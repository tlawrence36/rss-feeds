      "Hart died at his home in Los Angeles, according to his friend and co-author, Glenn Ballantyne. He had been in poor health since breaking his hip last year.",
      "Boyce and Hart were a prolific and successful team in the mid-1960s, especially for the Monkees, the made-for-television group promoted by Don Kirshner. They wrote the Monkees' theme song, with its opening shot, \"Here we come, walkin' down the street,\" and enduring chant, \"Hey, hey, we're the Monkees,\" and their first No. 1 hit, \u201cLast Train to Clarksville.\u201d The Monkees' eponymous, million-selling debut album included six songs from Boyce and Hart, who also served as producers and used their own backing musicians, the Candy Store Prophets, as session players.",

      "As Boyce and Hart grew in fame and the Monkees took more control of their work, they pursued their own careers, releasing the albums \"Test Patterns\" and \"I Wonder What She's Doing Tonite\" and appearing on such sitcoms as \"I Dream of Jeannie\" and \"Bewitched.\" They also were politically active. They campaigned for Robert F. Kennedy when he ran for president in 1968 and wrote the brassy \"L.U.V. (Let Us Vote)\" in support of the 26th Amendment, which in 1971 lowered the voting age from 21 to 18. Their other songs included the Monkees' melancholy \"I Wanna Be Free\" and the theme to the daytime soap opera \"Days of Our Lives.\"",

He worked with Austin Roberts on \"Over You,\" an Oscar-nominated ballad performed by Betty Buckley in \"Tender Mercies,\" and with Dick Eastman on \"My Secret (Didja Gitit Yet?)\" for New Edition. He and Bryce toured with Dolenz and fellow Monkee Davy Jones in the '70s, put out the album \"Dolenz, Jones, Boyce & Hart\" and received renewed attention when the Monkees enjoyed a comeback in the 1980s.",

      "He was a minister's son, born Robert Luke Harshman in Phoenix, Arizona. In his memoir, he remembered himself as a shy kid with a \"strong desire to distinguish\" himself, as he wrote in \"Psychedelic Bubblegum.\" Music was the answer. By high school, he had learned piano, guitar and the Hammond B-3 organ. He also started his own amateur radio station, eventually adding a console, turntables and microphones. After graduating from high school and serving in the Army reserves, he settled in Los Angeles in the late 1950s, hoping first to become a disc jockey, but soon working as a songwriter and session musician. His name shortened to Bobby Hart, he toured as a member of Teddy Randazzo and the Dazzlers, and with Randazzo and Bobby Weinstein wrote \"Hurt So Bad,\" a hit for Little Anthony and the Imperials later covered by Linda Ronstadt.",
      "He also befriended Boyce, a singer and songwriter from Charlottesville, Virginia, with a \"very unusual personality, spontaneous and extroverted, yet very cool at the same time.\" Boyce and Hart helped write the top 10 hit \"Come a Little Bit Closer\" for Jay and the Americans and were a strong enough combination that Kirshner recruited them for his Screen Gems songwriting factory: They were assigned to the Monkees. Asked to come up with songs for a quartet openly modeled on the Beatles, they devised a twangy guitar line similar to the one for \"Paperback Writer\" and wrote \"Last Train to Clarksville,\" a chart topper in 1966. When Kirshner suggested a song with a girl's name in the title, they turned out \"Valleri\" and reached the top 5.",
      "For the show's theme song, a stroll outside was enough.",
      "\"Boyce began strumming his guitar and I joined in by snapping my fingers & making noises with my mouth that simulated an open & closed hi-hat cymbal,\" Hart wrote in his memoir. \"We had created the perfect recipe for inspiration and started singing about just what we were doing: 'Walkin' down the street.'\"",

      "Designer Christian Siriano transformed a Macy's department store into a New York Fashion Week runway show for his latest collection",
      "NEW YORK -- Hidden behind cream curtains, designer Christian Siriano transformed the athleisure aisles of the Herald Square Macy\u2019s department store into a cinematic universe as he ushered his New York Fashion Week runway show attendees on a journey through film from black-and-white gowns to full Technicolor looks.",
      "Much like his inspiration for his runway show, the VIP guestlist was straight out of Hollywood. Whoopi Goldberg sat between Oprah and singer Lizzo. Front row celebrities cheered as longtime Siriano muse Coco Rocha opened the catwalk in her classic high powered supermodel strut, wearing a black-and-white stripe and polka dot organza blazer paired with a mini skirt and matching hat.",
      "For his spring 2026 collection, Siriano said he drew inspiration from actor Marlene Dietrich and how she played with both feminine and masculine styles.",
      "\u201cA lot of the collection is black-and-white, but a lot of texture,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have this beautiful plaid sequin, polka dot, stripes ... that she\u2019s worn in her kind of repertoire of clothes and then we end in this idea of like, what if all of a sudden the film turned to color?\u201d",
      "Sticking with the old Hollywood glamour theme, models wore their hair in slick backed buns with one pin curl wave. In a modern twist, some models wore their structured blazers with only tights.",
      "From tailored blazers to voluminous bubble dresses, Siriano played with patterns and structure throughout his collection.",
      "Siriano relied on his color palette to transport attendees to the silver screen with black-and-white patterns from polka dots, stripes and plaid at the top of his show before transitioning his looks to Technicolor fabrics including a tiffany blue ball gown and a barbie pink deconstructed tuxedo dress.",
      "The show was a first for \u201cWhite Lotus\u201d star Natasha Rothwell. \u201cI want to spend an insane amount of money,\u201d she said after the show. \u201cFor my first fashion show, it was everything.\u201d",
      "Attendees came dressed ready for the drama in their tulle and corsets. Singer Adam Lambert arrived in a bronze belted blazer coat with matching oversized bronze sunglass shades.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s just important to have a mix of beautiful people, he said.",
      "Siriano accessorized his designs with an array of flat top and oversized whimsical hats. The designer himself has worn his fair share of hats.",
      "Siriano, who won the design competition \u201cProject Runway\u201d in 2007, recently returned to offer his expertise as a mentor to emerging designers on the newest iteration of the show, which features image architect Law Roach and supermodel Heidi Klum.",
      "Siriano is also serving as creative director for Macy's ready-to-wear I.N.C. brand as it marks 40 years. Siriano said by bringing fashion week to Macy's he hoped to bring customers back to retail shopping.",
      "Minutes before the start of the runway show, Siriano's backstage crew were sewing and touching up the final look of the night worn by Rocha, whose showstopping moments have become a signature element of Siriano's shows. In a black-and-white polka dot billowing gown, Rocha elegantly posed as she sauntered in the off-the-shoulder tulle look to close the catwalk",
      "\u201cI love my shows to be a little bit more like a performance too,\u201d Siriano said. \u201cI want people to feel like when they walk in the room, they\u2019re in a different world. We work so hard on making all these beautiful things, and I think it\u2019s escapism. We need that so much right now.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- Ellie Potts goes dancing with her friends most weeks. They don\u2019t put on the latest Taylor Swift or Ed Sheeran, though \u2014 they much prefer English country dances that were popular more than 200 years ago.",
      "As the music starts, about two dozen men and women curtsy and bow, extend a gloved hand to their partner, before dancing in circles or skipping in elaborate patterns around each other.",
      "Like many of her fellow Hampshire Regency Dancers, Potts is a devotee of Jane Austen and all things from the Regency period. Not only have they studied the books and watched all the screen adaptations \u2014 they also research the music, make their own period dresses, and immerse themselves in dances Austen and her characters would have enjoyed in centuries past.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been interested in Jane Austen since I was about 8 or 9,\u201d said Potts, 25. \u201cI mainly joined (the dance group) so I can have balls and things to go to in my costumes, but I really got into it. I\u2019ve been surprised how much I enjoy the dancing.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s no shortage of grand costumed balls and historical dancing this year, which marks the 250th anniversary of Austen\u2019s birth. This weekend, thousands of fans who call themselves \u201cJaneites\u201d are descending on the city of Bath for a 10-day festival celebrating the beloved author of \u201cPride and Prejudice\u201d and \u201cSense and Sensibility.\u201d",
      "The highlight is a Regency costumed promenade on Saturday, where some 2,000 people in their finest bonnets, bows and costumes will parade through the streets of Bath. Organizers say the extravaganza holds the Guinness World Record for the \u201clargest gathering of people dressed in Regency costumes.\u201d",
      "Bonny Wise, from Indiana, is attending her sixth Jane Austen festival in Bath. This time she\u2019s bringing four period dresses she made, and will lead a tour group of 25 Austen enthusiasts from all over the United States.",
      "\u201cI started planning a tour four years ago, when I realized this was a big year for Jane,\u201d said Wise, 69. She credited the 1995 adaptation of \u201cSense and Sensibility\u201d with sparking her obsession.",
      "\u201cThat movie just opened up a whole new world for me,\u201d she said. \u201cYou start with the books, the movies, then you start getting into the hats, the tea, the manners \u2026 one thing just led to another.\u201d",
      "Wise said she loves the wit, humor and social observations in Austen\u2019s books. She also finds the author\u2019s own life story inspiring.",

      "Ed Sheeran has long sought to bring people together with his music, whether it be his emotionally resonant acoustic ballads or unproblematic, danceable pop hits",
      "NEW YORK -- Ed Sheeran has long sought to bring people together with his music, whether it be his emotionally resonant acoustic ballads or unproblematic, danceable pop hits. \u201cPlay,\u201d his eighth studio album out Friday, stays in that familiar lane for the most part.",
      "In his quest, Sheeran has maintained an everyman quality by carefully evolving with the status quo (while, largely, removing himself from public discourse, save his copyright court win and more recent promotional pop-ups in everyman places, like a New York City ice cream shop just this week). The aesthetic of Ed Sheeran, global star, still matches that of Ed Sheeran, up-and-coming troubadour. Most of the time, it's still just Sheeran, his guitar and his loop pedal against the world.",
      "Of course, Sheeran, like most pop stars, knows that as his stardom has risen and his audience widened, the meaning of that relatability has shifted. His listeners, over a decade in, know that too. So \u201cPlay,\u201d the first project in a new series from Sheeran named for symbols (he's said \u201cRewind\u201d will be next), uses Sheeran's global acclaim to his advantage \u2014 without straying too far from his singer-songwriter roots.",
      "Recorded throughout his \u201cMathematics World Tour\u201d and finished in Goa, India, the project feels split. There are moments that herald the return of Sheeran the hitmaker, an exciting development after his last two albums \u2014 the final chapter of his mathematics series, \u201cSubtract,\u201d and the folk-pop \u201cAutumn Variations\u201d \u2014 were well received but failed to produce the kind of chart-toppers that created Sheeran, the megastar. Most tracks, however, fall more in line with those albums, deviating little from the narrative songwriting toolkit that raised Sheeran, the artist.",
      "Sheeran turned to new collaborators for a couple songs that are already established hits. The addictive \u201cSapphire\u201d features Indian singer Arijit Singh, who ranks among Spotify's most popular artists globally. A Farsi version of the single \u201cAzizam,\u201d written and produced with Ilya Salmanzadeh, Savan Kotecha and Johnny McDaid, was released in April featuring Iranian singer Googoosh. Sheeran isn't just eyeing the U.S. and U.K. charts here \u2014 he's playing for cross-cultural domination, and having fun while doing it.",
      "The rest of the tracks, those that feel more classically Sheeran, see old themes recycled: \u201cOld Phone\u201d provides him the space to remember old friends and reminisce about his changing personal life, just as the landscape in 2017's \u201cCastle on the Hill\u201d provided a tangible marker of memory. The conceit of the sappily sweet \u201cCamera\u201d \u2014 \u201cI don't need a camera to capture this moment\u201d \u2014 comes in conflict with that of Sheeran's own beloved \u201cPhotograph\u201d from 2014's \u201cMultiply.\u201d",
      "There are still moments that feel like they'll stick: Sheeran's ode to his daughters, \u201cFor Always,\u201d with cooing backing vocals from co-writer Amy Allen, is sure to be a favorite father-daughter dance track, right behind the groovy \u201cThe Vow\u201d on wedding playlists.",
      "Sheeran flexes his pen on \u201cOpening,\u201d the album's first track. Bounded by glittery verses about boundaries, he raps about his family, his mental health, that court case, fame and what comes next. \u201cBeen a long time up top but I ain\u2019t complacent/If I look down I can see replacements,\u201d he raps at one point. \u201cGotta make dreams and chase them.\u201d",
      "Sheeran wants to be for everyone. And to do that, he'll still be an everyman.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Why would anyone keep a prop from the set of \u201cJaws?\u201d",
      "Steven Spielberg was musing about what it felt like while making his 1975 oceanic classic, and how little he thought any of it would matter when shooting the now-legendary opening scene of a woman night-swimming past an ocean buoy. His primary concern was keeping his job as a 26-year-old director amid unfolding disasters.",
      "\u201cHow did anybody know to take the buoy and take it home and sit on it for 50 years?\u201d he said.",
      "That prop is among the first things visitors will see as they enter a 50th anniversary \u201cJaws\u201d exhibit opening Sunday and running through July at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures.",
      "The exhibition featuring more than 200 pieces from the culture-changing blockbuster is the first full show in the four-year history of the museum that is dedicated to a single film. It comes amid a bevy of celebrations of the film's five-decade life, including a theatrical re-release last week.",
      "Spielberg spoke to a gathering of media at the museum after touring the exhibit, which takes visitors chronologically through the film's three acts, with some relic or recreation from virtually every scene.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just so proud of the work they\u2019ve done,\u201d the 78-year-old said. \u201cWhat they\u2019ve put together here at this exhibition is just awesome. Every room has the minutiae of how this picture got together.\u201d",
      "\u201cClearly this is a very historic initiative for us,\u201d museum director Amy Homma said before introducing the director and also announced the museum plans a full Spielberg retrospective in 2028.",
      "\u201cJaws\u201d has been essential to the Academy Museum, which opened in 2021 and is operated by the organization that gives out the Oscars.",
      "The only surviving full-scale mechanical shark from the production, 25 feet in length and nicknamed \u201cBruce\u201d by Spielberg after his lawyer, has permanently hung over the escalators since it opened.",
      "Homma said Bruce has become an \u201cunofficial mascot\u201d that \u201chelped to define this museum.\u201d",
      "The media preview was accompanied by a 68-piece orchestra playing John Williams\u2019 score. Two of the musicians played on the original.",
      "The exhibit includes a keyboard with instructions on how to play Williams' famously ominous two-note refrain that a generation of children learned to tap out on the piano.",
      "Similar novelties include a dolly-zoom setup to which visitors can attach their phone and shoot their own face to recreate perhaps the film\u2019s most famous shot, the zoom-in to star Roy Scheider\u2019s frightened gaze on the beach in the fictional town of Amity.",

      "A new Whitney Houston song has arrived 13 years after her death",
      "NEW YORK -- It sounds impossible, but that's the magic of it. On Thursday, a new Whitney Houston song arrives 13 years after her death.",
      "English singer Calum Scott is responsible. The single is a duet between Scott and Houston, a balladic reinterpretation of the timeless \u201cI Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me),\u201d using Houston's original vocal stems. (Stems are the individual musical elements that, when combined, make up a song.)",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t even something I could have dreamt as a possibility, and the fact that I'm getting to do it is, geez, one of the honors of my career,\u201d Scott told The Associated Press. Houston's voice is one that soundtracked his childhood \u2014 courtesy his mom \u2014 and he refers to Houston as one of the most influential performers in his life and the lives of many.",
      "\u201cTimeless,\u201d he describes her.",
      "Here's how the new song came into existence.",
      "Such an undertaking couldn't be possible without the approval of a number of parties. Specifically, it required Pat Houston, Whitney\u2019s sister-in-law and the executor of her estate, and Primary Wave, which acquired the copyrights to hit Whitney Houston songs as part of a 2022 deal.",
      "Pat Houston says the idea for Scott's \u201cI Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\u201d actually came from Primary Wave. They were familiar with Scott's live cover version of the song from his stint opening for Ed Sheeran in 2024. On that tour, Scott stripped the 1987 classic down into a ballad, blending it with Robyn's \u201cDancing On My Own.\u201d",
      "After hearing what Scott could do with the song \u2014 taking it from its up-tempo pop spirit to a big-hearted ballad, while also taking into consideration that 2025 marks the 40th anniversary of Houston's music career \u2014 Pat Houston was on board. It was yet another opportunity for celebration. \u201cI said, you know what, this is a no-brainer. This is the Houston style. So, let\u2019s go with this,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cWhitney was a balladeer and that\u2019s why we all fell in love with her,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd Calum turned the song into a beautiful ballad.\u201d",
      "First, the Houston estate and Primary Wave provided Scott with the original vocal stems, produced by her longtime producer Narada Michael Walden. Then Scott recorded the song with producers Jon \u201cMAGS\u201d Maguire, Andrew Yeates and Charlie T in the U.K. in \u201cabout a week,\u201d he recalls. They were joined by a string section, which gave additional dimension to their somber take on the song.",
      "\u201cTake a pop song and make it sad,\u201d Scott jokes of his approach.",
      "Recording the ballad made sense because, as Scott points out, the lyrics to the original song are a bit melancholic. \u201cYou want to dance with somebody who loved you, you know, you're not actually dancing with them,\u201d he says. It's about yearning. But in an early demo, the chorus was recorded in a minor chord \u2014 which sounded a bit too depressing. The change was made swiftly; even slowed, the song needed some of that Houston ebullience.",

      "Another early decision: The new song would start with just Houston's voice, alone, in the first verse. \u201cWhitney starts the song because this is her song,\u201d Scott says simply. \u201cI would never dare stand in front of Whitney for that first verse.\u201d",
      "Eagle-eyed (eared?) fans might notice the sound of a snare drum bleeding into her vocal on that verse \u2014 because it was originally recorded to tape, not digitally, and because \u201cwe can\u2019t change anything like that because those are etched into the song and into her vocal,\u201d says Scott. \u201cAnd to remove it would be taking a piece away.\u201d",
      "It's one of the reasons they kept the song's iconic key change in the last chorus as well.",
      "\u201cI really had to dig for those high notes,\u201d he says of the recording. \u201cIt was an honor just to harmonize with her.\u201d",
      "Scott looked to the original songwriters for approval \u2014 the dream team of George Merrill and Shannon Rubicam. They were immediately on board.",
      "\u201cSome people would have come in and they would have added something ... to boost their visibility next to Whitney. And he had the boldness to tear it all down and just have acoustic piano, just Whitney, and then give her the first verse,\u201d said Merrill. \u201cAnd I mean, this is his project. To me, that\u2019s showing such respect.\u201d",
      "That, and they recognize Scott as a virtuosic vocalist. \u201cHis music really features his voice, as with Adele or Whitney, and rightly so because he can carry it off,\u201d said Rubicam. \u201cThere aren\u2019t just hundreds of people who can carry that off with his kind of power.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re a good vocal match together,\u201d she adds. \u201cThey both got a lot of emotionality and command also of their vocal instrument. ... Whitney could overpower a lot of people. But for Calum, he\u2019s confident and he had a vision about it and they both are meeting at an emotional level.\u201d",
      "\u201cI felt like I gently walked alongside Whitney,\u201d says Scott. The song is meant to feel alive, channeling the spirit of Houston \u2014 not a tribute, but an active single. It's why their version of \u201cI Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\u201d will be featured on his new album \u201cAvenoir,\u201d out Oct. 10.",
      "\u201cThis is as much part of my story as any other song on the album,\u201d he says. \u201cJust being given the honor of it has been, you know, I could die a very happy man now.\u201d",
      "\u201cForty years ago, this particular song was hot then and it\u2019s hot now,\u201d says Pat Houston. \u201cSo why not keep producing. But it\u2019s the right connection, it's the right platform and it certainly is the right artist to collab with her on this.\u201d",

      "\"Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale\" brings change to the Crawley family as they face the 1930s",
      "Change comes slowly to the Downton Abbey universe and its Crawley family. Just watch Robert Crawley go flat-hunting in London.",
      "Wait, what? FLAT-HUNTING? The Earl of Grantham? Well, yes, and it\u2019s the most amusing scene in \u201cDownton Abbey: The Grand Finale\u201d (a self-announcing title if there ever was one).",
      "Just look at proud and starched Robert (Hugh Bonneville), trying to be open-minded but utterly flummoxed by this \u201cflat\u201d in which you cannot go \u201cup\u201d to bed because there is no \u201cup.\u201d Well, you can go \u201calong\u201d to bed, suggests daughter Mary (Michelle Dockery, as always the sensible center of things) trying to make it all sound manageable.",
      "But the prospect of flat-living \u2014 rather than maintaining a mansion in London \u2014 is a thing the Crawleys must consider as they move into the 1930s, with financial and social instability always around the corner. \u201cFamilies like us need to keep moving to survive,\u201d says Mary, with the weight of Downton Abbey\u2019s future itself resting on her shoulders.",
      "A note to those coming in cold to the franchise here: Well, it\u2019s going to be quite hard. Writer Julian Fellowes and director Simon Curtis do not engage in hand-holding when it comes to mastering the Crawley family tree or the broader family of servants that Downton fans know and love. Even those who saw the first two films \u2013 the last in 2022 \u2013 might feel the need for a refresher.",
      "We begin in London\u2019s West End, at a show by Noel Coward, attended by Downton inhabitants from all levels. They\u2019re all there to watch dashing actor Guy Dexter (Dominic West), who in the last movie asked former butler Thomas Barrow to become his dresser, and more. It\u2019s nice to see Barrow is happy now, able to live life as a gay man \u2014 even if Robert can\u2019t quite grasp their relationship (change is slow, remember).",
      "Meanwhile Mary is shopping in London with sister Edith, and the importance of this scene is perhaps to remind us that the real star of the \u201cDownton\u201d universe, after that stupendous house of course, are the costumes. Mary finds a sleek red satin gown that is quite possibly the most smashing outfit we\u2019ve seen yet.",
      "But when she puts it on for a society ball, trouble erupts. As the family arrives we learn that Mary\u2019s divorce decree has come through \u2014 and this means, alas, that she will become a pariah. The newspaper screams news of \u201cdivorce in high places,\u201d and indeed, the ball\u2019s hostess actually kicks Mary out of the party because royalty is coming. Mary\u2019s concerned parents are outraged \u2014 but they stay, and their daughter heads out, quipping that she hopes a taxi will agree to take her.",
      "Soon enough we\u2019re back at Downton, and there is one very big difference: no longer does Violet Crawley, aka Maggie Smith, with her inimitable style and those hilarious quips, rule the halls. She died in the last film \u2014 and Smith died in 2024. But the film is dedicated to her in more ways than one.",

      "Harold arrives from America with some unfortunate news \u2013 he\u2019s wasted away much of their family fortune.

The playwright is the closest thing in Downton world to a modern celebrity \u2014 everyone wants to be with him, no matter station nor gender, and he winds up helping Mary overcome her social shunning.",
      "Nowhere to be seen is dashing Hugh Dancy, who played a film director (besotted with Mary) in the last movie. But the character that director anointed as a screenwriter, Joseph Moseley (Kevin Doyle), is back, and Fellowes must have enjoyed writing this line for him: \u201cIn many ways the writers are the stars of cinema.\u201d",

      "\u201cSometimes I feel that the past is a more comfortable place than the future,\u201d someone says in a poignant moment.

    "story": [
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer is willing to risk a government shutdown at the end of the month if Republicans don\u2019t accept Democratic demands on health care",
      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer weathered backlash from Democrats earlier this year when he voted with Republicans to keep the government open. But he\u2019s now willing to risk a shutdown at the end of the month if Republicans don\u2019t accede to Democratic demands.",
      "Schumer says he and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries are united in opposing any legislation that doesn\u2019t include key health care provisions and a commitment not to roll them back. He argues that the country is in a different place than it was in March, when he vigorously argued against a shutdown, and he says he believes Republicans and President Donald Trump will be held responsible if they don\u2019t negotiate a bipartisan deal.",
      "\u201cThings have changed\u201d since the March vote, Schumer said in an interview with The Associated Press on Thursday. He said Republicans have since passed Trump\u2019s massive tax breaks and spending cuts legislation, which trimmed Medicaid and other government programs, and Democrats are now unified \u2014 unlike in March, when he voted with Republicans and Jeffries voted against legislation to fund the government.",
      "A shutdown, Schumer said, wouldn\u2019t necessarily worsen an environment in which Trump is already challenging the authority of Congress. \u201cIt will get worse with or without it, because Trump is lawless,\u201d Schumer said.",
      "Schumer\u2019s threat comes as Republicans are considering a short-term stopgap spending measure to avoid a Sept. 30 shutdown and as Democrats face what most see as two tough choices if the parties can\u2019t negotiate a deal \u2014 vote with Republicans to keep the government open or let it close indefinitely with no clear exit plan.",
      "It also comes amid worsening partisan tensions in the Senate, where negotiations between the two parties over the confirmation process broke down for a second time Thursday and Republicans are changing Senate rules to get around Democratic objections. Democrats are also fuming over the Trump administration\u2019s decision to unilaterally claw back $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid just as negotiations over the spending deadline were getting underway in late August.",
      "Republicans have said that Democrats clearly will be to blame if they don\u2019t vote to keep the government open, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has repeatedly said that Schumer needs to come to them with a specific proposal on health care, including an extension of expanded government tax credits for many Americans who get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. Some Republicans are open to extending those credits before they expire at the end of the year.",

      "Schumer said Democrats also want Republicans to commit that the White House won\u2019t take back money they have negotiated and Congress has approved after Republicans pushed through a $9 billion cut requested by the White House in July and Trump blocked the additional foreign aid money in August. \u201cHow do you pass an appropriations bill and let them undo it down the road?\u201d Schumer said.",
      "Schumer\u2019s move to support the spending legislation in March put him in the rare position of bucking his party\u2019s base. He said then that of two bad options, a partial government shutdown was worse because it would give Trump even more control to shut down agencies and there would be \u201cno off-ramp\u201d to get out of it. \u201cI think people realize it\u2019s a tough choice,\u201d he said.",
      "He faced massive backlash from within the party after the vote, with some activists calling on him to resign. Jeffries temporarily distanced himself from his New York colleague, saying in a statement immediately after Schumer\u2019s vote that House Democrats \u201cwill not be complicit.\u201d The majority of Senate Democrats also voted against the plan.",
      "This time, though, Schumer is in lockstep with Jeffries and in messaging within his caucus. In Democrats\u2019 closed-door lunch Wednesday, he shared polling that he said suggested most Americans would blame Trump, not Democrats, for a shutdown.",
      "\u201cI did what I thought was right\u201d in March, Schumer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a different situation now than then.\u201d",

      "The Justice Department said the information was needed to investigate possible fraud or unlawful off-label promotion of drugs, but the information requested \u2014 including actual patient records \u2014 seemed to be unrelated, the judge said.

      "\u201cThe Administration has been explicit about its disapproval of the transgender community and its aim to end GAC,\u201d Joun wrote, referring to gender-affirming care. The judge later continued, \u201cIt is abundantly clear that the true purpose of issuing the subpoena is to interfere with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts' right to protect GAC within its borders, to harass and intimidate BCH to stop providing such care, and to dissuade patients from seeking such care.\u201d",
      "Just eight days after taking office, President Donald Trump issued an executive order aimed at restricting access to medical care for transgender youth. In June, the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division announced the division would use \u201call available resources to prioritize investigations of doctors, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, and other appropriate entities,\u201d in an effort to investigate what it called \u201cradical gender experimentation.\u201d",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi announced in a statement July 9 that the Justice Department had sent more than 20 subpoenas to doctors and clinics that provide care to transgender patients under 18. Bondi said the requests were part of investigations into \u201chealthcare fraud, false statements, and more.\u201d But the requests did not just seek information on policies or billing practices \u2014 they also demanded information about individual patients who had been prescribed puberty blockers or hormone therapy.",
      "Boston Children's Hospital asked the federal court to quash the subpoena on July 8, saying the Justice Department was seeking practically every document related to the provision of gender-affirming care over the past five and a half years, including highly sensitive and personally identifiable information about young patients.",

Belem, the city hosting the conference, is known as the gateway to the Amazon, and many who will be attending, from activists to delegates, think the role of Indigenous communities in climate action and conservation will be highlighted in a distinct way.",
      "\u201cThe \u2018forest man\u2019 or \u2018man forest,\u2019 according to the Indigenous perspective, has always been linked to the reciprocity between human health and the natural environment where one lives,\u201d said Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez Cayetano, president of the Federation of Ticuna and Yagua Communities of the Lower Amazon, or FECOTYBA, in the Peruvian Amazon. \u201cIf each state does not guarantee the rights and territories of Indigenous peoples, we would inevitably be harming their health, their lives, and the ecosystem itself.\u201d",
      "That harm can look like respiratory diseases such as asthma caused by toxic air pollution after fires, or illnesses that spread from animals to humans such as malaria, said Paula Prist, a senior program coordinator for the Forest and Grasslands Unit at the International Union for Conservation of Nature and one of the study authors.",
      "The researchers compiled and analyzed data on forest quality, legal recognition of Indigenous territory and disease incidence in the countries that border and include the Amazon.",
      "The work was \u201cimpressive\u201d to University of Washington health and climate scientist Kristie Ebi. She said it highlighted the complexity of factors that affect human health, and the importance of understanding the role Indigenous communities play in shaping it. \u201cUsing these methods, others could study other parts of the world,\u201d she said.",
      "The researchers found creative ways to account for other variables that can affect the spread of diseases, like access to health care in a given area, said Magdalena Hurtado, an anthropology and global health professor at Arizona State University and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences who was not involved with the study. But she expressed concern that the findings were presented with a precision that may not be warranted, given that they were based on correlation and use data on observations that can be difficult to measure.",
      "\u201cThey claim that Indigenous territories only protect health when forest cover is above 40%. And so that that feels like, why 40%? Why not 35? Or why not a range?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that the study is wrong, but it means that we need to be cautious because the patterns could change if different, more precise methods were used.\u201d",
      "Still, she thinks this is a starting point that could open the door to future research. \u201cThey are actually doing something quite beautiful,\u201d empirically connecting the legal recognition of Indigenous lands to human health outcomes, she said.",
      "Hern\u00e1ndez, of FECOTYBA, said that's important for the global policymakers who are coming to Brazil.",
      "\u201cFrom my Indigenous perspective, I think that this type of study would make our ancestral knowledge more visible and precise,\u201d he said.",

      "Five years ago, Chakwera's eventual victory came after months of street protests in his support. But things have changed after five hard years and this vote takes place amid economic turmoil and shaky trust in public institutions in the southern African nation of 21 million.",

      "According to Dulani, Mutharika\u2019s strong challenge to return to the presidency despite the flawed 2019 election was not a reflection of his popularity but rather disillusionment with Chakwera.",
      "The fraudulent 2019 vote prompted a change in Malawian electoral law, and this election will be decided by the 50%+1 format \u2014 meaning the winner needs to get more than 50% of the vote.",
      "Analysts see a strong likelihood that no one will get a majority in the first round of voting, forcing a runoff, likely between Chakwera and Mutharika.",

      "Pope Leo XIV has honored hundreds of Christians who have been killed for their faith in the 21st century",
      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Pope Leo XIV on Sunday honored hundreds of Christians who have been killed for their faith in the 21st century, praising their courage and lamenting that their numbers were growing in many parts of the world.",
      "The Vatican has been documenting these Christian martyrs, not as part of its saint-making process but to merely collect and remember their stories. Their numbers include cases of Christians being killed by Islamic militants, mafia groups or Amazonian ranchers upset at their defense of the rainforest and poor.",
      "Leo presided over a Holy Year evening prayer service to honor them, inviting Orthodox patriarchs and Christian ministers from over 30 Christian denominations. It was part of the Vatican\u2019s ongoing effort to underline what it calls the indiscriminate \u201cecumenism of blood\u201d that unites Christians who are persecuted and killed for their faith, regardless of their particular denomination.",
      "\u201cMany brothers and sisters, even today, carry the same cross as our Lord on account of their witness to the faith in difficult situations and hostile contexts,\u201d Leo said. \u201cLike him, they are persecuted, condemned and killed.\u201d",
      "The service, at the basilica of St. Paul Outside the Walls, came 25 years after St. John Paul II presided over a 2000 Jubilee commemoration of new martyrs held at the Colosseum.",
      "Leo cited a few examples of martyrdom since then, including Sister Dorothy Stang, an American nun who spent three decades trying to preserve the Amazon rainforest and defend the rights of poor settlers who confronted powerful ranchers seeking their lands. She was gunned down in 2005 in a hit ordered by ranchers.",
      "\u201cWhen those who were about to kill her asked her for a weapon, she showed them her Bible and replied, \u2018This is my only weapon,\u2019\u201d Leo said.",
      "Leo lamented that despite the end of the \u201cgreat dictatorships of the 1900s,\u201d when Christians were persecuted in parts of Europe, Christians were still being killed and in some places, in even greater numbers than before.",
      "A Vatican study commission created in 2023 has documented more than 1,500 cases of martyrs since 2000, including the 21 Coptic Orthodox workers beheaded by Islamic militants in Libya in 2015. The commission has also documented stories of Christians killed by criminal organizations or imply because their presence and defense of Christian principles was bothersome, said Andrea Riccardi, vice president of the commission.",

      "Supreme Court justice Alexandre de Moraes has become a hero for many Brazilians and a zealot for others",
      "BRASILIA, Brazil -- Some Brazilian historians now count 14 coup attempts in the republic\u2019s 136 years. Some have been successful, including the one that installed a military dictatorship between 1964-1985.",
      "But only the latest, which a Supreme Court panel ruled was orchestrated by former President Jair Bolsonaro, ended with prison sentences for its leaders, instigators and supporters, many of whom are already behind bars.",
      "To a large extent, the unprecedented outcome is the result of one man\u2019s drive.",
      "Supreme Court justice Alexandre de Moraes, the judge who spearheaded the case, has become a hero to some Brazilians and a zealot to others.",
      "In Brazil he is better known as \u201cXand\u00e3o,\u201d or \u201cBig Alex\u201d in Portuguese. Married with three children, he is widely known for his shiny bald head and use of soccer metaphors, but also for what many see as swift and divisive actions.",
      "De Moraes, 56, has taken on politicians, billionaire Elon Musk and Bolsonaro supporters who damaged government buildings in Brasilia, the capital, during a 2023 riot that prosecutors said was instigated by the former president.",
      "From now on, Brazilian history books will call him the Supreme Court judge who led a five-member panel to sentence Bolsonaro to 27 years and three months in prison.",
      "He led the trial despite pressure from the U.S. government that sanctioned de Moraes and imposed tariffs on Brazil because of the process against Bolsonaro, an ally of U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Only one of the justices, Luiz Fux, disagreed and asked for Bolsonaro to be acquitted. But de Moraes\u2019 sway in the case is such that the longest serving member of the court, Justice Gilmar Mendes, and Chief Justice Luis Roberto Barroso popped by the panel\u2019s room at end of the trial solely to defend his work.",
      "The panel also ruled against seven close allies of the former president, including top military men.",
      "\u201cI may have disagreements in some issues with Justice de Moraes,\" said Jos\u00e9 Eduardo Cardozo, a former justice minister who first met de Moraes about 30 years ago. \"But in general his standing is rigorously righteous for those who understand constitutional law and defend the rule of law vehemently.\u201d",
      "For Cardozo, the criticism of how he handled Bolsonaro's trial is \u201cpurely political.\u201d",
      "Celso Vilardi, a lawyer for Bolsonaro, took swipes at de Moraes after Fux voted almost entirely in disagreement in the case.",
      "\u201cI am vindicated,\u201d Vilardi told journalists Wednesday. \u201cThis was a technical vote.\u201d",
      "But before he became Bolsonaro\u2019s lawyer in January, Vilardi had nothing but praise for de Moraes.",
      "Before the Bolsonaro case began, de Moraes\u2019 public image was one of a backward, conservative judge.",
      "He frequently was mocked on social media for two videos. One shows him destroying a small marijuana plantation with his bare hands. The other exposes his discomfort among Indigenous Brazilians, who danced as they repeated his name.",
      "Now social media is filled with images of de Moraes. Right-wing content shows the judge asking people for their private information if they don\u2019t want to be jailed, while left-wing voters portray him as Superman, an unstoppable hero rising to the task. Some memes mock his seemingly more aggressive decisions when his soccer club Corinthians loses.",
      "Friends, adversaries and colleagues have said over the years that de Moraes does not waiver when on duty.",
      "\u201cHistory teaches us that impunity, omission and cowardice are not options for pacification, because the apparently easier path, and only apparently, is that of impunity, omission, leaving traumatic scars in our society and corrodes our democracy,\u201d de Moraes said during the first week of Bolsonaro's trial.",
      "A university professor and former public prosecutor, he was appointed to the country\u2019s top court in 2017 by President Michel Temer, a conservative, after a stint as his justice minister.

      "The disagreement involved a monthslong dispute with Musk over free speech, far-right accounts and misinformation. In the end, the tech billionaire complied with all of de Moraes\u2019 demands, including blocking certain accounts from the platform, paying outstanding fines and naming a legal representative in Brazil, and the justice restored the social media\u2019s service.",
      "Recently, Trump's administration imposed a 50% tariff hike on Brazilian exports with vocal support from Bolsonaro\u2019s sons. The U.S. also sanctioned de Moraes over alleged suppression of freedom of expression and overseeing the Bolsonaro trial.",
      "De Moraes previously identified with center-right administrations and politicians. Between 2015 and 2016, he was Sao Paulo state\u2019s public security secretary in a conservative setting.",
      "Some of that experience became obvious during his term as president of Brazil\u2019s top electoral court, overseeing the 2022 election.",
      "His efforts to fight disinformation and protect the integrity of the electoral process were praised by moderates, international institutions and supporters of President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva as key to the results being respected.",
      "The electoral court role was added to one he received at the start of the Bolsonaro administration as rapporteur of a \u201cfake news\u201d probe focused on online attacks against members of the Supreme Court. De Moraes was handpicked based on his security experience in Sao Paulo.",
      "The two investigations resulted in arrests of political figures, blocks on social media accounts and lawsuits against business leaders, but in some ways also converged in the coup plot.",
      "As the verdict and sentencing phase of Bolsonaro's trial ended Thursday, de Moraes made an effort to reign in his emotions as his peer Fl\u00e1vio Dino took almost five minutes to praise his work.",
      "\u201cJustice Alexandre sees this as finishing line,\" Dino said. \u201cBut there will be other trials, other tasks. This is a high point in his career, and we have to pay a tribute to him. That\u2019s not very common in our community.\u201d",

      "Some small-scale farmers in the southern African country of Malawi are using an AI chatbot for advice to help them improve their methods and become more resilient to climate change",
      "MULANJE, Malawi -- Alex Maere survived the destruction of Cyclone Freddy when it tore through southern Malawi in 2023. His farm didn't.",
      "The 59-year-old saw decades of work disappear with the precious soil that the floods stripped from his small-scale farm in the foothills of Mount Mulanje.",
      "He was used to producing a healthy 850 kilograms (1,870 pounds) of corn each season to support his three daughters and two sons. He salvaged just 8 kilograms (17 pounds) from the wreckage of Freddy.",
      "\u201cThis is not a joke,\u201d he said, remembering how his farm in the village of Sazola became a wasteland of sand and rocks.",
      "Freddy jolted Maere into action. He decided he needed to change his age-old tactics if he was to survive.",
      "He is now one of thousands of small-scale farmers in the southern African country using a generative AI chatbot designed by the non-profit Opportunity International for farming advice.",
      "The Malawi government is backing the project, having seen the agriculture-dependent nation hit recently by a series of cyclones and an El Ni\u00f1o-induced drought. Malawi\u2019s food crisis, which is largely down to the struggles of small-scale farmers, is a central issue for its national elections next week.",
      "More than 80% of Malawi's population of 21 million rely on agriculture for their livelihoods and the country has one of the highest poverty rates in the world, according to the World Bank.",
      "The AI chatbot suggested Maere grow potatoes last year alongside his staple corn and cassava to adjust to his changed soil. He followed the instructions to the letter, he said, and cultivated half a soccer field's worth of potatoes and made more than $800 in sales, turning around his and his children's fortunes.",
      "\u201cI managed to pay for their school fees without worries,\u201d he beamed.",
      "Artificial intelligence has the potential to uplift agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa, where an estimated 33-50 million smallholder farms like Maere's produce up to 70-80% of the food supply, according to the U.N.'s International Fund for Agricultural Development. Yet productivity in Africa \u2014 with the world's fast-growing population to feed \u2014 is lagging behind despite vast tracts of arable land.",
      "As AI's use surges across the globe, so it is helping African farmers access new information to identify crop diseases, forecast drought, design fertilizers to boost yields, and even locate an affordable tractor. Private investment in agriculture-related tech in sub-Saharan Africa went from $10 million in 2014 to $600 million in 2022, according to the World Bank.",
      "But not without challenges.",
      "Africa has hundreds of languages for AI tools to learn. Even then, few farmers have smartphones and many can't read. Electricity and internet service are patchy at best in rural areas, and often non-existent.",
      "\u201cOne of the biggest challenges to sustainable AI use in African agriculture is accessibility,\u201d said Daniel Mvalo, a Malawian technology specialist. \u201cMany tools fail to account for language diversity, low literacy and poor digital infrastructure.\u201d",
      "The AI tool in Malawi tries to do that. The app is called Ulangizi, which means advisor in the country's Chichewa language. It is WhatsApp-based and works in Chichewa and English. You can type or speak your question, and it replies with an audio or text response, said Richard Chongo, Opportunity International's country director for Malawi.",

      "But to work in Malawi, AI still needs a human touch. For Maere's area, that is the job of 33-year-old Patrick Napanja, a farmer support agent who brings a smartphone with the app for those who have no devices. Chongo calls him the \u201chuman in the loop.\"",
      "\u201cI used to struggle to provide answers to some farming challenges, now I use the app,\" said Napanja.",
      "Farmer support agents like Napanja generally have around 150-200 farmers to help and try to visit them in village groups once a week. But sometimes, most of an hour-long meeting is taken up waiting for responses to load because of the area's poor connectivity, he said.

      "But he said Malawi faces challenges in getting the tool to enough communities to make an extensive difference. Those communities don't just need smartphones, but also to be able to afford internet access.",
      "For Malawi, the potential may be in combining AI with traditional collaboration among communities.",
      "\u201cFarmers who have access to the app are helping fellow farmers,\u201d Jassi said, and that is improving productivity.",

      "Nepal's military faces its biggest challenge yet after it stepped in to restore order following days of deadly violence in Kathmandu",
      "KATHMANDU, Nepal -- Two days of deadly violence left the streets of Kathmandu resembling a war zone. Nepal\u2019s major symbols of power like Parliament, the Supreme Court, and the president\u2019s house were burned by angry protesters. The prime minister was forced to quit, and no one seemed to be in control.",
      "Until Nepal\u2019s military chief, Gen. Ashok Raj Sigdel, appeared in a prerecorded video on Tuesday evening and appealed for calm.",
      "Within hours, the Nepal army was patrolling the streets. Its officers began holding talks with the young protesters who had toppled the prime minister in a major public revolt. And a rapidly escalating spiral of violence began to come under control.",
      "Five days after the violence began, Nepalis are still wondering who is in charge of the country where 34 people were killed in protests sparked by a short-lived social media ban and fueled by broader discontent against the government. But with the army stepping up, many people are breathing a sigh of relief, in contrast to some other countries where citizens are usually fearful of the military taking over the civilian government in moments of crisis.",
      "\u201cIt was a very abnormal situation in Nepal which the army was successful in bringing back to control to further prevent loss of lives and property. They were able to take control in an emergency situation and turn the abnormal situation to normal,\u201d said Geja Sharma Wagle, a Kathmandu-based security and strategic affairs analyst.",
      "The military in Nepal, which has also fought a bloody Maoist rebellion, is rarely mobilized in the Himalayan nation wedged between China and India. It is also not known for battling enemy troops at the border and has mostly been confined to barracks. It is normally sought out only when there are floods, landslides or rescues during earthquakes.",
      "Yet it is hugely popular. In the past, it has restored order in difficult times, particularly during the massive pro-democracy protests in the 1990 and the antimonarchy 2006 demonstrations that ended with the abolition of the monarchy.",
      "Nepal\u2019s troops have also been part of United Nations peacekeeping forces for the past six decades, serving in conflict areas in Africa, Middle East and Asia. Nepal currently is the biggest contributor of troops to the U. N . peacekeeping missions.",
      "Since 2008, when Nepal became a republic, the army has tried to stay away from politics. Occasionally it gets dragged in when political leaders decide who will lead the armed forces.",
      "This week\u2019s deadly protests, however, could very well be the greatest challenge it has faced so far.",
      "So far, the military has been successful in bringing calm, quelling a jailbreak in the heart of the capital, Kathmandu, and initiating talks with the protesters on naming a transitional leader. On Friday, Nepal\u2019s president, army officials and representatives from various protesting groups held meetings to decide on a name.",

      "After the protests began in Nepal, President Ram Chandra Poudel, whose role is largely ceremonial, had asked Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli to lead a caretaker government. But Oli fled from his official residence on Tuesday, and his whereabouts were not clear.",

      "The French are getting to know their new Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, who has a unique greeting style",
      "PARIS -- As they get to know their new Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, a loyal ally of President Emmanuel Macron who had been remarkably low-key before taking one of the top jobs in the land, the French are also discovering that he has a somewhat unusual habit: He likes to butt heads.",
      "Instead of the greeting that many French use to say hello \u2014 two, and in some places even three or four, kisses on the cheeks \u2014 the 39-year-old former defense minister has been repeatedly spotted in his first days in office giving gentle head-butts to male colleagues.",
      "Although not new, it\u2019s got French media talking \u2014 and digging into the prime minister's past before politics, when he toyed as a teenager with the idea of becoming a monk.",
      "Le Monde and other French publications say Lecornu\u2019s way of greeting people \u2014 mostly men, but sometimes women, too \u2014 with soft temple-to-temple bumps stems from time he spent at Saint-Wandrille Abbey, a community of about 30 Benedictine monks in the Normandy region northwest of Paris.",
      "The naturally discreet Lecornu, citing reasons both personal and professional, has said he finds it difficult to talk publicly about what attracted him to the possibility of joining them.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t like to talk about it, but it\u2019s true,\u201d he said, drawing a deep breath, when asked in 2024 on France\u2019s Television\u2019s \u201cQuelle \u00e9poque !\u201d chat show whether it was accurate that he had considered becoming a Benedictine monk.",
      "The host, L\u00e9a Salam\u00e9, quickly followed up.",
      "\u201cWhat moved you above all is the manner the monks have of greeting each other, forehead to forehead,\" she said.",
      "\u201cOh, not just that,\u201d replied the then-defense minister.",
      "\u201cI had a moment in my adolescent life, a period of discernment, as we say, but which is a very intimate period. I don\u2019t really like talking about that because, for one, I represent the state as a minister and the state is neutral. And so I am a great defender of secularism.\u201d",
      "He then added: \u201cSince you asked me the question: Yes, when I was 16.\u201d",

      "BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic is escalating his crackdown on protests that have shaken his populist rule in recent months. What began as a small, student-led campaign against corruption has snowballed into one of the most turbulent protest waves in the Balkan country in a quarter of a century.",
      "Rights groups and Vucic's political opponents have warned of increasingly brutal tactics aimed at silencing a movement that has become the biggest challenge yet to his decade-long grip on power.",
      "Last week, tanks rolled through the capital, Belgrade, in preparation for a military parade on Sept. 20. If the parade becomes a flashpoint for unrest, protesters fear the military could remain on the streets.",
      "Vucic has ruled Serbia for more than a decade, reshaping its politics while drawing accusations of corruption and authoritarianism.",
      "He began his political career in the 1990s as a hardline nationalist in the Serbian Radical Party, becoming information minister under the late Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic. He was notorious for his calls to punish independent media and his wartime rhetoric against Serbia's neighbors which he maintains to this day.",
      "Serbia was defeated in the wars in the Balkans, Milosevic was ousted by a wave of protests in October 2000, and Vucic reinvented himself as a pro-European reformer. He co-founded the Serbian Progressive Party, which promised modernization and EU integration, but he consolidated his power through populism, control of the media, and a tight grip on state institutions.",
      "On Nov. 1, 2024, a canopy collapsed at the railway station in the northern city of Novi Sad, killing at least 16 people. The tragedy, tied to a Chinese-backed renovation project, sparked outrage over alleged state-run corruption and negligence.",

      "But the anger over corruption quickly resonated beyond campuses, drawing crowds of ordinary citizens frustrated with rising costs of living and a sense of impunity among ruling-party elites.",
      "Protesters now demand accountability, transparency, and early elections.",
      "At first, the demonstrations were peaceful marches and sit-ins. But tensions rose when authorities deployed riot police, plainclothes officers and even shady parapolice units, led by soccer hooligans loyal to Vucic, to disperse the gatherings with batons, sticks and flares.",
      "Protesters reported beatings, arbitrary arrests, and the use of tear gas, stun grenades and sonic devices \u2014 tactics that rights groups have condemned as brutal and excessive.",
      "The harsh response from the authorities has fueled defiance. Students have escalated their actions by blocking major intersections, occupying university halls, and staging sit-ins outside state institutions. Each new crackdown has drawn more people into the streets, creating a cycle of confrontation.",
      "And while previous waves of protests petered out over a disputed property development, allegations of stolen elections and two mass shootings, this time the protests have built up over time. Crucially, they spread beyond Belgrade to dozens of cities and small towns across the country.",
      "Vucic has repeatedly branded the student protesters as \u201cterrorists\u201d who are working in conjunction with Western powers to remove him from office, without presenting any evidence.

      "BEIRUT -- BEIRUT (AP) \u2014 Alexandre Paulikevitch put on his white dress and wig and danced his way to center stage, knowing that the extremist groups who had threatened him before his controversial recital might be waiting for him outside the theater.",
      "The Lebanese dancer\u2019s sold-out performance to a cheering crowd at a popular Beirut venue had angered fundamentalist movements ranging from the right-wing Christian Soldiers of God to Sunni Islamists.",
      "The fundamentalists say Paulikevitch is \u201cpromoting homosexuality\" because he wears dresses and corsets and undulates to classical Arabic music in a way which society largely sees as exclusive to women.",
      "Paulikevitch says he\u2019s breaking social norms and reintroducing forms of dance that were commonplace for men as recently as the early 20th century.",
      "Lebanon is seen as a place of relative tolerance in the region when it comes to LGBTQ+ rights, following years of activism from the queer community and supporters. But the community still faces restrictions and even violence.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not promoting anything, I am just dancing. If you want to come watch me, come,\u201d Paulikevitch said defiantly in his changing room as the audience took their seats outside. \u201cThey think if one looks a certain way, that means they have an agenda to convert society. If the society was going to convert, it would have happened hundreds of years ago.\u201d",
      "Male dancers in the 19th and early 20th century in countries like Egypt who moved their hips and torsos expressively were once widely appreciated but today are largely shunned. Paulikevitch says he\u2019s paying tribute to his favorite dancers and songs with local forms that go beyond belly dancing, which he dismisses as a narrow and exoticized Western perception of Middle Eastern dancing.",
      "The crowd gazed at Paulikevitch as he swayed and contorted his slender body to music played by his backing band of traditional percussionists and flutists. His lipstick, eyeshadow, and eyeliner glowed while he moved under the spotlight. Some in the crowd smiled and sang along, while others watched as if mesmerized. Many filmed with their cellphones. All of them applauded.",
      "Paulikevitch, 43, was seen at protests for years, holding a megaphone for all sorts of causes, including labor rights, combating domestic violence, and in the countrywide uprisings against Lebanon's banks and political leadership in late 2019. He also faced attacks and was once imprisoned under Lebanon\u2019s opaque laws.",
      "\u201cWe dance because we have no other option. We dance because whatever happened and whatever is happening to us, this is our resistance,\u201d he told the audience in his white dress after his first number.",
      "Over 20 years ago, the first non-governmental organization for queer rights in the Middle East was founded in Lebanon. Helem, Arabic for \u201cdream\u201d, was even formally registered. Owners of a handful of Beirut\u2019s nightlife venues are largely accessible to the country\u2019s LGBTQ+ community, including Metro al-Madina, where Paulikevitch is performing. Some even host drag shows.",

      "Lebanon has spiraled downward since 2019, with its banks collapsing and corrupt state institutions decaying. Over half its population of about six million has been pulled into poverty after decades of mismanagement and profiteering by the political class. Israel\u2019s widespread destruction of southern and eastern Lebanon in its monthslong war with the Hezbollah militant group last year further compounded the country\u2019s woes.",
      "\u201cWith everything that\u2019s happening now, especially now \u2014 the killing, the strikes, the extermination, and the insanity that we are living through \u2014 is this the time to focus on me?\u201d the dancer said while putting on his makeup. \u201cWho\u2019s paying attention to me? I don\u2019t understand where this gravity is coming from, which is why I refused to stop my show, because something doesn\u2019t add up.\u201d",
      "As Lebanon has struggled to stand on its own two feet, the queer community has been periodically targeted by conservatives and right-wing groups in ways similar to the ongoing culture wars of the United States and Europe. In Lebanon\u2019s fractured sectarian power-sharing political system, it became a rare bridge of unity.",
      "The summer of 2023 was notably hostile. Lebanon\u2019s culture minister moved to ban the movie \u201cBarbie\u201d, saying it \u201cpromotes homosexuality and transgenders.\u201d Right-wing groups unsuccessfully lobbied to shut down Helem and have mobilized against anything displaying rainbows, from cakes in bakery storefronts to children\u2019s board games at schools. In some cases, their actions turned violent. Members of the Soldiers of God group entered a bar in Beirut hosting a drag show, attacking several people, and forcing other patrons to hide in a bathroom.",

      "\u201cI have a problem with you the same way you have a problem with me, but the difference between us is that I respect you,\u201d he said, addressing the groups attacking him. \u201cEven if your beard or your appearance bothers me, I respect and accept you as you are. You can\u2019t see me as I\u2019m not getting near you, (so) why do you have such a problem with me?\u201d",
      "The dancer has faced more than just threats. He said he was detained for a year under a murky law which criminalizes sexual activity \u201cagainst nature\u201d, which some interpret as including same-sex acts. In 2020, during popular protests across the country decrying corruption and the country\u2019s politicians and bankers, Paulikevitch was among a handful of activists beaten and arrested by riot police by the Central Bank.",
      "Still, he remains optimistic for the future of the queer community and artistic expression in Lebanon. One member of his band helped him with his wig before a quick rehearsal. His calm demeanor soon turned into nervousness, with his mind fixed on his performance and not on whatever might be taking place outside.",
      "\u201cMe putting this makeup and putting (on) my dresses is a political act, (whether) I want it or not,\u201d he said. \u201cDoing what I do is resisting, is giving the possibility for others to be inspired, to say it is possible. I\u2019m paying a high price, but ... maybe, maybe I can inspire someone.\u201d",

      "When Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered this week\u2019s attempted assassination of Hamas leaders in Qatar, he took a major gamble in his campaign to pound the group into submission",
      "JERUSALEM -- When Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered this week\u2019s attempted assassination of Hamas leaders in Qatar, he took a major gamble in his campaign to pound the group into submission.",
      "With signs growing that the mission failed, that gamble appears to have backfired.",
      "Netanyahu had hoped to kill Hamas' senior exiled leaders to get closer toward his vision of \u201ctotal victory\u201d against the militant group that attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and pressure it into surrendering after nearly two years of war in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Instead, Hamas claims its leaders survived, and Netanyahu's global standing, already badly damaged by the scenes of destruction and humanitarian disaster in Gaza, took another hit.",
      "The airstrike Tuesday has enraged Qatar, an influential U.S. ally that has been a key mediator throughout the war, and drawn heavy criticism across the Arab world. It also has strained relations with the White House and thrown hopes of reaching a ceasefire into disarray, potentially endangering the 20 hostages still believed to be alive in Gaza.",
      "But while the strike marks a setback for Netanyahu, the Israeli leader shows no sign of backing down or halting the war. And with his hard-line coalition still firmly behind him, Netanyahu faces no immediate threat to his rule.",
      "Five low-level Hamas members and a Qatari security guard were killed in the strike. But Hamas has said the intended target, senior exiled leaders meeting to discuss a new U.S. ceasefire proposal, all survived. The group, however, has not released any photos of the leaders, and Qatar has not commented on their conditions.",
      "If the airstrike had killed the top leadership, the attack could have provided Netanyahu an opportunity declare Hamas\u2019 destruction, said Harel Chorev, an expert on Arab affairs at Tel Aviv University.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s all very symbolic and it\u2019s definitely part of the thing which allows Netanyahu at a certain point to say \u2018We won, we killed them all,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "Israel\u2019s fierce 23-month offensive in Gaza has wiped out all of Hamas\u2019 top leadership inside the territory. But Netanyahu has set out to eradicate the group as part of his goal of \u201ctotal victory.\u201d",
      "That is now looking increasingly unlikely, making it even harder for Netanyahu to push a ceasefire through his hard-line coalition.",
      "Far-right members of Israel\u2019s governing coalition have cornered Netanyahu, threatening to topple his government unless Israel pushes ahead with an expanded operation in Gaza City, despite serious misgivings by many in the military leadership and widespread opposition among Israel\u2019s public.",
      "A successful operation in Qatar could have allowed Netanyahu to placate the hard-liners, even though it would have eliminated the very officials responsible for negotiating a possible ceasefire.",
      "Israel has had the ability to target Hamas leaders in Doha from the start of the war but did not want to antagonize the Qataris while negotiations took place, Chorev said.",
      "Qatar has helped negotiate two previous ceasefires that have released 148 hostages, including eight bodies, in exchange for thousands of Palestinian prisoners. Israel\u2019s military has rescued just eight hostages alive, and retrieved the bodies of 51 hostages.",
      "While Israel has complained that Qatar was not putting pressure on Hamas, it had continued to leave that channel open \u2014 until Tuesday.",
      "\u201cIsrael, by the attack, notified the whole world that it gave up on the negotiations,\u201d Chorev said. \u201cThey\u2019ve decided to burn the channel with Qatar.\"",
      "Asked if ceasefire talks would continue, Qatar\u2019s prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said that after the strike, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything valid\u201d in the current talks. But he did not elaborate and stopped short of saying Qatar would end its mediation efforts.",

      "State-run Electricite du Liban, or EDL, is viewed as one of Lebanon\u2019s most wasteful institutions and plagued by political interference. It has cost state coffers about $40 billion since the 1975-90 civil war ended.",
      "Since taking office earlier this year, Aoun and Prime Minister Nawaf Salam have vowed to work on implementing reforms and fighting corruption and decades-old mismanagement to get Lebanon out of an economic crisis that the World Bank has described as among the world\u2019s worst since the 1850s.",
      "Lebanon has for decades faced long hours of electricity cuts but the situation became worse following an economic meltdown that began in late 2019. The 14-month Israel-Hebzollah war that ended in late November also badly damaged electricity and other infrastructure in parts of Lebanon.",
      "In April, the World Bank said it will grant Lebanon a $250 million loan that will be used to help ease electricity cuts.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to boost U.S. manufacturing by attracting foreign investment are clashing with his immigration crackdown",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump\u2019s push to revitalize American manufacturing by luring foreign investment into the U.S. has run smack into one of his other priorities: cracking down on illegal immigration.",
      "Hardly a week after immigration authorities raided a sprawling Hyundai battery plant in Georgia, detained more than 300 South Korean workers and showed video of some of them shackled in chains, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung warned that the country's other companies may be reluctant to take up Trump\u2019s invitation to pour money into the United States.",
      "If the U.S. can't promptly issue visas to the technicians and other skilled workers needed to launch plants, then \u201cestablishing a local factory in the United States will either come with severe disadvantages or become very difficult for our companies,\u201d Lee said Thursday. \u201cThey will wonder whether they should even do it.\u201d",
      "The raid and subsequent diplomatic crisis show how the Trump administration's mass deportation goals are running up against its efforts to bring in money from abroad to drive the U.S. economy and create more jobs. Moves like workplace immigration enforcement and visa restrictions could risk alienating allies that are pledging to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S. to avoid high tariffs.",
      "Trump\u2019s economic agenda is built around using hefty tariffs on imports, including a 15% levy on South Korean products, as a cudgel to force manufacturing to return to the U.S. He\u2019s repeatedly said foreign companies can escape his tariffs if they produce in America. South Korea, already a top investor, pledged to invest $350 billion in the U.S. when the two sides announced a trade deal in July.",
      "It made more investments in new construction, such as factories, on previously undeveloped land than any other country in 2022. Last year, it ranked 12th in the world with $93 billion in total American investment \u2014 including acquisitions of existing companies, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.",
      "But the dramatic roundup of South Koreans and others working to set up the battery plant threatens to put a chill on the investment push. Indeed, Trump seems to be trying to undo the damage.",
      "While demanding that foreign investors \u201cLEGALLY bring your very smart people,\u201d Trump also promised to \u201cmake it quickly and legally possible for you to do so.\u201d",
      "\u201cPresident Trump will continue delivering on his promise to make the United States the best place in the world to do business, while also enforcing federal immigration laws,\u201d White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement Thursday.",
      "For now, the South Koreans are furious and immigration experts are puzzled. It's been common practice for decades for foreign companies \u2014 such as the Japanese and German carmakers that have built factories in the American Midwest and South \u2014 to send technical specialists from their home countries to help open plants in the United States. Most of them train U.S. workers, then go home.",
      "\u201cJapanese managers, senior engineers, other technical experts had to come to the United States to set this stuff up,\u201d said Lee Branstetter, a professor of economics and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University who's studied Japanese auto plants in the U.S.",
      "American companies do the same thing, sending U.S. workers overseas temporarily to get operations started.",
      "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement launched the roundup last week at a manufacturing site that state officials have touted as Georgia\u2019s largest economic development project.",
      "\u201cIt's really baffling to me why this raid would have occurred,\u201d said Ben Armstrong, executive director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Industrial Performance Center. \u201cThe existence of these workers shouldn't have been a surprise.\u201d",

The U.S. has a few country-specific visa categories that make it easier to bring in certain foreign workers, like those from Mexico, Australia or Singapore.",

      "In the days following the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, numerous workers have been fired for their comments on his death, among them MSNBC political analyst Matthew Dowd",
      "NEW YORK -- In the days following the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, numerous workers have been fired for their comments on his death, among them MSNBC political analyst Matthew Dowd.",
      "It's far from the first time workers have lost their jobs over things they say publicly \u2014 including in social media posts. In the U.S., laws can vary across states, but overall, there\u2019s very little legal protections for employees who are punished for speech made both in and out of private workplaces.",
      "\u201cMost people think they have a right to free speech\u2026but that doesn\u2019t necessarily apply in the workplace,\u201d said Vanessa Matsis-McCready, associate general counsel and vice president of HR Services for Engage PEO. \u201cMost employees in the private sector do not have any protections for that type of speech at work.\u201d",
      "Add to that the prevalence of social media, which has made it increasingly common to track employees\u2019 conduct outside of work and to dox people, or publish information about them online with the intent of harming or harassing them.",
      "Protections for workers vary from one state to the next. For example, in New York, if an employee is participating in a weekend political protest, but not associating themselves with the organization that employs them, their employer cannot fire them for that activity when they return to work. But if that same employee is at a company event on a weekend and talks about their political viewpoints in a way that makes others feel unsafe or the target of discrimination or harassment, then they could face consequences at work, Matsis-McCready said.",
      "Most of the U.S. defaults to \u201cat-will\u201d employment law \u2014 which essentially means employers can choose to hire and fire as they see fit, including over employees' speech.",
      "\u201cThe First Amendment does not apply in private workplaces to protect employees\u2019 speech,\" said Andrew Kragie, an attorney who specializes in employment and labor law at Maynard Nexsen. \"It actually does protect employers\u2019 right to make decisions about employees, based on employees\u2019 speech.\u201d",
      "Kragie said there are \u201cpockets of protection\u201d around the U.S. under various state laws, such as statues that forbid punishing workers for their political views. But the interpretation of how that gets enforced changes, he notes, making the waters murky.",
      "Steven T. Collis, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin and faculty director of the school\u2019s Bech-Loughlin First Amendment Center, also points to some state laws that say employers can\u2019t fire their workers for \u201clegal off duty conduct.\u201d But there\u2019s often an exception for conduct seen as disruptive to an employer\u2019s business or reputation, which could be grounds to fire someone over public comments or social media posts.",
      "\u201cIn this scenario, if somebody feels like one of their employees has done something that suggests they are glorifying or celebrating a murder, an employer might still be able to fire them even with one of those laws on the books,\u201d Collis said.",
      "For public employees, which can range from school teachers and postal workers to elected officials, the process is a bit different. That\u2019s because the First Amendment plays a unique role when the government is the employer, Collis explains \u2014 and the Supreme Court has ruled that if an employee is acting in a private capacity but speaking on a matter of public concern, they\u2019re protected.",
      "However, that has yet to stop the public sector from restricting speech in the aftermath of Kirk's death. For instance, leaders at the Pentagon unveiled a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy for any posts or comments from troops that make light of or celebrate the killing of Kirk.",
      "The policy, announced by the Pentagon\u2019s top spokesman Sean Parnell on social media Thursday, came hours after numerous conservative military influencers and activists began forwarding posts they considered problematic to Parnell and his boss, defense secretary Pete Hegseth.",
      "\u201cIt is unacceptable for military personnel and Department of War civilians to celebrate or mock the assassination of a fellow American,\u201d Parnell wrote Thursday.",
      "The ubiquity of social media is making it easier than ever to share opinions about politics and major news events as they're unfolding. But posting on social media leaves a record, and in times of escalating political polarization, those declarations can be seen as damaging to the reputation of an individual or their employer.",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t realize when they\u2019re on social media, it is the town square,\u201d said Amy Dufrane, CEO of the Human Resource Certification Institute. \u201cThey\u2019re not having a private conversation with the neighbor over the fence. They\u2019re really broadcasting their views.\u201d",

      "Political debates are certainly not limited to social media and are increasingly making their way into the workplace as well.",
      "\u201cThe gamification of the way we communicate in the workplace, Slack and Teams, chat and all these things, they\u2019re very similar to how you might interact on Instagram or other social media, so I do think that makes it feel a little less formal and somebody might be more inclined to take to take a step and say, 'Oh, I can\u2019t believe this happened,'\u201d Matsis-McCready said.",
      "In the tense, divided climate of the U.S., many human resource professionals have expressed that they're unprepared to address politically charged discussions in the workplace, according to the Human Resource Certification Institute. But those conversations are going to happen, so employers need to set policies about what is acceptable or unacceptable workplace conduct, Dufrane said.",
      "\u201cHR has got to really drill down and make sure that they\u2019re super clear on their policies and practices and communicating to their employees on what are their responsibilities as an employee of the organization,\u201d Dufrane said.",
      "Many employers are reviewing their policies on political speech and providing training about what appropriate conduct looks like, both inside and outside the organization, she said. And the brutal nature of Kirk's killing may have led some of them to react more strongly in the days that followed his death.",
      "\u201cBecause of the violent nature of what some political discussion is now about, I think there is a real concern from employers that they want to keep the workplace safe and that they\u2019re being extra vigilant about anything that could be viewed as a threat, which is their duty,\u201d Matsis-McCreedy said.",
      "Employees can also be seen as ambassadors of a company\u2019s brand, and their political speech can dilute that brand and hurt its reputation, depending on what is being said and how it is being received. That is leading more companies to act on what employees are saying online, she said.",
      "\u201cSome of the individuals that had posted and their posts went viral, all of a sudden the phone lines of their employers were just nonstop calls complaining,\u201d Matsis-McCready said.",
      "Still, experts like Collis don\u2019t anticipate a significant change in how employers monitor their workers speech \u2014 noting that online activity has come under the spotlight for at least the last 15 years.",
      "\u201cEmployers are already and have been for a very long time, vetting employees based on what they\u2019re posting on social media,\u201d he said.",

      "The Congressional Budget Office has released new economic projections, indicating that unemployment, inflation and overall growth will worsen in 2025 before improving over the next year",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policy, immigration crackdowns and sweeping tax and spending law are expected to increase jobless rates and inflation and lower overall growth this year before they improve next year, according to a new report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The CBO on Friday released new economic projections for the next three years, updating the outlook it originally released in January, before Trump's inauguration.",
      "The latest figures, which compare fourth quarter changes, show the unemployment rate, inflation and overall growth are expected to be worse this year than initially projected, while the economic picture is expected to steady in subsequent years.",
      "The CBO outlooks attempt to set expectations for the economy in order to help choices made by congressional and executive branch policymakers. It does not forecast economic downturns or recessions, with its estimates generally reverting back to an expected average over time.",
      "But Friday\u2019s outlook showed the degree to which Trump\u2019s choices are altering the path of the U.S. economy, suggesting that growth has been hampered in the near term by choices that have yet to show the promised upside of more jobs and lower budget deficits.",
      "Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson, told The Associated Press, \u201cAmericans heard similar doom-and-gloom forecasts during President Trump\u2019s first term, when the President\u2019s economic agenda unleashed historic job, wage, and economic growth and the first decline in wealth inequality in decades.\u201d",

      "Overall, the CBO expects real GDP growth to decrease from 2.5% in 2024 to 1.4% this year, a downgrade from the initial projection of 1.9%. The CBO attributes the projected decline to a slowdown in consumer spending stemming from new tariffs and a decrease in immigration, which would also impact consumer spending.",

      "Cook's lawyers say the administration hasn't shown sufficient cause to fire her.",
      "Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook is asking a U.S. appeals court to reject the Trump administration's latest bid to remove her from her post ahead of the central bank's next vote on interest rates.",
      "In a filing with the court Saturday, attorneys on behalf of Cook asked the court to refuse an emergency request by the Trump administration for a stay of a lower court ruling that would clear the way for President Donald Trump to remove Cook from the Federal Reserve\u2019s board of governors.",
      "Lawyers for Cook argue that the Trump administration has not shown sufficient cause to fire her, and stressed the risks to the economy and country if the president were allowed to fire a Fed governor without cause.",
      "\u201cA stay by this court would therefore be the first signal from the courts that our system of government is no longer able to guarantee the independence of the Federal Reserve. Nothing would then stop the president from firing other members of the board on similarly flimsy pretexts. The era of Fed independence would be over. The risks to the nation\u2019s economy could be dire,\u201d according to the filing.",
      "The court has given the Trump administration the option to respond to Cook's filing by 3 p.m. Eastern on Sunday.",
      "At stake is whether the Trump administration will succeed in its extraordinary effort to shape the board before the Fed\u2019s interest rate-setting committee meets Tuesday and Wednesday. At the same time, Senate Republicans are pushing to confirm Stephen Miran, President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to an open spot on the Fed\u2019s board, which could happen as soon as Monday.",
      "Trump has accused Cook of mortgage fraud because she appeared to claim two properties as \u201cprimary residences\u201d in July 2021, before she joined the board. Such claims can lead to a lower mortgage rate and smaller down payment than if one of them was declared as a rental property or second home.",
      "Cook has denied the charges and sued the Trump administration to block her firing.",
      "On Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Jia Cobb ruled the administration had not satisfied a legal requirement that Fed governors can only be fired \u201cfor cause,\u201d which she said was limited to misconduct while in office. Cook did not join the Fed\u2019s board until 2022.",

      "The administration then appealed the decision and asked for an emergency ruling reversing the lower court order by Monday. In their emergency appeal, Trump\u2019s lawyers argued that even if the conduct occurred before Cook's time as governor, her alleged action \u201cindisputably calls into question Cook\u2019s trustworthiness and whether she can be a responsible steward of the interest rates and economy.\u201d",
      "If the Trump administration's appeal succeeds, Cook would be removed from the Fed\u2019s board until her case is ultimately resolved in the courts, and she would miss next week\u2019s Fed meeting, when the central bank is set to decide whether to reduce its key interest rate.",
      "If the appeals court rules in Cook\u2019s favor, the administration could seek an emergency ruling from the Supreme Court.",
      "The Fed is under relentless pressure from Trump to cut rates. The central bank has held rates steady since late 2024 over worries that the Trump administration\u2019s unpredictable tariff policies will reignite inflation.",
      "Last month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled that Fed officials are increasingly concerned about weaker hiring, setting the stage for a rate cut next week. Most economists expect the Fed will cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point to about 4.1%.",
      "When the Fed reduces its key rate, it often, over time, lowers borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, and business loans. Some of those rates have already fallen in anticipation of cuts from the Fed.",

      "Gov. Newsom championed it as crucial facing Trump\u2019s environmental rollbacks.",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California will extend a key climate program under a bill state lawmakers passed Saturday, sending the measure to Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has championed it as a crucial tool to respond to the Trump administration\u2019s environmental rollbacks.",
      "The Democrat-dominated Legislature voted to reauthorize the state's cap-and-trade program, which is set to expire after 2030. Then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, signed a law authorizing the program in 2006, and it launched in 2013.",
      "The program sets a declining limit on total planet-warming emissions in the state from major polluters. Companies must reduce their emissions, buy allowances from the state or other businesses, or fund projects aimed at offsetting their emissions. Money the state receives from the sales funds climate-change mitigation, affordable housing and transportation projects, as well as utility bill credits for Californians.",
      "Newsom, a Democrat, and legislative leaders, who said months ago they would prioritize reauthorizing the program, almost ran out of time to introduce the proposal before the statehouse wraps for the year.",
      "\u201cAfter months of hard work with the Legislature, we have agreed to historic reforms that will save money on your electric bills, stabilize gas supply, and slash toxic air pollution \u2014 all while fast-tracking California\u2019s transition to a clean, green job-creating economy,\u201d Newsom said after striking the deal this week.",
      "The proposal would reauthorize the program through 2045, better align the declining cap on emissions with the state's climate targets and potentially boost carbon-removal projects. It would also change the name to \u201ccap and invest\" to emphasize its funding of climate programs.",
      "The Legislature approved another bill committing annual funding from the program's revenues. It includes $1 billion for the state's long-delayed high-speed rail project, $800 million for an affordable housing program, $250 million for community air protection programs and $1 billion for the Legislature to decide on annually.",
      "The votes come as officials contend with balancing the state\u2019s ambitious climate goals and the cost of living. California has some of the highest utility and gas prices in the country. Officials face increased pressure to stabilize the cost and supply of fuel amid the planned closures of two oil refineries that make up roughly 18% of the state's refining capacity, according to energy regulators.",
      "Proponents of the extension say it will give companies certainty over the program's future. The state lost out on $3.6 billion in revenues over the past year and a half, largely due to uncertainty, according to a report from Clean and Prosperous California, a group of economists and lawyers supporting the program. Some environmentalists say the Trump administration's attacks on climate programs, including the state's first-in-the-nation ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, added urgency to the reauthorization effort.",
      "Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas said the extension balanced the state's ambitious emission-reduction and affordability goals. The Democrat called cap and trade \u201cthe cornerstone of our climate strategy.\u201d",
      "But environmental justice advocates opposing the proposal say it doesn't go far enough and lacks strong air quality protections for low-income Californians and communities of color more likely to live near major polluters.",
      "\u201cThis really continues to allow big oil to reduce their emissions on paper instead of in real life,\u201d said Asha Sharma, state policy manager at the Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability.",
      "GOP lawmakers criticized the program, saying it would make living in California more expensive.",

      "Cambodia has opened the Techo International Airport in Phnom Penh with the hope of boosting tourism",
      "KANDAL, Cambodia -- Cambodia on Tuesday opened the capital's new Techo International Airport as officials welcomed an inaugural flight to great fanfare, with the hope of boosting tourism.",
      "Fire trucks crisscrossed streams of water over the Air Cambodia flight from China as it taxied to the terminal in the new $2 billion facility located about 20 kilometers (12 miles) outside of Phnom Penh.",
      "The new three-runway facility replaces the nearly 70-year-old Phnom Penh International Airport which had only one runway. It had been scheduled to be operational in July but the opening was delayed for a technical issue.",
      "\u201cThe opening is a major step for Cambodia\u2019s aviation and economy,\u201d former Prime Minister Hun Sen said on social media.",
      "\u201cIt's a great honor to be one of the first passengers to use the airport and it looks absolutely amazing,\u201d said Briton David Weare, who arrived on a flight from Singapore later Tuesday. \u201cI can't wait to get through and see the rest of it.\u201d",
      "In 2024, Phnom Penh International Airport saw 4.75 million passengers. The new airport is initially expected to be able to accommodate 13 million passengers, but that capacity will increase to 30 million after 2030 and up to 50 million by 2050.",
      "The opening follows the inauguration of the Siem Reap-Angkor International Airport in 2023 near the country's most popular tourist attraction, the centuries-old Angkor Wat temple complex and comes as Cambodia looks to capitalize on the lucrative tourism industry.",
      "In 2024, some 6.7 million international tourists visited the Southeast Asian country, a 23% increase from 2023.",
      "But tensions between Cambodia and neighboring Thailand could complicate efforts to attract more tourists, with at least 41 soldiers and civilians being killed in armed border clashes before a shaky truce was reached on July 28.",
      "While the new airport in Siem Reap was financed by China, the Techo International Airport is a joint venture between the Cambodian government and the Overseas Cambodian Investment Corp, according to authorities.",
      "The airport\u2019s name \u201cTecho,\u201d or powerful in the Khmer language, is an honorific given to top army commanders in Cambodia, including Hun Sen.",

      "British horse racing has gone ahead with its unprecedented one-day strike to protest a feared rise in taxes on race betting",
      "LONDON -- British horse racing went ahead Wednesday with its unprecedented one-day strike to protest a feared rise in taxes on race betting, with a top official in the sport urging the industry to \u201cstand together\u201d and \u201cmake their voices heard.\u201d",
      "Four scheduled meetings \u2014 at Carlisle, Uttoxeter, Lingfield and Kempton \u2014 have been canceled and rescheduled after agreements between the owners of the courses and the British Horseracing Authority, making it the first time the sport in Britain has voluntarily refused to race in modern history.",
      "The BHA set up the \u201cAxe the Racing Tax\u201d campaign in response to proposals to replace the existing three-tax structure of online gambling duties with a single tax, with fears the current 15% duty on racing could be increased to the 21% levied on games of chance.",
      "Economic analysis commissioned by the BHA says such a rise could cost the sport at least 66 million pounds ($90 million) and put around 2,750 jobs at risk in the first year, in what BHA chairman Charles Allen described as \u201cnothing short of an existential threat for our sport.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need every part of our industry \u2014 trainers, jockeys, stable staff, racecourses, and fans \u2014 to stand together and make their voices heard,\" Allen said.",
      "\u201cWe are Britain\u2019s second largest spectator sport, supporting 85,000 jobs and delivering over 4 billion pounds ($5.4 billion) of economic value every year. Yet all of this is now being put at risk by a change that would devastate our funding model and the livelihoods that depend on it.\"",
      "Allen said the protests are about \u201cprotecting communities across Britain\u201d and \u201csafeguarding a national institution.\u201d",
      "Previously, the British government said it was bringing the \u201ctreatment of online betting in line with other forms of online gambling to cut down bureaucracy.\u201d",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s president said Thursday that South Korean companies will likely hesitate to maintain or make direct investments in the United States if the U.S. fails to improve its visa system for Korean workers.",
      "In a news conference marking 100 days in office, Lee called for improvements in the U.S. visa system as he spoke about the Sept. 4 immigration raid in Georgia that resulted in the arrest of more than 300 South Korean workers at a battery factory under construction at Hyundai\u2019s sprawling auto plant in Georgia.",
      "Lee said the Korean workers are set to be brought home on Friday aboard a charter plane following negotiations with the U.S.",
      "The massive roundup in Georgia, and U.S. authorities\u2019 release of video showing some workers being chained and taken away, sparked widespread anger and a sense of betrayal in South Korea. The raid came less than two weeks after a summit between President Donald Trump and Lee, and just weeks after the countries reached a July agreement that spared South Korea from the Trump administration\u2019s highest tariffs, but only after Seoul pledged $350 billion in new U.S. investments.",
      "Lawmakers from both Lee\u2019s liberal Democratic Party and the conservative opposition decried the detentions as outrageous and heavy-handed, while South Korea\u2019s biggest newspaper compared the raid to a \u201crabbit hunt\u201d executed by U.S. immigration authorities in a zeal to meet an alleged White House goal of 3,000 arrests a day.",
      "During the news conference, Lee said South Korean and U.S. officials are discussing a possible improvement to the U.S. visa system, adding that under the current system South Korean companies \u201ccan\u2019t help hesitating a lot\u201d about making direct investments in the U.S.",
      "U.S. authorities said some of the detained workers had illegally crossed the U.S. border, while others entered legally but had expired visas or entered on visa waivers that prohibited them from working.",

      "South Korean companies have been relying on short-term visitor visas or Electronic System for Travel Authorization to send workers who are needed to launch manufacturing sites and handle other setup tasks, a practice that had been largely tolerated for years.",
      "Lee said that whether the U.S. establishes a visa system allowing South Korean companies to send skilled workers to industrial sites will have a \u201cmajor impact\u201d on future South Korean investments in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not like these are long-term workers. When you build a facility or install equipment at a plant, you need technicians, but the United States doesn\u2019t have that workforce and yet they won\u2019t issue visas to let our people stay and do the work,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cBut the United States clearly doesn\u2019t see things that way. On top of that, U.S. immigration authorities pledge to strictly forbid illegal immigration and employment and carry out deportations in various aggressive ways, and our people happened to be caught in one of those cases,\u201d he added.",
      "Following a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington, South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun said Wednesday that U.S. officials have agreed to allow the workers detained in Georgia to later return to finish their work at the site. He added that the countries agreed to set up a joint working group for discussions on creating a new visa category to make it easier for South Korean companies to send their staff to work in the United States.",

      "Without an update in U.S. visa policies, Min said, \u201cKorean companies will no longer be able to send their workers to the United States, causing inevitable delays in the expansion of facilities and other production activities, and the harm will boomerang back to the U.S. economy.\"",

      "Officials say Ukrainian drones have struck one of Russia\u2019s largest oil refineries and sparked a fire",
      "Ukrainian drones have struck one of Russia\u2019s largest oil refineries, sparking a fire, Russian officials and Ukraine\u2019s military said Sunday.",
      "The overnight strike on the Kirishi refinery, in Russia's northwestern Leningrad region, follows weeks of Ukrainian attacks on Russian oil infrastructure that Kyiv says fuels Moscow\u2019s war effort.",
      "The facility, operated by Russian company Surgutneftegas, produces close to 17.7 million metric tons per year (355,000 barrels per day) of crude, and is one of Russia's top three by output.",
      "More than three years since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, drones continue to be a key weapon for both sides. Multiple Russian drones crossed into Poland on Wednesday, prompting NATO to send fighter jets to shoot them down and underlining long-held concerns that the fighting might spill over beyond Ukraine's borders.",
      "According to Ukraine\u2019s General Staff, explosions and a fire were reported at the Kirishi refinery. It posted a photo appearing to show a blaze and clouds of smoke against a night sky.",
      "Regional Gov. Alexander Drozdenko said that three drones were downed overnight in the Kirishi area, with falling debris sparking a fire at the facility. He said that no one was injured, and the blaze was put out.",
      "As of Sunday afternoon, Russian officials offered no further comment on the consequences of the strike, and it wasn't immediately possible to verify these. At least 80 Ukrainian drones were shot down overnight over Russia, the annexed Crimean Peninsula and the adjacent Sea of Azov, according to the Russian Defense Ministry.",
      "Ukrainian drones previously targeted the Kirishi refinery in March, causing minor damage, according to social media posts published at the time by Drozdenko.",
      "Russia remains the world\u2019s second-largest oil exporter, but a seasonal rise in demand and sustained Ukrainian drone strikes have caused gasoline shortages in recent weeks. Gas stations have run dry in some regions of the country, with motorists waiting in long lines and officials resorting to rationing or cutting off sales altogether.",

      "Also in the Leningrad region, a diesel locomotive was derailed during the night, local Gov. Drozdenko said Sunday. He said the incident occurred near Gatchina south of St. Petersburg. Russia's No. 2 city, which was known as Leningrad during Soviet times, is surrounded by but not included in the region of the same name.",
      "Drozdenko said the locomotive's driver was trapped in his cabin, and later died of his injuries while being transported to a hospital. He added an official investigation would check for signs of sabotage.",

      "Residents of Annob\u00f3n island in Equatorial Guinea have faced severe internet outages since complaining about dynamite explosions by a Moroccan construction company",
      "LAGOS, Nigeria -- When residents of Equatorial Guinea's Annob\u00f3n island wrote to the government in Malabo in July last year complaining about the dynamite explosions by a Moroccan construction company, they didn't expect the swift end to their internet access.",
      "Dozens of the signatories and residents were imprisoned for nearly a year, while internet access to the small island has been cut off since then, according to several residents and rights groups.",
      "Local residents interviewed by The Associated Press left the island in the past months, citing fear for their lives and the difficulty of life without internet.",
      "Banking services have shut down, hospital services for emergencies have been brought to a halt and residents say they rack up phone bills they can't afford because cellphone calls are the only way to communicate.",
      "When governments shut down the internet, they often instruct telecom providers to cut connections to designated locations or access to designated websites, although it's unclear exactly how the shutdown works in Annob\u00f3n.",
      "The internet shutdown remains in effect, residents confirmed alongside activists, at a moment when the Trump administration has considered loosening corruption sanctions on the country\u2019s vice president.",
      "The Moroccan company Somagec, which activists allege is linked to the president, confirmed the outage but denied having a hand in it. The AP could not confirm a link.",
      "\u201cThe current situation is extremely serious and worrying,\u201d one of the signatories who spent 11 months in prison said, speaking anonymously for fear of being targeted by the government.",
      "In addition to the internet shutdown, \"phone calls are heavily monitored, and speaking freely can pose a risk,\u201d said Macus Menejolea Taxijad, a resident who recently began living in exile.",
      "It is only the latest of repressive measures that the country has deployed to crush criticisms, including mass surveillance, according to a 2024 Amnesty International report.",
      "Equatorial Guinea, a former Spanish colony, is run by Africa\u2019s longest-serving president, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, who, at 83, has served as president for more than half his life. His son serves as the vice president and is accused of spending state funds on a lavish lifestyle. He was convicted of money laundering and embezzlement in France and sanctioned by the U.K.",
      "Despite the country\u2019s oil and gas wealth, at least 57% of its nearly 2 million people live in poverty, according to the World Bank. Officials, their families and their inner circle, meanwhile, live a life of luxury.",
      "The Equatorial Guinea government did not respond to the AP\u2019s inquiry about the island, its condition and internet access.",
      "Located in the Atlantic Ocean about 315 miles (507 kilometers) from Equatorial Guinea\u2019s coast, Annob\u00f3n is one of the country\u2019s poorest islands and one often at conflict with the central government. With a population of around 5,000 people, the island has been seeking independence from the country for years as it accuses the government of disregarding its residents.",
      "The internet shutdown is the latest in a long history of Malabo\u2019s repressive responses to the island\u2019s political and economic demands, activists say, citing regular arrests and the absence of adequate social amenities like schools and hospitals.",
      "\u201cTheir marginalization is not only from a political perspective, but from a cultural, societal and economic perspective,\u201d said Merc\u00e8 Monje Cano, secretary-general of the Unrepresented Peoples and Nations Organization global advocacy group.",

The internet shutdown has instead worsened living conditions there, collapsing key infrastructure, including health care and banking services.",
      "In 2007, Equatorial Guinea entered into a business deal with Somagec, a Moroccan construction company that develops ports and electricity transmission systems across West and Central Africa.",
      "Annob\u00f3n's geological formation and volcanic past make the island rich in rocks and expands Malabo's influence in the Gulf of Guinea, which is abundantly rich in oil. Somagec has also built a port and, according to activists, explored mineral extraction in Annob\u00f3n since it began operations on the island.",
      "Residents and activists said the company's dynamite explosions in open quarries and construction activities have been polluting their farmlands and water supply. The company's work on the island continues.",
      "Residents hoped to pressure authorities to improve the situation with their complaint in July last year. Instead, Obiang then deployed a repressive tactic now common in Africa to cut off access to internet to clamp down on protests and criticisms.",
      "This was different from past cases when Malabo restricted the internet during an election.",
      "\"This is the first time the government cut off the internet because a community has a complaint,\u201d said Tutu Alicante, an Annobon-born activist who runs the EG Justice human rights organization.",

      "\"Annob\u00f3n is very remote and far from the capital and the (rest of) continent,\" said Alicante, the activist from the island. \"So you're leaving people there without access to the rest of the continent ... and incommunicado.\"",

      "Many on social media have reminisced about seeing the giant Pacific octopus named Ghost when they had visited the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach. Some shared that they had a tattoo of Ghost or would wear a sweater emblazoned with the beloved cephalopod in her memory.",
      "\u201cShe is a wonderful octopus and has made an eight-armed impression on all of our hearts,\u201d the aquarium said on Instagram.",
      "Ghost laid eggs earlier this week and entered the last phase of her life cycle, known as senescence. During this period, the octopus will neglect her own basic needs like eating, instead focusing on protecting her eggs and aerating them to prevent bacteria or other harmful agents from growing on them.",
      "Ghost's eggs are unfertilized and will never hatch, however. In the wild, giant Pacific octopuses spend their whole lives alone and only come together for a brief instance to reproduce.",
      "\u201cYou really can\u2019t combine males and females for any period of time because they don\u2019t naturally cohabitate,\u201d said the aquarium's vice president of animal care, Nate Jaros. \u201cThey\u2019re at high risk or aggression or even potentially death.\u201d",
      "Ghost is originally from the waters of British Columbia, Canada, and arrived at the aquarium in May 2024 from a scientific collector. She was only 3 pounds (1.4 kilograms) then but now weighs more than 50 pounds (22.7 kilograms).",
      "The average giant Pacific octopus lives for three to five years. Ghost is estimated to be between two and four years old, Jaros said.",
      "Ghost was a \u201csuper active and very physical octopus\u201d who enjoyed spending time with humans, Jaros said.",

      "The 59-year-old saw decades of work disappear with the precious soil that the floods stripped from his small-scale farm in the foothills of Mount Mulanje.",
      "He was used to producing a healthy 850 kilograms (1,870 pounds) of corn each season to support his three daughters and two sons. He salvaged just 8 kilograms (17 pounds) from the wreckage of Freddy.",
      "\u201cThis is not a joke,\u201d he said, remembering how his farm in the village of Sazola became a wasteland of sand and rocks.",
      "Freddy jolted Maere into action. He decided he needed to change his age-old tactics if he was to survive.",
      "He is now one of thousands of small-scale farmers in the southern African country using a generative AI chatbot designed by the non-profit Opportunity International for farming advice.",
      "The Malawi government is backing the project, having seen the agriculture-dependent nation hit recently by a series of cyclones and an El Ni\u00f1o-induced drought. Malawi\u2019s food crisis, which is largely down to the struggles of small-scale farmers, is a central issue for its national elections next week.",
      "More than 80% of Malawi's population of 21 million rely on agriculture for their livelihoods and the country has one of the highest poverty rates in the world, according to the World Bank.",
      "The AI chatbot suggested Maere grow potatoes last year alongside his staple corn and cassava to adjust to his changed soil. He followed the instructions to the letter, he said, and cultivated half a soccer field's worth of potatoes and made more than $800 in sales, turning around his and his children's fortunes.",
      "\u201cI managed to pay for their school fees without worries,\u201d he beamed.",
      "Artificial intelligence has the potential to uplift agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa, where an estimated 33-50 million smallholder farms like Maere's produce up to 70-80% of the food supply, according to the U.N.'s International Fund for Agricultural Development. Yet productivity in Africa \u2014 with the world's fast-growing population to feed \u2014 is lagging behind despite vast tracts of arable land.",
      "As AI's use surges across the globe, so it is helping African farmers access new information to identify crop diseases, forecast drought, design fertilizers to boost yields, and even locate an affordable tractor. Private investment in agriculture-related tech in sub-Saharan Africa went from $10 million in 2014 to $600 million in 2022, according to the World Bank.",
      "But not without challenges.",
      "Africa has hundreds of languages for AI tools to learn. Even then, few farmers have smartphones and many can't read. Electricity and internet service are patchy at best in rural areas, and often non-existent.",
      "\u201cOne of the biggest challenges to sustainable AI use in African agriculture is accessibility,\u201d said Daniel Mvalo, a Malawian technology specialist. \u201cMany tools fail to account for language diversity, low literacy and poor digital infrastructure.\u201d",
      "The AI tool in Malawi tries to do that. The app is called Ulangizi, which means advisor in the country's Chichewa language. It is WhatsApp-based and works in Chichewa and English. You can type or speak your question, and it replies with an audio or text response, said Richard Chongo, Opportunity International's country director for Malawi.",

      "As Big Tech\u2019s data centers continue to grow threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are considering bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- With the explosive growth of Big Tech's data centers threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are taking a hard look at a tough-love solution: bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies.",
      "Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.",
      "Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.",
      "Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.",
      "That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.",
      "Texas was first, but it won't be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,\u201d said Michael Weber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. \u201cData center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.\u201d",
      "That's because grids can't keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.",
      "Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.",
      "A proposal similar to Texas' has emerged from the nation's biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.",
      "The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs \u2014 likely for the biggest power users \u2014 to meet growing demand.",
      "The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast \u2014 twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data \u2014 and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.",
      "Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.",
      "\u201cData center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,\u201d said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.",
      "Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there's a power outage.",
      "Data center operators, however, say they hadn't anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.",
      "The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.",

      "The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.",
      "PJM's just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.",
      "That's caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.",
      "Many questioned PJM's legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.",
      "\u201cThis is particularly concerning given that states within PJM\u2019s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,\u201d the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.",
      "The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it's too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.",
      "Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won't lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a \u201cbring your own generation\u201d requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.",
      "In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.",
      "Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.",
      "However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.",
      "To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.",
      "It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.",
      "Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.",
      "But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.",
      "\u201cAnd the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?\" Silverman said. \"Or is there a better way to do it?\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Australia has approved a world-first vaccine to protect koalas from chlamydia",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- A regulator has approved a world-first vaccine to protect koalas from chlamydia infections, which are causing infertility and death in the iconic native species that is listed as endangered in parts of Australia.",
      "The single-dose vaccine was developed by the University of the Sunshine Coast in Queensland state after more than a decade of research led by professor of microbiology Peter Timms.",
      "The research showed the vaccine reduced the likelihood of koalas developing symptoms of chlamydia during breeding age and decreased mortality from the disease in wild populations by at least 65%.",
      "The recent approval by Australia\u2019s veterinary medicine regulator means the vaccine can now be used in wildlife hospitals, veterinary clinics and in the field to protect the nation\u2019s most at-risk koalas, Timms said on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cWe knew a single-dose vaccine \u2014 with no need for a booster \u2014 was the answer to reducing the rapid, devastating spread of this disease, which accounts for as much as half of koala deaths across all wild populations in Australia,\u201d Timms said in a statement.",
      "\u201cSome individual colonies are edging closer to local extinction every day, particularly in southeast Queensland and New South Wales, where infection rates within populations are often around 50% and in some cases can reach as high as 70%,\u201d\u202fTimms added.",
      "Deborah Tabart, chair of the conservation charity Australian Koala Foundation, said resources being spent on vaccinating koalas should be redirected at saving koala habitat.",
      "\u201cAt the risk of sounding flippant, how can anyone be so delusional as to think that you can vaccinate 100,000 animals? It\u2019s just ridiculous,\u201d Tabart said on Friday.",
      "Tabart\u2019s foundation estimates there are fewer than 100,000 koalas in the wild. The government-backed National Koala Monitoring Program estimated last year there were between 224,000 and 524,000 koalas.",
      "\u201cI accept that chlamydia is an issue for koalas, but I also want people to understand that they\u2019re sick because they haven\u2019t got any habitat,\u201d Tabart said.",
      "The Queensland Conservation Council, an umbrella organization for more than 50 environmental groups across the state, welcomed the vaccine. But the council's director, Dave Copeman, echoed Tabart\u2019s focus on preserving koala habitat.",

      "\u201cKoalas were at risk before chlamydia outbreaks, and they will remain at risk even if we manage chlamydia perfectly, because we keep on destroying their habitat,\u201d he added.",
      "Koalas are listed as endangered species in the states of Queensland and New South Wales and in the Australian Capital Territory, with habitat loss due to wildfires and urban expansion as the major threats. Chlamydia can cause urinary tract infections, infertility, blindness and death.",
      "Treatment with antibiotics can disrupt an infected koala\u2019s ability to digest eucalyptus leaves \u2014 its sole food source \u2014 leading to starvation, the university said in a statement.",
      "The research has been supported by the federal, New South Wales and Queensland governments.",
      "Federal Environment Minister Murray Watt said his government had contributed to the vaccine\u2019s development through a 76 million Australian dollar ($50 million) Saving Koalas Fund.",
      "\u201cWe know that koalas need help to fight diseases like chlamydia. It\u2019s a widespread threat impacting their reproductive health and causing infertility,\u201d Watt said in a statement.",
      "Koalas are iconic Australian marsupials, like wombats and kangaroos. They spend most of their time eating and sleeping in eucalyptus trees, and their paws have two opposing thumbs to help them grasp and climb up tree trunks.",
      "Australia\u2019s wild koala populations have declined steeply in the past two decades.",
      "Facing compounded threats from disease, habitat loss, climate change and road collisions, koalas could become extinct by 2050, according to a 2020 assessment from the New South Wales government.",

      "High school and college educators say that student use of artificial intelligence has become so widespread that they need to rethink how to assign and assess students",
      "The book report is now a thing of the past. Take-home tests and essays are becoming obsolete.",
      "High school and college educators around the country say student use of artificial intelligence has become so prevalent that to assign writing outside of the classroom is like asking students to cheat.",
      "\u201cThe cheating is off the charts. It\u2019s the worst I\u2019ve seen in my entire career,\u201d says Casey Cuny, who has taught English for 23 years. Educators are no longer wondering if students will outsource schoolwork to AI chatbots. \u201cAnything you send home, you have to assume is being AI\u2019ed.\u201d",
      "The question now is how schools can adapt, because many of the teaching and assessment tools that have been used for generations are no longer effective. As AI technology rapidly improves and becomes more entwined with daily life, it is transforming how students learn and study, how teachers teach, and it\u2019s creating new confusion over what constitutes academic dishonesty.",
      "\u201cWe have to ask ourselves, what is cheating?\u201d says Cuny, a 2024 recipient of California\u2019s Teacher of the Year award. \u201cBecause I think the lines are getting blurred.\u201d",
      "Cuny\u2019s students at Valencia High School in southern California now do most writing in class. He monitors student laptop screens from his desktop, using software that lets him \u201clock down\u201d their screens or block access to certain sites. He\u2019s also integrating AI into his lessons and teaching students how to use AI as a study aid \u201cto get kids learning with AI instead of cheating with AI.\u201d",
      "In rural Oregon, high school teacher Kelly Gibson has made a similar shift to in-class writing. She is also incorporating more verbal assessments to have students talk through their understanding of assigned reading.",
      "\u201cI used to give a writing prompt and say, \u2018In two weeks I want a five-paragraph essay,\u2019\u201d says Gibson. \u201cThese days, I can\u2019t do that. That\u2019s almost begging teenagers to cheat.\u201d",
      "Take, for example, a once typical high school English assignment: Write an essay that explains the relevance of social class in \u201cThe Great Gatsby.\u201d Many students say their first instinct is now to ask ChatGPT for help \u201cbrainstorming.\u201d Within seconds, ChatGPT yields a list of essay ideas, plus examples and quotes to back them up. The chatbot ends by asking if it can do more: \u201cWould you like help writing any part of the essay? I can help you draft an introduction or outline a paragraph!\u201d",
      "Students say they often turn to AI with good intentions for things like research, editing or help reading difficult texts. But AI offers unprecedented temptation and it\u2019s sometimes hard to know where to draw the line.",
      "College sophomore Lily Brown, a psychology major at an East Coast liberal arts school, relies on ChatGPT to help outline essays because she struggles putting the pieces together herself. ChatGPT also helped her through a freshman philosophy class, where assigned reading \u201cfelt like a different language\u201d until she read AI summaries of the texts.",
      "\u201cSometimes I feel bad using ChatGPT to summarize reading, because I wonder is this cheating? Is helping me form outlines cheating? If I write an essay in my own words and ask how to improve it, or when it starts to edit my essay, is that cheating?\u201d",
      "Her class syllabi say things like: \u201cDon\u2019t use AI to write essays and to form thoughts,\u201d she says, but that leaves a lot of grey area. Students say they often shy away from asking teachers for clarity because admitting to any AI use could flag them as a cheater.",
      "Schools tend to leave AI policies to teachers, which often means that rules vary widely within the same school. Some educators, for example, welcome the use of Grammarly.com, an AI-powered writing assistant, to check grammar. Others forbid it, noting the tool also offers to rewrite sentences.",
      "\u201cWhether you can use AI or not, depends on each classroom. That can get confusing,\u201d says Valencia 11th grader Jolie Lahey, who credits Cuny with teaching her sophomore English class a variety of AI skills like how to upload study guides to ChatGPT and have the chatbot quiz them and then explain problems they got wrong.",
      "But this year, her teachers have strict \u201cNo AI\u201d policies. \u201cIt\u2019s such a helpful tool. And if we\u2019re not allowed to use it that just doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Lahey says. \u201cIt feels outdated.\u201d",

The term \u201cAI literacy\u201d has become a buzzword of the back-to-school season, with a focus on how to balance the strengths of AI with its risks and challenges.",
      "Over the summer, several colleges and universities convened their AI task forces to draft more detailed guidelines or provide faculty with new instructions.",
      "The University of California, Berkeley emailed all faculty new AI guidance that instructs them to \u201cinclude a clear statement on their syllabus about course expectations\u201d around AI use. The guidance offered language for three sample syllabus statements \u2014 for courses that require AI, ban AI in and out of class, or allow some AI use.",

      "At Carnegie Mellon University there has been a huge uptick in academic responsibility violations due to AI but often students aren\u2019t aware they\u2019ve done anything wrong, says Rebekah Fitzsimmons, chair of the AI faculty advising committee at the university\u2019s Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy.",
      "For example, one English language learner wrote an assignment in his native language and used DeepL, an AI-powered translation tool, to translate his work to English but didn\u2019t realize the platform also altered his language, which was flagged by an AI detector.",
      "Enforcing academic integrity policies has been complicated by AI, which is hard to detect and even harder to prove, said Fitzsimmons. Faculty are allowed flexibility when they believe a student has unintentionally crossed a line but are now more hesitant to point out violations because they don't want to accuse students unfairly, and students are worried that if they are falsely accused there is no way to prove their innocence.",
      "Over the summer, Fitzsimmons helped draft detailed new guidelines for students and faculty that strive to create more clarity. Faculty have been told that a blanket ban on AI \u201cis not a viable policy\u201d unless instructors make changes to the way they teach and assess students. A lot of faculty are doing away with take-home exams. Some have returned to pen and paper tests in class, she said, and others have moved to \u201cflipped classrooms,\u201d where homework is done in class.",
      "Emily DeJeu, who teaches communication courses at Carnegie Mellon\u2019s business school, has eliminated writing assignments as homework and replaced them with in-class quizzes done on laptops in \u201ca lockdown browser\u201d that blocks students from leaving the quiz screen.",
      "\u201cTo expect an 18-year-old to exercise great discipline is unreasonable, that\u2019s why it\u2019s up to instructors to put up guardrails.\u201d",

      "The Las Vegas debut of Zoox's long-planned ride-hailing service reflects Amazon-owned robotaxi maker's confidence in the safety of its boxy vehicles after two years of testing them in the city.",
      "The robotaxis initially were only available to employees in Las Vegas before gradually expanding to friends and family members. Now, anyone with the Zoox app will be able to request a ride to five designated locations, including Resorts World, the Luxor hotel and the New York-New York hotel. The longest distance the Zoox robotaxis will travel is about three miles (4.8 kilometers) while carrying up to four passengers.",
      "All rides will be provided for free for at least the first few months to help promote the existence of the service in the perennially popular travel destination. Once it begins charging for rides in Las Vegas, Zoox says its prices will be comparable to traditional taxis and ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft.",
      "Zoox can afford to give free rides largely because of Amazon's deep pockets. The e-commerce powerhouse, currently worth $2.5 trillion, bought Zoox for $1.2 billion five years ago as part of its efforts to establish a foothold in other fields of technology.",
      "The Las Vegas market marks Zoox's first step in its attempt to catch up with robotaxi leader Waymo, a Google spin-off that offers that already provides driverless rides in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Atlanta and Austin, Texas (where Tesla is still in the testing phase of a robotaxi service that its CEO, Elon Musk, has been hyping for the past decade).",

      "In a sign of its ambitions, Zoox hopes to manufacture as many as 10,000 robotaxis annually as it expands into other markets. While the company is currently testing its vehicles in San Francisco, it hopes to open up its service to all passengers next year.",
      "Zoox is currently operating about 50 vehicles in Las Vegas and San Francisco, with most of them in Nevada for now. After it starts charging for rides in San Francisco, Zoox hopes to expand to Austin and Miami next.",

      "NASA's Mars rover Perseverance has uncovered rocks in a dry river channel that may hold potential signs of ancient microscopic life",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- NASA\u2019s Mars rover Perseverance has uncovered rocks in a dry river channel that may hold potential signs of ancient microscopic life, scientists reported Wednesday.",
      "They stressed that in-depth analysis is needed of the sample gathered there by Perseverance \u2014 ideally in labs on Earth \u2014 before reaching any conclusions.",
      "Roaming Mars since 2021, the rover cannot directly detect life. Instead, it carries a drill to penetrate rocks and tubes to hold the samples gathered from places judged most suitable for hosting life billions of years ago. The samples are awaiting retrieval to Earth \u2014 an ambitious plan that's on hold as NASA seeks cheaper, quicker options.",
      "Calling it an \u201cexciting discovery,\u201d a pair of scientists who were not involved in the study \u2014 SETI Institute\u2019s Janice Bishop and the University of Massachusetts Amherst\u2019s Mario Parente \u2014 were quick to point out that non-biological processes could be responsible.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s part of the reason why we can\u2019t go so far as to say, \u2018A-ha, this is proof positive of life,'\u2019\u2019 lead researcher Joel Hurowitz of Stony Brook University told The Associated Press. \u201cAll we can say is one of the possible explanations is microbial life, but there could be other ways to make this set of features that we see.\u201d",
      "Either way, Hurowitz said it\u2019s the best, most compelling candidate yet in the rover\u2019s search for potential signs of long-ago life. It was the 25th sample gathered; the tally is now up to 30, with six more to go.",
      "\u201cIt would be amazing to be able to demonstrate conclusively that these features were formed by something that was alive on another planet billions of years ago, right?\" Hurowitz said. But even if that's not the case, it's \"a valuable lesson in all of the ways that nature can conspire to fool us.\u201d",
      "Collected last summer, the sample is from reddish, clay-rich mudstones in Neretva Vallis, a river channel that once carried water into Jezero Crater. This outcrop of sedimentary rock, known as the Bright Angel formation, was surveyed by Perseverance\u2019s science instruments before the drill came out.",
      "Along with organic carbon, a building block of life, Hurowitz and his team found minuscule specks, dubbed poppy seeds and leopard spots, that were enriched with iron phosphate and iron sulfide. On Earth, these chemical compounds are the byproducts when microorganisms chomp down on organic matter.",
      "The findings appeared in the journal Nature.",
      "Ten of the titanium sample tubes were placed on the Martian surface a few years ago as a backup to the rest aboard the rover, the main target in NASA\u2019s still fuzzy return mission.",

      "A New Zealand court has rejected the latest bid by internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom to halt his deportation to the United States on charges related to his file-sharing website Megaupload",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- A New Zealand court has rejected the latest bid by internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom to halt his deportation to the United States on charges related to his file-sharing website Megaupload.",
      "Dotcom had asked the High Court to review the legality of an official\u2019s August 2024 decision that he should be surrendered to the U.S. to face trial on charges of copyright infringement, money laundering and racketeering. It was the latest chapter in a protracted 13-year battle by the U.S. government to extradite the Finnish-German millionaire from New Zealand.",
      "The Megaupload founder had applied for what in New Zealand is called a judicial review, in which a judge is asked to evaluate whether an official's decision was lawful.",
      "A judge on Wednesday dismissed Dotcom's arguments that the decision to deport him was politically motivated and that he would face grossly disproportionate treatment in the U.S. In a written ruling, Justice Christine Grice also rejected Dotcom's claim that New Zealand's police were wrong to charge his business partners, but not him, under domestic laws \u2014 which likely yielded laxer sentences than if the men had been tried in the U.S.",
      "The latest decision could be challenged in the Court of Appeal, where a deadline for filing is Oct. 8. It wasn't immediately clear if Dotcom would do so.",
      "One of his lawyers, Ron Mansfield, told Radio New Zealand that Dotcom's team had \"much fight left in us as we seek to secure a fair outcome,\u201d but didn't elaborate further. Neither Dotcom nor Mansfield responded to a request for comment from The Associated Press on Thursday.",
      "New Zealand\u2019s government hasn\u2019t disclosed what will happen next in the extradition process or divulged an expected timeline for Dotcom to be surrendered to the United States.",
      "The saga stretches back to the January 2012 arrest by New Zealand authorities of Dotcom in a dramatic raid on his Auckland mansion along with other company officers at the request of the FBI. U.S. prosecutors said Megaupload raked in at least $175 million, mainly from people who used the site to illegally download songs, television shows and movies, before the FBI shut it down earlier that year.",
      "Lawyers for Dotcom and the others arrested argued that it was the users of the site, founded in 2005, who chose to pirate material, not its founders. But prosecutors said the men were the architects of a vast criminal enterprise, with the Department of Justice describing it as the largest criminal copyright case in U.S. history.",
      "He has been free on bail in New Zealand since February 2012.",
      "Dotcom and his business partners fought the FBI's efforts to extradite them for years, including by challenging New Zealand law enforcement's actions during the investigation and arrests. In 2021, however, New Zealand\u2019s Supreme Court ruled that Dotcom and two other men could be surrendered.",

      "In exchange, U.S. efforts to extradite them were dropped. Part of Dotcom's latest legal bid challenged the police decision not to extend a plea deal under New Zealand laws to him too.",
      "Grice rejected that, saying the choice to only charge Ortmann and van der Kolk in New Zealand was \u201ca proper exercise of the Police's discretion.\u201d The jurist also dismissed Dotcom's claim that Goldsmith's extradition decision was politically motivated.",

      "Experts say a ship likely cut cables in the Red Sea, disrupting internet access in Africa, Asia and the Middle East",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- A ship likely cut cables in the Red Sea that disrupted internet access in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, experts said Tuesday, showing the lines' vulnerability over a year after another incident severed them.",
      "The International Cable Protection Committee told The Associated Press that 15 submarine cables pass through the narrow Bab el-Mandeb Strait, the southern mouth of the Red Sea that separates East Africa from the Arabian Peninsula.",
      "Over the weekend, authorities in multiple countries identified the cables affected as the South East Asia\u2013Middle East\u2013Western Europe 4, the India-Middle East-Western Europe and the FALCON GCX cables. On Tuesday, that list expanded to include the Europe India Gateway cable as well, said Doug Madory, director of internet analysis at the firm Kentik.",
      "Initial reporting suggested the cut happened off the coast of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, something authorities in the kingdom have not acknowledged, nor have the companies managing the cables.",
      "\u201cEarly independent analysis indicates that the probable cause of damage is commercial shipping activity in the region,\u201d John Wrottesley, the committee's operations manager, told the AP. \u201cDamage to submarine cables from dragged anchors account for approximately 30% of incidents each year representing around 60 faults.\u201d",
      "Madory also told the AP that the working assumption was a commercial vessel dropped its anchor and dragged it across the four cables, severing the connections. Cabling in the Red Sea can be at a shallow depth, making it easier for an anchor drag to affect them.",

      "However, rerouting traffic can cause latency, or lag, for internet users. Madory said it appeared at least 10 nations in Africa, Asia and the Middle East had been affected by the cable cut. Among those nations were India, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.",
      "\u201cNobody\u2019s completely offline, but each provider has lost a subset of their international transit,\u201d Madory said. \"So if you imagine this is like an equivalent to plumbing and you lose some volume of water coming down the pipes ... and now you just have less volumes to carry the traffic.\u201d",
      "Cable security also has been a concern amid attacks by Yemen's Houthi rebels on ships over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. In early 2024, Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government in exile alleged that the Houthis planned to attack undersea cables. Several later were cut, possibly by a ship attacked by the Houthis dragging its anchor, but the rebels denied being responsible.",

      "Nepal's crackdown on social media companies, which led to protests and police killing at least 19 people, is part of a yearslong decline of internet freedoms around the world as even democracies seek to curtail online speech.",
      "The Himalayan country\u2019s government said last week it was blocking several social media platforms including Facebook, X and YouTube because the companies failed to comply with a requirement that they register with the government. The ban was lifted Tuesday a day after the deadly protests.",
      "What's happening in Nepal mirrors \u201cthis broader pattern of controlling the narrative and controlling of stories emerging from the ground,\u201d said Aditya Vashistha, an assistant professor of information science at Cornell University. \u201cThis has happened several times in the neighboring countries India, Pakistan, Bangladesh. So this is nothing new \u2014 in fact, I would say this is taken from the playbook, which is now very established, of trying to control social media narratives.\u201d",
      "Like neighboring countries, Nepal's government have been asking the companies to appoint a liaison in the country. Officials are calling for laws to to monitor social media and ensure both the users and operators are responsible and accountable for what they share. But the move has been criticized as a tool for censorship and punishing opponents who voice their protests online.",
      "\u201cGovernments absolutely have a valid interest in seeking to regulate social media platforms. This is such a daily part of our lives and in our business. And it is certainly reasonable for authorities to sit down and say we want to develop rules for the road,\u201d said Kian Vesteinsson, senior research analyst for technology and democracy at the Washington-based nonprofit Freedom House.",
      "\u201cBut what we see in Nepal is that wholesale blocks as a means of enforcing a set of rules for social media companies results in wildly disproportionate harms. These measures that were put in place in Nepal (cut) tens of millions of people off from platforms that they used to express themselves, to conduct daily business, to speak with their families, to go to school, to get healthcare information.\u201d",
      "It's not just Nepal. Freedom House has found that global internet freedom has declined for the 14th consecutive year in 2024, as governments crack down on dissent and people face arrest for expressing political, social or religious views online. While China consistently tops the list as the \u201cworld's worst environment\u201d for internet freedom, last year Myanmar shared this designation as well. The organization did not track Nepal.",
      "India passed a telecommunications law in 2023 that gave its government \u201cbroad powers to restrict online communications and intercept communications,\" according to Freedom House. Three years earlier, a sweeping internet law put digital platforms like Facebook under direct government oversight. Officials say the rules are needed to quell misinformation and hate speech and to give users more power to flag objectionable content. But critics cautioned it would lead to censorship in a country where digital freedoms have already been shrinking.",
      "In January, meanwhile, Pakistan\u2019s lower house of parliament passed a bill that gives the government sweeping controls on social media, including sending users to prison for spreading disinformation.",
      "Calling internet freedom a \u201cpillar of modern democracy,\u201d Freedom House said a healthy 21st-century democracy cannot function without a trustworthy online environment, where people can access information and express themselves freely.",
      "Increasingly, though, governments are putting up roadblocks.",

      "Often, regulations are in the name of child safety, cyber crime or fraud, Vesteinsson said, \u201cbut unfortunately, a lot of this regulation comes hand in hand with restrictive measures.\u201d",
      "In the Nepali law, for instance, \u201cthe same provision of this law, directs social media platforms to restrict content relating to child trafficking and human trafficking and labor, a really important issue,\" he added. \"Two bullet points above that, it orders platforms to restrict people from posting anonymously.\u201d",
      "The Committee to Protect Journalists said Monday that the protests \u201cunderscore the widespread concerns over Nepal\u2019s ban on social media and the pressing need for the government to drop its order. Such a sweeping ban not only restricts freedom of expression, it also severely hinders journalists\u2019 work and the public\u2019s right to know.\u201d",
      "The crackdown appears to have spurred a surge in use of virtual private networks, or VPNs, according to Proton, which provides encrypted services. Signups for Proton\u2019s VPN service in Nepal have jumped by 8,000% since Sept. 3, according to data the company posted online. A VPN is a service that allows users to mask their location in order to circumvent censorship or geography-based online viewing restrictions.",
      "But experts caution that VPNs are not an end-all solution to government internet blocks. They can be expensive and out of reach for many people, Vashistha noted, and they can be slow and lead to lower-quality experiences when people try to access blocked social platforms.",
      "Google, Meta, X and TikTok (which registered and continues to operate) didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.",
      "Vesteinsson said companies can take important steps to safeguard privacy of their users \u2014 particularly human rights defenders and activists who might be a specific target for government repression in their countries.",

People are very angry and Nepal finds itself in a very precarious situation,\u201d said Prateek Pradhan, editor of Baahrakhari, a Nepalese independent news website.",
      "Demonstrations in Nepal have been called the protest of Gen Z, which generally refers to people born between 1995 and 2010. They were largely in response to the ban that went into effect last week and government\u2019s larger attempt to regulate social media through a bill that requires platforms to register and submit to local oversight and regulations.",
      "The bill, which has not yet been fully debated in parliament, has been widely criticized as a tool for censorship and punishing opponents who voice their protests online. Rights groups have called it an attempt by the government to curb freedom of expression and violate fundamental rights.",
      "At the same time, the protests were also a tipping point of a longstanding sentiment against politicians, their families and concerns over corruption.",
      "In the weeks before the ban, a social media campaign \u2014 particularly on video-sharing platform TikTok \u2014 spotlighted the lavish lifestyles of politicians\u2019 children, highlighting disparities between Nepal\u2019s rich and poor. Protesters criticized them of flaunting their luxury possessions in a country where the per capita income is $1,400 a year.",
      "Widespread criticism over government\u2019s failure to pursue some major corruption cases and create more economic opportunities for the youth also added to the anger. The youth unemployment rate in Nepal was 20% last year, according to the World Bank.",
      "\u201cAll these issues have made the youth of Nepal dissatisfied. They saw no other option but to take to the streets,\u201d said Pradhan.",
      "The unrest is the worst in decades in the Himalayan nation that is wedged between India and China. It is also far violent than the one in 2006, when an uprising forced Nepal\u2019s former king to give up his authoritarian rule. At least 18 people were killed in the violence. Two years later the parliament voted to abolish the monarchy.",
      "Over the years, many Nepalis have grown frustrated with the republic, saying it has failed to bring about political stability.",

      "Authorities identified Kirk's alleged shooter as 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, who now remains in custody. Charges are expected to be formally filed on Tuesday, Cox said.",

Everybody gets that, I think, and we have choices and we in my political philosophy and my, and my religious philosophy, we believe in agency, that every one of us gets to make our own decisions ... Every one of us has to make a decision. Are we going to hate our neighbor? Are we going to hate the other side? Are we going to return violence with violence? Or are we going to find a different path? Are we going to get out of those social media, those dark places of the internet where the conflict entrepreneurs reside, who are praying upon us, these, these companies with trillion dollar market caps who are using dopamine just like fentanyl, to addict us to their product and, and lead us again -- those algorithms -- lead us to more outrage. Can we put that aside? Can we go and serve our fellow human beings? Can we do some good in our neighborhood? Can we hug a family member? Can we talk to a neighbor that we disagree with?

      "But it's wrong to resort to violence and killing. And I think that's a message we need to reemphasize in this age when sometimes there's to many conflicting messages out there. We need to speak unequivocally, celebrate our differences. They should lead to discussion, not violence.",

      "And I think a number of things have come along. I don't think COVID helped. I think -- we have to look really hard. I mentioned social media before. I think we have to look really hard at what's just occupying nearly 100% of brain weight of not just the youth, but of all generations, and what's coming across, and actually what we're allowing to come across, and there's just zero liability for what people are putting out there. And I just think that's if we're going to fix this, we have to look really hard at that.",

      "Some would-be international students are not showing up on American campuses this fall despite offers of admission because of logjams with visa applications, which the Trump administration slowed this summer while it rolled out additional vetting. Others have had second thoughts because of the administration's wider immigration crackdown and the abrupt termination of some students' legal status.",
      "But none face bigger obstacles than the students hit with travel bans. Last year, the State Department issued more than 5,700 F-1 and J-1 visas \u2014 which are used by foreign students and researchers \u2014 to people in the 19 travel ban-affected countries between May and September. Citizens of Iran and Myanmar were issued more than half of the approved visas.",
      "Pouya Karami, a 17-year-old student from Shiraz, Iran, focused his college search entirely on the U.S. No other country offers the same research opportunities in science, he said. He was planning to study polymer chemistry this fall at Pittsburg State University in Kansas, but he had to shelve those plans because of the travel ban.",
      "Karami deferred admission until next year and is holding out hope. He is still preparing for his embassy interview and reaching out to U.S. politicians to reconsider the travel ban's restrictions on students.",
      "\u201cI'm doing everything I can about it,\u201d he said.",
      "The full travel ban affects citizens from 12 countries spanning Africa, Asia, the Middle East and the Caribbean. It blocks most people from obtaining new visas, although some citizens from the banned countries are exempt, such as green card holders, dual citizens and some athletes. Seven other countries have tighter restrictions that also apply to student visas.",
      "When Trump announced the travel ban in June, he cited high visa overstay rates and national security threats from unstable or adversarial foreign governments as reasons for putting countries on the list. He has called some of the countries\u2019 screening processes \u201cdeficient\u201d and said he plans to keep the ban in place until \u201cidentified inadequacies\u201d are addressed.",
      "In Myanmar, the family of one 18-year-old student made his education their top priority, saving paychecks for him to go abroad for college.

      "When he shared a screenshot of his acceptance letter to the University of South Florida in a family group chat, it exploded with celebratory emojis, Gu Gu said. He had been waiting for visa appointments to be announced when one night, his mother woke him to ask about news of a U.S. travel ban. In an instant, his plans to study at USF this fall were ruined.",
      "Many students his age in Myanmar have been drafted into the military or joined resistance groups since the military ousted the elected civilian government in 2021. While a civil war rages, he had been looking forward to simple freedoms in the U.S. like walking to school by himself or playing sports again.",

      "From the moment conservative icon Charlie Kirk was felled by an assassin\u2019s bullet, partisans have fought over who\u2019s to blame for his death",
      "DENVER -- From the moment conservative activist and icon Charlie Kirk was felled by an assassin\u2019s bullet, partisans began fighting over which side was to blame. President Donald Trump became the most prominent to do so, tying the attack to \u201cthe radical left\u201d before a suspect was even identified.",
      "It was part of a new, grim tradition in a polarized country \u2014 trying to pin immediate responsibility for an act of public violence on one of two political sides. As the nation reels from a wave of physical attacks against both Republicans and Democrats, experts warn that the rush to blame sometimes ambiguous and irrational acts on political movements could lead to more conflict.",
      "\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing now is exactly how the spiral of violence occurs,\u201d said Robert Pape, a political scientist and director of the Chicago Project on Security and Threats at the University of Chicago.",
      "On Friday, authorities announced they had arrested 22-year-old Tyler Robinson of Washington, Utah, in the shooting. While a registered voter, he was not affiliated with any party and had not voted in the last two general elections. Even so, officials said Robinson had recently grown more political and expressed negative views about Kirk.",
      "There was other initial evidence of Robinson's potential influences. According to court papers, he carved taunting phrases into his ammunition \u2014 including one bullet casing marked with \u201cHey, fascist! Catch!\u201d \u2014 and others from the irony-laden world of memes and online video games.",
      "Experts say political assassins don\u2019t always fall into neatly sorted partisan categories. In some cases, like that of Thomas Mathew Crooks, who shot Trump at a Pennsylvania campaign rally last year, there is little record of any political stances whatsoever. The FBI has said Crooks also had researched then-President Joe Biden as a possible attack target.",
      "Bruce Hoffman, who studies terrorism at Georgetown University, noted that the FBI has created a new category, Nihilistic Violent Extremism, to track the increasing number of attacks that seem to have no clear political motivation.",
      "\u201cExtremism is becoming a salad bowl of ideologies where you can pick whatever you want,\u201d Hoffman said, adding that the increasing number of lone wolf attacks means violence is increasingly unmoored from organizations with clear political goals.",
      "What\u2019s more important than the attackers\u2019 state of mind, experts stressed, is the broader political environment. The more heated the atmosphere, the more likely it\u2019ll lead unstable people to commit violence.",
      "\u201cWhat they all share is a political ecosystem that\u2019s very permissive about violence towards political rivals,\u201d Arie Perlinger, a professor of security studies at the University of Massachusetts-Lowell, said of recent perpetrators of political violence. \u201cBecause politicians are incentivized to use extreme rhetoric and extreme language, that leads to demonization of political rivals.\u201d",
      "That certainly happened after the Kirk killing. The 31-year-old father of two young children was an icon on the new, populist right, especially among young conservatives, and a key ally of Trump. While some conservatives called for calm, others, such as conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and podcaster and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, called for \u201cwar.\u201d",
      "In a speech on the House floor on Thursday, Rep. Mary Miller, an Illinois Republican, said Kirk\u2019s \u201cdeath was not an isolated tragedy. It is part of a disturbing trend in political violence in our country, encouraged by the radical left and amplified by a corrupt media that has gone from being fake to totally evil.\u201d",
      "Many prominent Democrats issued statements urging calm on both sides. Among them were California Gov. Gavin Newsom and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose husband was gravely injured by a hammer-wielding attacker who broke into their house in 2022 in an assault that Trump, among other Republicans, mocked.",

      "Hoffman said that in modern history, the right has been responsible for more political attacks on people than the left. He said that\u2019s because left-wing radicals are more likely to target property rather than people, and because the extreme right boasts organizations such as militias.",
      "He added that after Trump pardoned more than 1,500 people convicted of crimes during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol to overturn his election loss, \u201cthere\u2019s a belief in certain quarters that, if you engage in violence, the slate can be wiped clean.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s no question there\u2019s also been political violence from the left. In 2017, a 66-year-old man who had supported leftist causes opened fire at a congressional Republican baseball practice, critically wounding Rep. Steve Scalise, who eventually recovered.",

      "BACKSTORY: Trump spent weeks talking up renaming the Defense Department, saying that, back when the U.S. had a War Department, it \u201cjust sounded better.\u201d The War Department was created by George Washington in 1789, but abolished as part of the National Security Act of 1947, which created the National Military Establishment instead. Two years later, Congress amended that and changed the name to the Department of Defense. Trump recently sought to change the name himself via an executive order. Lawmakers will still need to approve making that permanent and official, however.",
      "WHERE IT STANDS: Still talking about it.",
      "BACKSTORY: Trump posted in August about a list of people he helped choose for the center\u2019s annual awards: \u201cGREAT Nominees for the TRUMP/KENNEDY CENTER, whoops, I mean, KENNEDY CENTER, AWARDS.\u201d He subsequently said, during an Oval Office event, \u201cSome people refer to it as the Trump Kennedy Center, but we\u2019re not prepared to do that quite yet. Maybe in a week or so.\u201d A GOP-backed congressional effort would rename the center after Trump and its opera house after first lady Melania Trump. But a full renaming may ultimately prove more likely than Trump\u2019s name simply being added to the existing building alongside Kennedy. The 1964 act that renamed the National Cultural Center in Washington in honor of John F. Kennedy stated that, after Dec. 2, 1983, \u201cno additional memorials or plaques in the nature of memorials shall be designated or installed\u201d \u2014 which would seemingly bar just tacking \u201cTrump\u201d up beside the existing namesake in the center's public spaces.",
      "WHERE IT STANDS: Faded away.",
      "BACKSTORY: Trump has been on all sides of the issue. He posted before retaking the White House that the GOP would work to eliminate daylight saving time. In March, he said that setting clocks back and forward was a 50-50 issue, and was therefore too hard for him to take a firm position on. The following month, the president posted online that he actually supported making daylight saving time permanent. The Senate passed a measure do just that in 2022, but it stalled in the House. Legislation reviving that effort has been introduced, but not advanced.",

But that made his sudden announcement in July that Coca-Cola had agreed to use real cane sugar in its flagship product in the U.S. all the more surprising. The company soon confirmed that such a version was indeed coming, but would be a new product added to the company's line \u2014 not a change encompassing all domestic Cokes. Still, the promised change is notable given that U.S. Coke had been sweetened with high fructose corn syrup since the 1980s, even as Coke from Mexico and some other countries continued to use cane sugar. \u201cThis will be a very good move,\u201d Trump said. \"You\u2019ll see.

      "BACKGROUND: While threatening to impose steep tariffs on U.S. trading partners around the globe, Trump said in April that such import tariffs \"will be enough to cut all of the income tax.\u201d The president has since championed passage of the sweeping tax legislation. It included around $4.5 trillion in tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the rich, but fell well short of wiping out federal income taxes entirely. That hasn\u2019t stopped Trump from continuing to assert that the country was its wealthiest near the end of the Gilded Age, when the government relied heavily on tariffs for revenue and there was no federal income tax. Still, he's lately been less quick to suggest the U.S. is on its way back to such policies.",
      "WHERE IT STANDS: Still talking about it \u2014 but misstating what happened.",
      "BACKGROUND: Trump and top administration officials have repeatedly suggested that the tax package approved by Congress wipes out taxes paid on Social Security benefits. But it doesn\u2019t. The law has a temporary tax deduction for people 65 and older that applies to all income, not just Social Security. And not all Social Security beneficiaries can claim it. Indeed, Republicans used a congressional process known as budget reconciliation to pass the measure without the 60-vote threshold normally needed to block a filibuster from opponents \u2014 and the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 restricts budget reconciliation bills from making major changes to Social Security.",

Despite that hype, there has been no major effort by the administration to overhaul the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program, which Congress created in 1990 to offer U.S. visas to investors who spend about $1 million on a company that employs at least 10 people.",

But the order gave no deadline for when such policy recommendations need to be completed and what might happen once they are ready is even murkier.",
      "WHERE IT STANDS: Still talking about it.",
      "BACKGROUND: Even though Trump boasted while still a candidate that he\u2019d could end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine in 24 hours, fighting rages on. The president undermined international efforts to isolate Vladimir Putin by hosting him in Alaska on Aug. 15, yet came away with no agreement to ease fighting \u2014 and has since been unable to broker a promised meeting between Russia\u2019s leader and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. In the meantime, Trump's face-to-face with Putin appears to have bought Moscow breathing room, since major economic sanctions that Trump had threatened against Russia haven't materialized. Trump has continued to say since that he's frustrated with Putin while insisting there may still be \u201csevere consequences\u201d if Russia doesn\u2019t begin showing it\u2019s serious about peace. But, so far, it's been lots of threats without follow through.",

      "High school and college educators say that student use of artificial intelligence has become so widespread that they need to rethink how to assign and assess students",
      "The book report is now a thing of the past. Take-home tests and essays are becoming obsolete.",
      "High school and college educators around the country say student use of artificial intelligence has become so prevalent that to assign writing outside of the classroom is like asking students to cheat.",
      "\u201cThe cheating is off the charts. It\u2019s the worst I\u2019ve seen in my entire career,\u201d says Casey Cuny, who has taught English for 23 years. Educators are no longer wondering if students will outsource schoolwork to AI chatbots. \u201cAnything you send home, you have to assume is being AI\u2019ed.\u201d",
      "The question now is how schools can adapt, because many of the teaching and assessment tools that have been used for generations are no longer effective. As AI technology rapidly improves and becomes more entwined with daily life, it is transforming how students learn and study, how teachers teach, and it\u2019s creating new confusion over what constitutes academic dishonesty.",
      "\u201cWe have to ask ourselves, what is cheating?\u201d says Cuny, a 2024 recipient of California\u2019s Teacher of the Year award. \u201cBecause I think the lines are getting blurred.\u201d",
      "Cuny\u2019s students at Valencia High School in southern California now do most writing in class. He monitors student laptop screens from his desktop, using software that lets him \u201clock down\u201d their screens or block access to certain sites. He\u2019s also integrating AI into his lessons and teaching students how to use AI as a study aid \u201cto get kids learning with AI instead of cheating with AI.\u201d",
      "In rural Oregon, high school teacher Kelly Gibson has made a similar shift to in-class writing. She is also incorporating more verbal assessments to have students talk through their understanding of assigned reading.",
      "\u201cI used to give a writing prompt and say, \u2018In two weeks I want a five-paragraph essay,\u2019\u201d says Gibson. \u201cThese days, I can\u2019t do that. That\u2019s almost begging teenagers to cheat.\u201d",
      "Take, for example, a once typical high school English assignment: Write an essay that explains the relevance of social class in \u201cThe Great Gatsby.\u201d Many students say their first instinct is now to ask ChatGPT for help \u201cbrainstorming.\u201d Within seconds, ChatGPT yields a list of essay ideas, plus examples and quotes to back them up. The chatbot ends by asking if it can do more: \u201cWould you like help writing any part of the essay? I can help you draft an introduction or outline a paragraph!\u201d",
      "Students say they often turn to AI with good intentions for things like research, editing or help reading difficult texts. But AI offers unprecedented temptation and it\u2019s sometimes hard to know where to draw the line.",
      "College sophomore Lily Brown, a psychology major at an East Coast liberal arts school, relies on ChatGPT to help outline essays because she struggles putting the pieces together herself. ChatGPT also helped her through a freshman philosophy class, where assigned reading \u201cfelt like a different language\u201d until she read AI summaries of the texts.",
      "\u201cSometimes I feel bad using ChatGPT to summarize reading, because I wonder is this cheating? Is helping me form outlines cheating? If I write an essay in my own words and ask how to improve it, or when it starts to edit my essay, is that cheating?\u201d",
      "Her class syllabi say things like: \u201cDon\u2019t use AI to write essays and to form thoughts,\u201d she says, but that leaves a lot of grey area. Students say they often shy away from asking teachers for clarity because admitting to any AI use could flag them as a cheater.",
      "Schools tend to leave AI policies to teachers, which often means that rules vary widely within the same school. Some educators, for example, welcome the use of Grammarly.com, an AI-powered writing assistant, to check grammar. Others forbid it, noting the tool also offers to rewrite sentences.",
      "\u201cWhether you can use AI or not, depends on each classroom. That can get confusing,\u201d says Valencia 11th grader Jolie Lahey, who credits Cuny with teaching her sophomore English class a variety of AI skills like how to upload study guides to ChatGPT and have the chatbot quiz them and then explain problems they got wrong.",
      "But this year, her teachers have strict \u201cNo AI\u201d policies. \u201cIt\u2019s such a helpful tool. And if we\u2019re not allowed to use it that just doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Lahey says. \u201cIt feels outdated.\u201d",

      "Many schools initially banned use of AI after ChatGPT launched in late 2022. But views on the role of artificial intelligence in education have shifted dramatically. The term \u201cAI literacy\u201d has become a buzzword of the back-to-school season, with a focus on how to balance the strengths of AI with its risks and challenges.",
      "Over the summer, several colleges and universities convened their AI task forces to draft more detailed guidelines or provide faculty with new instructions.",
      "The University of California, Berkeley emailed all faculty new AI guidance that instructs them to \u201cinclude a clear statement on their syllabus about course expectations\u201d around AI use. The guidance offered language for three sample syllabus statements \u2014 for courses that require AI, ban AI in and out of class, or allow some AI use.",
      "\u201cIn the absence of such a statement, students may be more likely to use these technologies inappropriately,\u201d the email said, stressing that AI is \u201ccreating new confusion about what might constitute legitimate methods for completing student work.\u201d",
      "At Carnegie Mellon University there has been a huge uptick in academic responsibility violations due to AI but often students aren\u2019t aware they\u2019ve done anything wrong, says Rebekah Fitzsimmons, chair of the AI faculty advising committee at the university\u2019s Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy.",
      "For example, one English language learner wrote an assignment in his native language and used DeepL, an AI-powered translation tool, to translate his work to English but didn\u2019t realize the platform also altered his language, which was flagged by an AI detector.",
      "Enforcing academic integrity policies has been complicated by AI, which is hard to detect and even harder to prove, said Fitzsimmons. Faculty are allowed flexibility when they believe a student has unintentionally crossed a line but are now more hesitant to point out violations because they don't want to accuse students unfairly, and students are worried that if they are falsely accused there is no way to prove their innocence.",
      "Over the summer, Fitzsimmons helped draft detailed new guidelines for students and faculty that strive to create more clarity. Faculty have been told that a blanket ban on AI \u201cis not a viable policy\u201d unless instructors make changes to the way they teach and assess students. A lot of faculty are doing away with take-home exams. Some have returned to pen and paper tests in class, she said, and others have moved to \u201cflipped classrooms,\u201d where homework is done in class.",

      "\u201cTo expect an 18-year-old to exercise great discipline is unreasonable, that\u2019s why it\u2019s up to instructors to put up guardrails.\u201d",

      "ATLANTA -- A judge has rejected an attempt by the state of Georgia and a local development agency to force people who unsuccessfully sued to block an electric vehicle plant to pay the government's legal fees.",
      "State government and the development authority demanded that six Morgan County property owners who challenged the zoning for Rivian Automotive pay more than $337,000 in legal fees incurred by the government.",
      "Morgan County Superior Court Judge Stephen Bradley, in a ruling filed Friday, said that the two lawsuits where the government agencies were seeking fees were far from frivolous, and that awarding legal fees to the government could make it harder for regular citizens to exercise their rights to challenge government actions in court.",
      "\u201cNo truly aggrieved citizen should be prohibited from suing to test the legality or constitutionality of the government\u2019s claims, and any precedent that could allow political actions and costs to be offloaded to complaining litigants would be untenable,\" Bradley wrote.",

      "Some local residents oppose the plant, saying it is an inappropriate neighbor to farms and will ruin residents' drinking-water well in a rural area on eastern edge of Atlanta's suburban frontier. The property's previous owner, a joint development authority that includes the governments of Jasper, Morgan, Newton and Walton counties, transferred ownership of the land to the state. That extinguished what could have been a contentious rezoning fight because state land is generally exempt from local zoning laws.",

      "After Koreans detained in a historic raid on a Georgia Hyundai plant were sent home, lawyers and social workers say the nearly 200 non-Korean workers ensnared in the crackdown remain in legal limbo",
      "Ever since a massive immigration raid on a Hyundai manufacturing site swept up nearly 500 workers in southeast Georgia, Rosie Harrison said her organization\u2019s phones have been ringing nonstop with panicked families in need of help.",
      "\u201cWe have individuals returning calls every day, but the list doesn\u2019t end,\u201d Harrison said. She runs an apolitical non-profit called Grow Initiative that connects low-income families \u2014 immigrant and non-immigrant alike \u2014 with food, housing and educational resources.",
      "Since the raid, Harrison said, \u201cfamilies are experiencing a new level of crisis.\u201d",
      "A majority of the 475 people who were detained in the workplace raid \u2014 which U.S. officials have called the largest in two decades \u2014 were Korean and have returned to South Korea. But lawyers and social workers say many of the non-Korean immigrants ensnared in the crackdown remain in legal limbo or are otherwise unaccounted for.",
      "As the raid began the morning of Sept. 4, workers almost immediately started calling Migrant Equity Southeast, a local nonprofit that connects immigrants with legal and financial resources. The small organization of approximately 15 employees fielded calls regarding people from Mexico, Guatemala, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador and Venezuela, spokesperson Vanessa Contreras said.",
      "Throughout the day, people described federal agents taking cellphones from workers and putting them in long lines, Contreras said. Some workers hid for hours to avoid capture, in air ducts or remote areas of the sprawling property. The Department of Justice said some hid in a nearby sewage pond.",
      "People off-site called the organization frantically seeking the whereabouts of loved ones who worked at the plant and were suddenly unreachable.",
      "Like many of the Koreans who were working at the plant, advocates and lawyers representing the non-Korean workers caught up in the raid say that some who were detained had legal authorization to work in the United States.",
      "Neither the Department of Homeland Security nor Immigration and Customs Enforcement responded to emailed requests for comment Friday. It is not clear how many people detained during the raid remain in custody.",
      "Atlanta-based attorney Charles Kuck, who represents both Korean and non-Korean workers who were detained, said two of his clients were legally working under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which was created by former President Barack Obama. One had been released and \u201cshould have never been arrested,\u201d he said, while the other was still being held because he was recently charged with driving under the influence.",

      "The financial impact of the raid at the construction site for a battery factory that will be operated by HL-GA Battery Co. was compounded by the fact that another massive employer in the area \u2014 International Paper Co. \u2014 is closing at the end of the month, laying off another 800 workers, Harrison said.",
      "Growth Initiative doesn\u2019t check immigration status, Harrison said, but almost all families who have reached out to her have said that their detained loved ones had legal authorization to work in the United States, leaving many confused about why their relative was taken into custody in the first place.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday proposed doing away with a program that has required large, mostly industrial polluters to report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions to the government.",
      "The program requires refineries, power plants, oil wells and landfills to report their emissions without risk of penalty as officials seek to identify high-polluting facilities and develop policies to lower emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Experts say the reporting held the companies publicly accountable for their emissions.",
      "Since the program began in 2009, U.S. industry has collectively reported a 20% drop in carbon emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal-fired power plants.",
      "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program \u201cburdensome\u201d and unhelpful to improving human health and the environment.",
      "Removing the rule would save American businesses up to $2.4 billion in regulatory costs over 10 years while maintaining the agency\u2019s statutory obligations under the Clean Air Act, Zeldin said. If finalized, the proposal would remove reporting obligations for most large industrial facilities in the United States, as well as fuel and industrial gas suppliers and carbon dioxide injection sites.",
      "\u201cThe Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,\u201d Zeldin said in a statement.",
      "\u201cIt costs American businesses and manufacturing billions of dollars, driving up the cost of living, jeopardizing our nation\u2019s prosperity and hurting American communities,'' he said. \"With this proposal, we show once again that fulfilling EPA\u2019s statutory obligations and Powering the Great American Comeback is not a binary choice.''",
      "But experts say dropping the requirement \u2014 as Zeldin promised in March when he unleashed what he called the greatest day of deregulation in U.S. history \u2014 risks a big increase in emissions, since companies would no longer be publicly accountable for what they discharge into the air. And they say losing the data \u2014 at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere \u2014 would make it tougher to fight climate change.",
      "Joseph Goffman, who led EPA's Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden, said eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program \u201cblinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution.

      "David Doniger, a senior strategist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, called the proposal \u201ca cynical effort to keep the American public in the dark, because if they don\u2019t know who the polluters are, they can\u2019t do anything to hold them responsible.\"",
      "Big polluters may want to keep their climate pollution secret, he added, but the public, states and local policymakers \u201chave depended on this data\" for more than 15 years.

      "Some Nebraska lawmakers and residents say the Republican governor's plan to convert a prison into an immigration detention center has come with few details about the transition",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- No formal agreement has been signed to convert a remote state prison in Nebraska into the latest immigration detention center for President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping crackdown, more than three weeks since the governor announced the plan and as lawmakers and nearby residents grow increasingly skeptical.",
      "Corrections officials insist the facility could start housing hundreds of male detainees next month, with classrooms and other spaces at the McCook Work Ethic Camp retrofitted for beds. However, lawmakers briefed last week by state officials said they got few concrete answers about cost, staffing and oversight.",
      "\u201cThere was more unanswered questions than answered questions in terms of what they know,\u201d state Sen. Wendy DeBoer said.",
      "Officials in the city of McCook were caught off guard in mid-August when Republican Gov. Jim Pillen announced that the minimum-security prison in rural southwest Nebraska would serve as a Midwest hub for immigration detainees. Pillen and federal officials dubbed it the \u201cCornhusker Clink,\" in line with other alliterative detention centers such as \u201c Alligator Alcatraz \u201d in Florida and the \u201c Speedway Slammer \u201d in Indiana.",
      "\u201cCity leaders were given absolutely no choice in the matter,\u201d said Mike O\u2019Dell, publisher of the local newspaper, the McCook Gazette.",
      "McCook is the seat of Red Willow County where voters favored Trump in the 2024 election by nearly 80%. Most of them likely support the president's immigration crackdown, O'Dell said. However, the city of around 7,000 has also grown accustomed to the camp's low-level offenders working on roads, in parks, county and city offices and even local schools.",
      "\u201cPeople here have gotten to know them in many cases,\u201d O'Dell said. \u201cI think there is a feeling here that people want to know where these folks are going to end up and that they'll be OK.\u201d",
      "The Work Ethic Camp first opened in 2001 and currently houses around 155 inmates who participate in education, treatment and work programs to help them transition to life outside prison. State leaders often praise it as success story for reducing prisoner recidivism.",

The governor's office and state prison officials met with members of the Legislature's Judiciary Committee last week to answer questions about the transfer.",
      "What the lawmakers got, several said, were estimates and speculation.",

      "LA CANADA FLINTRIDGE, Calif. -- When sculptor Bobby Zokaites moved to Phoenix in the summer of 2011, walking the half mile to classes at Arizona State University in triple-digit heat felt risky. He learned to find shade along his route \u2014 resting in a stoplight's sliver of it, dodging the sizzling sun at each opportunity.",
      "\u201cIt was pretty crazy,\u201d he recalled.",
      "Those experiences influenced one of Zokaites' latest projects: He was one of nine artists commissioned this year to bring shade to the region.",
      "Across the U.S., cities are weaving art, science and community engagement to protect people from extreme heat and communicate its risks. As cities adapt to hotter temperatures, driven by human-caused climate change, and contend with urban heat, shade is playing a critical role. But communicating heat risks and safety can be challenging. That is where art comes in. It can engage, bring hope and even enhance how cool someone feels.",
      "Shade \u201ccan be much more than functional,\" said David Hondula, Phoenix\u2019s director of heat response and mitigation. \"It can enrich our public spaces.\"",
      "At one park in Phoenix, a large awning is held up with panels of dazzling colors. On them are painted whimsical creatures called \u201calebrijes\" from Mexican folk art, and the structure contains a solar-powered misting system. At another park, a canopy decorated with colorful drawings uses reflective paint and an ultraviolet-resistant canvas.",
      "These are part of Phoenix's temporary public art pieces created with help from locals. Each was unveiled during a community event featuring information about shade and heat safety, along with free cooling towels and sunscreen.",
      "\u201cThe more you know and the more you can recognize your own body\u2019s response, the better you can take care of yourself,\" said Carrie Brown, deputy director for the city's office of art and culture.",
      "These art installations are one element of the city's plan to expand shade. Studies show that shade significantly reduces air and surface temperature and how intensely people feel heat. In a city that has averaged in the last decade more than 115 days annually with day temperatures past 100 F (38 C), cooling shade can be lifesaving.",
      "Shade can feel even cooler when combined with beauty. One study in Phoenix, co-authored by Hondula, found that people rated aesthetically pleasing bus stops as being cooler than less beautiful ones. In another from Hong Kong, findings suggested that people had a higher heat tolerance when they perceived their environment as quiet and beautiful.",
      "In Cambridge, Massachusetts, a place accustomed to dreary winters but not heat, a project titled \u201c Shade is Social Justice \u201d is helping the city convey heat dangers and safety with creative designs. One installation features hanging flowers that open when temperatures hit 85 F (29 C), signaling to people to cool down with water and shade, said Claudia Zarazua, the city's art and cultural planning director.",

He measured temperature, humidity, wind and radiation, then estimated what could be happening to a person\u2019s body in both the shade and in direct sun light.",
      "He found that moving from sun to shade dropped the mean radiant temperature from about 145 F (63 C) to 88 F (about 31 C). The change did not significantly affect core temperature, but skin temperature decreased immediately. When MaRTy3D+ returned to the sun, skin temperature rose again.",
      "MaRTy 3D+'s ability to model and measure how different people thermoregulate is unique. It can tell researchers, for instance, the skin and core temperature as well as cardiac strain in someone who is elderly or on a specific medication, said Jennifer Vanos, an associate professor at ASU who studies heat\u2019s impacts on the human body and how to mitigate them. This technology allows them to collect real-time data in sometimes risky situations without impacting humans. They are using their findings to make recommendations to the city.",
      "Edith de Guzman, a cooperative extension researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles, has spent years researching how to increase shade in communities most impacted by heat. With colleagues, she has also quantified that shade can reduce up to 25% of heat-related deaths in LA and up to 66% of heat-related emergency room visits. When the opportunity emerged to curate an art exhibit about shade and who lacks access to it, she and her husband took it.",

      "A three-part installation by artist Leslie K. Gray invites visitors to consider the past, current and future experiences of public transportation users in the city. Each features a silhouetted woman waiting at a bus stop with either no shade, a little bit or ample amounts. The bus stop signs include facts about the dangers of heat, the benefits of shade and the disparate access to it.",

      "One photo \u2014 a Yazidi shrine \u2014 caught the eye of Penn doctoral student Marc Marin Webb in 2022, nearly a decade after it was destroyed by IS extremists plundering the region. Webb and others began scouring museum files and gathered almost 300 photos to create a visual archive of the Yazidi people, one of Iraq's oldest religious minorities.",
      "The systematic attacks, which the United Nations called a genocide, killed thousands of Yazidis and sent thousands more into exile or sexual slavery. It also destroyed much of their built heritage and cultural history, and the small community has since become splintered around the world.",
      "Ansam Basher, now a teacher in England, was overwhelmed with emotion when she saw the photos, particularly a batch from her grandparents' wedding day in the early 1930s.",
      "\u201cNo one would imagine that a person my age would lose their history because of the ISIS attack,\u201d said the 43-year-old, using an acronym for the extremist group. Basher's grandfather lived with her family while she was growing up in Bashiqa, a town outside Mosul. The city fell to IS in 2014.",
      "\u201cMy albums, my childhood photos, all videos, my two brothers' wedding videos (and) photos, disappeared. And now to see that my grandfather and great-grandfather\u2019s photo all of a sudden just come to life again, this is something I'm really happy about,\u201d she said. \u201cEverybody is.\u201d",
      "The archive documents Yazidi people, places and traditions that IS sought to erase. Marin Webb is working with Nathaniel Brunt, a Toronto documentarian, to share it with the community, both through exhibits in the region and in digital form with the Yazidi diaspora.",
      "\u201cWhen they came to Sinjar, they went around and destroyed all the religious and heritage sites, so these photographs in themselves present a very strong resistance against that act of destruction,\u201d said Brunt, a postdoctoral student at the University of Victoria Libraries. The city of Sinjar is the ancestral homeland of the Yazidis near the Syrian border.",
      "The first exhibits took place in the region in April, when Yazidis gather to celebrate the New Year. Some were held outdoors in the very areas the photos documented nearly a century earlier.",
      "\u201c(It) was perceived as a beautiful way to bring memory back, a memory that was directly threatened through the ethnic cleansing campaign,\u201d Marin Webb said.",
      "Basher\u2019s brother was visiting their hometown from Germany when he saw the exhibit and recognized his grandparents. That helped the researchers fill in some blanks.",
      "The wedding photos show an elaborately dressed bride as she stands anxiously in the doorway of her home, proceeds with her dowry to her husband\u2019s village, and finally enters his family home as a crowd looks on.",

      "Her grandfather, Bashir Sadiq Rashid al-Rashidani, came from a prominent family and often hosted the Penn archaeology crews at his cafe. He and his brother, like other local men, also worked on the excavations, prompting him to invite the westerners to his wedding. They in turn took the photos and even lent the couple a car for the occasion, the family said.",
      "Some of the photos were taken by Ephraim Avigdor Speiser, the Penn Museum archaeologist who led excavations at two ancient Mesopotamian sites in the area, Tepe Gawra and Tell Billa.",
      "\u201cMy grandfather used to talk a lot about that time,\u201d said Basher, who uses a different spelling of the family surname than other relatives.",
      "Her father, Mohsin Bashir Sadiq, 77, a retired teacher now living in Cologne, Germany, believes the wedding was the first time anyone in the town used a car, which he described as a 1927 model. It can be seen at the back of the wedding procession.",
      "Basher has shared the photos on social media to educate people about her homeland.",
      "\u201cThe idea or the picture they have in their mind about Iraq is so different from the reality, \u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been suffering a lot, but we still have some history.\u201d",
      "Other photos in the collection show people at home, at work, at religious gatherings.",
      "To Marin Webb, an architect from Barcelona, they show the Yazidis as they lived, instead of equating them with the violence they later endured. Locals who saw the exhibit told him it \u201cshows the world that we\u2019re also people.\u201d",
      "An isolated minority, the Yazidis have been persecuted for centuries. Many Muslim sects consider them infidels; many Iraqis falsely see them as worshippers of Satan. They speak Kurdish and their traditions are amalgamated, borrowing from Christianity, Islam and the ancient Persian religion of Zoroastrianism.",
      "Basher is grateful the photos remained safe \u2014 if largely out of sight \u2014 at the museum all this time. Alessandro Pezzati, the museum's senior archivist, was one of several people who helped Marin Webb comb through the files to identify them.",
      "\u201cA lot of these collections are sleeping until they get woken up by people like him,\u201d Pezzati said.",

    "story": [
      "Monet \u2026 Degas \u2026 Renoir. When we think of French Impressionism, it's the usual suspects who spring to mind. But one lesser-known artist is ripe for rediscovery.",
      "\"Gustave Caillebotte is probably the least-known of the Impressionist painters,\" said Gloria Groom, co-curator of a new exhibition of the works of Caillebotte, now on display at the Art Institute of Chicago. \"I think he's still not completely integrated into that story. He's still kind of the outsider.\"",
      "The museum has long been home to the artist's most recognizable painting, \"Paris Street - Rainy Day.\"",
      "\"People, they may not know Gustave Caillebotte's name, but if you say the painting with the umbrellas, they all know it,\" said Groom. \"And so you start thinking, okay, it's all about this bourgeois couple walking down the street. But it's not, because there's a painter with a ladder, the charwoman who's opening her umbrella, all these different types of people.\"",
      "\"Paris Street - Rainy Day\" played a supporting role in the beloved movie \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\". While it was out on loan, museum-goers were bereft. \"We got letters,\" said Groom. \"But you can't be part of an exhibition to be a partner if you don't lend the major work for the exhibition. So, we made that sacrifice. And now we're celebrating its return.\"",
      "The exhibition looks at Caillebotte's work from a new perspective. While his peers were painting ballerinas and landscapes, Caillebotte's canvases focused on men to a degree unusual for the time.",
      "Groom said, \"He's looking at the men in his life, he's looking at the relationships. But he's not just doing, you know, macho masculinity. He's doing men in interiors, men on sofas, men looking out a window, kind of turning the tables in many ways.\"",
      "Some of the paintings scandalized the French art establishment. \"The Floor Scrapers\" was rejected from a prestigious art exhibition.",
      "And, at another exhibition, a painting featuring a nude man was relegated to a small, inaccessible room. \"It's a male nude, but not an Adonis,\" said Groom. \"It's shocking even today. It's a beautiful, beautiful painting, and it's sensuous. Let's face it, it's sensuous!\"",
      "When this exhibition opened in Paris last year with the title \"Painting Men,\" some critics condemned what they considered the show's insinuation of Caillebotte's homosexuality. The artist never married, but shared the last decade or so of his life with a female companion.",
      "But the show moved on to Chicago with a new title \u2013 \"Painting His World\" \u2013 which has others saying the changed title minimizes the artist's focus on the same sex.",
      "Gloria Groom says, quite simply, the paintings speak for themselves: \"The paintings are the paintings, and that's what we're interested in. We try to open it up to all kinds of interpretations, and people will see what they want to see.\"",
      "Gustave Caillebotte died in 1894. He was just 45. All these decades later, people are still seeing what they want to in his beguiling artistry.",

    "summary": "The actor-comedian talks about his new horror film \"Him,\" in which he plays an aging football superstar tempting a rookie quarterback with an evil bargain, and how he learned to turn personal loss into dramatic power.",
    "story": [
      "Just a stone's throw from the concert halls of New York's Lincoln Center is another place where creative dreams come true: LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, a launching pad for the most talented teens in New York. Liza Minnelli studied here; so did Billy Dee Williams, Jennifer Aniston, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, and Adrien Brody. \"A two-time Oscar-winner, look at that!\" said Brody's former classmate, Marlon Wayans, Class of 1990. \"Makes me so proud. We used to give him wedgies!\"",
      "As an actor, writer and producer, Wayans is behind some of the best-loved projects in recent memory, like the \"Scary Movie\" franchise, a comic satire of horror films. There have been five \"Scary\" movies (some without the Wayans brothers), but they're back at the helm for the upcoming #6 next year.",
      "And when he's not making movies, Marlon Wayans tours on the live stand-up comedy circuit. He also turns out streaming comedy specials like clockwork. \"Probably a year that I had a day off,\" he said. \"Probably three years since I had a vacation.\"",
      "I asked, \"What are you chasing?\"",
      "\"I don't know if I'm chasing, or if I'm running from something!\" he laughed. And for his latest role, he had to do both.",
      "In the new psychological horror film \"Him,\" a rookie quarterback (played by Tyriq Withers) wants to be the greatest. Marlon Wayans is an aging football superstar who's going to help him. At first he's a likeable coach, but he morphs into a something evil.",
      "Is he the Devil in this film? \"No, I think I'm just one of the people that the Devil uses to entice the people who sell their soul,\" Wayans said.",
      "To watch a trailer for the film \"Him,\" click on the video player below:",
      "The notion of trading your soul for athletic immortality is one of the all-time great storylines. You might recall \"Damn Yankees,\" with a hopeful fan striking a deal with the Devil. And as the Devil's advocate in \"Him,\" Wayans' character puts the rookie quarterback through hell. \"The movie seems like, 'Oh, you're selling your soul to the Devil.' The Devil exists every day, everywhere,\" Wayans said. \"At least 20 times a day you are gonna be faced with God or the Devil. So, it's a choice. Everything you do is a choice.\"",
      "It's a big change for someone raised on comedy. Marlon Wayans is the youngest of 10 siblings, in the comedy dynasty known as the Wayans family. He often worked with his brothers, like when he teamed up with Shawn as an undercover FBI agent in the 2004 cult favorite \"White Chicks.\"",
      "Family is still the bedrock of Wayans' life, and the passing of some close relatives and friends over the past few years hit especially hard, as he described in his 2024 special \"Good Grief\":",
      "\"I've been dodging depression for the last three years. I lost my momma three years ago. And let me tell you y'all something, ain't no pain, ain't no nothing like losing your momma.\"",
      "I asked, \"Do you think losing all these people in such a short span of time, that pain, informs your acting?\"",
      "\"Yes, because I used to have to manufacture tears,\" Marlon said. \"My mother died ... it's all I gotta think about. It's right there. It's right behind my eyes. I don't need 20 minutes to go think about stuff no more.\"",
      "Wayans has learned how to turn personal loss into dramatic power. He was told he was the only one considered for his role in \"Him,\" a sign that his time may have finally come.",
      "He said, \"It took me doing the work for 53 years to feel special.\"",
      "\"You didn't feel special?\" I asked.",
      "\"I felt like I was working towards something.\"",
      "\"And now you feel like that something is here?\"",
      "\"I feel like it's never there, but it's getting closer,\" he replied.",
      "To date, Marlon Wayans' movies alone are said to have grossed nearly $2 billion, and there are more on the way. But he says he'll never forget LaGuardia, the unique school where it all started. \"I'll always love this city, and I'll always love this school. This is my baby for life. I hope these kids know how good they got it.\"",
      "He almost didn't get to go. His father didn't want him to attend. \"Nah, my dad, he was super-religious, and he was kind of a homophobe; he didn't want me wearing tights! 'Cause you have to wear tights when you come to this school.\"",
      "The late LaGuardia drama teacher Peter Treitler gave him permission to wear sweatpants instead, a little thing that changed Marlon's life forever.",
      "Mr. Treitler's words are still alive in Marlon's heart: \"He said, 'I'll make a deal with you: If you go to this school, you work harder than anybody else here, and you be special.' Young people need people that believe in them and see they're great. But young people gotta do the work so they can see they're great.\"",
      "\"Well, that's the thing, is you took that and ran with it,\" I said.",
      "Wayans replied, \"I'm still running with it.\"",

    "summary": "Veronica Swanson Beard and Veronica Miele Beard met at a wedding. Years later, they're the heads of a landmark fashion brand.",
    "story": [
      "In the bustling heart of Manhattan, the women behind the luxury fashion label Veronica Beard are running a brand that has become synonymous with modern American style. And in a twist of fate, they share more than just their company; they share a name.",
      "Veronica Swanson Beard and Veronica Miele Beard first met at a wedding, where they were seated next to each other. That day, Swanson Beard made two important connections.",
      "\"I met my husband and my work wife all at that wedding,\" she told CBS Saturday Morning with a laugh.",
      "Their their lives began on opposite coasts: Miele Beard grew up in North Caldwell, New Jersey, raised by a single mother, while Swanson Beard was raised in California as an heir to the Swanson frozen-food fortune. The two became sisters-in-law when they married brothers. As their families grew, so did their careers. Swanson Beard pursued fashion, while Miele Beard thrived in finance. What the women shared was a passion for style.",
      "\"Since I was four years old, that's been my dream,\" said Swanson Beard. \"Fashion was the greatest expression of yourself. You could wake up and be whoever you wanted to be.\"",
      "For Miele Beard, even on Wall Street, what she wore was a statement of confidence and authority in a male-dominated environment.",
      "But when it came to dressing for work, both women noticed something missing: a staple piece that could anchor a modern woman's wardrobe. Their answer was inspired by history. In the 1840s, detachable shirtfronts known as \"dickeys\" gave men the appearance of a full shirt beneath their waistcoat without the bulk. Reimagining that idea, the duo designed a tailored blazer with an interchangeable insert.",
      "In 2010, their namesake label, Veronica Beard, was born, along with its now-iconic Dickey Jacket. The early days were anything but glamorous. Swanson Beard set up a makeshift showroom in her apartment, juggling young children and a dog, while Miele Beard announced mid-launch that she was pregnant with her fifth child. Between the two, they had eight children and a fledgling business.",
      "Their breakthrough came with Saks Fifth Avenue, which gave the brand its first major retail platform. From there, Veronica Beard rapidly grew, and today boasts 42 stores worldwide, including a flagship location on Madison Avenue in New York City.",
      "\"It was the most thrilling moment of our career,\" Swanson Beard said of the store opening. \"It was the physical manifestation of all of our hopes and dreams.\"",
      "Fifteen years later, the brand has evolved into a full lifestyle label, offering ready-to-wear, denim, shoes, and handbags, while still promoting the power of a great blazer.",
      "\"We love the idea of the uniform being your blazer with jeans,\" said Miele Beard. \"Get your best pair of jeans, throw on a white tank and a jacket, and you're done. You've just elevated your style.\"",
      "The Dickey Jacket remains the brand's signature piece. When Gwyneth Paltrow featured it on Goop, the Beards knew they had made it.",
      "\"For us, that was like being on Oprah's list,\" Swanson Beard said.",
      "Beyond fashion, the duo is committed to giving back. Their philanthropic initiative, Veronica Beard Gives Back, supports causes including Feeding America, the American Heart Association, and the Council of Fashion Designers of America.",
      "Their mission resonates with the women who choose their clothes. Recently, Katherine, Princess of Wales wore a Veronica Beard dress to announce she had completed her cancer treatment.",
      "\"She could have chosen a power suit to say, 'I'm strong,'\" said Swanson Beard. \"Instead, she chose something feminine and earthy. I was so emotional about it.\"",
      "At its heart, Veronica Beard is more than a label; it's a mantra.",
      "\"We always say our battle cry is 'make it happen,'\" Swanson Beard explained. \"For us, being the clothes on a woman's back when she's making it happen is the greatest thing in the world.\"",

    "summary": "The Trump administration wants an appeals court to lift a ruling that blocked President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook before an interest rate meeting next week.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration asked a federal appeals court Thursday to lift a ruling that blocked President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, in time for a crucial meeting next week when Fed officials will decide whether to lower interest rates.",
      "Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook from the Federal Reserve's powerful Board of Governors last month, accusing her of falsely claiming two different homes as her principal residence in mortgage documents. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb blocked the firing on Tuesday, concluding that the president \"has not stated a legally permissible cause for Cook's removal.\" Under federal law, Fed board members serve for 14-year terms and can only be removed \"for cause.\"",
      "On Thursday, the Trump administration asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to stay that ruling while the government appeals it. The Justice Department argued that the president has broad discretion to remove federal officials, including to decide whether \"cause\" exists, and courts have \u2014 at most \u2014 extremely narrow authority to review those decisions.",
      "\"Here, the evidence\u2014which Cook has yet to offer contrary explanation for\u2014was that she applied for two loans for her personal benefit, and was able to obtain favorable interest rates by misrepresenting where she lived,\" the government argued Thursday. \"Regardless of whether that misconduct occurred before or during office, it indisputably calls into question Cook's trustworthiness and whether she can be a responsible steward of the interest rates and economy for the whole Nation.\"",
      "Those allegations surfaced in a letter from Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee who cited mortgage papers for homes that Cook bought in Georgia and Michigan in 2021. Abbe Lowell, an attorney representing Cook, called the government's accusations \"unsubstantiated and vague.\"",
      "The government requested that the appeals court act by the end of the day on Monday, noting that the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, is set to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday.",
      "Cook's attorneys asked the appellate court to deny the Trump administration's request, calling it \"wholly unwarranted.\"",
      "\"An administrative stay would threaten Governor Cook's participation in next week's meeting and potentially plunge the FOMC's vote into turmoil,\" Cook's attorneys wrote in court papers. \"In addition, it has the real potential of impacting domestic and foreign markets. The Government has provided no justification for such a grave disruption of the status quo.\"",
      "The appeals court directed the government to reply to Cook's filing by Sunday at 3 p.m., making a ruling before then unlikely.",
      "Why does the Fed committee matter?",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee \u2014 which includes Cook, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and 10 other top central bank officials \u2014 is responsible for setting the Fed's interest rate targets, which have a major impact on economic growth, inflation and borrowing costs. The panel typically acts independently, with little input from elected officials.",
      "The committee has voted to leave interest rates relatively high so far this year, but investors and economists widely expect it to reduce rates at next week's meeting. Rate cuts could lead to stronger economic growth, but at the risk of causing inflation to heat up.",
      "Mr. Trump has tangled with the Fed for months over its decision to keep rates steady, nicknaming Powell \"Mr. Too Late\" and arguing the rate-setting committee should overrule him. Powell's term ends in May.",
      "Amid that pressure, Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook in late August. A Biden appointee, Cook's term on the Fed's seven-member Board of Governors is set to end in 2038. The allegations against Cook are not related to Mr. Trump's push against the Fed, but if she is removed from the board, the president could pick her replacement, giving him more influence over the central bank.",

      "Tariff policies are top of mind for many Americans, too, she said, noting that about 60% of consumers raised the topic in interviews.",
      "Inflation expectations for the year remained steady at 4.8%. Consumers' long-run inflation expectations, however, rose for a second straight month to 3.9% in September, according to the survey, as consumers become aware of \"what tariffs mean for them,\" High Frequency Economics analysts said in a research note.",
      "A separate U. of Michigan report on trade policy and consumer spending found that most U.S. adults plan to spend less on goods that are subject to tariff-related price hikes. Just 24% of consumers surveyed said they expected to spend as usual on items that have large price increases, according to the August report.",
      "\"The corrosive uncertainty surrounding tariffs, other economic policies and immigration, continues to weigh on consumer sentiment, High Frequency Economics analysts said in a research note. \"Rising consumer prices and the reality of the consequences of tariffs are just starting to be felt by consumers. They are saying, 'Ouch!'\"",

Heavily imported goods saw some of the steepest price hikes last month, the data show. The increase represents the fastest rate of inflation since January, when Mr. Trump was inaugurated for his second term.",
      "Although the tariffs were first announced in April on what Mr. Trump called \"Liberation Day,\" their implementation was largely delayed as the administration negotiated new trade deals with multiple nations over the ensuing months. That gave U.S. companies time to prepare for the new import duties, which are paid by U.S. businesses directly to the federal government.",
      "Facing the prospect of sharply higher tariffs, some American companies scrambled to stock up on the imported goods and parts they use in their business, postponing the need to raise customer prices. Others absorbed the levies instead of passing them along to consumers.",
      "But many companies are now pulling back from those strategies, economic data shows. According to the Federal Reserve's latest \"Beige Book\" survey, which includes responses from businesses, economists and other sources, tariff-related price hikes were visible across the U.S. in August.",
      "Beth Hammack, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland,\u00a0recently told CBS News that some companies facing a hit to their profit margins have no choice but to start passing on tariff-related costs to consumers.",
      "Among the companies to say they are raising prices for some goods as tariffs take effect are\u00a0home improvement giant Home Depot, retailer Macy's and camera maker Nikon.",
      "\"The pass-through from tariffs is gradual because some businesses may have held on to a greater share of the costs and may have shared a greater burden of tariffs,\" said EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco. \"But there is a limit to how long and how much of that they can do \u2014 so there may be more of a push to pass those costs onto consumers.\"",

      "\"Since President Trump took office, CPI is tracking at a 2.3% annualized rate, consistent with low and stable inflation,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Leavitt also noted that data on producer prices out this week point to a decline in wholesale inflation. \"As the Trump economic agenda continues to take effect, the trillions of dollars in private sector and foreign investments, historic tax cuts, massive deregulation and energy dominance that the president is spearheading will fuel an economic boom,\" she added.",

      "Some economists think tariffs are likely to continue pushing inflation higher throughout the rest of the year, putting more financial pressure on families. As a result, many consumers will spend with more restraint, according to Daco.",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Trade Commission has started an inquiry into several social media and artificial intelligence companies, including OpenAI and Meta, about the potential harms to children and teenagers who use their chatbots as companions.",
      "On Thursday, the FTC said it has sent letters to Google parent Alphabet, Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms, Snap, Character Technologies, ChatGPT maker OpenAI and xAI.",
      "The FTC said it wants to understand what steps, if any, companies have taken to evaluate the safety of their chatbots when acting as companions, to limit the products' use by and potential negative effects on children and teens, and to apprise users and parents of the risks associated with the chatbots.",
      "The inquiry comes after OpenAI said it plans to make changes to ChatGPT safeguards for vulnerable people, including adding extra protections for those under 18 years old, after the parents of a teen boy who died by suicide in April sued, alleging the artificial intelligence chatbot led their teen to take his own life.",
      "More children are now using AI chatbots for everything \u2014 from homework help to personal advice, emotional support and everyday decision-making. That's despite research on the harms of chatbots, which have been shown to give kids dangerous advice about topics such as drugs, alcohol and eating disorders.",
      "\"As AI technologies evolve, it is important to consider the effects chatbots can have on children, while also ensuring that the United States maintains its role as a global leader in this new and exciting industry,\" said FTC Chairman Andrew N. Ferguson in a statement.",
      "He added, \"The study we're launching today will help us better understand how AI firms are developing their products and the steps they are taking to protect children.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Character.AI said it is looking forward to \"collaborating with the FTC on this inquiry and providing insight on the consumer AI industry and the space's rapidly evolving technology.\"",
      "Meta declined to comment on the FTC inquiry. The company has been working on making sure its AI chatbots are safe and age appropriate for children, a spokesperson said.",
      "OpenAI said that it's prioritizing \"making ChatGPT helpful and safe for everyone, and we know safety matters above all else when young people are involved. We recognize the FTC has open questions and concerns, and we're committed to engaging constructively and responding to them directly.\"",
      "In an email to CBS News, Snap said, \"We share the FTC's focus on ensuring the thoughtful development of generative AI, and look forward to working with the Commission on AI policy that bolsters U.S. innovation while protecting our community.\"",
      "Alphabet and xAI did not immediately respond to messages for comment.",
      "AI changes",
      "OpenAI and Meta earlier this month announced changes to how their chatbots respond to teenagers asking questions about suicide or showing signs of mental and emotional distress. OpenAI said it is rolling out new controls enabling parents to link their accounts to their teen's account.",
      "Parents can choose which features to disable and \"receive notifications when the system detects their teen is in a moment of acute distress,\" according to a company blog post that says the changes will go into effect this fall.",
      "Regardless of a user's age, the company says its chatbots will attempt to redirect the most distressing conversations to more capable AI models that can provide a better response.",
      "Meta also said it is now blocking its chatbots from talking with teens about self-harm, suicide, disordered eating and inappropriate romantic conversations, and instead directs them to expert resources. Meta already offers parental controls on teen accounts.",
      "If you or someone you know is in emotional distress or a suicidal crisis, you can reach the\u00a0988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline\u00a0by calling or texting 988. You can also chat with the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline\u00a0here.",

      "According to the group, a 2.7% COLA would raise the average monthly benefit for retired workers by $54, from $2,008 to $2,062. The Senior Citizens League predicted the same cost-of-living adjustment in August.",
      "The cost-of-living adjustment has averaged 2.6% over the last 20 years, according to the Senior Citizens League. A COLA of 2.7% would be higher than this year's adjustment of 2.5%, but below the 3.2% boost seniors received in 2024.",
      "The Social Security Administration (SSA) makes a cost-of-living adjustment each year based on inflation data from July, August and September. Thursday's CPI report shows that the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), the figure the SSA uses to make its annual adjustment, increased 2.8% on an annual basis in August, up from 2.5% the month prior.",

      "The ministry had said the flight was expected to take off on Wednesday, but that it was delayed due to unspecified circumstances in the U.S. On Thursday, President Lee said the delay was caused by discussion that was ongoing Wednesday over the details of the transport arrangements for the South Korean nationals between the ICE detention facility and the Atlanta airport.",

      "Industry experts caution, however, that it may be difficult to maintain investment levels under those guidelines, as securing visas can take years, while many projects face strict deadlines and delays can drive up costs. There is a shortage of highly skilled workers in the U.S., meanwhile, for battery manufacturing, semiconductor and modern shipbuilding industries \u2014 all arenas in which South Korea has been investing heavily for years.",

      "Some economists point to the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs as pushing prices higher. That's because U.S. businesses pay the import duties to the federal government and then pass on some of those costs to consumers in the form of costlier goods.",
      "So far in 2025, the Federal Reserve has held off on cutting rates due to the potential for tariffs to reignite inflation. Because rate reductions make it cheaper to borrow, they can spur businesses and consumers to open their wallets, adding to inflationary pressures.",
      "Yet with the labor market showing signs of strain, Fed Chair Jerome Powell last month signaled that the door may be open for a rate cut at the central bank's Sept. 17 meeting. Cutting rates can spur hiring by making it cheaper for businesses to borrow, and therefore easier to expand and add employees.",
      "Under the Fed's so-called \"dual mandate,\" the central bank is required to promote full employment while keeping inflation in check.",
      "Despite the rise in inflation, the Fed is likely still on track for a rate cut next week, said Seema Shah, Chief Global Strategist at Principal Asset Management, noting that the weaker jobs data will likely outweigh concerns about higher prices.",
      "\"While the CPI report is a tad hotter than expected, it will not give the Fed a moment of hesitation when they announce a rate cut next week,\" she said in an email.",
      "What's getting pricier",
      "Some items getting more expensive are products that are largely imported, such as coffee, which soared 21.7% from a year ago, and furniture, which rose 4.7%. Imports are subject to U.S. tariffs based on country of origin, with the Trump administration adding new duties that start at 10% and scale higher.",
      "\"There were once again some signs of tariff effects putting upward pressure on goods prices,\" noted Capital Economics in a research note, pointing to higher costs for appliances and other home products.",
      "Day-to-day costs also increased at a faster pace, with food prices rising by 3.2% from a year ago, largely driven by higher restaurant prices, the data showed.",
      "Those pressures are being felt by many consumers, with some telling CBS News that their expenses have only increased in the past year. Some say that they're cutting back on discretionary spending to cope with a rise in household costs.",
      "\"Everything overall is more expensive \u2014 my groceries for example \u2014 and I hope for things that are on sale. I plan everything we're going to have for the week,\" said Kali Daugherty, 40, an executive director of a nonprofit in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.",
      "She said she's spending about $275 to $300 every two weeks on groceries for her family, up from about $175 to $200 a year ago. \"There's no wiggle room anymore,\" she added.",

    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence is poised to change how businesses and consumers interact in virtually every industry, including travel, which is ripe for disruption by AI.",
      "When the first online trip planning sites emerged in the mid-1990s, they let consumers act as their own travel agents. Decades later, artificial intelligence tools are able to take over that role, and plan and book trips on behalf of travelers, saving them time and even money.",
      "\"It takes a lot of research and clicking around. It takes an average of 30 days between when you start planning a trip and when it's fully finished,\" Skylar Erickson, co-founder of Gondola AI, which helps consumers maximize their loyalty points, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You have 40 tabs open on your browser, so it takes a lot of work to get to that right answer.\"",
      "Also, because airfares and hotel room rates fluctuate constantly based on demand, shoppers could save a lot of time using a chatbot or other AI-powered tool to track and compare prices rather than manually refreshing their browsers.",
      "\"You log into a site, and you're trying to find the right price based on what other airlines are charging \u2014 that's the ultimate goal,\" Ram Reddy, an AI expert and chief technology officer at Nagarro, a consulting firm, said. \"AI tools that know you well can get you to the right place at the right time, when prices, which aren't static, are changing every minute.\"",
      "Consumers booking trips are already seeing AI's value: 41% of more than 2,000 consumers\u00a0surveyed\u00a0by Oliver Wyman, a management consulting firm, said they had recently used AI tools for travel inspiration or itinerary planning.",
      "From inspiration to booking",
      "There are a range of AI-powered apps and bots at consumers' fingertips that can help plan a trip \u2014 from inception to booking. AI-powered bots can help travelers dream up trip ideas, turn visual inspiration into ready-to-go itineraries, and complete bookings and payments while maximizing the consumer's own loyalty points and other rewards so that they save money. In other words, AI provides the services in which travel agents at brick-and-mortar travel agencies once specialized.",
      "Ways AI can assist travel planning",
      "Did you see a social media post of a trip you'd like to be on? Send it to Expedia to book your own version through a feature called Trip Matching, which can turn social media reels into bookable trip itineraries.",
      "Don't know what to plan for the kids while on a family vacation? ChatGPT can generate a list of free activities in any locale.",
      "Not sure how many loyalty points or rewards you've accrued, or what they're worth? A company called Gondola AI can figure that out, helping users maximize their loyalty points so their dollars take them further.",
      "Trip planning and booking is prime territory for AI agents to test their skills, and hopefully, make the process easier for consumers, according to AI leaders.",
      "\"These days, it's easier to identify where AI is not being used to help travelers. It is everywhere, from planning to booking,\" Melanie Fish, head of global PR for Expedia Brands, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Jennifer Yellin, travel expert at Points Path, a browser extension that helps consumers compare flight deals, said the more she utilizes AI for trip planning, the better the technology gets to know her, and the more useful it becomes.",
      "\"The more you use it, it starts to recognize your patterns and preferences. It gets to know you as a traveler,\" she said of a Gondola AI, one of her favorite new tools. \"If you've been booking stays at Ritz Carltons, it won't suggest a Marriott Residence Inn as a first option; it will suggest a stay of a similar caliber.\"",
      "\"I used it dozens of times\"",
      "Other travel industry pros say they see more value in AI's ability to help them navigate locales once they've arrived.",
      "\"ChatGPT totally revolutionized how we were able to get along in China \u2014 I used it to scan menus and translate them into English,\" Scott Keyes, founder of flight deals site Going.com, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I used it dozens of times a day.\"",
      "As far as trip planning goes, Keyes said that while he's generally an AI optimist, \"the use case has not yet proven itself to me.\"",
      "Which tools are the most helpful? These are some popular trip planning tools. Here's how they can help, and where they fall short.",
      "AI travel planning tools",
      "ChatGPT:\u00a0The AI chatbot can suggest places to stay or things to do anywhere in the world. Tell it you're visiting New York City around Christmastime with young children and you're not sure what neighborhood to stay in. It can suggest parts of town and outline their pros and cons.",
      "Google Flight Deals: Enter a destination and desired dates, or describe the type of trip you'd like to take, such as \"beach escape,\" or \"Paris in the fall.\" Let the AI-powered search engine \u2014 designed for travelers who want to save money \u2014 try to find you the best deal based on such parameters. The tool is not an AI agent though, and can't book tickets for you.",
      "Expedia Trip Matching:\u00a0The AI tool lets you send a public Instagram travel reel, or video, to Expedia, which will create an itinerary based on the visual inspiration you provide. The reel must be publicly available on Instagram, and the AI tool can only suggest trips in the U.S. market.",
      "Gondola AI: Give the tool access to your email, and it will cull your loyalty points and rewards from airlines, hotels and credit card companies to let you know what they are worth. It will compare prices in cash versus combinations of points, and can save you hundreds of dollars. It comes into play after you've decided where you want to go and stay. \"We are about finding you money, earning you money and redeeming at the highest possible value,\" Erickson said.",

      "Laura Nicolosi, assistant inspector general for audit in the Labor Department's Office of Inspector General, said in a September 10 letter to acting BLS commissioner William Wiatrowski that the watchdog will examine how the statistics bureau compiles and reports monthly inflation and jobs data.",
      "In the letter, Nicolosi pointed to the Labor Department recently announcing large downward revisions to its earlier estimates of payroll gains. BLS released figures on Tuesday showing that the U.S. labor market added more than 900,000 fewer jobs in the 12-month period ending March 2025 than had earlier been reported.",
      "The BLS produces its monthly employment report by conducting separate surveys of households and businesses. The Labor Department also taps other measures of how the job market is faring, including state unemployment claims. The Labor Department frequently issues revisions to figures from prior months as more complete or accurate data is collected over time.",
      "The internal review of BLS' methods also will examine how it collects, reports and revises data used in two closely watched gauges of inflation \u2014 the Producer Price Index and the Consumer Price Index \u2014 Nicolosi said. Recent data show that inflation around the U.S. has risen this year.",
      "President Trump last month fired then BLS commissioner Erika McEntarfer and accused her of political bias after the Labor Department's July employment report showed unexpectedly weak job growth and revised down payroll gains for the previous two months.",
      "\"I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY. She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can't be manipulated for political purposes,\" the president\u00a0wrote\u00a0in an August 1 post on social media.",

      "Mr. Trump's move to oust McEntarfer and question the accuracy of federal labor data has sparked concern among economists and policymakers.",

      "McBlais' concerns and struggles come as the pace of inflation continues to creep higher, remaining well above the Federal Reserve's goal of driving it down to an annual 2% rate.

Despite the media's false narrative, core inflation has run at a 2.4% average pace since President Trump took office which is the lowest 6-month pace since March 2021. The so-called 'experts' have been wrong month after month: tariffs have not hiked prices and President Trump is delivering on his promise to make America affordable again,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Federal Reserve's complicated decision",
      "A hotter CPI report would complicate the Federal Reserve's task of deciding its next interest rate move on Sept. 17, given that the labor market has stalled out this summer. The Fed's so-called \"dual mandate\" requires it to promote full employment while keeping inflation in check.",
      "So far in 2025, the Fed has held its benchmark rate steady, with Chair Jerome Powell saying he wanted to keep the central bank's powder dry in case tariffs caused inflation to reignite. Because rate reductions make it cheaper to borrow, they can spur businesses and consumers to open their wallets, adding to inflationary pressures.",
      "But two consecutive disappointing jobs reports signal that the labor market is stalling out, putting pressure on the Fed to cut rates, which can help bolster hiring by making it cheaper for businesses to borrow and add more workers. Powell last month signaled the Fed may be open to a cut, pointing to the labor market's risks.",
      "The probability of a 0.25 percentage point rate cut is pegged at 90% by CME FedWatch, which bases its forecast on 30-day Fed Funds futures prices. There's a slimmer 10% likelihood that the Fed could usher in a jumbo cut of 0.5 percentage points, its data shows.",
      "A rate cut could help some consumers by lowering their borrowing costs, with interest fees on credit cards, home equity lines of credit and other loans likely to drop after a reduction. But households are still continuing to face higher prices at the grocery store and for household bills, experts note.",

    "story": [
      "A federal Judge on Tuesday ruled that\u00a0Lisa Cook can remain in her role on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors while her lawsuit challenging President Trump's attempt to fire her from her post plays out.",
      "\"President Trump has not stated a legally permissible cause for Cook's removal,\" U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden, wrote in her ruling, which is likely to be appealed.",
      "Mr. Trump said he is firing Cook over allegations she made false representations on mortgage agreements several years ago, resulting in more favorable loan terms.",
      "\"President Trump's stated cause refers only to allegations regarding Cook's conduct before she began serving on the Federal Reserve Board,\" Cobb wrote. \"As discussed above, such allegations are not a legally permissible cause.\"",
      "In addition to casting doubt on whether Mr. Trump established cause for Cook's firing, in issuing the stay, Cobb also ruled that Cook's right to due process was violated and that she would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction was not granted.",
      "Abbe David Lowell, an attorney representing Cook in her lawsuit, said in a statement to CBS News on Tuesday night, \"This ruling recognizes and reaffirms the importance of safeguarding the independence of the Federal Reserve from illegal political interference. Allowing the President to unlawfully remove Governor Cook on unsubstantiated and vague allegations would endanger the stability of our financial system and undermine the rule of law. Governor Cook will continue to carry out her sworn duties as a Senate-confirmed Board Governor.\"",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement that Tuesday's ruling \"will not be the last say on the matter.\"",
      "\"President Trump lawfully removed Lisa Cook for cause due to credible allegations of mortgage fraud from her highly sensitive position overseeing financial institutions on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors,\" Desai said.",
      "Under federal law, Fed board members\u00a0serve for 14-year terms\u00a0and can only be fired by the president \"for cause.\" Cook has served on the Fed since being appointed to complete another member's unexpired term in 2022, and her current term would run until 2038.",
      "Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook on Aug. 26, writing in a letter\u00a0terminating her\u00a0from the Fed Board of Governors that he had \"sufficient cause\" to remove her from the position. The president cited a previous letter from Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, that was sent to Attorney General Pam Bondi alleging Cook made false statements on mortgage agreements.",
      "Pulte, an appointee of Mr. Trump's, alleged that Cook in 2021 claimed two different properties in Michigan and Georgia as her primary residence on mortgage documents to get better lending terms. Cook has not been charged with any civil or criminal offense.",
      "Cook's lawyers have previously said in court filings that Mr. Trump's \"unsubstantiated allegation that Governor Cook 'may have' or 'seems' to have erred in filling out a mortgage form in her capacity as a private citizen-does not amount to 'cause' for removal within the meaning of the FRA [Federal Reserve Act].\"",
      "\"None of the alleged misconduct occurred during the performance of Governor Cook's duties as a Federal Board member,\" they wrote. \"And the President and Director Pulte have not even alleged explicitly that Ms. Cook benefited from any clerical error, or that such an error was intentional.\"",
      "In court arguments Friday, Lowell said Cook was not given notice of the allegations or a chance to respond to them, violating, he argued, her due process rights.",
      "Cook's lawsuit argues that Mr. Trump's attempt to oust her is \"unprecedented and illegal,\" noting it would be the first removal of a governor by the president in the Fed's 112-year history.",
      "\"The President's effort to terminate a Senate-confirmed Federal Reserve Board member is a broadside attack on the century-old independence of the Federal Reserve System,\" Cook's lawyers wrote in a filing.",
      "They warned that Mr. Trump's theory of \"cause\" would allow him to remove any Fed Board member with whom he disagrees on policy, eroding the central bank's independence and threatening its mission of providing economic stability.",
      "Cobb appeared to agree with their argument, writing in her ruling on Tuesday, \"Taken to its logical conclusion, the Government's argument leads to an absurd result: While admitting that the President cannot remove an official for policy disagreements, the Government claims that under Reagan, a removal on the grounds of a policy disagreement would nevertheless be unreviewable. ... This cannot be the case. Such a rule would provide no practical insulation for the members of the Board of Governors. It would mean that the President could, in practice, 'remove a member ... merely because he wanted his own appointees.'\"",
      "Cobb also wrote that Mr. Trump \"does not address her [Cook's] in-office conduct at all, let alone provide any examples of how Cook's performance or personal conduct since assuming the role has been in any way deficient in carrying out her statutory duties,\" adding that Mr. Trump's termination letter \"does not identify any conduct that Cook has engaged in while serving as a member of the Board that indicates that Cook lacks the competence or trustworthiness for the role.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's move to fire Cook came amid his repeated\u00a0attacks on the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, over the central bank's handling of interest rates.",
      "Cook, Powell and 10 other Fed officials sit on a committee that controls the nation's monetary policy and sets target interest rates, with a dual mandate of keeping inflation low and employment levels high. This work is typically done independently, with little to no input from political leaders.",
      "While the Fed did cut interest rates last year, after they had reached their highest point in decades in 2022 and 2023 in a bid to fight off inflation, the central bank has recently kept rates at relatively high levels. Powell has cited concerns that lowering rates could again lead to a swift rise in inflation and that Mr. Trump's tariffs could also lead to an increase in consumer prices.",

The announcement comes just over a month after Joby\u00a0acquired Blade Air Mobility, which flies passengers by helicopter and seaplanes, in a $125 million deal.",
      "In a news\u00a0release, Uber and Joby said that once the service is integrated, passengers will be able to book flights directly in the Uber app in the \"most populated cities in the world.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Joby told CBS MoneyWatch that the company does not yet have details on routes or pricing, but that airport connections would be appealing to consumers. \"Airport routes have long been identified as some of the highest value propositions to the public,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Blade's\u00a0website\u00a0shows that it offers flights between Manhattan and John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York or Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey for $195. Last year, Blade flew 50,000 passengers in the New York metropolitan area and Southern Europe, according to the companies.",

    "published": "Wed, 10 Sep 2025 11:34:09 -0400",
    "summary": "ATM fees for out-of-network cash withdrawals average $4.86 nationwide \u2014 the highest on record, according to aBankrate survey.",
    "story": [
      "Getting cash from an ATM is growing increasingly expensive as fees reach record highs.",
      "Americans are now paying an average of $4.86 for out-of-network ATM withdrawals, up 1.9% from $4.77 last year, according to a new\u00a0survey\u00a0from Bankrate.com. That's the highest on record, according to the personal finance website, which starting tracking ATM fees 27 years ago.",
      "\"ATM fees are just one of those avenues that the bank can very freely continue to charge fees,\" Bankrate financial analyst Stephen Kates told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Those costs include charges from both ATM owners and banks. According to the survey, the average fee from cash machine providers is $3.22. Banks charge $1.64 on average, up 3.8% from 2024 \u2014 the highest since 2018. As a result, Americans in certain metro areas could see average combined fees of more than $5.",
      "For its survey, Bankrate polled a total of 10 banks and financial institutions in 25 of the nation's largest metro areas. Atlanta topped the list for highest ATM costs, with an average out-of-network fee of $5.37. Behind Atlanta are Phoenix and San Diego, where ATM charges average $5.35 and $5.31, respectively.",
      "Boston and Seattle had the lowest average rates among the metro areas surveyed \u2014 $4.37 and $4.42, respectively.",
      "What's behind the rising charges?",
      "The problem, said Kates, is that while there have been regulatory rumblings around curbing overdraft fees, resulting in voluntary caps by financial institutions, there are no limits on how much banks can charge for ATM withdrawals, giving them free rein to hike fees as much as they want. And since the charges apply to people outside the bank's network, there's no risk of it losing customers.",
      "\"It's one of the ways for the bank to certainly make money, and it's one of the ways to do so that doesn't really hurt their own customers,\" Kates said.",
      "Higher fees also help ATM owners and banks make up for lost revenue as consumers gravitate away from using cash and toward digital payments, said Kates. Also, online banking has nearly eliminated the need for automated bank tellers. According to a\u00a0survey\u00a0conducted by Morning Consult on behalf of the American Bankers Association last year, only 5% of customers relied on ATMs to manage their bank accounts.",
      "To be sure, reliance on cash hasn't disappeared altogether. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta found that cash was still Americans' primary form of payment as of October 2024 \u2014 whether for a trip to an old-school laundromat or a vexingly cash-only restaurant.",
      "\"Fewer and fewer people need to use cash for certain things, but there are some times when you have to have it,\" said Kates.",
      "How to avoid high ATM fees",
      "Avoiding high ATM fees requires a bit of strategy and forethought, as you may not always be near a bank-affiliated ATM when you need to withdraw cash.",
      "In such a situation, one option is to get cash back at a local store. Kates also encourages people to look at their banking app to see which ATMs are close to them.",
      "If you need to withdraw cash on a regular basis, but live in an area where there aren't any ATMs in-network, you may want to consider changing where you bank to accommodate your needs. Certain online financial services like Fidelity, for instance, reimburse customers for ATM fees \u2014 making them a more attractive option.",

      "The streamlining would save $1.25 billion by the end of 2026, savings that are to be redirected to diabetes and obesity, including research and development, the company said.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday said it will decide whether President Trump can impose his most sweeping tariffs, setting up a major test of one of the pillars of the president's economic agenda.",
      "The high court agreed to review lower court decisions\u00a0that found Mr. Trump did not have the authority to issue many of his global tariffs under an emergency powers law. The Justice Department appealed one of those rulings, from a federal appeals court, to the Supreme Court last week and asked it to move swiftly.",
      "The Trump administration has argued that upholding the ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit would put the United States at a disadvantage and expose the nation to retaliatory trade policies.",
      "The case is the first in which the Supreme Court will directly decide the legality of one of Mr. Trump's second-term policies. The high court has been asked roughly two dozen times to intervene in challenges to many of the president's initiatives, but on an interim emergency basis.",
      "The justices said arguments in the tariffs case would take place in the first week of November.",
      "The tariffs case",
      "One of the disputes before the Supreme Court was brought by a group of small businesses and 12 states. They argued that he did not have the authority to impose many of the global tariffs under the emergency powers law that he invoked, called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.",
      "A federal trade court ruled in May that Mr. Trump exceeded his authority when he issued the tariffs under IEEPA, and the Federal Circuit upheld that decision late last month. In its 7-4 decision, the appeals court agreed that the tariffs are illegal.",
      "\"It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs,\" the appeals court wrote. \"The statute neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the President's power to impose tariffs.\"",
      "The appeals court did not decide whether IEEPA authorizes any tariffs at all. Instead, it only resolved whether sweeping duties that Mr. Trump imposed through a series of executive orders earlier this year are allowed under the law.",
      "The second case involves a pair of Illinois-based companies that sell educational toys and products. A federal district judge in Washington, D.C., ruled in May that IEEPA \"does not authorize the president to impose the tariffs set forth\" in his executive orders. The decision from U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras was more narrow, barring the Trump administration only from collecting any tariff from the two companies. Contreras paused his decision while the Justice Department appealed to the D.C. Circuit.",
      "The two companies asked the Supreme Court in June to fast track the case and leap frog the appeals court in Washington, D.C.",
      "A spokesperson for one of the companies, Learning Resources, said in a statement it was \"gratified\" that the Supreme Court would hear the case.",
      "\"There is a lot riding on this historic case,\" the spokesperson said. \"The unlawful IEEPA tariffs have wreaked havoc in our economy for too long now.\"",
      "The duties at issue include those announced by Mr. Trump in early April \u2014 which he refers to as \"Liberation Day\" \u2014 that set a 10% baseline rate for nearly every country, and higher \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners. It also involves a set of levies on imports from Canada, Mexico and China in response to what Mr. Trump said is their failure to address the trafficking of fentanyl across U.S. borders.",
      "The president has used the tariffs, and the threat of additional duties, to try to force trading partners to negotiate trade deals with his administration. So far, \u00a0he has announced frameworks of trade agreements with the European Union and six countries: the United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines.",
      "Mr. Trump is the first president to use IEEPA to impose tariffs, though it has been used by his predecessors to hit foreign nations with economic sanctions. His administration has argued that a denial of tariff authority would put the U.S. on the brink of \"economic catastrophe\" and make the nation poorer.",
      "In urging the Supreme Court to move quickly, Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing that the Federal Circuit's \"erroneous decision has disrupted highly impactful, sensitive, ongoing diplomatic trade negotiations, and cast a pall of legal uncertainty over the President's efforts to protect our country by preventing an unprecedented economic and foreign-policy crisis.\"",
      "The Trump administration has argued that IEEPA gives the president broad powers to regulate trade, including imposing tariffs, \"to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat\" to U.S. national security, foreign policy or the economy.",
      "Mr. Trump has said that trade deficits and the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. constituted threats to the national security and economy of the U.S., and invoked IEEPA to impose tariffs to address them.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs have remained in effect, since the Federal Circuit put its decision on hold until Oct. 14 to give the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court.",
      "The plaintiffs \u2014 the five small businesses and 12 states \u2014 agreed that the Supreme Court needs to resolve the legality of Mr. Trump's tariffs, calling it an issue of \"great\" and \"undoubted importance.\" They argued that the tariffs are illegal and urged the high court to affirm the Federal Circuit's decision.",
      "\"The government's case rests entirely on the notion that the phrase 'regulate \u2026 importation' in IEEPA constitutes a boundless power to impose tariffs on the American people whenever the President wants, at whatever level he wants, for whatever countries and products he wants, and for as long as he wants, merely by declaring that longstanding U.S. trade deficits are a national 'emergency' and an 'unusual and extraordinary threat' \u2014 assertions the government claims are effectively unreviewable,\" lawyers for the small businesses wrote in a Supreme Court filing. \"There are no limits.\"",
      "The states, meanwhile, said that the Constitution gives Congress the power to collect taxes, and the Trump administration is claiming that the president has sweeping authority to impose tariffs \"on any country, at any rate, and for however long he likes.\"",
      "\"The President's chaotic implementation of that purported authority, which changed by the day and wreaked havoc on capital markets and the economy, illustrates both the breadth of powers that the President claims and the danger of unlimited authority in this domain,\" they warned in court papers.",
      "The legal challenge to Mr. Trump's tariffs is likely to be one of several involving the president's second-term policies that the Supreme Court takes up. Other cases involving his immigration policies and efforts to remove members of independent agencies have progressed through the lower courts, and the Trump administration is likely to seek Supreme Court review of decisions against it.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. labor market added 911,000 fewer jobs in the 12-month period that ended March 2025 than had earlier been reported, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Tuesday. The major downward revision signals that the labor market was slowing more last year than had earlier been reported.",
      "The so-called preliminary benchmark revision, produced annually by the BLS, was bigger than a decline of roughly 800,000 that economists had forecast prior to the release. The revision aims to better account for businesses that have opened or closed in the 12-month period it covers, as these changes are sometimes missed by the BLS' monthly jobs report.",
      "The downward revision comes as the labor market appears to be ailing, with Friday's\u00a0disappointing August jobs report\u00a0sending warning signals about the pace of hiring across the U.S. At the same time, the BLS is in the crosshairs of the Trump administration, with the president last month\u00a0questioning the validity\u00a0of the monthly jobs report after the data included a significant downward revision, prompting him to\u00a0fire the commissioner\u00a0of the BLS.",
      "Revisions are a normal part of the statistical process at the BLS, economists note. That's because the monthly jobs data is based on a survey of businesses, and some companies respond after the agency's initial jobs report has been issued. Because of that, the BLS updates its data to reflect the new information.",
      "The sharp downward annual revision signals that the job market was facing bigger headwinds in 2024 and early 2025 than earlier reported, and could add to the Federal Reserve's case for cutting its benchmark rate at its Sept. 17 meeting, economists said.",
      "\"Today's data suggests cooling in the labor market is more dramatic than previously thought,\" said Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet, in an email.",
      "She added, \"This strengthens the likelihood that the Fed will cut rates next week, as it's additional evidence that the labor market side of the dual mandate needs some attention.\"",
      "Less momentum in job gains",
      "With the new revisions, job growth in 2025 has averaged 44,000 per month, down from 75,000 prior to the revamped numbers, Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said in an email. In 2024, payroll gains factoring in the revisions averaged 106,000, down from 168,000 previously.",
      "\"The revision shows the economy entered 2025 with less momentum than previously understood,\" he said. \"It's now a lock that the Fed will cut interest rates at their meeting next week and that further rate cuts will follow in the months ahead. The question is by how much.\"",
      "The probability of a 0.25 percentage point rate cut at the Fed's Sept. 17 meeting is now projected at 94%, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "The annual revisions are based on fresh data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), which tracks employment and wages reported by employers that cover more than 95% of U.S. jobs, or about 11 million workplaces.",
      "The QCEW tracks when businesses open or close, something that is difficult for the monthly jobs report to track. For instance, if a business doesn't respond to the monthly survey, the BLS doesn't immediately know if the company simply isn't responding or if it has shut down.",
      "The large revision is likely due to the QCEW's tracking of businesses that have either been newly created or recently closed, with some of those new companies likely having slower hiring than the BLS had earlier estimated, Pantheon Macroeconomics chief U.S. economist Samuel Tombs said in a research note.",
      "\"Probably about two-thirds of the downward benchmark revision looks set to be due to weaker job creation at new firms than the BLS initially inferred from its model,\" he said.",

      "The \"big, beautiful bill\" signed into law by President Trump in July provides a bevy of new tax cuts and deductions that could lower taxes for millions of Americans, according to a recent analysis from the Tax Foundation.",
      "The typical filer could see a tax cut of $3,752 in 2026, the nonpartisan think tank found. But the impact will also vary geographically, with some residents in some states likely receiving a bigger tax benefit than others under the new law, Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "For instance, the biggest average cut will go to residents of Wyoming, with a reduction of $5,374, according to his analysis of the law's impact.",
      "The geographic differences are due partly to variations in the average income of each state, given that the law provides bigger tax cuts to high-income Americans\u00a0compared with low-income households, Watson noted. Other provisions also could help some regions more than others. That includes the higher deduction cap for state and local taxes, which will give more of a lift to people in states with high property taxes, such as New Jersey and New York.",
      "\"Places with higher incomes are going to have higher nominal tax cuts,\" Watson said. \"The largest tax benefits are going to the mountain states \u2014 it's due to a subgroup of higher-income business owners.\"",
      "Residents of Mississippi and West Virginia are likely to see the smallest tax cuts next year, the analysis found. Incomes in those states tend to be lower than the national average, with median household income in Mississippi standing at about $55,000 as of 2023 and $60,000 for West Virginians, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The national household median income is about $80,600.",
      "The Tax Foundation analysis projects the average tax cut in tax year 2026, meaning that these numbers reflect the reductions for the next calendar year. Although many of the law's provisions are effective in 2025, the IRS is still working out the details on some of them, which means lower tax withholding for the new provisions won't be fully in place until 2026, Watson said.",
      "Bigger refunds?",
      "Tax refunds are also likely to be larger in early 2026, when people file their taxes for the 2025 calendar year, Watson said, although he hasn't calculated the potential impact.",
      "Seniors who can claim a new $6,000 deduction for people over 65 under the law may get a bigger refund, as well as taxpayers across the board due to the higher standard deduction, said Mark Steber, chief tax officer at Jackson Hewitt.",
      "Because of the tax changes in the new law, Steber recommends that people start preparing now. For example, workers who are newly eligible for tax breaks on tips and on overtime pay should keep track of such income.",
      "\"Having this much time left in the year allows taxpayers to make any necessary adjustments to help increase a refund or lower an amount due, and can be as simple as adjusting the withholding on a W-4,\" Steber told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The top 1% of earners around the U.S. \u2014 those with incomes over $1.1 million \u2014 will receive a $75,410 annual tax break from the new law in 2026, according to a\u00a0separate analysis\u00a0from the Tax Policy Center, nonpartisan think tank. That compares with an average tax break of $150 for households in the bottom 20% of the income distribution, or people earning less than $36,000 a year, and of $1,780 for earning $66,801 to $119,200.",
      "To be sure, many of new law's tax cuts will depend on an individual's financial circumstances. For instance, a low-income worker who earns tips or overtime could see a much bigger tax cut due to the law's \"no tax on tips\" and \"no tax on overtime\" provisions, Watson noted.",
      "\"If a taxpayer isn't taking tips or overtime or new car loan deduction, they may see a lower benefit,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Cracker Barrel is shelving plans to remodel its restaurants as it continues to backtrack on overhauling its brand image.",
      "The move comes after the chain already reverted to its old logo in response to an uproar around a refreshed brand symbol that caused the company's stock\u00a0to lose as much as $200 million in market value.",
      "\"Your Old Country Store is Here to Stay,\" the company said in a statement on its website Tuesday, adding that it would no longer seek to modernize the restaurant's interiors.",
      "\"Today, we're suspending our remodels. If your restaurant hasn't been remodeled, you don't need to worry, it won't be,\" Cracker Barrel said. The decision to halt remodeling plans was based on opinions customers shared \"not just on our logo, but also on our restaurants,\" it added.",
      "Cracker Barrel conceded in its statement that its planned store redesign did \"not reflect what you love about Cracker Barrel.\"",
      "To date, the Southern-themed restaurant chain has remodeled just four of its 660 store locations. It is suspending plans to remodel any additional stores.",
      "\"With our recent announcement that our 'Old Timer' logo will remain, along with our bigger focus in the kitchen and on your plate, we hope that today's step reinforces that we hear you,\" the company said Tuesday.",
      "Marketing experts said that while Cracker Barrel may have had solid business reasons for revamping its brand, the company's execution of that strategy was flawed.",
      "\"I'm sure there was a lot of deep thought that went into both the logo and store redesigns,\" Vanderbilt University marketing professor Kelly Goldsmith told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They needed to turn the ship around financially and thought the logo and store redesign would help.\"",
      "While Cracker Barrel's growth soared in the 1990s, it has slowed in recent years. For 2024, the company\u00a0reported\u00a0revenue of roughly $3.5 billion, up less than 1% from the previous year. Net income fell to $40.9 million, down from $99 million in 2023.",
      "\"It's existing plan wasn't working for the company financially, and that was the impetus for this change,\" Goldsmith said.",
      "Goldsmith suspects Cracker Barrel may have wanted to appeal to a broader audience by presenting a more flexible brand, opening the door for the chain to expand into new food categories.",
      "\"Unfortunately, we never got to see if that actually converted to a return on investment for them because they switched back so quickly,\" she said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jobs-manufacturing-trump-tariffs-economy/",
    "published": "Tue, 09 Sep 2025 13:49:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Uncertainty over U.S. tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies are deterring manufacturers from hiring, according to the Center for American Progress.",
    "story": [
      "Manufacturers in the U.S. are cutting thousands of jobs even as President Trump pushes economic policies that he says will revitalize the industry.",
      "Employers shed 12,000 manufacturing jobs\u00a0in August, while payrolls in the sector have shrunk by 42,000 since April, according to a new\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the Center for American Progress (CAP) that draws on government labor data.",
      "The nonpartisan policy institute attributes that decline to the Trump administration's steep new tariffs; hardline stance on immigration; and the Republican-backed \"big, beautiful bill,\" a tax and spending package enacted by Mr. Trump in July that CAP says hurts renewable energy companies by phasing out certain tax credits.",
      "For all of 2025, manufacturing employment in the U.S. has sunk by a total of 33,000 jobs, according to Labor Department\u00a0figures. Most of those job losses have been among companies that make durable goods, such as cars, household appliances and electronics. The drop comes as hiring overall has slowed sharply in recent months, with employers adding only 22,000 jobs in August, well below forecasts.",
      "The number of manufacturing jobs in the U.S. has declined for the past six decades, according to\u00a0data\u00a0from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. In 1960, manufacturing represented about 34% of total employment, while the number of jobs in the sector peaked in 1970 at 19.5 million. As of August this year, 12.7 million Americans were employed in manufacturing, while the industry lost 87,000 jobs in 2024,\u00a0data shows.",
      "Uncertainty hurting businesses",
      "When Mr. Trump in April announced a range of levies on dozens of other countries, the White House said tariffs would protect American workers by reducing the U.S. trade deficit with its economic partners and spurring employers to move manufacturing jobs to the U.S.",
      "For now, however, confusion over the scale and scope of U.S. tariffs has put manufacturers on the defensive, increasing their costs and discouraging them from hiring, economist Sara Estrep, one of the authors of the CAP report, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Companies are uncertain about what's happening,\" she said. \"Everything has been changing on a day-to-day basis, so it's not clear what production should look like. That's why they aren't hiring.\"",
      "In August, for example, farm equipment giant John Deere cited tariffs in announcing that its sales and operating profits had dipped from a year ago. In an earnings call, an executive with the company noted that it had racked up roughly $300 million in tariff-related costs, including on steel and aluminum imports. John Deere also announced it was laying off more than 200 workers at plants in Illinois and Iowa, according to AgWeb, a trade publication.",
      "Automakers pointed partly to tariffs in announcing nearly 5,000 job cuts in July, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, while it noted that the retail sector has also stepped up layoffs and store closures because of economic uncertainty.",
      "Another factor fueling uncertainty for manufacturers are the ongoing legal challenges to the Trump tariffs, making it hard to plan and invest for the future, according to experts.",
      "A federal appeals court in August ruled that Mr. Trump unlawfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose sweeping tariffs on U.S. trade partners. Mr. Trump on September 3\u00a0asked the Supreme Court\u00a0to review the lower court's decision before it takes effect in October.",
      "The outcome of the case leaves many manufacturers in doubt about how to proceed, making them reluctant to expand their workforce as they seek to control costs, Daco told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The slowdown is symptomatic of an environment where purchasing managers are all under stress, and they are being squeezed by higher costs of goods and reduced demand,\" said EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco. \"And so in that squeeze, they are having to find ways to offset the higher costs, and one of the avenues to do that is to streamline their operations and make sure that they only have the essential talent on hand.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to several requests for comment on CAP's findings. The Office of the United States Trade Representative and National Association of Manufacturers, a trade group, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Immigration effect",
      "The Trump administration's crackdown on U.S. immigrants is also weighing on hiring in manufacturing, said Daniel Altman, an economist and author of the High Yield Economics newsletter.",
      "\"Immigration has been an important source of employment in manufacturing for some industries, and if you take away some of their labor supply, that's just gives them more incentive to pursue automation and other forms of capital intensive manufacturing,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The government stepped up its campaign last week when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents\u00a0detained 475 immigrants, most of them Korean, at a Hyundai plant in Georgia because they were suspected of living and working in the U.S. illegally.",
      "Border patrol agents have also\u00a0conducted raids targeting immigrants working in retail, according to CBS News. In sectors like farming, food processing and construction, undocumented immigrants make up to 20% of the workforce, according to\u00a0Goldman Sachs.",
      "White House \"border czar\" Tom Homan on Sunday said the White House will expand such efforts.",
      "\"We're going to do more worksite enforcement operations,\" Homan told CNN. \"No one hires an illegal alien out of the goodness of their heart. They hire them because they can work them harder, pay them less, undercut the competition that hires U.S. citizen employees.\"",
      "Other long-term factors that go beyond the Trump administration's policies are also contributing to the ongoing contraction in manufacturing jobs. During the pandemic, manufacturers invested heavily in technologies to automate their operations, Altman noted.",
      "\"We've seen a lot of automation, which means companies do not need as many workers to provide the same output,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Output per worker has been increasing, and when we see that kind of increase in labor productivity, it usually means workers have access to more capital, or better technology or both, and that's what you'd expect with automation.\"",

      "MAJOR GARRETT: I'm Major Garrett in Washington.",
      "And this week on Face the Nation: What will America do after the killing of political activist Charlie Kirk? Is the assassination of a high- visibility and effective conservative thought leader and vote mobilizer a moment when national divisions begin to close or will attitudes harden?",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "ERIKA KIRK (Widow of Charlie Kirk): To everyone listening tonight across America, the movement my husband built will not die.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The criminal investigation continues, as does the quest to deduce a motive. Charges will be filed later this week.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson joins us on the path ahead and a range of issues facing Congress, from avoiding a government shutdown to Russian sanctions.",
      "And a conversation with Democratic Senator Chris Coons and Republican Senator James Lankford, longtime advocates both of finding common ground and minimizing political strife.",
      "Also, University of Chicago Professor Robert Pape, one of the country's foremost researchers on political violence, with a warning about where things stand.",
      "Then: As consumers turn gloomy and the job market freezes up, high expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut. CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger will break it all down.",
      "It is all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. Margaret is on assignment for \"60 Minutes.\" I'm Major Garrett.",
      "We have a lot to get to today, and I want to begin with justice correspondent Scott MacFarlane with the latest on the assassination of political activist Charlie Kirk and the ongoing investigation.",
      "Utah Republican Governor Spencer Cox has been the most authoritative voice in this matter since it happened, Scott. We have some new comments from him this morning.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: It sounds like they have a lot to work with to start.",
      "First of all, as the weekend began, they executed a search warrant on the family home in Washington County, Utah. It's about three or four hours from the site of the shooting. The governor, though, says multiple people are talking here, including the roommate of the suspect, who he describes as incredibly cooperative.",
      "The roommate, he says, had no idea this was happening, and he also says the roommate may have been in a romantic relationship with Tyler Robinson, may have been gender transitioning, but the governor says there's no indication or no idea yet if that's at all relevant to this case.",
      "As for Robinson, he's in the Utah County Jail, the one where Utah Valley University is. He's in a special watch area. He's inmate 460956. A special watch means they're ensuring he's not harmed or can do any self-harm. It doesn't mean there's a mental health issue, Major, but the severity of the crime, commonly in correctional facilities across the country, puts you in a special watch.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: State charges due to be filed later this week. And because of Utah's approach to state charges, this will be a high-visibility prosecution when it comes.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: Yes, the district attorney is Jeff Gray. We expect him to speak Tuesday. The probable cause statement already submitted for this arrest indicates the possible charges, aggravated murder, felonious discharge of a firearm. Those are possible come Tuesday in Utah County Court.",
      "Whether the feds get involved, whole different issue. There may not be a foothold for federal charges here for the U.S. Department of Justice, unless they see something in the firearms or in the motives here that makes it federal, though we saw in Charlotte last week they brought federal charges in the alleged murder of a Ukrainian refugee.",
      "In that case, they found mass transit system foothold to bring the federal case.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Scott, as you well know, in instances like this, authorities struggle to stay with the facts as they are known and as they evolve.",
      "But there is rampant online speculation, rumormongering about motive. Authorities still very early in the stages of trying to identify one, if it exists\u2026",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: And the F\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: \u2026 and can properly characterized.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: And it's happening at a moment of change inside the U.S. Department of Justice. The FBI has new leadership, and this really is a first big test for the new FBI leadership.",
      "And the grades are incomplete right now. It was the father who seems to have turned in his son in this case, and the FBI director was called on some social media posts that were conflicting with other information, saying a subject was in custody, then a subject was released.",
      "And the FBI director also posted this weekend: \"Against all law enforcement recommendations, we released that video of the suspect.\" Governor of Utah today said: \"We certainly never recommended against releasing video.\"",
      "So there's some questions to answer for the FBI as this week begins.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Little bit of tension there.",
      "Scott MacFarlane, thank you very much.",
      "We turn now to the speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, who joins us this morning from Baton Rouge, Louisiana.",
      "Mr. Speaker, it's good to see you. I appreciate your time.",
      "The burdens of speakership are always manifold. You know that. Previous speakers I have covered know that, but they feel particularly heavy after the events of this week. I just want to ask you, Mr. Speaker, how are you doing?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON (R-Louisiana): I'm doing OK, Major. Thanks for asking it.",
      "No question, it was a difficult week for the country. Certainly, it was felt on Capitol Hill. There's a mixture of anger and sadness and fear, frankly, on the part of a lot of people. It cast a large shadow across the country and the nation's capital.",
      "But what I do know, Major, is that my good friend Charlie would not want any of us to be consumed by despair. He would want us to go forward boldly. That was his message, and to do it in love. And I think that, I hope, is the message that continues in the days ahead.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: It's not common for this show to pick up on something said by Connecticut's Young Democrats and Connecticut's Young Republicans, but they put out a statement that has gotten quite a bit of attention on the Internet, saying, as follows: \"There is no place in our country for such acts, regardless of political disagreements.\"",
      "Do you believe, on Capitol Hill, there will be a method to forge any sort of bipartisan remembrance of Charlie Kirk?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: There will be.",
      "We had a moment of prayer and silent reflection on the floor on Wednesday, within an hour of his passing. There will be \u2013 I participated in a large vigil here in Baton Rouge at LSU, my alma mater, on Friday night. Tonight, we will have a big, I hope, bipartisan prayer and reflection vigil in Capitol Hill, at the Kennedy Center.",
      "There will be a members reflection and prayer moment that I will lead on Monday night. This will continue. I think that the country needs to see leaders in Congress and leaders with platforms all around the country speaking truth and bringing calm to the situation.",
      "We should appeal, as Lincoln reminded us so many years ago, to the better angels among us all. And I think this is a real moment for Amer (AUDIO GAP) affirmatively. And I think one of the ways to do that, Major, is to adopt the manner of Charlie Kirk, because while he loved vigorous debate and he believed in the free marketplace of ideas and advancing truth boldly, he also was motivated by love for his fellow man, because he never hated the person on the other side of the table.",
      "And I think everyone would do well to be reminded of that model.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Mr. Speaker, you mentioned the word fear a moment ago. It is on the lips of members of Congress in ways I have never experienced before. They are talking openly. They already have canceled events.",
      "Other members are talking about whether or not it's proper, and there are family conversations, to seek reelection. How do you feel this particular space of anxiety for your membership, Republican and Democrat?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Yes.",
      "Well, I have been talking with a lot of them over the last few days about that and trying to calm the nerves to assure them that we will make certain that everyone has the level of security that's necessary, that the resources will be there for their residential security and their personal security.",
      "We're evaluating all the options for that, but also to be reminded that it does take a certain measure of courage to step out and to lead. I mean, our first responders do it every day. Our members of the military do it every day and political figures as well.",
      "But I think, if we all adopt these practices together and we turn down the rhetoric, we cease with this idea that policy disputes are somehow an existential threat to democracy or the republic, we stop calling one another names \u2013 I mean, calling people Nazis and fascists is not helpful.",
      "Look, there are some deranged people in society. And when they see leaders using that kind of language so often now, increasingly, it spurs them on to action. We have to recognize that reality and address it appropriately.",
      "And I'm heartened to know, Major, and to see that many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are stepping up and saying that and addressing it. I think this could be a turning point, frankly, to use Charlie's term, for the country. And I hope that's true.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Would that turning point, from your vantage point, Mr. Speaker, because I know you had a long conversation with President Trump, extend to the White House itself?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Well, of course.",
      "Look, the president knew Charlie very well. He was like a family member to the Trumps. Many of us felt that close association with him. And he admired Charlie's approach to public debate. And you have heard him say that publicly. He was \u2013 Charlie was a good man.",
      "And I think the best way we honor his memory is to continue to do that very thing and not shy away from debate, to keep the free marketplace of ideas going, but to work on the tone of those debates, because I think that serves the best of our principles, our Judeo-Christian heritage as a nation, our civil discourse, and we got to return to that.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Mr. Speaker, several issues pending before Congress, not the least of which is keeping the government open.",
      "I know you prefer a seven-week clean C.R., but there is a press for other issues, extending Obamacare tax subsidies. There's been a push this weekend for Russia sanctions backed by Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, in the Senate. Will either of those, from your vantage point, get into something to keep the government open?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Well, listen, we have been working very hard in the House to restore regular order in the appropriations government funding process, and that's something that no one's really seen for a long time on Capitol Hill.",
      "But I'm encouraged that, in a bipartisan fashion, our House Appropriations Committee has passed all 12 of the annual appropriations bills through the committee. We have got three off the House floor. The Senate's passed a few. And then last week we voted to move into a conference\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: OK, Mr. Speaker, I believe there's a technical glitch that has forced us to lose your audio.",
      "We're going to take a quick break, and we will come right back to House Speaker Mike Johnson in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in just a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to Face the Nation.",
      "Because technical gremlins lurk everywhere, they got in between my conversation with House Speaker Mike Johnson.",
      "Mr. Speaker. I'm glad to have you back.",
      "You were in the middle of answering about Obamacare tax subsidies, possible sanctions against Russia and a government funding mechanism. Please continue.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Yes, sorry about the interruption there.",
      "Listen, we're very encouraged that we have been able to restore the regular appropriations, regular order process in the House.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Right, but are we going to get this done? Are those two other things going to be added to the process, Mr. Speaker?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: We will have to see.",
      "I have got to build consensus around all of it, but I think we will need a short-term funding measure, a clean C.R. that will allow more time to figure all this out. And we certainly hope that Democrats will go along on that, because, if not, they really have no excuse.",
      "If they shut the government down, it would be their unilateral decision to do so.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And when Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, says, as he did this weekend, now is the time for Russia sanctions, President Trump opened the door on tariffs against India and China as a way to create economic leverage to end the war in Ukraine, where do you stand on all that?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Well, listen, I do believe that desperate times call for desperate measures.",
      "And I think appropriate sanctions on Russia are far overdue. I mean, I think there's a big appetite for that in Congress. So we're willing to work with the White House and our Senate colleagues in the House to get that done, and I'm anxious to do it personally.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Are you waiting for the president to give you the green light, or might Congress act on this on its own volition?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Well, Congress really can't do this on its own volition, because, of course, the president would need to sign whatever you do into law. So it has to be a partnership.",
      "But we have defer to the commander in chief. I mean, the president is a strong and bold leader on the world stage. He has brokered peace around the world in other conflicts in a way that no one before him has been able to do. And so we're trusting that he can use that same force and that same approach to bring about finally an end to this war in Ukraine.",
      "Everyone in America wants that bloodshed to end, and President Trump is forcing that. And I certainly\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: OK, Mr. Speaker, I'm told that the technical difficulties keep arising, so a bit prematurely, we're going to end our conversation here to spare you and spare our audience from continued mayhem by technical gremlins.",
      "Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the time. Thank you for joining us on Face the Nation very much.",
      "Jill Schlesinger joins now \u2013 joins us now. She's CBS News business analyst. She's on Long Island, as she often is when we talk.",
      "Jill, I'm pleased to see you.",
      "Look, everyone expects the Federal Reserve to cut rates this coming week. That's not a mystery. I guess the only mystery is, is it 25 basis points or 50 basis points? And if it's 50, how much more of a difference might that make?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Well, I think it's more likely to be a quarter-of-a- percentage point, at least for this meeting.",
      "And, remember, what is the Fed's job? It's got \u2013 they have got to keep into balance two big priorities. And these are big. One is to make sure the economy grows enough to create jobs for anyone who wants a job. And the other priority is to kind of keep a lid on prices, to control inflation or deflation.",
      "Right now, if you look at the Fed's job, it's a real tough one, because the job market is weakening at the same time that inflation is reaccelerating. Now, remember, we are not going back to scary post-pandemic inflationary surge, but inflation is starting to move in the wrong direction.",
      "But I think the Fed's outlook is, hey, it's the job market that is getting slower, faster. We have got to concentrate on that. I think they go a quarter-of-a-percentage point, rather than a half-of-a-percentage point, at least to get things restarted.",
      "Major, it was exactly a year ago when they began their rate cuts. Back in September of last year, they cut by a half-a-percentage point because they felt like inflation was moving down very quickly. I don't think that's the case this time.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jill, the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, frequently says the Fed and he are data-dependent. That's probably a virtue, except when the data is messy and cloudy and full of conflicting signals.",
      "That seems to be prevalent right now.",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Well, I think there is a real problem, in that, if you look at the last five years, our data is all over the place. The pandemic really did create a doozy of a problem on the economy, but also the way we track the economy.",
      "And I know people got really freaked out about those preliminary estimates to the revisions to all that data for the 12 months through March of this year. That preliminary revision showed 911,000 fewer jobs than we originally thought. Now, this is always part of an annual process. We will get the final number in February.",
      "But what I guess is important is, there are so many different aspects to what's going on in the economy right now. The crosscurrents are really difficult. So, yes, we know the labor market is weakening, but we're not seeing widespread job losses, thank goodness. There is no evidence that we are in a recession currently.",
      "The economy is growing. But we do have that niggling problem of prices starting to rise again. And I think that that price increase, because of those tariffs, because of certain aspects, even the service economy, I think that's a real crosscurrent.",
      "And, to be clear, the Fed, the amazing people who work there, the amazing economists that are out there doing the research, so many of them say to me, you know what, this is the most difficult time to judge the next steps of the economy in the last 40 years.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jill, as you know, there's a phrase going around describing the job market, and it goes as follows: \"No fire, no hire.\"",
      "What does that mean practically for somebody in the job market or just graduating from college trying to break in?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Yes, this is a very difficult labor market. I mean, granted, we are \u2013 again, we are not like we are in a recession. We are not seeing widespread layoffs, thank goodness. There are pockets of layoffs that are happening in different sectors. We are seeing contractions. We're seeing people who are retiring and those jobs not being refilled.",
      "But I think that if anyone who has a job right now, when I talk to H.R. people, they basically say to me, hey, you know what? Tell people to stay where they are. Don't fly off the handle, the job-hugging, staying engaged with your boss, engaged with the company, very important right now.",
      "If you are seeking a job, you know, where the jobs are right now, we see the most activity in health care, health services. So, you're \u2013 if you're somebody who is trained to do one job, try to find a job in the sector at least that is adding positions. I might be a programmer and I might not have an ability to get a job at a big tech company.",
      "Maybe I go to a big hospital chain. These are the kinds of things. We have to kind of get outside of ourselves. The adaptable candidate is going to be the one that wins in this economy.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jill, let's talk about tariffs, because it is a conversation and a way of trying to assess that this country has no recent experience with, at least 50 or 60 years, of trying to assess what a tariff does when it is widespread throughout the global economy.",
      "So a lot of us are trying to get used to this. Economists are trying to get used to it. Policymakers are trying to get used to it. Our trading partners are trying to get used to it. What is the story of tariffs so far, and has it been fully written?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Nothing fully written, so very important here, because when those tariffs were announced in April, and then they were moved higher, and then they were frozen for a while, the tariff story was an uncertain one.",
      "I think it is that cloud of uncertainty that was really hanging over the labor market over the past four months. But, right now, what we do know is that the industries most directly impacted by tariffs are not hiring as much. We know that. We know that they are losing some jobs. We also know that tariffs are creeping into the economy, and not in a huge way yet.",
      "But what we are clear about is that prices are set to rise over the next, say, six months or so. Not great for holiday shopping, I know. But what we also know is that we consumers, we are very canny. Once those prices go up, we will switch and make different choices.",
      "So that is why economists believe that this kind of tariff regime is one where we will see prices rise, but not keep rising. Now, that does not really help you if you are going out and shopping. I understand that. But maybe the best news that I can have is that you are not going to feel like you did from the year 2021 to 2022, where it just felt like prices were going up, up, up, up, up.",
      "It is likely to be that prices and the Consumer Price Index, from the way that the Fed looks at this, the PCE index, these measures of inflation will start to rise over the next few weeks \u2013 few months. Then they will kind of steady.",
      "But the problem, Major, is that consumers are going to be stuck with price levels that are higher. And I think that is going to be very hard to swallow for anyone who is in the lower to middle earning category.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jill, one other part of the economic scenario I want to discuss with you, because when people talk about inflation, they say, just tell me what energy cost is and I will tell you what inflation is going to be.",
      "But yet there is a dual reality there.",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Yes.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Natural gas and prices at the pump are down, but electricity paid for by consumers, either businesses or at home, are up.",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Yes.",
      "I mean, the great news is that prices at the pumps, OK, totally happy with that. Everyone's good. The price of crude oil sort of in the low 60s, no problem. That electric \u2013 the electricity story is a story of artificial intelligence, because, to build artificial intelligence, it needs a lot of energy in the term \u2013 in terms of electricity or in the form of electricity.",
      "That's why you are seeing those prices go up. But, again, what I have come back to over this process of the last few years, the last five years of the \u2013 all these different impacts on the economy, we have never been here before. And so what I want to try to emphasize is that we can't hang our hat on what has happened in the past.",
      "Right now, I can look at a lot of different companies and say, wow, these companies are making a ton of money, big technology companies. We are seeing the S&P 500, the Nasdaq, the Dow all at all-time highs. And you have to reckon with the problem, the other side of that, which is, consumers feel burdened.",
      "And I think that's going to be the story of this year and next. How will consumers get out of this? If the labor market weakens from here, I think that's a problem. If we see a resumption of growth and the labor market starts to strengthen, the average worker will be able to afford what's going on in the economy.",
      "But it does come down to that labor market.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jill, deeply unfair, 40 seconds. What has A.I.'s influence been on the labor market?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: You know, hard to say. In 40 seconds, what I can tell you is, not yet. That's the major takeaway, because we know that there are some areas where there's a lot of hiring within A.I.",
      "There are companies that are using A.I. to increase their productivity. But there is no evidence yet that A.I. is taking everybody's job, so whew, whew. We have got a few minutes to worry about that.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: A few minutes to worry about that, among many other things.",
      "Jill Schlesinger, always a pleasure. Thank you so much for joining us.",
      "And we will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. I invite you to please stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: For a daily dose of political news, analysis, and so much more throughout the week, please join me for The Takeout. We're on every weeknight at 5:00 p.m. on our CBS News 24/7 streaming channel, also available on our apps, CBS News and Paramount+.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: We will be right back with Senators Chris Coons and James Lankford for a bipartisan conversation on uniting America, plus the leading researcher on political violence, University of Chicago Professor Robert Pape.",
      "Please stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to \"FACE THE NATION.\"",
      "For a look at how Congress may, may help bridge political divisions the country presently, we turn to a couple of lawmakers with a lot of experience in that space. Democratic Senator Chris Coons, who joins us from Wilmington, Delaware, Republican Senator James Lankford, who joins us from Oklahoma City.",
      "Gentlemen, you have a well-earned reputation both for preaching bipartisanship, taking the rhetorical temperature in Washington and nationwide down a notch or two.",
      "Senator Coons, I want to start with you. After the events of this week, do you feel that's harder than ever to achieve?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS COONS (D-DE): It is. And, Major, thank you for a chance to be on with you and with my friend, Senator Lankford.",
      "The brutal assassination of Charlie Kirk, while he was in the middle of a debate on a college campus, goes to the very heart of what it means to be American, of the importance of the First Amendment of free speech. And someone like Charlie Kirk, who was a nationally known figure, who dedicated himself to debate, to engagement with his political adversaries, should not have paid with his life for the opportunity to speak out. No matter how much I might deeply disagree with his political views, the idea that he would be killed in such a grotesque and public way has to bring all of us to reflect about how hard it's getting because the internet is an accelerant. It is driving extremism in our country. It's driving us apart left and right. And leaders like Senator Lankford, Governor Cox have an obligation and an opportunity to join with leaders from my party in urging folks to set aside any thought of political violence and to respect each other, even as we keep advancing our political differences through discourse.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Lankford, do you ever, at times, feel as if your appeals for better angels, calmer rhetoric, more bipartisanship is shouting into an internet void?",
      "SENATOR JAMES LANKFORD, (R-OK): It is because the algorithm pushes people to the most extreme. The algorithm is all \u2013 on social media is always pushing, who's the angriest, who's the loudest, who says the craziest things. That's what gets repeated over and over and over again. So, any time that there is cogent dialogue or an issue on something where people may disagree, but they're having a \u2013 a civil conversation on it, that gets pushed aside towards someone that's just angry and \u2013 and focused.",
      "This is somewhat human nature to be able to say we disagree. We find areas where we disagree, and we try to be able to solve those. The best way to be able to solve those is through words, talking it out, finding an opportunity to be able to do it. But I would tell you, this kind of anger is as old as Cain and Abel, to be able to go back and say, I'm mad at you, so I'm going to try to destroy you. Whether it's destroy you online or to try to humiliate you or to cancel you or to, in this case, try to murder you publicly. It is \u2013 it is painful to be able to see that part of humanity. And it is better for us to be able to push better angels.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Lankford, first to you, then Senator Coons.",
      "Senator Lankford, are you afraid for your own security right now?",
      "SENATOR JAMES LANKFORD: I am \u2013 I am attentive to my own security, how about that, for myself and for my family. My staff and I have to \u2013 have to talk through each public event. But we've had to do that for a while.",
      "As you may know well, there have been 14,000 threats against members of Congress just this calendar year. This is not new. But it continues to be able to rise. as we've seen Democratic lawmakers in Minnesota, in their own home, have a home invasion and be murdered in their home. As we've seen a governor in Pennsylvania have his home set on fire. It's not just public events, it's also in our private spaces as well that we're keenly aware that there are people that are irrational, that do irrational acts.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Coons?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS COONS: I agree that for all of us who serve in public life, whether it's leading a non-profit or a church, teaching in a school, or being a public advocate, someone engaged in public debate, as Charlie Kirk was, the risk is getting higher. And to have to worry about the safety of your own family, if you step forward to serve as a judge, if you write editorials, if you lead a non-profit or if you serve in Congress or run for president, to have to worry not just about your own physical safety but the safety of your spouse and children, I think, weakens our ability to have good and robust debates, to have a well-led nation and to demonstrate to the world that we're a nation committed to free speech, but where we reject political violence.",
      "So, of course, anyone in public life today is more concerned about the tragedy in Utah, about the incidents that Senator Lankford just referenced, the attempt to kidnap the governor of Michigan, to assault Speaker Pelosi's husband, the shooting of Steve Scalise and the shootings at other members of Congress. The recent incidents have gotten worse and worse, and I think I know the reason. It's principally because the internet is fueling and accelerating those deep-seated inclinations towards violence and seeing others as enemies, that James was referencing, and there are steps we can and should take in Congress to address that.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The administering this weekend, as I'm sure you two are both aware, putting before Congress $58 billion in security for members of Congress, the judiciary and the like.",
      "Senator Coons, you believe Congress will be disposed to agree to that?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS COONS: I hope that we will step up and invest more. I just hosted a bipartisan event last week on protecting state judges, and we had state judicial leaders from across the country, from Delaware and Texas and many other states, talk about harrowing incidents and tragic killings of the members of the judiciary. I hope we will invest in securing our public life because incidents like this tragedy in Utah, like the murder of Melissa and her husband, Mark Hortman, in Minnesota, frankly, fuel further anger in our country. And the ways in which folks are then taking the horrific images of these incidents and propagating them on the internet adds fuel to the fire.",
      "We can and should pass bills, as we just did, Senator Cruz and Senator Klobuchar worked together to pass, and President Trump signed into law, the Take It Down Act, to remove some of the most harmful pornographic revenge porn images from the internet. And we have a bill right in front of us, the Kids Online Safety Act, that's broadly bipartisan, that we should pass to help reduce some of the risks and harms to our families and our country from the internet.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Lankford, I misspoke, that's $58 million, not $58 billion, but it's a substantial sum.",
      "SENATOR JAMES LANKFORD: Yes, it is a substantial sum. What was funny was I was going to actually correct you on that, let you know it's an \"m\" not a \"b\" on that particular one. But it is something to be able to set aside and say, what are we doing? It's not \u2013 it is about the person and their family, but it's also about the title. It's about the task. Because that person represents that state, that \u2013 that part of the nation, that particular task.",
      "My wife and I often talk about the fact that I have this title of senator for a season. Someone else had it before me. Someone else will have it after me. But while I have it, I'm a steward of that task and that responsibility. And so, when we're talking about protecting judges and protecting individual, it's not just their personal safety, it is really declaring to the nation that we believe that these tasks are hard, that they should be intense debate, that we have very difference perspective. Chris Coons and I are very close friends, but have very different ideas on some things, but we have the ability to represent our individual states and set of ideas and to be able to talk those two things out and to be able to bring things together and say, I know areas where we disagree. Where do we agree? How can we solve it? That is where we are at our best as Americans is to say, we don't oppress each other. We try to be able to find common ground and to be able to move forward as we can.",
      "But as Chris has mentioned, the Oline Kids Safety Act is a great piece of legislation to be able to protect our kids. We are seeing people radicalized online on social media and through the internet in the United States by other Americans and by the algorithm that's there. And I will tell you, as recently as just a couple of weeks ago, I was in a school in Oklahoma, that now Oklahoma schools have banned all cellphones from bell to bell at school. You cannot have a cellphone on your \u2013 on your \u2013 on from bell to bell on campus. And the principals and the teachers all talk about how dramatically different the environment is on campus right now because people are looking up, people are interacting, people are talking again. They're not just staring at their phone. They're not getting fed all this vitriol all day long. And so, it changes the mood of everything just by looking at each other in the face and saying, let's see if we can work this out.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Lankford, I'm going to bring up something that's playing out through the country right now, and it's making all the things you and Senator Coons have talked about more difficult, which is, people who have posted about Charlie Kirk have jobs and are being fired because what they posted online has been viewed by their personnel directors or leaders as inappropriate. At any governmental level or in the private sector, are you comfortable having someone fired for an utterance about Charlie Kirk's death?",
      "SENATOR JAMES LANKFORD: Yes, this is about protecting the individual businesses. And what people are seeing is, in this cancel culture that still persists, that if you voice something that becomes a big pushback from the community, the employer will step up and say, hey, you're about to kill our business based on what you're saying online. Everyone has to understand what they say privately online can get connected to their business.",
      "We have a veterinarian clinic in Oklahoma City right now that \u2013 that one of the veterinarians posted something just absolutely horrific about now we're culling out the sick ones right after Charlie Kirk was murdered, that now there's been big pushback through that veterinary clinic because people are say, OK, this is the person \u2013 do I want to do business with that person if they have that belief?",
      "So, this is part of the challenge that we have with social media and with employments. Employers are going to say, don't hurt our business based on the foolish things that you choose to say to be able to say online.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Coons, how about within the federal government?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Well, the way James put it there, I think, is a good balance between, it's OK to have codes of conduct, to say to an employee, you shouldn't be speaking out on behalf of this company or this department of the federal government. Where your role, for example, requires that you be trusted, and that you not take partisan political positions. One of the challenges of the intersection of the line between social media and one's conduct on behalf of the government is that today we can see into your internal views.",
      "But it's not that new. So, let's imagine that you're a career federal prosecutor or you're a judge. Historically, there have been clear rules against engaging in partisan politics while you are performing those functions. The internet just makes it easier for folks to police and punish those who make statements that are considered extreme or out of the mainstream.",
      "Cancel culture is a real challenge to us, to balancing free speech with positions of responsibility. And we have to find our way through this together in a way that offers some grace and humility while celebrating the free speech that is the foundation of our republic and urging people to think twice before they post things that are outrageous online.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Lankford, the country's going to look to Congress here in the next couple of weeks to avert a government shutdown, also possibly extend soon to expire Affordable Care Act subsidies that help afford insurance. In this climate, and with those eyes on the nation upon Congress, how do you expect that to play out?",
      "SENATOR JAMES LANKFORD: I expect us to be able to solve the budget issues, which the American people expect to be able to do as well. These are hard issues. We're sent to be able to do hard things. We should do hard things on it. We should not, first and foremost, have a government shutdown. We have $37 trillion in debt right now. We should have hard conversations about debt and deficit, but they shouldn't be during a government shutdown.",
      "What we're currently arguing right now about is a seven-week extension on the current budget spending to say, we're not changing anything, but for the seven \u2013 next seven weeks, let's just hold it until we get a longer budget agreement and can actually come to agreement. What has been floated is a $300 billion requirement by some of my Democratic colleagues to say, if we don't spend an additional $300 billion, we're not going to keep the government open the next seven weeks. This is also a subsidy, an insurance subsidy, that was put in place during Covid, and just after Covid to say, due to the health care issues around Covid, we're going to extend additional insurance coverage that's there.",
      "Covid and the crisis of Covid is now past on it. It's difficult to say we should spent an additional $300 billion just to stay open the next seven weeks due to a Covid emergency at this point.",
      "So, yes, we'll have \u2013 we'll have hard conversations. But let's have it. Let's \u2013 let's talk it out and let's figure it out.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Coons, you're going to get the last word. Respond to Senator Lankford on that.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Well, this is an area where Senator Lankford and I disagree. We are both appropriators. We both want to find a way to work together, to keep the government open. But the Republican-only bill that was passed earlier this year, the so-called big, beautiful bill, threatens to raise rates for health care for millions of Americans and to throw millions more off of health care.",
      "I think there are ways we can reduce the harm to Americans' health care through the appropriations process. The bill that we both voted for in our committee in July would restore many of the proposed deep cuts to the National Institutes of Health, for example, one positive step forward. We have to find a way to resolve these issues and reduce or reverse some of the harm that's being done to Americans' health care.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Chris Coons, Delaware Democratic, James Lankford, Oklahoma Republican, thank you both. I appreciate it.",
      "And we'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back.",
      "We're going to take a closer look at the problem of political violence in America. And we're joined now, I'm glad to say, by University of Chicago Professor Robert Pape. He is the founding director of the Chicago Project on Security and Threats.",
      "Professor, it's great to have you with us. Thanks for joining us.",
      "What are the trend lines and what is the key terminology you want my audience to understand?",
      "ROBERT PAPE (Professor of Political Science, University Of Chicago): We are now in a watershed moment for what I call the era of violent populism in America. This era is defined, first and foremost, by two factors. Number one, a rising tide of political violence on both the right and the left. And just think, and I'll only go back to 2002. Just think of the attack \u2013 the assassination attempt on Nancy Pelosi, Democratic leader of the House. Missed her. Almost killed her husband. The attempt on Brett Kavanaugh, conservative Supreme Court justice. Two attempts on Republican candidate Donald Trump. And then the \u2013 in Minnesota, just a few months ago, not just attempts, but actual assassinations of Democratic leaders. Josh Shapiro, governor of Pennsylvania. And now we see Charlie Kirk assassinated. And what we are seeing is this clear rising trend in numbers of attacks.",
      "Side by side with that, though, we are also seeing a rising tide, a groundswell of support for political violence on both the right and the left that corresponds with this rising trend of political violence on both the right and the left.",
      "Our center at the University of Chicago Project on Security and Threats, we have been conducting highly reliable national surveys on political violence \u2013 the support for political violence among Americans for over four years. We started this in the summer of 2021. Our most recent survey in May found higher levels of support for political violence on both the right and the left than we have ever seen. And that's one of the reasons why I rang the alarm bell with that big op-ed in \"The New York Times\" in June, saying, we're on the cusp of major political violence. And I'm sorry to say, we're now right in the grip of violent populism.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And in that survey data, is it that people who respond to your surveys say to reconcile myself to the political outcome I want, I will be willing to resort to violence. Is that the key connection point?",
      "ROBERT PAPE: The key connection is the particular political grievance. So, we asked, just give you an example, 39 percent of Democrats say they agree that the use of force is justified to remove Donald Trump from the presidency. When we go deeper to probe, what do they mean by use of force? Fifty-five percent are talking about assassinations. They're talking about lethal uses of force. That's why we use that term.",
      "On the right, we also asked \u2013 very same survey, we found 24 percent of Republicans agree that Donald Trump is justified in using the U.S. military to suppress Democratic protesters. So, these are very specific questions. We have a whole slew of these questions so that we really can speak with great precision about what are the grievances that people want to say use of force is justified. We know what the meaning of that term is. And then we can see, Democrat, Republican in the cross tabs.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Does your research buttress the point that both Senator Lankford and Senator Coons made, which is, the internet is an accelerant and amplifier?",
      "RICHARD PAPE: It's an accelerant, but it's not the root cause. So, studying this problem now for five years, I have found that, just as around the world, big, social change drives political violence. We see this in other countries around the world. But the details of the change vary.",
      "We are now moving, for the first time in our country's 250-year history, from a white majority democracy to a white minority democracy. In 1990, we were 76 percent non-Hispanic white. Today, we're 57 percent non-Hispanic white. It will be another ten years, maybe 15 if we deport a lot of those undocumented illegal immigrants, before we make the transition to a truly white minority democracy.",
      "Well, this generational change is happening \u2013 it started about ten years ago where the real tipping point generation and corresponds with the rise of Donald Trump, why his issue of immigration is meteoric, why it's morphed from immigration, meaning stop people costing the border, to now deporting mass numbers of people because there are people on the right who want to stop or reverse this, and also the virulent reaction to Donald Trump on the left, on parts of the left, who want to keep this going. This is really the taproot, and that's why we need to expect \u2013 this, left to its own devices, will get worse and be with us for ten years.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: So, this is a demographic story that is creating a political backlash that gets amplified and accelerated online? Do I have that right?",
      "RICHARD PAPE: Yes. You've got it exactly right. And these are why \u2013 it's not the internet is not important, it's a reinforcing factor. And there is a \u2013",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: In other words, it's too simplistic to say it's the internet?",
      "RICHARD PAPE: Exactly, because that's what \u2013 a few years ago, people challenged my findings and I said, oh, no, no, we'll just deplatform people. So, the problem here is just the internet, so we're going to de- platform x, y, and z. We de-platformed x, y, and z. And, you know what, didn't miss a beat.",
      "And the reason is because, yes, it is an additional \u2013 it's like throwing gasoline on the fire, but the internet is not the fire itself. There's something going on, which is really radicalizing our politics. And I'm sorry to say, this is a story that we see around the world, in other countries, other times, and so this is \u2013 this is the social change leading to radicalized politics that changes winners and losers in our society for real, and that's leading to political violence.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Professor, it has always been a hallmark of this country, we have sort of thought about ourselves as having this experiment that has lots of differences of opinion, spasms of violence, but in the end we reconcile and move forward. Are you any more or less optimistic about that and that underlying assumption about the core ability of America than you were previously?",
      "RICHARD PAPE: The future is in our hands. This is not locked in with destiny. That said, if we do nothing, this will keep getting worse. The number one thing we have to do is we need our political leaders to step up. And we just saw an instance of that, just previously, where we have senators from both sides of the aisle making a joint video appearance. Well, that's really quite \u2013 to condemn violence. That's important because the leaders can restrain their own constituents. When they bad-mouth the other side's constituents, our data shows, that makes everything worse. That's the worst of all possible worlds because it produces defiance. We need to step that up. What would step that up? A summit between President Trump, Governor Newsom and Governor Pritzker, a public session where they all together condemn political violence.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Professor Pape, I am very glad you're here. Modeling behavior matters in many contexts in life, political and otherwise. Thank you very much.",
      "We'll be back in just a moment.",

    "summary": "Rep. Michael McCaul, a foreign policy leader who had strongly supported Ukraine, warned Sunday that Russian President Vladimir Putin is \"testing the resolve of NATO.\"",
    "story": [
      "Texas Republican Rep. Michael McCaul, a foreign policy leader who formerly chaired the House Homeland Security and Foreign Affairs Committees, announced Sunday that he will not seek reelection in 2026 after 11 terms.",
      "On ABC's \"This Week,\" McCaul called it \"the honor of a lifetime\" to serve his constituents of central Texas and chair the two Congressional House committees.",
      "He said he will serve out the remainder of his term but is looking for a \"new challenge\" in the national security and foreign policy realm. In a post on X shortly after the announcement, McCaul wrote that he's \"ready for a new challenge in 2027\".",
      "\"I want to continue to serve the people in this country in national security and foreign policy, and do what I've done the last two decades \u2013 make America stronger and the world safer,\" McCaul said.",
      "McCaul had served as chairman of the powerful House Foreign Affairs Committee and had been one of the strongest advocates for U.S. support for Ukraine. On Sunday, he disputed Mr. Trump's comments last week that the incursion of Russian drones over Poland's airspace could be a mistake.",
      "\"With all deference to the president, I don't think that was a mistake. I think [Russian President Vladimir] Putin is testing the resolve of NATO,\" McCaul said.",
      "McCaul did not announce any plans to run for another office, joining two other House Republicans who have announced they plan to retire. McCaul is one of only four Republicans from Texas whose time in the House predates President Trump's first term.",
      "His announcement comes amid a time of change for Texas Republicans as state lawmakers have pushed through a rare mid-decade redistricting in an effort to gain more seats for the party in the U.S. House. Although according to a CBS News analysis of the districts based on the 2024 vote for Mr. Trump, the ideological makeup of McCaul's district is not likely to change much.",
      "McCaul joins two other Texas Republicans who have already announced they will not seek reelection, although one of them, Rep. Chip Roy, has announced he will instead run for Texas Attorney General.",
      "McCaul most recently led a multi-year investigation into the U.S. withdrawal from Aghanistan, in which 13 service members were killed in a suicide bombing in Kabul. He spoke to \"Face the Nation\" last year about the report, criticizing President Biden who he claimed \"[prioritized] politics and his personal legacy over America's national security interests\".",
      "In 2023 as chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, McCaul led a bipartisan delegation of House members to Taiwan to meet with Taiwanese business leaders and senior government officials in an effort to strengthen economic and defense relationships. The representative was sanctioned by the Chinese Communist Party after the visit, which McCaul wore as \"a badge of honor\".",
      "McCaul told \"This Week\" that the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks changed his life. Before becoming a member of Congress, he worked as a counterterrorism federal prosecutor with the Department of Justice. Looking back at his career as a congressmember, McCaul recounted the events he's seen.",
      "\"I saw the rise of ISIS in the caliphate. As chairman of Foreign Affairs, I saw Afghanistan fall and Putin invade Ukraine, and the Middle East on fire, and then the threat from Chairman Xi and China and the Indo-Pacific,\" McCaul said.",
      "Rep. Brian Mast, the Florida Republican who now serves as chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, thanked McCaul in a statement on X \"for being a great leader in the U.S. House\" and \"for setting the example of how to be a diplomat and statesman\".",
      "Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican who is also a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, called McCaul his \"mentor and friend\" and said he is a \"tremendous leader protecting America at home and abroad\" in a post on X.",
      "McCaul's announcement comes at a time when a number of Representatives are leaving their seats at the end of the term to seek other offices, primarily in the U.S. Senate and at the gubernatorial level.",

      "\"No matter how much I might deeply disagree with his political views, the idea that he would be killed in such a grotesque and public way has to bring all of us to reflect about how hard it's getting, because the internet is an accelerant,\" Coons said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Kirk was shot and killed at Utah Valley University last week in what officials described as a \"targeted attack.\" The assassination has spurred calls for lowering the political temperature nationwide, along with efforts to improve bipartisan dialogue in Washington.",
      "Sen. James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican, appeared alongside Coons on Sunday as the two men made an appeal to bipartisanship amid the divisive political climate. Lankford echoed Coons' concerns about the internet and extremism to CBS News' chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett, saying calls for bipartisanship can be drowned out because \"the algorithm pushes people to the most extreme.\"",
      "\"Social media is always pushing who's the angriest, who's the loudest, who says the craziest thing\u00a0\u2014\u00a0that's what gets repeated over and over and over again,\" Lankford said. \"So anytime that there is cogent dialog or an issue on something where people may disagree, but they're having a civil conversation on it, that gets pushed aside towards someone that's just angry and focused.\"",

      "Lankford called the bill \"a great piece of legislation to be able to protect our kids,\" adding that \"we are seeing people radicalize online.\" And he pointed to a cell phone ban in Oklahoma schools that he said teachers have touted for creating a \"dramatically different\" environment.",
      "\"People are looking up, people are interacting, people are talking again,\" Lankford said. \"They're not just staring at their phone. They're not getting fed all this vitriol all day long. And so it changes the mood of everything just by looking at each other in the face and saying, 'let's see if we can work this out.'\"",
      "The comments come after Utah Gov. Spencer Cox called social media a \"cancer on our society\" in the aftermath of Kirk's assassination last week. Cox encouraged people to \"log off, turn off, touch grass, hug a family member, go out and do good in your community.\"",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sens. Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, and James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 14, 2025.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to \"Face The Nation.\" For a look at how Congress may- may help bridge political divisions in the country presently, we turn to a couple of lawmakers with a lot of experience in that space. Democratic Senator Chris Coons, who joins us from Wilmington, Delaware, Republican Senator James Lankford, who joins us from Oklahoma City. Gentlemen, you have a well-earned reputation, both, for preaching bipartisanship, taking the rhetorical temperature in Washington and nationwide down a notch or two. Senator Coons, I want to start with you. After the events of this week, do you feel that's harder than ever to achieve?",
      "SEN. CHRIS COONS: It is. And, Major, thank you, for a chance to be on with you and with my friend, Senator Lankford. The brutal assassination of Charlie Kirk, while he was in the middle of a debate on a college campus, goes to the very heart of what it means to be American, of the importance of the First Amendment, of free speech, and someone like Charlie Kirk, who was a nationally known figure, who dedicated himself to debate, to engagement with his political adversaries, should not have paid with his life for the opportunity to speak out. No matter how much I might deeply disagree with his political views, the idea that he would be killed in such a grotesque and public way has to bring all of us to reflect about how hard it's getting, because the internet is an accelerant. It is driving extremism in our country. It's driving us apart, left and right, and leaders like Senator Lankford, Governor Cox, have an obligation and an opportunity to join with leaders from my party in urging folks to set aside any thought of political violence and to respect each other, even as we keep advancing our political differences through discourse.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Lankford, do you ever at times feel as if your appeals for better angels, calmer rhetoric, more bipartisanship, is shouting into an internet void?",
      "SEN. JAMES LANKFORD: It is, because the algorithm pushes people to the most extreme. The algorithm is all- on social media is always pushing who's the angriest, who's the loudest, who says the craziest thing, that's what gets repeated over and over and over again. So anytime that there is cogent dialogue or an issue on something where people may disagree, but they're having a civil conversation on it, that gets pushed aside, towards someone that's just angry and focused. This is somewhat human nature, to be able to say, we disagree. We find areas where we disagree, and we try to be able to solve those. The best way to be able to solve those is through words, talking it out, finding an opportunity to be able to do it. But I would tell you, this kind of anger is as old as Cain and Abel. To be able to go back and say, I'm mad at you, so I'm going to try to destroy you, whether it's destroy you online, or to try to humiliate you, or to cancel you, or to, in this case, try to murder you publicly. It is- it is painful to be able to see that part of humanity, and it is better for us to be able to push better angels.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Lankford, first you, then Senator Coons. Senator Lankford, are you afraid for your own security right now?",
      "SEN. LANKFORD: I am- I am attentive to my own security, how about that, for myself and for my family. My staff and I have to- have to talk through each public event, but we've had to do that for a while. As you may know well, there have been 14,000 threats against members of Congress just this calendar year. This is not new, but it continues to be able to rise. As we've seen, Democratic lawmakers in Minnesota, in their own home, have a home invasion, to be murdered in their home, as we've seen a governor in Pennsylvania have his home set on fire. It's not just public events, it's also in our private spaces as well, that we're keenly aware that there are people that are irrational, that do irrational acts.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Coons?",
      "SEN. COONS: I agree that for all of us who serve in public life, whether it's leading a nonprofit or a church, teaching in a school, or being a public advocate, someone engaged in public debate as Charlie Kirk was, the risk is getting higher. And to have to worry about the safety of your own family, if you step forward to serve as a judge, if you write editorials, if you lead a nonprofit, or if you serve in Congress or run for president, to have to worry not just about your own physical safety, but the safety of your spouse and children, I think, weakens our ability to have good and robust debates, to have a well-led nation, and to demonstrate to the world that we're a nation committed to free speech, but where we reject political violence. So of course, anyone in public life today is more concerned about the tragedy in Utah, about the incidents that Senator Lankford just referenced, the attempt to kidnap the governor of Michigan, to assault Speaker Pelosi's husband, the shooting of Steve Scalise and the shootings at other members of Congress. The recent incidents have gotten worse and worse and I think I know the reason. It's principally because the internet is fueling and accelerating those deep-seated inclinations towards violence and seeing others as enemies that James was referencing. And there are steps we can and should take in Congress to address that.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The administration this weekend, as I'm sure you two are both aware, putting before Congress $58 billion in security for members of Congress, the judiciary and the like. Senator Coons, you believe Congress will be disposed to agree to that?",
      "SEN. COONS: I hope that we will step up and invest more. I just hosted a bipartisan event last week on protecting state judges, and we had state judicial leaders from across the country, from Delaware and Texas and many other states, talk about harrowing incidents and tragic killings of members of the judiciary. I hope we will invest in securing our public life, because incidents like this tragedy in Utah, like the murder of Melissa and her husband Mark Hortman in Minnesota, frankly, fuel further anger in our country, and the ways in which folks are then taking the horrific images of these incidents and propagating them on the internet, adds fuel to the fire. We can and should pass bills, as we just did. Senator Cruz and Senator Klobuchar worked together to pass, and President Trump signed into law, the TAKE IT DOWN Act, to remove some of the most harmful pornographic, revenge porn images from the internet. And we have a bill right in front of us, the Kids Online Safety Act that's broadly bipartisan, that we should pass to help reduce some of the risks and harms to our families in our country, from the internet.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Lankford, I misspoke that's 58 million, not 58 billion, but it's a substantial sum.",
      "SEN. LANKFORD: Yeah, it is a substantial sum. What was funny was I was going to actually correct you on that, to let you know it's an 'M', not a 'B' on that particular one, but it is something to be able to set aside and say, what are we doing? It's not- it is about the person and their family, but it's also about the title. It's about the task, because that person represents that state, that- that part of the nation, that particular task, my wife and I often talk about the fact that I have this title of senator for a season. Someone else had it before me, someone else will have it after me. But while I have it, I'm a steward of that task and that responsibility. And so when we're talking about protecting judges and protecting individuals, it's not just their personal safety. It is really declaring to the nation that we believe that these tasks are hard, that there should be intense debate, that we have very different perspectives. Chris Coons and I are very close friends, but we have very different ideas on some things. But we have the ability to be able to represent our individual states instead of ideas, and to be able to talk those two things out, and to be able to bring things together and say, I know areas where we disagree, where do we agree? How can we solve it? That is where we are at our best as Americans is to say we don't oppress each other. We try to be able to find our common ground and to be able to move forward as we can and- but as Chris has mentioned, the online kids safety Act is a great piece of legislation to be able to protect our kids. We are seeing people radicalize online, on social media and through the internet in the United States, by other Americans and by the algorithm that's there. And I would tell you, as recently as just a couple of weeks ago, I was in a school in Oklahoma that now Oklahoma schools have banned all cell phones from bell to bell at school. You cannot have a cell phone on your- on your- on from bell to bell on campus. And the principals and the teachers all talk about how dramatically different the environment is on campus right now because people are looking up, people are interacting. People are talking again. They're not just staring at their phone. They're not getting fed all this vitriol all day long. And so it changes the mood of everything just by looking at each other in the face and saying, let's see if we can work this out.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Lankford, I'm going to bring up something that's playing out through the country right now, and it's making all the things you and Senator Coons have talked about more difficult, which is people who have posted about Charlie Kirk have jobs and are being fired because what they've posted online has been viewed by their personnel directors or leaders as inappropriate. At any governmental level or in the private sector, are you comfortable having someone fired for an utterance about Charlie Kirk's death?",
      "SEN. LANKFORD: Yeah, this is about protecting the individual businesses. And what people are seeing is this cancel culture that still persists, that if you voice something that becomes a big push back from the community, the employer will step up and say, hey, you're about to kill our business based on what you're saying online. Everyone has to understand what they say privately online can get connected to their business. We have a veterinarian clinic in Oklahoma City right now that one of the veterinarians posted something just absolutely horrific about--and now we're calling out the sick ones right after Charlie Kirk was murdered that now there's been big pushback through that veterinary clinic, because people are saying, okay, this is the person- do I want to do business with that person if they have that belief? So this is part of the challenge that we have with social media and with employments. Employers are going to say, don't hurt our business based on the foolish things that you choose to say, to be able to say online.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Coons, how about within the federal government?",
      "SEN. COONS: Well, the way James put it there, I think, is a good balance between it's okay to have codes of conduct to say to an employee, you shouldn't be speaking out on behalf of this company or this department of the federal government, where your role, for example, requires that you be trusted and that you not take partisan political positions. One of the challenges of the intersection of the line between social media and one's conduct on behalf of the government is that today we can see into your internal views. But it's not that new. So, let's imagine that you're a career federal prosecutor or you're a judge. Historically, there have been clear rules against engaging in partisan politics while you're performing those functions. The internet just makes it easier for folks to police and punish those who make statements that are considered extreme or out of the mainstream. Cancel culture is a real challenge to us, to balancing free speech with positions of responsibility, and we have to find our way through this together in a way that offers some grace and humility while celebrating the free speech that is the foundation of our republic, and urging people to think twice before they post things that are outrageous online.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Lankford, the country is going to look to Congress here in the next couple of weeks to avert a government shutdown. Also possibly extend soon to expire Affordable Care Act subsidies that help people afford insurance. In this climate and with those eyes of the nation upon Congress, how do you expect that to play out?",
      "SEN. LANKFORD: I expect us to be able to solve the budget issues, which the American people expect to be able to- to do as well. These are hard issues. We're sent to be able to do hard things. We should do hard things on it. We should not, first and foremost, have a government shutdown. We have $37 trillion in debt right now. We should have hard conversations about debt and deficit, but they shouldn't be during a government shutdown. What we're currently arguing right now about is a seven-week extension on the current budget spending, to say we're not changing anything, but for the next seven weeks, let's just hold it until we get a longer budget agreement and can actually come to agreement. What has been floated is a $300 billion requirement, by some of my Democratic colleagues, to say, if we don't spend an additional $300 billion, we're not going to keep the government open the next seven weeks. This is also a subsidy, an insurance subsidy, that was put in place during COVID and just after COVID, to say, due to the health care issues around COVID, we're going to extend additional insurance coverage that's there. COVID and the crisis of COVID has now passed on it, it's difficult to say we should spend an additional $300 billion just to stay open the next seven weeks due to a COVID emergency at this point. So yes, we'll have- we'll have hard conversations, but let's have it. Let's- let's talk it out. Let's figure it out.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Coons, you're going to get the last word. Respond to Senator Lankford on that.",
      "SEN. COONS: Well, this is an area where Senator Lankford and I disagree. We are both appropriators. We both want to find a way to work together to keep the government open, but the Republican-only bill that was passed earlier this year, the so-called Big Beautiful Bill, threatens to raise rates for health care for millions of Americans and to throw millions more off of health care. I think there are ways we can reduce the harm to Americans' healthcare through the appropriations process. The bill that we both voted for in our committee in July would restore many of the proposed deep cuts to the National Institutes of Health for example, one positive step forward. We have to find a way to resolve these issues and reduce or reverse some of the harm that's being done to Americans' health care.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Chris Coons, Delaware Democrat. Senator James Lankford, Oklahoma Republican. Thank you both. I appreciate it. And we'll be right back."

    "summary": "House Speaker Mike Johnson said \"I think this could be a turning point\" for the country in the aftermath of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's death, urging leaders to \"turn down the rhetoric.\"",
    "story": [
      "In the wake of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, House Speaker Mike Johnson said Sunday that \"I think this could be a turning point\" for the country, while urging leaders to \"turn down the rhetoric\" amid a divisive political climate.",
      "Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that lawmakers should stop treating policy disputes as an \"existential threat to democracy or the Republic,\" while urging them to stop \"calling one another names.\"",
      "\"Calling people Nazis and fascists is not helpful,\" Johnson said. \"There are some deranged people in society, and when they see leaders using that kind of language so often now increasingly, it spurs them on to action. We have to recognize that reality and address it appropriately.\"",
      "The speaker told CBS News' chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett that he's \"heartened to know\" that lawmakers on both sides of the aisle \"are stepping up and saying that and addressing it.\"",
      "Kirk was shot and killed at Utah Valley University last week in what authorities have described as a \"targeted attack.\" Authorities have arrested 22-year-old Tyler Robinson on charges of aggravated murder, obstruction of justice and felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury, according to an inmate booking sheet from the Utah County Sheriff's Office. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said Sunday that the suspect is not cooperating with authorities as they try to \"to learn more about what that motive actually was.\"",
      "The speaker outlined how Kirk's assassination has been felt on Capitol Hill, saying there's \"a mixture of anger and sadness and fear, frankly, on the part of a lot of people \u2014 it cast a large shadow across the country, and the nation's capital.\"",
      "\"My good friend Charlie would not want any of us to be consumed by despair,\" Johnson said. \"He would want us to go forward boldly, that was his message, and to do it in love. And I think that, I hope, is the message that continues in the days ahead.\"",
      "Johnson described the efforts to honor Kirk's memory in Congress, including a moment of prayer and silent reflection on the House floor Wednesday, shortly after Kirk's death, while outlining that a prayer and reflection vigil will be held at the Kennedy Center in Washington later Sunday, along with a moment for members' reflection and prayer that he will lead Monday.",
      "\"This will continue,\" Johnson said. \"I think that the country needs to see leaders in Congress and leaders with platforms all around the country speaking truth and bringing calm to the situation.\"",
      "Johnson invoked President Abraham Lincoln's appeal to the nation's \"better angels,\" while urging the adoption of \"the manner of Charlie Kirk.\"",
      "\"While he loved vigorous debate and he believed in the free marketplace of ideas and advancing truth boldly, he also was motivated by love for his fellow man, because he never hated the person on the other side of the table,\" Johnson said. \"And I think everyone would do well to be reminded of that model.\"",
      "The speaker said he's been speaking with members in recent days about the fear that those holding public office are feeling in the aftermath of Kirk's death and has been \"trying to calm the nerves to assure them that we will make certain that everyone has a level of security that's necessary.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the White House is sending a $58 million request to Congress to increase security for the executive and judicial branches in the wake of Kirk's assassination, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CBS News on Saturday. And the Trump administration expressed support for increased funding to protect congressional lawmakers, but may defer to the legislative branch.",
      "Johnson said House GOP leaders are \"evaluating all the options\" to ensure resources will be available for lawmakers' residential security and personal security. And he added that \"it does take a certain measure of courage to step out and to lead,\" saying first responders, members of the military and political figures do it every day.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with House Speaker Mike Johnson that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 14, 2025.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, who joins us this morning from Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, it's good to see you. I appreciate your time. The burdens of speakership are always manifold. You know that. Previous speakers I've covered know that, but they feel particularly heavy after the events of this week. I just want to ask you, Mr. Speaker, how are you doing?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: I'm doing okay, Major. Thanks for asking. No question, it was a difficult week for the country. Certainly, it was felt on Capitol Hill. There's a mixture of, you know, anger and sadness and fear, frankly, on the part of a lot of people. It cast a large shadow across the country and the nation's capital. But what I do know, Major, is that my good friend Charlie would not want any of us to be consumed by despair. He would want us to go forward boldly, that was his message, and to do it in love. And I think that, I hope, is the message that continues in the days ahead.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: It's not common for this show to pick up on something said by Connecticut's Young Democrats and Connecticut's Young Republicans, but they put out a statement that has gotten quite a bit of attention on the internet, saying as follows, \"there is no place in our country for such acts, regardless of political disagreements.\" Do you believe on Capitol Hill there will be a method to forge any sort of bipartisan remembrance of Charlie Kirk?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: There will be. You know, we had a moment of prayer and silent reflection on the floor on Wednesday within an hour of his passing. There will be, I participated in a large vigil here in Baton Rouge at LSU, my alma mater, on Friday night. Tonight, we'll have a big, I hope, bipartisan prayer and reflection vigil in Capitol Hill at the Kennedy Center. There will be a members reflection and prayer moment that I'll lead on Monday night. This will continue. I think that the country needs to see leaders in Congress and leaders with platforms all around the country speaking truth and bringing calm to the situation. We should appeal, as Lincoln reminded us so many years ago, to the better angels among us all. And I think this is a real moment for America [TECHNICAL DISRUPTION] -- affirmatively. And I think one of the ways to do that, Major, is to adopt the manner of Charlie Kirk because while he loved vigorous debate and he believed in the free marketplace of ideas, and advancing truth boldly, he also was motivated by love for his fellow man because he never hated the person on the other side of the table. And I think everyone would do well to be reminded of that model.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Mr. Speaker, you mentioned the word fear a moment ago. It is on the lips of members of Congress in ways I've never experienced before. They are talking openly. They already have canceled events. Other members are talking about whether or not it's proper in their family conversations to seek re-election. How do you feel this particular space of anxiety for your membership, Republican and Democrat?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: Yeah, well, I've been talking with a lot of them over the last few days about that and trying to calm the nerves, to assure them that we will, we will make certain that everyone has a level of security that's necessary, that the resources will be there for their residential security and their personal security. We're evaluating all the options for that. But also, to be- to be, you know, reminded that it does take a certain measure of courage to step out and- and to lead. I mean, our first responders do it every day, our members of the military do it every day and political figures as well. But I think if we all adopt these practices together and we turn down the rhetoric, we, you know, cease with this idea that, you know, policy disputes are somehow an existential threat to democracy or the republic, we stop calling one another names. I mean calling people Nazis and fascists is not helpful. Look, there are some deranged people in society and when they see leaders using that kind of language, so often now, increasingly, it spurs them on to action. We have to recognize that reality and address it appropriately. And I'm heartened to know, Major, and to see that many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are stepping up and saying that and addressing it. I think this could be a turning point, frankly, to use Charlie's term, for the country, and I hope that's true.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Would that turning point, from your vantage point, Mr. Speaker, because I know you had a long conversation with President Trump, extend to the White House itself?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: Well, of course. Look, the President knew Charlie very well. He was like a family member to the Trumps. Many of us felt that close association with him, and he admired Charlie's approach to public debate. And you've heard him say that publicly. He was- Charlie was a good man, and I think the best way we honor his memory is to continue to do that very thing, and not shy away from debate, to keep the free marketplace of ideas going, but to work on the tone of those debates. Because I think that- I think that serves the best of our principles, our Judeo-Christian heritage as a nation, our civil discourse, and we got to return to that.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Mr. Speaker, several issues pending before Congress, not the least of which is keeping the government open. I know you prefer a seven-week clean CR, but there is a press for other issues. Extending Obamacare tax subsidies. There's been a push this weekend for Russia sanctions backed by Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, in the Senate. Will either of those, from your vantage point, get into something to keep the government open?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: Well, listen, we've been working very hard in the House to restore regular order in the appropriations government funding process, and that's something that no one's really seen for a long time on Capitol Hill. But I'm encouraged that, in a bipartisan fashion, our House Appropriations Committee has passed all 12 of the annual appropriations bills through the committee. We've got three off the House floor. The Senate's passed a few, and then last week, we voted to move into a conference [TECHNICAL DISRUPTION] --",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: -- Okay, Mr. Speaker, I believe there's a technical glitch that has forced us to lose your audio. We're going to take a quick break, and we'll come right back to House Speaker Mike Johnson in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in just a moment.",
      "[COMMERCIAL BREAK]",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to Face the Nation. Because technical gremlins lurk everywhere, they got in between my conversation with House Speaker Mike Johnson. Mr. Speaker, I'm glad to have you back. You were in the middle of answering about Obamacare tax subsidies, possible sanctions against Russia and a government funding mechanism. Please continue.",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: Yeah, sorry about the interruption there. Listen, we're very encouraged that we've been able to restore the regular appropriations, regular order process --",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: -- Right, but are we going to get this done? Are those two other things going to be added to the process, Mr. Speaker?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: We'll have to see. I got to build consensus around all of it, but I think we'll need a short-term funding measure. A clean CR that will allow more time to figure all this out. We certainly hope that Democrats will go along on that, because, if not, they really have no excuse. If they shut the government down, it would be their unilateral decision to do so.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And when Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, says, as he did this weekend, now is the time for Russia sanctions. President Trump opened the door on tariffs against India and China as a way to create economic leverage to end the war in Ukraine. Where do you stand on all that?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: Listen, I do believe that desperate times call for desperate measures, and I think appropriate sanctions on Russia are far overdue. I mean, I think there's a big appetite for that in Congress, so we're willing to work with the White House and our Senate colleagues in the House to get that done and I'm anxious to do it, personally.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Are you waiting for the President to give you the green light or might Congress act on this on its own volition?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: Well, Congress really can't do this on its own volition because, of course, the President would need to sign whatever we do into law. So it has to be a partnership, but we defer to the commander in chief. I mean, the President is a strong and bold leader on the world stage. He has brokered peace around the world and other conflicts in a way that no one before him has been able to do, and so we're trusting that he can use that same force and that same approach to bring about, finally, an end to this war in Ukraine. Everyone in America wants that bloodshed to end, and President Trump is forcing that, and I certainly [TECHNICAL DISRUPTION]--",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Okay. Mr. Speaker, I'm told that the technical difficulties keep arising, so a bit prematurely we're going to end our conversation here to spare you and spare our audience from continued mayhem by technical gremlins. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the time. Thank you for joining us on Face the Nation."

      "Conservative activist Charlie Kirk was shot and killed at Utah Valley University on Wednesday as he addressed a large crowd at an outdoor debate. Officials described it as a \"targeted attack,\" and it drew\u00a0condemnation from both sides of the political aisle as authorities launched a massive search for the suspect.",
      "On Friday, officials announced they have a person in custody for the fatal shooting. They identified him as 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, who resides in southern Utah. Robinson was arrested on charges of aggravated murder, obstruction of justice and felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury, according to an inmate booking sheet from the Utah County Sheriff's Office.",
      "Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray is reviewing the evidence to determine the appropriate charges and plans to file them on Tuesday, Christopher Ballard, chief of staff for the Utah County Attorney's Office, confirmed to CBS Saturday. Robinson could make his first court appearance Tuesday afternoon, Ballard said.",
      "Kirk, who co-founded the right-wing advocacy group Turning Point USA, was 31. He is survived by his wife, Erika, and two young children.",
      "Turning Point USA announced Saturday that a public funeral for Kirk will be held on Sunday, Sept. 21, at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.",
      "Here is what we know so far about the assassination and ongoing investigation.",
      "Who is the suspect?",
      "More details about Robinson and what happened before and after the attack are emerging.",
      "Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said Robinson is not a student at Utah Valley University, where the attack took place, and has been living with his family in Washington County, located in the southwestern corner of the state. Family members said Robinson had \"become more political\" in recent years, the governor said.",
      "Utah State University said Robinson briefly attended the school for one semester in 2021. According to the Utah System of Higher Education, Robinson was a third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship program at Dixie Technical College in St. George, Utah.",
      "Robinson's father owns a business installing kitchen countertops and cabinets and his mother is a licensed social worker, according to public records and their social media accounts. Robinson is the oldest of three brothers.",
      "\"They are very supportive parents who loved their boys and are involved in the community,\" a neighbor who said she knew the Robinson family well but had not seen Robinson in a few years told CBS News. She also said the parents were supportive of the country and of President Trump.",
      "State records show that Robinson registered to vote as unaffiliated. He is listed as an inactive voter in state records, meaning he didn't vote in the last two elections. He was not old enough to vote in 2020.",
      "Robinson had no prior felony or misdemeanor convictions and no prior violent offenses, according to a Public Safety Assessment Report filed in Utah state court.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel said he was taken into custody at 10 p.m. local time Thursday night, though Utah officials said it was in the early hours of Friday. Records from the Utah County Sheriff's Office Corrections Division show he was booked into jail at 7:58 a.m. local time (9:58 a.m. ET).",
      "Mr. Trump first broke the news on \"Fox and Friends\" that someone had been taken into custody.",
      "\"With a high degree of certainty, we have him in custody. Everyone did a great job,\" the president said.",
      "Cox said messages on Discord, an instant messaging and social media platform, that were reviewed by investigators referenced a rifle wrapped in a towel that was left in the woods and engravings on bullets. The messages came from a person named \"Tyler\" and were shared with an unidentified individual, Cox said.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, a spokesperson for Discord said it had removed an account associated with Robinson for violating the company's \"off-platform behavior policy,\" which prohibits users from engaging in various forms of violence, and will continue to coordinate closely with law enforcement. The spokesperson also said Discord \"found no evidence that the suspect planned this incident or promoted violence\" on the platform itself.",
      "\"We are deeply saddened by this tragedy and extend our condolences to the Kirk family and everyone affected,\" the statement said. \"The messages referenced in recent reporting about planning details do not appear to be Discord messages. These were communications between the suspect's roommate and a friend after the shooting, where the roommate was recounting the contents of a note the suspect had left elsewhere.\"",
      "The governor said authorities believe Robinson acted alone and said there is currently no information that would lead to additional arrests. He told reporters Friday morning he can't answer questions about the possible motive of the suspect.",
      "Robinson is currently on \"special watch\" at the Utah County Jail while he is being evaluated to determine if he is a risk to himself or others, Utah County Sheriff's Spokesperson Sgt. Raymond Ormond told CBS News. Inmates are held in a special housing unit while on special watch.",
      "All inmates are given an initial screening after booking, but some are put on the more intensive special watch until they're screened, depending on the crimes they committed or things they said, Ormond said.",
      "How the suspect was captured",
      "Cox said Robinson's father recognized his son as the subject of photos that were released by law enforcement and urged him to turn himself in.",
      "Robinson admitted to his father that he was the person in the photos, two federal law enforcement sources told CBS News. Robinson said he would rather die by suicide than turn himself in, the federal law enforcement sources said.",
      "Robinson's father called a youth pastor who knows the 22-year-old and is close to the family, and he and the pastor tried to calm Robinson down. The sources said the pastor, who also serves as a court security officer, called the U.S. Marshals Service and other law enforcement agencies. Marshals  then detained Robinson and kept him secure while waiting for the FBI. The FBI later took him into custody.",
      "Investigators reviewed video footage and said they identified Robinson arriving on Utah Valley University's campus in a gray Dodge Challenger at around 8:29 a.m. local time Wednesday, the day of the shooting, according to the governor. Robinson was wearing a plain maroon T-shirt, light-colored shorts, a black hat with a white logo and light-colored shoes, Cox said.",
      "He is believed to have changed clothing on the roof, where the shot was fired from, before changing back into what he was originally wearing. When investigators encountered Robinson, he was wearing clothing consistent with that outfit, the governor said.",
      "Tracking the suspect",
      "On Thursday, Utah Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason described the suspect they were seeking as a male who \"blended in\" with the college community and appeared to be college age.",
      "The public safety department and the Salt Lake City FBI office posted images of someone they called a \"person of interest,\" showing an individual appearing to wear a dark long-sleeve shirt, a hat and sunglasses. More photos posted later on Thursday showed the person wearing a backpack.",
      "Mason said investigators were able to track the shooter's movements before and after the assassination.",
      "According to a probable cause statement filed by investigators after Robinson's arrest, investigators were able to track his movements on campus starting at approximately 11:50 a.m. local time on Wednesday. He was observed entering a building called the Losee Center near where Kirk's event was taking place, which was the shooting location, and going up to the roof, according to the statement.",
      "Mason said the shooter moved to the other side of the building after firing a single shot, then jumped off and fled into a neighborhood off campus. Investigators contacted homeowners with cameras and witnesses to identify leads, he said.",
      "In a news briefing Thursday evening in Orem, Utah, with Patel in attendance, officials released security video that showed a man \u2014 who Mason called a suspect \u2014 running across the roof and then climbing down the side of the building immediately after the shooting.",
      "As he climbed off the edge of the building and dropped down, he \"left some palm impressions, some smudges, some places we're looking to collect DNA,\" along with a shoe print that indicated he was wearing Converse tennis shoes, Mason told reporters while showing the video.",
      "\"It's important to note his black t-shirt, his black pants, and there appears to be some white on the soles of those Converse tennis shoes,\" Mason said. \"Those are all identifiable items that we're looking for.\"",
      "After dropping off the building, the video showed the man moving across a grassy area before entering traffic. Mason said he crossed the street into a wooded area, where the firearm believed to have been used in the shooting was later found.",
      "The FBI said it was offering a reward of up to $100,000 for information that leads law enforcement to identify and arrest the person or people involved in Kirk's assassination. Patel said authorities had received more than 11,000 leads as of Friday morning.",
      "Gun and bullet casings recovered",
      "FBI special-agent-in-charge Robert Bohls said Thursday that investigators recovered a \"high-powered, bolt-action rifle,\" which they believe was the weapon used in the assassination. It was found in a wooded area where the shooter fled and was wrapped in a towel, according to Bohls. The rifle was determined to be a Mauser .30-06-caliber bolt-action rifle, according to the probable cause statement.",
      "Cox said that there were inscriptions on the casings of the bullet that was fired, as well as on the casings of three bullets that were not fired.",
      "According to the probable cause statement, the fired bullet casing contained the inscription, \"Notices Buldge OWO what's this?\" An unfired bullet casing read, \"hey fascist! CATCH!\" followed by an up arrow symbol, a right arrow symbol and three down arrow symbols. And a second unfired casing read, \"O Bella ciao, Bella ciao, Bella ciao, Ciao, ciao!\" A third unfired casing said, \"If you read This, you are GAY Lmao.\"",
      "Cox didn't speculate on the meaning of the inscriptions.",
      "Investigators also have a footwear impression, palm print and forearm imprints that will be analyzed, the FBI official said.",
      "Timeline of \"targeted attack\"",
      "The event where Kirk was speaking was scheduled to begin in the UVU courtyard at noon.",
      "A CBS News review of livestream footage and video metadata indicates Kirk was shot around 12:23 p.m., which is also when the FBI's Patel said Kirk was shot. He was struck in the neck by a single gunshot.",
      "A map produced by CBS News' Confirmed team shows where Kirk was when he was shot \u2014 in the central courtyard of Utah Valley University, which is surrounded by campus buildings.",
      "A university spokeswoman said Wednesday that they believed the shot was fired from the Losee Center. A law enforcement source told CBS News that the gunman appeared to have fired from the building's roof.",
      "The FBI released a video\u00a0\u2014 timestamped at 12:23 p.m. local time \u2014 that appears to show a person climbing off a roof at Utah Valley University and fleeing the scene. Dispatch audio reviewed by CBS News described a person on the roof of a nearby building wearing black clothing and carrying a long rifle.",
      "Video captured at 2:37 p.m. shows officers searching an area around a quarter mile north of the campus.",
      "At 2:40, more than two hours after the shooting, Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social that Kirk had died.",
      "While authorities have not specified a potential motive for the shooting, Mason said they believe it was a \"targeted attack toward one individual.\" Only one shot was fired, and Kirk was the only victim, the commissioner said.",
      "Cox called the shooting \"a political assassination,\" while Mr. Trump, in a video posted to Truth Social, blamed it on \"radical left political violence,\" which he said \"has hurt too many innocent people and taken too many lives.\"",
      "Charlie Kirk's influence in politics",
      "Kirk was shot while he was speaking at a \"Prove Me Wrong\" debate, a trademark event for Kirk's Turning Point USA, which is a conservative organization focused on young people. He would hold political debates with a group that usually consisted of left-leaning attendees.",
      "Kirk had visited the Utah university as part of a nationwide tour of college campuses that was scheduled to continue for the next two months. About 3,000 people attended the outdoor event where he was assassinated, the Utah Department of Public Safety said in a statement.",
      "Mr. Trump called Kirk legendary, saying, \"No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie. He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us.\"",
      "Kirk was a close Trump ally and was credited with galvanizing younger voters during his campaign. He made it his mission to engage more young people in politics and register them to vote. Kirk was also a close friend of the president's son, Donald Trump Jr.",
      "Kirk was the host of \"The Charlie Kirk Show,\" a daily conservative talk radio show and amassed millions of followers on social media.",
      "Kirk's politics, however, weren't without controversy. He pushed false claims about voter fraud after Mr. Trump lost the 2020 presidential election, stoked skepticism about the COVID-19 pandemic and spread anti-trans rhetoric. He also amplified the \"Great Replacement\" conspiracy, which is based on the belief that there's a plot to replace White people with minorities.",
      "He was a friend of JD Vance, who said Kirk advocated \"in public and private\" for Mr. Trump to pick him as his running mate last year.",
      "\"So much of the success we've had in this administration traces directly to Charlie's ability to organize and convene,\" Vance said after Kirk was killed. \"He didn't just help us win in 2024, he helped us staff the entire government.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 14 Sep 2025 10:38:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The murder of Charlie Kirk last week follows a litany of violent acts against political targets. Historian Jon Meacham talks about the existential questions now facing America.",
    "story": [
      "For Jon Meacham, the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian, and author of \"The Soul of America: The Battle for Our Better Angels,\" this past week has been disturbing \u2014 and all too familiar. Asked what is the state of America's soul today, he replied, \"I think that we are in a dangerous place. There's never been a once-upon-a-time in American history. There's not going to be a happily-ever-after. But there are moments that you and I could agree we would like to see replicated \u2014 and this is not one of them.",
      "\"Political violence erupts in America when there is an existential question \u2014 who is an American? Who deserves to be included in 'We the people,' or 'All men being created equal'?\" he said. \"When that is in tension, when we don't have common agreement about that, then, if you look at it historically, violence erupts.\"",
      "And on Wednesday, it did.",
      "At Utah Valley University, the crack of a gunshot once again rattled America. Charlie Kirk, a prominent 31-year-old conservative activist, was assassinated as he engaged in public debate.",
      "By Thursday, a suspect was in custody: 22-year-old Utah resident Tyler Robinson.",
      "Kirk had a fervent following on the right, and was a key organizer in President Donald Trump's movement. (At the 2020 GOP Convention, Kirk referred to Trump as \"the bodyguard of Western civilization.\") He also had his critics, who called him an incendiary voice [as when, on his eponymous show, he exclaimed, \"The entire Democrat Party project is how quickly we can turn America into a third-world hellhole\"].",
      "His death has become the latest convulsion in a divided country.",
      "Meacham told Robert Costa, \"We do not want to be in a place where because you disagree with someone, you pick up a gun. That is not what the country can be. And if it is, then it's something different.\"",
      "It's not America? \"It's not the America we want,\" he said.",
      "Kirk's murder is the latest of numerous acts of political violence since last summer, when we saw the first of two assassination attempts on candidate Trump, followed by (to name just a few) the firebombing of the home of Pennsylvania's governor, Democrat Josh Shapiro; the killing of Democratic lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband in Minnesota; the murder of two Israeli embassy workers\u00a0in Washington; and the killing of police officer David Rose\u00a0in a shooting outside\u00a0CDC headquarters in Atlanta.",
      "Costa asked Meacham, \"Are we in a particular time in America when all of this seems to keep happening?\"",
      "\"We are, self-evidently,\" Meacham replied. \"And I think it's because we are experiencing an era in which we are debating, not only the means of politics, but the purpose of politics.\"",
      "Meacham says the purpose of America is an urgent cause for leaders, and for citizens: \"When we lose the capacity to engage in argument and dissent and debate peaceably, we are breaking faith with the American covenant,\" he said. \"And the American covenant is that we live in contention with each other, but we're not at each other's throats.\"",
      "Asked what our political leaders can do to keep that covenant, Meacham said, \"Make the case. Tell the story. What do you want the country to be? This is why history matters, I think, more than ever, because there's not a hell of a lot going on in the present that you want to say, 'Yeah, we want more of that,' right?",
      "\"You want to tell the story of Omaha Beach. You want to tell the story of the Pettus Bridge. You want to tell the story of Gettysburg. Because those were moments where imperfect people actually created a more perfect union. It's not that they were superhuman. Quite the opposite,\" he said.",
      "They got through it, Meacham said, \"barely.\"",
      "But even if Americans can just barely carry on this weekend, Meacham says we must: \"If they could do it, then we can, too, if we decide that this country is about a more perfect union, it is about dissent, it is about respecting each other, and it is not about hunting each other down.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 13 Sep 2025 21:25:32 -0400",
    "summary": "California lawmakers voted to phase out a group of chemicals known as PFAS, which are often called \"forever chemicals\u200b,\" in cookware.",
    "story": [
      "California lawmakers voted to ban a group of chemicals known as PFAS, which are often called \"forever chemicals,\" in cookware. The move has pulled in celebrity chefs on one side and environmentalists, including actor Mark Ruffalo, on the other.",
      "The proposal, Senate Bill 682, would prohibit PFAS in cookware, cleaning products, dental floss, ski wax, food packaging and certain children's products. Lawmakers approved the bill in a 41-19 vote, late on Friday, with 20 assembly members not voting. The bill quickly passed amendments in the Senate and is now headed to Gov. Gavin Newsom's desk for his signature.",
      "It's the latest move to limit PFAS, which are a class of thousands of chemicals that have been around for more than 70 years and are widely used in a variety of consumer, commercial and industrial products due to their ability to withstand heat and repel water and stains. They are called \"forever chemicals\" because they are\u00a0extremely persistent in the environment\u00a0and can accumulate in humans and animals.",
      "Exposure to PFAS is linked to many negative health effects, including but not limited to kidney and testicular cancer, liver and kidney damage, and harm to the nervous and reproductive systems.",
      "Newsom has until Oct. 12 to sign the bill into law. If he does, there is time period for manufacturers and retailers to comply with the legislation. Cookware must be compliant by 2030, 2031 for certain cleaning products, and 2028 for all other products covered in the bill.",
      "The legislation specifically points to health risks as the reason for phasing out PFAS from cookware and other products. \"Exposure to PFAS poses a significant threat to the environment and public health,\" the bill states.",
      "Nearly everyone in the United States has been exposed to PFAS and has it in their blood, according to the Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention. California and more than a dozen other states have in recent years taken a more cautionary stance by limiting PFAS in other products, including textiles, certain children's products, firefighting foam, and cosmetics.",
      "California has already banned PFAS in carpets, textiles and firefighting foam. Now, the latest debate centers on nonstick pans. Many are treated with a chemical compound called PTFE, a type of PFAS better known as Teflon, which coats millions of pans.",
      "Chefs push back",
      "The Cookware Sustainability Alliance, which describes itself as a group of cookware manufacturers, designers and engineers, has rallied high-profile culinary stars to oppose the bill. Chefs including Rachael Ray, Thomas Keller of the famed French Laundry restaurant in Napa, Marcus Samuelsson of Red Rooster in Harlem, and David Chang of Momofuku in New York City all submitted letters to lawmakers arguing nonstick pans are safe when manufactured and used correctly.",
      "\"I respect and share the desire to protect Californians and our planet, but I urge you to look closely at the science before moving forward with legislation that could unintentionally do more harm than good,\" Ray wrote. \"PTFEs, when manufactured and used responsibly, are proven to be safe and effective.\"",
      "Some chefs also argue that banning nonstick pans could make cooking more difficult and costly for families. \"Alternatives often do not perform with the same consistency, which can undermine the very goal of helping people cook nourishing meals at home,\" chef Einat Admony of Balaboosta in New York City wrote in her letter.",
      "\"We base everything on chemistry, on science,\" Steve Burns, executive director of the Cookware Sustainability Alliance, said in an interview with CBS News. \"The Teflon coating around a nonstick pan is a fluoropolymer. Technically it falls under the PFAS family, but fluoropolymers have been shown for decades to be inert and non-harmful.\"",
      "The cookware industry says the bill unfairly targets a material that regulators, like the Food and Drug Administration, have repeatedly approved and deemed safe. \"Since the 1960s, the FDA has authorized PTFE\u00a0and other fluoropolymers for use in food-contact applications,\" Burns said. \"As recently as early 2025, the FDA reaffirmed that PTFE in nonstick coatings remains approved.\"",
      "The environmental community responds",
      "Environmental groups including the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Working Group have pushed back against the industry, saying everyday use of Teflon-coated cookware can release PFAS particles or fumes, especially when pans are scratched or overheated.",
      "\"PTFE is basically a plasticized version of PFAS,\" said Anna Reade, the NRDC's director of PFAS advocacy.",
      "She disagrees with industry claims that Teflon is safe because when nonstick cookware is overheated, she says, PFAS emissions come off the pans and can be inhaled or absorbed by the food cooking in the pan. A small scientific study supports Reade's claim, as well as additional scientific studies that recommend limiting the use of Teflon in production and use because of the potential risks it poses to human health.",
      "\"The other concern is that when you flake off and scrub off PTFE, you're breaking it into really small pieces,\" Reade said. Studies also suggest scratched pans may shed microplastics that could end up in food.",
      "Actor Mark Ruffalo, who starred in the 2019 film \"Dark Waters\" about PFAS contamination and is an outspoken critic of \"forever chemicals,\" weighed in on social platform X with an open letter to Ray. \"Independent science shows that the PFAS in cookware can wind up in our food,\" Ruffalo wrote. He went on to urge her to support the bill \"from the bottom of my heart.\"",
      "California state Sen. Ben Allen, a Democrat from Southern California who proposed the legislation, was grateful the bill passed.",
      "\"PFAS pose a level of serious risks that require us to take a measured approach to reduce their proliferation and unnecessary use throughout the marketplace,\" Allen said in a statement. \"With SB 682, California can take another strong step toward responsibly phasing out these toxins to prioritize our health and wellbeing over corporate profits.\"",
      "Allen emphasizes that the legislation aims to phase out PFAS in cookware and other items where substitutes exist. There are already PFAS-free options available for all the products referenced in the bill. In place of nonstick cookware, stainless steel and cast-iron pans are possible replacements because they do not include Teflon coatings.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-nato-oil-russia-china-tariffs-ukraine-war/",
    "published": "Sat, 13 Sep 2025 21:14:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump said that NATO's commitment to winning the war in Ukraine \"has been far less than 100%.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said he believes the more than three-year war in Ukraine would end if all NATO countries stopped buying oil from Russia and placed tariffs on China for its purchases of Russian petroleum. The announcement came as Romania became the second NATO country to report a Russian drone incursion.",
      "Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social on Saturday a letter purportedly sent to NATO in which he said he is \"ready to do major Sanctions on Russia\" on the condition that all NATO countries stop buying Russian oil. The president said the military alliance's commitment to winning the war in Ukraine \"has been far less than 100%\" and the purchase of Russian oil by some members is \"shocking.\"",
      "\"It greatly weakens your negotiation position, and bargaining power, over Russia,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "Since 2023, NATO member Turkey has been the third largest buyer of Russian oil, after China and India, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. Other members of the 32-state alliance involved in purchasing Russian oil include Hungary and Slovakia.",
      "Mr. Trump's letter comes at a tense moment in the conflict for NATO after the recent incursion by\u00a0multiple Russian drones into the airspace of alliance member Poland. It's being seen as an escalatory move by Russia and Poland shot down several of the drones.",
      "Earlier this week, Mr. Trump appeared to play down the significance of the incident, saying the incursion may not have been deliberate",
      "\"It could have been a mistake,\" he told journalists late Thursday. A day earlier, Mr. Trump issued a brief reaction on his Truth Social platform: \"What's with Russia violating Poland's airspace with drones? Here we go!\"",
      "The White House did not offer any clarification of Mr. Trump's remarks and Poland's most senior officials dismissed his suggestion\u00a0that it had been a mistake on Friday.",
      "On Saturday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters that NATO responded to the drones \"appropriately\" and that the U.S. believes it was an \"unacceptable and unfortunate and dangerous development.\"",
      "\"There's no doubt about the drones were intentionally launched,\" he said. \"The question is whether the drones were targeted to go into Poland specifically. If that's the case, that if the evidence leads us there, then, obviously, that'll be a highly explanatory move.\"",
      "Polish and allied aircraft were deployed in a \"preventive\" operation in Poland's airspace on Saturday because of a threat of drone strikes in neighboring areas of Ukraine, and the airport in the eastern Polish city of Lublin was closed, authorities said. The alert lasted around two hours.",
      "The Polish military's operational command posted on X on Saturday afternoon that ground-based air defense and reconnaissance systems were on high alert. It stressed that \"these actions are preventive in nature,\" and were aimed at securing Poland's airspace and protecting the country's citizens. It cited a threat of drone strikes in regions of Ukraine bordering Poland, but didn't give further details.",
      "Separately, Romania said it deployed two F-16 jets to intercept a drone that briefly entered its airspace on Saturday afternoon.",
      "\"The drone did not fly over inhabited areas and did not represent an imminent danger to the security of the population,\" the NATO member's defense ministry said in a statement.",
      "The ministry said that teams of specialists would conduct searches for potential debris. Romanian authorities didn't specify where they thought the drone originated from.",
      "During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump promised to end the war quickly. Some lawmakers in Congress are trying to persuade Mr. Trump to support a bill that toughens sanctions, after the president hosted Putin in Alaska for talks that failed to deliver on progress toward peace.",
      "The president in his post said a NATO ban on Russian oil plus tariffs on China would \"also be of great help in ENDING this deadly, but RIDICULOUS, WAR.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said NATO members should impose 50% to 100% tariffs on China and withdraw them if the war that was launched with Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine ends.",
      "\"China has a strong control, and even grip, over Russia,\" he posted, and powerful tariffs \"will break that grip.\"",
      "The U.S. president has already placed an additional 25% import tax on goods from India, which he has said is to punish it for buying Russian energy products.",
      "In his post, Mr. Trump said responsibility for the war fell on his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. As in past statements on the issue, he did not include in that list Russian President Vladimir Putin, who launched the invasion.",
      "Mr. Trump's post builds on a call Friday with finance ministers from the Group of Seven, a forum of industrialized democracies. During the call, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called on their counterparts to have a \"unified front\" to cut off \"the revenues funding Putin's war machine,\" according to Greer's office.",

    "story": [
      "Scientists are observing an Earth-like exoplanet that may contain water using NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, the space agency said in a news release.",
      "The exoplanet, known as TRAPPIST-1 e, orbits the red dwarf star TRAPPIST-1. The system was discovered in 2017. There are seven Earth-sized worlds orbiting the star, but planet e is the only one that is at a distance where water on the surface is \"theoretically possible,\" NASA said. However, astronomers still need to determine if the planet has an atmosphere.",
      "To look for an atmosphere, NASA scientists directed the Webb telescope's Near-Infrared Spectrograph instrument at the TRAPPIST-1 system as planet e passed in front of the star. If the planet has an atmosphere, the starlight that passes through it will be partially absorbed. That will create dips in the light spectrum that reaches the spectrograph. Those dips will allow scientists to determine if the planet has an atmosphere and what chemicals it might be made of.",
      "Scientists are also studying the light spectrum of another exoplanet in the system called TRAPPIST-1 b. Researchers have determined that planet has no atmosphere, NASA said, so comparing its output to that of TRAPPIST-1 e allows for a fuller picture of the potential atmosphere on that planet.",
      "\"Webb's infrared instruments are giving us more detail than we've ever had access to before, and the initial four observations we've been able to make of planet e are showing us what we will have to work with when the rest of the information comes in,\" said N\u00e9stor Espinoza of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland, a principal investigator on the research team. Espinoza and the research team recently published two\u00a0scientific\u00a0papers\u00a0outlining their initial results.",
      "Researchers \"feel confident\" that TRAPPIST-1 e does not have a primary atmosphere. A primary atmosphere would be made of hydrogen and helium that would have been present when the planet was formed. But the star the planet orbits is \"very active,\" with \"frequent flares,\" NASA said, which create stellar radiation that may have \"stripped off\" that primary atmosphere. However, TRAPPIST-1 e may have built up a \"heavier secondary atmosphere.\" Many planets, including Earth, have done this, NASA said. Further research with the Webb telescope and its instruments will determine the types of atmosphere and its makeup.",
      "There are also many possibilities for water on the planet. There may be none at all, NASA said. TRAPPIST-1 e might also contain an ocean or wide swath of water. One side of the planet is always in darkness, so there may also be ice, NASA said. If there is liquid water on the planet, the NASA researchers say there would also be a greenhouse effect, where gases like carbon dioxide keep the atmosphere stable and warm the planet.",
      "\"We are really still in the early stages of learning what kind of amazing science we can do with Webb. It's incredible to measure the details of starlight around Earth-sized planets 40 light-years away and learn what it might be like there, if life could be possible there,\" said Ana Glidden, a post-doctoral researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, who led the research on possible atmospheres for planet e, in NASA's news release. \"We're in a new age of exploration that's very exciting to be a part of,\" she said.",

      "The Federal Trade Commission has started an inquiry into several social media and artificial intelligence companies, including OpenAI and Meta, about the potential harms to children and teenagers who use their chatbots as companions.",
      "On Thursday, the FTC said it has sent letters to Google parent Alphabet, Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms, Snap, Character Technologies, ChatGPT maker OpenAI and xAI.",
      "The FTC said it wants to understand what steps, if any, companies have taken to evaluate the safety of their chatbots when acting as companions, to limit the products' use by and potential negative effects on children and teens, and to apprise users and parents of the risks associated with the chatbots.",
      "The inquiry comes after OpenAI said it plans to make changes to ChatGPT safeguards for vulnerable people, including adding extra protections for those under 18 years old, after the parents of a teen boy who died by suicide in April sued, alleging the artificial intelligence chatbot led their teen to take his own life.",
      "More children are now using AI chatbots for everything \u2014 from homework help to personal advice, emotional support and everyday decision-making. That's despite research on the harms of chatbots, which have been shown to give kids dangerous advice about topics such as drugs, alcohol and eating disorders.",
      "\"As AI technologies evolve, it is important to consider the effects chatbots can have on children, while also ensuring that the United States maintains its role as a global leader in this new and exciting industry,\" said FTC Chairman Andrew N. Ferguson in a statement.",
      "He added, \"The study we're launching today will help us better understand how AI firms are developing their products and the steps they are taking to protect children.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Character.AI said it is looking forward to \"collaborating with the FTC on this inquiry and providing insight on the consumer AI industry and the space's rapidly evolving technology.\"",
      "Meta declined to comment on the FTC inquiry. The company has been working on making sure its AI chatbots are safe and age appropriate for children, a spokesperson said.",
      "OpenAI said that it's prioritizing \"making ChatGPT helpful and safe for everyone, and we know safety matters above all else when young people are involved. We recognize the FTC has open questions and concerns, and we're committed to engaging constructively and responding to them directly.\"",
      "In an email to CBS News, Snap said, \"We share the FTC's focus on ensuring the thoughtful development of generative AI, and look forward to working with the Commission on AI policy that bolsters U.S. innovation while protecting our community.\"",
      "Alphabet and xAI did not immediately respond to messages for comment.",
      "AI changes",
      "OpenAI and Meta earlier this month announced changes to how their chatbots respond to teenagers asking questions about suicide or showing signs of mental and emotional distress. OpenAI said it is rolling out new controls enabling parents to link their accounts to their teen's account.",
      "Parents can choose which features to disable and \"receive notifications when the system detects their teen is in a moment of acute distress,\" according to a company blog post that says the changes will go into effect this fall.",
      "Regardless of a user's age, the company says its chatbots will attempt to redirect the most distressing conversations to more capable AI models that can provide a better response.",
      "Meta also said it is now blocking its chatbots from talking with teens about self-harm, suicide, disordered eating and inappropriate romantic conversations, and instead directs them to expert resources. Meta already offers parental controls on teen accounts.",
      "If you or someone you know is in emotional distress or a suicidal crisis, you can reach the\u00a0988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline\u00a0by calling or texting 988. You can also chat with the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline\u00a0here.",

      "According to the ADL report, several school shooters in the past year, including Holly, had been active on the same website, which the organization says is known for hosting content backing white supremacist ideas as well as material portraying graphic violence against both people and animals. People can navigate to the website, WatchPeopleDie, and access a forum where they can watch real images of beheadings, shootings and other violence. The site started on Reddit before being banned in March 2019.",
      "\"We're talking about thousands of people who are on these spaces,\" ADL Senior Vice President of Counter-Extremism and Intelligence, Oren Segal, told CBS News. \"There's no friction to access \u2014 anybody can do it.\"",

      "The 16-year-old posted a photo of himself holding a gun next to a box of ammunition on his X account two hours before the shooting. On social media, Holly showcased his collection of tactical gear, which featured extremist symbols. In a now-deleted TikTok post that contained references to a 2019\u00a0mass shooting at a mosque\u00a0in Christchurch, New Zealand, he engaged with a comment encouraging him to \"make a move,\" according to ADL.",

Cloudflare is used as the registrar for their main domain, Segal at the ADL said, and uses Cloudflare-owned IP addresses, which means that WPD is either hosted on Cloudflare or they are using their passthrough services.",
      "Segal said Cloudflare allows it to remain \u2026 that it's basically a service provider not taking action and \"allowing the hosting of the site.\"",

      "Segal said that ADL shares their findings with law enforcement agencies across the country. He did not specify an agency or the specific report. Segal said understanding incidents perpetrated by people influenced by nihilistic online spaces as a broader trend rather than one-offs could be a step toward preventing violence.",
      "\"We need to see that there's a connection there, there's a through line,\" Segal said. \"There's a common theme and a common thread, which are these online platforms.\"",

      "\"The infrastructure that we need to prevent violence has always been very weak, and it's even weaker right now,\" said Kingston. \"That's my biggest frustration, is having so many solutions that aren't being fully implemented. It just breaks my heart.\"",

      "And this week on Face the Nation: What will America do after the killing of political activist Charlie Kirk? Is the assassination of a high- visibility and effective conservative thought leader and vote mobilizer a moment when national divisions begin to close or will attitudes harden?",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "ERIKA KIRK (Widow of Charlie Kirk): To everyone listening tonight across America, the movement my husband built will not die.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The criminal investigation continues, as does the quest to deduce a motive. Charges will be filed later this week.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson joins us on the path ahead and a range of issues facing Congress, from avoiding a government shutdown to Russian sanctions.",
      "And a conversation with Democratic Senator Chris Coons and Republican Senator James Lankford, longtime advocates both of finding common ground and minimizing political strife.",
      "Also, University of Chicago Professor Robert Pape, one of the country's foremost researchers on political violence, with a warning about where things stand.",
      "Then: As consumers turn gloomy and the job market freezes up, high expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut. CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger will break it all down.",
      "It is all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. Margaret is on assignment for \"60 Minutes.\" I'm Major Garrett.",
      "We have a lot to get to today, and I want to begin with justice correspondent Scott MacFarlane with the latest on the assassination of political activist Charlie Kirk and the ongoing investigation.",
      "Utah Republican Governor Spencer Cox has been the most authoritative voice in this matter since it happened, Scott. We have some new comments from him this morning.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: It sounds like they have a lot to work with to start.",
      "First of all, as the weekend began, they executed a search warrant on the family home in Washington County, Utah. It's about three or four hours from the site of the shooting. The governor, though, says multiple people are talking here, including the roommate of the suspect, who he describes as incredibly cooperative.",
      "The roommate, he says, had no idea this was happening, and he also says the roommate may have been in a romantic relationship with Tyler Robinson, may have been gender transitioning, but the governor says there's no indication or no idea yet if that's at all relevant to this case.",
      "As for Robinson, he's in the Utah County Jail, the one where Utah Valley University is. He's in a special watch area. He's inmate 460956. A special watch means they're ensuring he's not harmed or can do any self-harm. It doesn't mean there's a mental health issue, Major, but the severity of the crime, commonly in correctional facilities across the country, puts you in a special watch.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: State charges due to be filed later this week. And because of Utah's approach to state charges, this will be a high-visibility prosecution when it comes.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: Yes, the district attorney is Jeff Gray. We expect him to speak Tuesday. The probable cause statement already submitted for this arrest indicates the possible charges, aggravated murder, felonious discharge of a firearm. Those are possible come Tuesday in Utah County Court.",
      "Whether the feds get involved, whole different issue. There may not be a foothold for federal charges here for the U.S. Department of Justice, unless they see something in the firearms or in the motives here that makes it federal, though we saw in Charlotte last week they brought federal charges in the alleged murder of a Ukrainian refugee.",
      "In that case, they found mass transit system foothold to bring the federal case.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Scott, as you well know, in instances like this, authorities struggle to stay with the facts as they are known and as they evolve.",
      "But there is rampant online speculation, rumormongering about motive. Authorities still very early in the stages of trying to identify one, if it exists\u2026",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: And the F\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: \u2026 and can properly characterized.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: And it's happening at a moment of change inside the U.S. Department of Justice. The FBI has new leadership, and this really is a first big test for the new FBI leadership.",
      "And the grades are incomplete right now. It was the father who seems to have turned in his son in this case, and the FBI director was called on some social media posts that were conflicting with other information, saying a subject was in custody, then a subject was released.",
      "And the FBI director also posted this weekend: \"Against all law enforcement recommendations, we released that video of the suspect.\" Governor of Utah today said: \"We certainly never recommended against releasing video.\"",
      "So there's some questions to answer for the FBI as this week begins.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Little bit of tension there.",
      "Scott MacFarlane, thank you very much.",
      "We turn now to the speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, who joins us this morning from Baton Rouge, Louisiana.",
      "Mr. Speaker, it's good to see you. I appreciate your time.",
      "The burdens of speakership are always manifold. You know that. Previous speakers I have covered know that, but they feel particularly heavy after the events of this week. I just want to ask you, Mr. Speaker, how are you doing?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON (R-Louisiana): I'm doing OK, Major. Thanks for asking it.",
      "No question, it was a difficult week for the country. Certainly, it was felt on Capitol Hill. There's a mixture of anger and sadness and fear, frankly, on the part of a lot of people. It cast a large shadow across the country and the nation's capital.",
      "But what I do know, Major, is that my good friend Charlie would not want any of us to be consumed by despair. He would want us to go forward boldly. That was his message, and to do it in love. And I think that, I hope, is the message that continues in the days ahead.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: It's not common for this show to pick up on something said by Connecticut's Young Democrats and Connecticut's Young Republicans, but they put out a statement that has gotten quite a bit of attention on the Internet, saying, as follows: \"There is no place in our country for such acts, regardless of political disagreements.\"",
      "Do you believe, on Capitol Hill, there will be a method to forge any sort of bipartisan remembrance of Charlie Kirk?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: There will be.",
      "We had a moment of prayer and silent reflection on the floor on Wednesday, within an hour of his passing. There will be \u2013 I participated in a large vigil here in Baton Rouge at LSU, my alma mater, on Friday night. Tonight, we will have a big, I hope, bipartisan prayer and reflection vigil in Capitol Hill, at the Kennedy Center.",
      "There will be a members reflection and prayer moment that I will lead on Monday night. This will continue. I think that the country needs to see leaders in Congress and leaders with platforms all around the country speaking truth and bringing calm to the situation.",
      "We should appeal, as Lincoln reminded us so many years ago, to the better angels among us all. And I think this is a real moment for Amer (AUDIO GAP) affirmatively. And I think one of the ways to do that, Major, is to adopt the manner of Charlie Kirk, because while he loved vigorous debate and he believed in the free marketplace of ideas and advancing truth boldly, he also was motivated by love for his fellow man, because he never hated the person on the other side of the table.",
      "And I think everyone would do well to be reminded of that model.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Mr. Speaker, you mentioned the word fear a moment ago. It is on the lips of members of Congress in ways I have never experienced before. They are talking openly. They already have canceled events.",
      "Other members are talking about whether or not it's proper, and there are family conversations, to seek reelection. How do you feel this particular space of anxiety for your membership, Republican and Democrat?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Yes.",
      "Well, I have been talking with a lot of them over the last few days about that and trying to calm the nerves to assure them that we will make certain that everyone has the level of security that's necessary, that the resources will be there for their residential security and their personal security.",
      "We're evaluating all the options for that, but also to be reminded that it does take a certain measure of courage to step out and to lead. I mean, our first responders do it every day. Our members of the military do it every day and political figures as well.",
      "But I think, if we all adopt these practices together and we turn down the rhetoric, we cease with this idea that policy disputes are somehow an existential threat to democracy or the republic, we stop calling one another names \u2013 I mean, calling people Nazis and fascists is not helpful.",
      "Look, there are some deranged people in society. And when they see leaders using that kind of language so often now, increasingly, it spurs them on to action. We have to recognize that reality and address it appropriately.",
      "And I'm heartened to know, Major, and to see that many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are stepping up and saying that and addressing it. I think this could be a turning point, frankly, to use Charlie's term, for the country. And I hope that's true.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Would that turning point, from your vantage point, Mr. Speaker, because I know you had a long conversation with President Trump, extend to the White House itself?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Well, of course.",
      "Look, the president knew Charlie very well. He was like a family member to the Trumps. Many of us felt that close association with him. And he admired Charlie's approach to public debate. And you have heard him say that publicly. He was \u2013 Charlie was a good man.",
      "And I think the best way we honor his memory is to continue to do that very thing and not shy away from debate, to keep the free marketplace of ideas going, but to work on the tone of those debates, because I think that serves the best of our principles, our Judeo-Christian heritage as a nation, our civil discourse, and we got to return to that.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Mr. Speaker, several issues pending before Congress, not the least of which is keeping the government open.",
      "I know you prefer a seven-week clean C.R., but there is a press for other issues, extending Obamacare tax subsidies. There's been a push this weekend for Russia sanctions backed by Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, in the Senate. Will either of those, from your vantage point, get into something to keep the government open?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Well, listen, we have been working very hard in the House to restore regular order in the appropriations government funding process, and that's something that no one's really seen for a long time on Capitol Hill.",
      "But I'm encouraged that, in a bipartisan fashion, our House Appropriations Committee has passed all 12 of the annual appropriations bills through the committee. We have got three off the House floor. The Senate's passed a few. And then last week we voted to move into a conference\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: OK, Mr. Speaker, I believe there's a technical glitch that has forced us to lose your audio.",
      "We're going to take a quick break, and we will come right back to House Speaker Mike Johnson in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in just a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to Face the Nation.",
      "Because technical gremlins lurk everywhere, they got in between my conversation with House Speaker Mike Johnson.",
      "Mr. Speaker. I'm glad to have you back.",
      "You were in the middle of answering about Obamacare tax subsidies, possible sanctions against Russia and a government funding mechanism. Please continue.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Yes, sorry about the interruption there.",
      "Listen, we're very encouraged that we have been able to restore the regular appropriations, regular order process in the House.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Right, but are we going to get this done? Are those two other things going to be added to the process, Mr. Speaker?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: We will have to see.",
      "I have got to build consensus around all of it, but I think we will need a short-term funding measure, a clean C.R. that will allow more time to figure all this out. And we certainly hope that Democrats will go along on that, because, if not, they really have no excuse.",
      "If they shut the government down, it would be their unilateral decision to do so.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And when Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, says, as he did this weekend, now is the time for Russia sanctions, President Trump opened the door on tariffs against India and China as a way to create economic leverage to end the war in Ukraine, where do you stand on all that?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Well, listen, I do believe that desperate times call for desperate measures.",
      "And I think appropriate sanctions on Russia are far overdue. I mean, I think there's a big appetite for that in Congress. So we're willing to work with the White House and our Senate colleagues in the House to get that done, and I'm anxious to do it personally.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Are you waiting for the president to give you the green light, or might Congress act on this on its own volition?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Well, Congress really can't do this on its own volition, because, of course, the president would need to sign whatever you do into law. So it has to be a partnership.",
      "But we have defer to the commander in chief. I mean, the president is a strong and bold leader on the world stage. He has brokered peace around the world in other conflicts in a way that no one before him has been able to do. And so we're trusting that he can use that same force and that same approach to bring about finally an end to this war in Ukraine.",
      "Everyone in America wants that bloodshed to end, and President Trump is forcing that. And I certainly\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: OK, Mr. Speaker, I'm told that the technical difficulties keep arising, so a bit prematurely, we're going to end our conversation here to spare you and spare our audience from continued mayhem by technical gremlins.",
      "Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the time. Thank you for joining us on Face the Nation very much.",
      "Jill Schlesinger joins now \u2013 joins us now. She's CBS News business analyst. She's on Long Island, as she often is when we talk.",
      "Jill, I'm pleased to see you.",
      "Look, everyone expects the Federal Reserve to cut rates this coming week. That's not a mystery. I guess the only mystery is, is it 25 basis points or 50 basis points? And if it's 50, how much more of a difference might that make?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Well, I think it's more likely to be a quarter-of-a- percentage point, at least for this meeting.",
      "And, remember, what is the Fed's job? It's got \u2013 they have got to keep into balance two big priorities. And these are big. One is to make sure the economy grows enough to create jobs for anyone who wants a job. And the other priority is to kind of keep a lid on prices, to control inflation or deflation.",
      "Right now, if you look at the Fed's job, it's a real tough one, because the job market is weakening at the same time that inflation is reaccelerating. Now, remember, we are not going back to scary post-pandemic inflationary surge, but inflation is starting to move in the wrong direction.",
      "But I think the Fed's outlook is, hey, it's the job market that is getting slower, faster. We have got to concentrate on that. I think they go a quarter-of-a-percentage point, rather than a half-of-a-percentage point, at least to get things restarted.",
      "Major, it was exactly a year ago when they began their rate cuts. Back in September of last year, they cut by a half-a-percentage point because they felt like inflation was moving down very quickly. I don't think that's the case this time.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jill, the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, frequently says the Fed and he are data-dependent. That's probably a virtue, except when the data is messy and cloudy and full of conflicting signals.",
      "That seems to be prevalent right now.",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Well, I think there is a real problem, in that, if you look at the last five years, our data is all over the place. The pandemic really did create a doozy of a problem on the economy, but also the way we track the economy.",
      "And I know people got really freaked out about those preliminary estimates to the revisions to all that data for the 12 months through March of this year. That preliminary revision showed 911,000 fewer jobs than we originally thought. Now, this is always part of an annual process. We will get the final number in February.",
      "But what I guess is important is, there are so many different aspects to what's going on in the economy right now. The crosscurrents are really difficult. So, yes, we know the labor market is weakening, but we're not seeing widespread job losses, thank goodness. There is no evidence that we are in a recession currently.",
      "The economy is growing. But we do have that niggling problem of prices starting to rise again. And I think that that price increase, because of those tariffs, because of certain aspects, even the service economy, I think that's a real crosscurrent.",
      "And, to be clear, the Fed, the amazing people who work there, the amazing economists that are out there doing the research, so many of them say to me, you know what, this is the most difficult time to judge the next steps of the economy in the last 40 years.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jill, as you know, there's a phrase going around describing the job market, and it goes as follows: \"No fire, no hire.\"",
      "What does that mean practically for somebody in the job market or just graduating from college trying to break in?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Yes, this is a very difficult labor market. I mean, granted, we are \u2013 again, we are not like we are in a recession. We are not seeing widespread layoffs, thank goodness. There are pockets of layoffs that are happening in different sectors. We are seeing contractions. We're seeing people who are retiring and those jobs not being refilled.",
      "But I think that if anyone who has a job right now, when I talk to H.R. people, they basically say to me, hey, you know what? Tell people to stay where they are. Don't fly off the handle, the job-hugging, staying engaged with your boss, engaged with the company, very important right now.",
      "If you are seeking a job, you know, where the jobs are right now, we see the most activity in health care, health services. So, you're \u2013 if you're somebody who is trained to do one job, try to find a job in the sector at least that is adding positions. I might be a programmer and I might not have an ability to get a job at a big tech company.",
      "Maybe I go to a big hospital chain. These are the kinds of things. We have to kind of get outside of ourselves. The adaptable candidate is going to be the one that wins in this economy.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jill, let's talk about tariffs, because it is a conversation and a way of trying to assess that this country has no recent experience with, at least 50 or 60 years, of trying to assess what a tariff does when it is widespread throughout the global economy.",
      "So a lot of us are trying to get used to this. Economists are trying to get used to it. Policymakers are trying to get used to it. Our trading partners are trying to get used to it. What is the story of tariffs so far, and has it been fully written?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Nothing fully written, so very important here, because when those tariffs were announced in April, and then they were moved higher, and then they were frozen for a while, the tariff story was an uncertain one.",
      "I think it is that cloud of uncertainty that was really hanging over the labor market over the past four months. But, right now, what we do know is that the industries most directly impacted by tariffs are not hiring as much. We know that. We know that they are losing some jobs. We also know that tariffs are creeping into the economy, and not in a huge way yet.",
      "But what we are clear about is that prices are set to rise over the next, say, six months or so. Not great for holiday shopping, I know. But what we also know is that we consumers, we are very canny. Once those prices go up, we will switch and make different choices.",
      "So that is why economists believe that this kind of tariff regime is one where we will see prices rise, but not keep rising. Now, that does not really help you if you are going out and shopping. I understand that. But maybe the best news that I can have is that you are not going to feel like you did from the year 2021 to 2022, where it just felt like prices were going up, up, up, up, up.",
      "It is likely to be that prices and the Consumer Price Index, from the way that the Fed looks at this, the PCE index, these measures of inflation will start to rise over the next few weeks \u2013 few months. Then they will kind of steady.",
      "But the problem, Major, is that consumers are going to be stuck with price levels that are higher. And I think that is going to be very hard to swallow for anyone who is in the lower to middle earning category.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jill, one other part of the economic scenario I want to discuss with you, because when people talk about inflation, they say, just tell me what energy cost is and I will tell you what inflation is going to be.",
      "But yet there is a dual reality there.",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Yes.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Natural gas and prices at the pump are down, but electricity paid for by consumers, either businesses or at home, are up.",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Yes.",
      "I mean, the great news is that prices at the pumps, OK, totally happy with that. Everyone's good. The price of crude oil sort of in the low 60s, no problem. That electric \u2013 the electricity story is a story of artificial intelligence, because, to build artificial intelligence, it needs a lot of energy in the term \u2013 in terms of electricity or in the form of electricity.",
      "That's why you are seeing those prices go up. But, again, what I have come back to over this process of the last few years, the last five years of the \u2013 all these different impacts on the economy, we have never been here before. And so what I want to try to emphasize is that we can't hang our hat on what has happened in the past.",
      "Right now, I can look at a lot of different companies and say, wow, these companies are making a ton of money, big technology companies. We are seeing the S&P 500, the Nasdaq, the Dow all at all-time highs. And you have to reckon with the problem, the other side of that, which is, consumers feel burdened.",
      "And I think that's going to be the story of this year and next. How will consumers get out of this? If the labor market weakens from here, I think that's a problem. If we see a resumption of growth and the labor market starts to strengthen, the average worker will be able to afford what's going on in the economy.",
      "But it does come down to that labor market.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jill, deeply unfair, 40 seconds. What has A.I.'s influence been on the labor market?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: You know, hard to say. In 40 seconds, what I can tell you is, not yet. That's the major takeaway, because we know that there are some areas where there's a lot of hiring within A.I.",
      "There are companies that are using A.I. to increase their productivity. But there is no evidence yet that A.I. is taking everybody's job, so whew, whew. We have got a few minutes to worry about that.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: A few minutes to worry about that, among many other things.",
      "Jill Schlesinger, always a pleasure. Thank you so much for joining us.",
      "And we will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. I invite you to please stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: For a daily dose of political news, analysis, and so much more throughout the week, please join me for The Takeout. We're on every weeknight at 5:00 p.m. on our CBS News 24/7 streaming channel, also available on our apps, CBS News and Paramount+.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: We will be right back with Senators Chris Coons and James Lankford for a bipartisan conversation on uniting America, plus the leading researcher on political violence, University of Chicago Professor Robert Pape.",
      "Please stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to \"FACE THE NATION.\"",
      "For a look at how Congress may, may help bridge political divisions the country presently, we turn to a couple of lawmakers with a lot of experience in that space. Democratic Senator Chris Coons, who joins us from Wilmington, Delaware, Republican Senator James Lankford, who joins us from Oklahoma City.",
      "Gentlemen, you have a well-earned reputation both for preaching bipartisanship, taking the rhetorical temperature in Washington and nationwide down a notch or two.",
      "Senator Coons, I want to start with you. After the events of this week, do you feel that's harder than ever to achieve?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS COONS (D-DE): It is. And, Major, thank you for a chance to be on with you and with my friend, Senator Lankford.",
      "The brutal assassination of Charlie Kirk, while he was in the middle of a debate on a college campus, goes to the very heart of what it means to be American, of the importance of the First Amendment of free speech. And someone like Charlie Kirk, who was a nationally known figure, who dedicated himself to debate, to engagement with his political adversaries, should not have paid with his life for the opportunity to speak out. No matter how much I might deeply disagree with his political views, the idea that he would be killed in such a grotesque and public way has to bring all of us to reflect about how hard it's getting because the internet is an accelerant. It is driving extremism in our country. It's driving us apart left and right. And leaders like Senator Lankford, Governor Cox have an obligation and an opportunity to join with leaders from my party in urging folks to set aside any thought of political violence and to respect each other, even as we keep advancing our political differences through discourse.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Lankford, do you ever, at times, feel as if your appeals for better angels, calmer rhetoric, more bipartisanship is shouting into an internet void?",
      "SENATOR JAMES LANKFORD, (R-OK): It is because the algorithm pushes people to the most extreme. The algorithm is all \u2013 on social media is always pushing, who's the angriest, who's the loudest, who says the craziest things. That's what gets repeated over and over and over again. So, any time that there is cogent dialogue or an issue on something where people may disagree, but they're having a \u2013 a civil conversation on it, that gets pushed aside towards someone that's just angry and \u2013 and focused.",
      "This is somewhat human nature to be able to say we disagree. We find areas where we disagree, and we try to be able to solve those. The best way to be able to solve those is through words, talking it out, finding an opportunity to be able to do it. But I would tell you, this kind of anger is as old as Cain and Abel, to be able to go back and say, I'm mad at you, so I'm going to try to destroy you. Whether it's destroy you online or to try to humiliate you or to cancel you or to, in this case, try to murder you publicly. It is \u2013 it is painful to be able to see that part of humanity. And it is better for us to be able to push better angels.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Lankford, first to you, then Senator Coons.",
      "Senator Lankford, are you afraid for your own security right now?",
      "SENATOR JAMES LANKFORD: I am \u2013 I am attentive to my own security, how about that, for myself and for my family. My staff and I have to \u2013 have to talk through each public event. But we've had to do that for a while.",
      "As you may know well, there have been 14,000 threats against members of Congress just this calendar year. This is not new. But it continues to be able to rise. as we've seen Democratic lawmakers in Minnesota, in their own home, have a home invasion and be murdered in their home. As we've seen a governor in Pennsylvania have his home set on fire. It's not just public events, it's also in our private spaces as well that we're keenly aware that there are people that are irrational, that do irrational acts.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Coons?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS COONS: I agree that for all of us who serve in public life, whether it's leading a non-profit or a church, teaching in a school, or being a public advocate, someone engaged in public debate, as Charlie Kirk was, the risk is getting higher. And to have to worry about the safety of your own family, if you step forward to serve as a judge, if you write editorials, if you lead a non-profit or if you serve in Congress or run for president, to have to worry not just about your own physical safety but the safety of your spouse and children, I think, weakens our ability to have good and robust debates, to have a well-led nation and to demonstrate to the world that we're a nation committed to free speech, but where we reject political violence.",
      "So, of course, anyone in public life today is more concerned about the tragedy in Utah, about the incidents that Senator Lankford just referenced, the attempt to kidnap the governor of Michigan, to assault Speaker Pelosi's husband, the shooting of Steve Scalise and the shootings at other members of Congress. The recent incidents have gotten worse and worse, and I think I know the reason. It's principally because the internet is fueling and accelerating those deep-seated inclinations towards violence and seeing others as enemies, that James was referencing, and there are steps we can and should take in Congress to address that.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The administering this weekend, as I'm sure you two are both aware, putting before Congress $58 billion in security for members of Congress, the judiciary and the like.",
      "Senator Coons, you believe Congress will be disposed to agree to that?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS COONS: I hope that we will step up and invest more. I just hosted a bipartisan event last week on protecting state judges, and we had state judicial leaders from across the country, from Delaware and Texas and many other states, talk about harrowing incidents and tragic killings of the members of the judiciary. I hope we will invest in securing our public life because incidents like this tragedy in Utah, like the murder of Melissa and her husband, Mark Hortman, in Minnesota, frankly, fuel further anger in our country. And the ways in which folks are then taking the horrific images of these incidents and propagating them on the internet adds fuel to the fire.",
      "We can and should pass bills, as we just did, Senator Cruz and Senator Klobuchar worked together to pass, and President Trump signed into law, the Take It Down Act, to remove some of the most harmful pornographic revenge porn images from the internet. And we have a bill right in front of us, the Kids Online Safety Act, that's broadly bipartisan, that we should pass to help reduce some of the risks and harms to our families and our country from the internet.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Lankford, I misspoke, that's $58 million, not $58 billion, but it's a substantial sum.",
      "SENATOR JAMES LANKFORD: Yes, it is a substantial sum. What was funny was I was going to actually correct you on that, let you know it's an \"m\" not a \"b\" on that particular one. But it is something to be able to set aside and say, what are we doing? It's not \u2013 it is about the person and their family, but it's also about the title. It's about the task. Because that person represents that state, that \u2013 that part of the nation, that particular task.",
      "My wife and I often talk about the fact that I have this title of senator for a season. Someone else had it before me. Someone else will have it after me. But while I have it, I'm a steward of that task and that responsibility. And so, when we're talking about protecting judges and protecting individual, it's not just their personal safety, it is really declaring to the nation that we believe that these tasks are hard, that they should be intense debate, that we have very difference perspective. Chris Coons and I are very close friends, but have very different ideas on some things, but we have the ability to represent our individual states and set of ideas and to be able to talk those two things out and to be able to bring things together and say, I know areas where we disagree. Where do we agree? How can we solve it? That is where we are at our best as Americans is to say, we don't oppress each other. We try to be able to find common ground and to be able to move forward as we can.",
      "But as Chris has mentioned, the Oline Kids Safety Act is a great piece of legislation to be able to protect our kids. We are seeing people radicalized online on social media and through the internet in the United States by other Americans and by the algorithm that's there. And I will tell you, as recently as just a couple of weeks ago, I was in a school in Oklahoma, that now Oklahoma schools have banned all cellphones from bell to bell at school. You cannot have a cellphone on your \u2013 on your \u2013 on from bell to bell on campus. And the principals and the teachers all talk about how dramatically different the environment is on campus right now because people are looking up, people are interacting, people are talking again. They're not just staring at their phone. They're not getting fed all this vitriol all day long. And so, it changes the mood of everything just by looking at each other in the face and saying, let's see if we can work this out.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Lankford, I'm going to bring up something that's playing out through the country right now, and it's making all the things you and Senator Coons have talked about more difficult, which is, people who have posted about Charlie Kirk have jobs and are being fired because what they posted online has been viewed by their personnel directors or leaders as inappropriate. At any governmental level or in the private sector, are you comfortable having someone fired for an utterance about Charlie Kirk's death?",
      "SENATOR JAMES LANKFORD: Yes, this is about protecting the individual businesses. And what people are seeing is, in this cancel culture that still persists, that if you voice something that becomes a big pushback from the community, the employer will step up and say, hey, you're about to kill our business based on what you're saying online. Everyone has to understand what they say privately online can get connected to their business.",
      "We have a veterinarian clinic in Oklahoma City right now that \u2013 that one of the veterinarians posted something just absolutely horrific about now we're culling out the sick ones right after Charlie Kirk was murdered, that now there's been big pushback through that veterinary clinic because people are say, OK, this is the person \u2013 do I want to do business with that person if they have that belief?",
      "So, this is part of the challenge that we have with social media and with employments. Employers are going to say, don't hurt our business based on the foolish things that you choose to say to be able to say online.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Coons, how about within the federal government?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Well, the way James put it there, I think, is a good balance between, it's OK to have codes of conduct, to say to an employee, you shouldn't be speaking out on behalf of this company or this department of the federal government. Where your role, for example, requires that you be trusted, and that you not take partisan political positions. One of the challenges of the intersection of the line between social media and one's conduct on behalf of the government is that today we can see into your internal views.",
      "But it's not that new. So, let's imagine that you're a career federal prosecutor or you're a judge. Historically, there have been clear rules against engaging in partisan politics while you are performing those functions. The internet just makes it easier for folks to police and punish those who make statements that are considered extreme or out of the mainstream.",
      "Cancel culture is a real challenge to us, to balancing free speech with positions of responsibility. And we have to find our way through this together in a way that offers some grace and humility while celebrating the free speech that is the foundation of our republic and urging people to think twice before they post things that are outrageous online.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Lankford, the country's going to look to Congress here in the next couple of weeks to avert a government shutdown, also possibly extend soon to expire Affordable Care Act subsidies that help afford insurance. In this climate, and with those eyes on the nation upon Congress, how do you expect that to play out?",
      "SENATOR JAMES LANKFORD: I expect us to be able to solve the budget issues, which the American people expect to be able to do as well. These are hard issues. We're sent to be able to do hard things. We should do hard things on it. We should not, first and foremost, have a government shutdown. We have $37 trillion in debt right now. We should have hard conversations about debt and deficit, but they shouldn't be during a government shutdown.",
      "What we're currently arguing right now about is a seven-week extension on the current budget spending to say, we're not changing anything, but for the seven \u2013 next seven weeks, let's just hold it until we get a longer budget agreement and can actually come to agreement. What has been floated is a $300 billion requirement by some of my Democratic colleagues to say, if we don't spend an additional $300 billion, we're not going to keep the government open the next seven weeks. This is also a subsidy, an insurance subsidy, that was put in place during Covid, and just after Covid to say, due to the health care issues around Covid, we're going to extend additional insurance coverage that's there.",
      "Covid and the crisis of Covid is now past on it. It's difficult to say we should spent an additional $300 billion just to stay open the next seven weeks due to a Covid emergency at this point.",
      "So, yes, we'll have \u2013 we'll have hard conversations. But let's have it. Let's \u2013 let's talk it out and let's figure it out.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Coons, you're going to get the last word. Respond to Senator Lankford on that.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Well, this is an area where Senator Lankford and I disagree. We are both appropriators. We both want to find a way to work together, to keep the government open. But the Republican-only bill that was passed earlier this year, the so-called big, beautiful bill, threatens to raise rates for health care for millions of Americans and to throw millions more off of health care.",
      "I think there are ways we can reduce the harm to Americans' health care through the appropriations process. The bill that we both voted for in our committee in July would restore many of the proposed deep cuts to the National Institutes of Health, for example, one positive step forward. We have to find a way to resolve these issues and reduce or reverse some of the harm that's being done to Americans' health care.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Chris Coons, Delaware Democratic, James Lankford, Oklahoma Republican, thank you both. I appreciate it.",
      "And we'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back.",
      "We're going to take a closer look at the problem of political violence in America. And we're joined now, I'm glad to say, by University of Chicago Professor Robert Pape. He is the founding director of the Chicago Project on Security and Threats.",
      "Professor, it's great to have you with us. Thanks for joining us.",
      "What are the trend lines and what is the key terminology you want my audience to understand?",
      "ROBERT PAPE (Professor of Political Science, University Of Chicago): We are now in a watershed moment for what I call the era of violent populism in America. This era is defined, first and foremost, by two factors. Number one, a rising tide of political violence on both the right and the left. And just think, and I'll only go back to 2002. Just think of the attack \u2013 the assassination attempt on Nancy Pelosi, Democratic leader of the House. Missed her. Almost killed her husband. The attempt on Brett Kavanaugh, conservative Supreme Court justice. Two attempts on Republican candidate Donald Trump. And then the \u2013 in Minnesota, just a few months ago, not just attempts, but actual assassinations of Democratic leaders. Josh Shapiro, governor of Pennsylvania. And now we see Charlie Kirk assassinated. And what we are seeing is this clear rising trend in numbers of attacks.",
      "Side by side with that, though, we are also seeing a rising tide, a groundswell of support for political violence on both the right and the left that corresponds with this rising trend of political violence on both the right and the left.",
      "Our center at the University of Chicago Project on Security and Threats, we have been conducting highly reliable national surveys on political violence \u2013 the support for political violence among Americans for over four years. We started this in the summer of 2021. Our most recent survey in May found higher levels of support for political violence on both the right and the left than we have ever seen. And that's one of the reasons why I rang the alarm bell with that big op-ed in \"The New York Times\" in June, saying, we're on the cusp of major political violence. And I'm sorry to say, we're now right in the grip of violent populism.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And in that survey data, is it that people who respond to your surveys say to reconcile myself to the political outcome I want, I will be willing to resort to violence. Is that the key connection point?",
      "ROBERT PAPE: The key connection is the particular political grievance. So, we asked, just give you an example, 39 percent of Democrats say they agree that the use of force is justified to remove Donald Trump from the presidency. When we go deeper to probe, what do they mean by use of force? Fifty-five percent are talking about assassinations. They're talking about lethal uses of force. That's why we use that term.",
      "On the right, we also asked \u2013 very same survey, we found 24 percent of Republicans agree that Donald Trump is justified in using the U.S. military to suppress Democratic protesters. So, these are very specific questions. We have a whole slew of these questions so that we really can speak with great precision about what are the grievances that people want to say use of force is justified. We know what the meaning of that term is. And then we can see, Democrat, Republican in the cross tabs.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Does your research buttress the point that both Senator Lankford and Senator Coons made, which is, the internet is an accelerant and amplifier?",
      "RICHARD PAPE: It's an accelerant, but it's not the root cause. So, studying this problem now for five years, I have found that, just as around the world, big, social change drives political violence. We see this in other countries around the world. But the details of the change vary.",
      "We are now moving, for the first time in our country's 250-year history, from a white majority democracy to a white minority democracy. In 1990, we were 76 percent non-Hispanic white. Today, we're 57 percent non-Hispanic white. It will be another ten years, maybe 15 if we deport a lot of those undocumented illegal immigrants, before we make the transition to a truly white minority democracy.",
      "Well, this generational change is happening \u2013 it started about ten years ago where the real tipping point generation and corresponds with the rise of Donald Trump, why his issue of immigration is meteoric, why it's morphed from immigration, meaning stop people costing the border, to now deporting mass numbers of people because there are people on the right who want to stop or reverse this, and also the virulent reaction to Donald Trump on the left, on parts of the left, who want to keep this going. This is really the taproot, and that's why we need to expect \u2013 this, left to its own devices, will get worse and be with us for ten years.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: So, this is a demographic story that is creating a political backlash that gets amplified and accelerated online? Do I have that right?",
      "RICHARD PAPE: Yes. You've got it exactly right. And these are why \u2013 it's not the internet is not important, it's a reinforcing factor. And there is a \u2013",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: In other words, it's too simplistic to say it's the internet?",
      "RICHARD PAPE: Exactly, because that's what \u2013 a few years ago, people challenged my findings and I said, oh, no, no, we'll just deplatform people. So, the problem here is just the internet, so we're going to de- platform x, y, and z. We de-platformed x, y, and z. And, you know what, didn't miss a beat.",
      "And the reason is because, yes, it is an additional \u2013 it's like throwing gasoline on the fire, but the internet is not the fire itself. There's something going on, which is really radicalizing our politics. And I'm sorry to say, this is a story that we see around the world, in other countries, other times, and so this is \u2013 this is the social change leading to radicalized politics that changes winners and losers in our society for real, and that's leading to political violence.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Professor, it has always been a hallmark of this country, we have sort of thought about ourselves as having this experiment that has lots of differences of opinion, spasms of violence, but in the end we reconcile and move forward. Are you any more or less optimistic about that and that underlying assumption about the core ability of America than you were previously?",
      "RICHARD PAPE: The future is in our hands. This is not locked in with destiny. That said, if we do nothing, this will keep getting worse. The number one thing we have to do is we need our political leaders to step up. And we just saw an instance of that, just previously, where we have senators from both sides of the aisle making a joint video appearance. Well, that's really quite \u2013 to condemn violence. That's important because the leaders can restrain their own constituents. When they bad-mouth the other side's constituents, our data shows, that makes everything worse. That's the worst of all possible worlds because it produces defiance. We need to step that up. What would step that up? A summit between President Trump, Governor Newsom and Governor Pritzker, a public session where they all together condemn political violence.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Professor Pape, I am very glad you're here. Modeling behavior matters in many contexts in life, political and otherwise. Thank you very much.",
      "We'll be back in just a moment.",

      "\"No matter how much I might deeply disagree with his political views, the idea that he would be killed in such a grotesque and public way has to bring all of us to reflect about how hard it's getting, because the internet is an accelerant,\" Coons said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Kirk was shot and killed at Utah Valley University last week in what officials described as a \"targeted attack.\" The assassination has spurred calls for lowering the political temperature nationwide, along with efforts to improve bipartisan dialogue in Washington.",
      "Sen. James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican, appeared alongside Coons on Sunday as the two men made an appeal to bipartisanship amid the divisive political climate. Lankford echoed Coons' concerns about the internet and extremism to CBS News' chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett, saying calls for bipartisanship can be drowned out because \"the algorithm pushes people to the most extreme.\"",

      "Kirk was shot and killed at Utah Valley University last week in what authorities have described as a \"targeted attack.\" Authorities have arrested 22-year-old Tyler Robinson on charges of aggravated murder, obstruction of justice and felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury, according to an inmate booking sheet from the Utah County Sheriff's Office. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said Sunday that the suspect is not cooperating with authorities as they try to \"to learn more about what that motive actually was.\"",
      "The speaker outlined how Kirk's assassination has been felt on Capitol Hill, saying there's \"a mixture of anger and sadness and fear, frankly, on the part of a lot of people \u2014 it cast a large shadow across the country, and the nation's capital.\"",
      "\"My good friend Charlie would not want any of us to be consumed by despair,\" Johnson said. \"He would want us to go forward boldly, that was his message, and to do it in love. And I think that, I hope, is the message that continues in the days ahead.\"",
      "Johnson described the efforts to honor Kirk's memory in Congress, including a moment of prayer and silent reflection on the House floor Wednesday, shortly after Kirk's death, while outlining that a prayer and reflection vigil will be held at the Kennedy Center in Washington later Sunday, along with a moment for members' reflection and prayer that he will lead Monday.",
      "\"This will continue,\" Johnson said. \"I think that the country needs to see leaders in Congress and leaders with platforms all around the country speaking truth and bringing calm to the situation.\"",
      "Johnson invoked President Abraham Lincoln's appeal to the nation's \"better angels,\" while urging the adoption of \"the manner of Charlie Kirk.\"",
      "\"While he loved vigorous debate and he believed in the free marketplace of ideas and advancing truth boldly, he also was motivated by love for his fellow man, because he never hated the person on the other side of the table,\" Johnson said. \"And I think everyone would do well to be reminded of that model.\"",
      "The speaker said he's been speaking with members in recent days about the fear that those holding public office are feeling in the aftermath of Kirk's death and has been \"trying to calm the nerves to assure them that we will make certain that everyone has a level of security that's necessary.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the White House is sending a $58 million request to Congress to increase security for the executive and judicial branches in the wake of Kirk's assassination, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CBS News on Saturday. And the Trump administration expressed support for increased funding to protect congressional lawmakers, but may defer to the legislative branch.",
      "Johnson said House GOP leaders are \"evaluating all the options\" to ensure resources will be available for lawmakers' residential security and personal security. And he added that \"it does take a certain measure of courage to step out and to lead,\" saying first responders, members of the military and political figures do it every day.",

    "story": [
      "Conservative activist Charlie Kirk was shot and killed at Utah Valley University on Wednesday as he addressed a large crowd at an outdoor debate. Officials described it as a \"targeted attack,\" and it drew\u00a0condemnation from both sides of the political aisle as authorities launched a massive search for the suspect.",
      "On Friday, officials announced they have a person in custody for the fatal shooting. They identified him as 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, who resides in southern Utah. Robinson was arrested on charges of aggravated murder, obstruction of justice and felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury, according to an inmate booking sheet from the Utah County Sheriff's Office.",
      "Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray is reviewing the evidence to determine the appropriate charges and plans to file them on Tuesday, Christopher Ballard, chief of staff for the Utah County Attorney's Office, confirmed to CBS Saturday. Robinson could make his first court appearance Tuesday afternoon, Ballard said.",
      "Kirk, who co-founded the right-wing advocacy group Turning Point USA, was 31. He is survived by his wife, Erika, and two young children.",
      "Turning Point USA announced Saturday that a public funeral for Kirk will be held on Sunday, Sept. 21, at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.",
      "Here is what we know so far about the assassination and ongoing investigation.",
      "Who is the suspect?",
      "More details about Robinson and what happened before and after the attack are emerging.",
      "Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said Robinson is not a student at Utah Valley University, where the attack took place, and has been living with his family in Washington County, located in the southwestern corner of the state. Family members said Robinson had \"become more political\" in recent years, the governor said.",
      "Utah State University said Robinson briefly attended the school for one semester in 2021. According to the Utah System of Higher Education, Robinson was a third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship program at Dixie Technical College in St. George, Utah.",
      "Robinson's father owns a business installing kitchen countertops and cabinets and his mother is a licensed social worker, according to public records and their social media accounts. Robinson is the oldest of three brothers.",
      "\"They are very supportive parents who loved their boys and are involved in the community,\" a neighbor who said she knew the Robinson family well but had not seen Robinson in a few years told CBS News. She also said the parents were supportive of the country and of President Trump.",
      "State records show that Robinson registered to vote as unaffiliated. He is listed as an inactive voter in state records, meaning he didn't vote in the last two elections. He was not old enough to vote in 2020.",
      "Robinson had no prior felony or misdemeanor convictions and no prior violent offenses, according to a Public Safety Assessment Report filed in Utah state court.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel said he was taken into custody at 10 p.m. local time Thursday night, though Utah officials said it was in the early hours of Friday. Records from the Utah County Sheriff's Office Corrections Division show he was booked into jail at 7:58 a.m. local time (9:58 a.m. ET).",
      "Mr. Trump first broke the news on \"Fox and Friends\" that someone had been taken into custody.",
      "\"With a high degree of certainty, we have him in custody. Everyone did a great job,\" the president said.",
      "Cox said messages on Discord, an instant messaging and social media platform, that were reviewed by investigators referenced a rifle wrapped in a towel that was left in the woods and engravings on bullets. The messages came from a person named \"Tyler\" and were shared with an unidentified individual, Cox said.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, a spokesperson for Discord said it had removed an account associated with Robinson for violating the company's \"off-platform behavior policy,\" which prohibits users from engaging in various forms of violence, and will continue to coordinate closely with law enforcement. The spokesperson also said Discord \"found no evidence that the suspect planned this incident or promoted violence\" on the platform itself.",
      "\"We are deeply saddened by this tragedy and extend our condolences to the Kirk family and everyone affected,\" the statement said. \"The messages referenced in recent reporting about planning details do not appear to be Discord messages. These were communications between the suspect's roommate and a friend after the shooting, where the roommate was recounting the contents of a note the suspect had left elsewhere.\"",
      "The governor said authorities believe Robinson acted alone and said there is currently no information that would lead to additional arrests. He told reporters Friday morning he can't answer questions about the possible motive of the suspect.",
      "Robinson is currently on \"special watch\" at the Utah County Jail while he is being evaluated to determine if he is a risk to himself or others, Utah County Sheriff's Spokesperson Sgt. Raymond Ormond told CBS News. Inmates are held in a special housing unit while on special watch.",
      "All inmates are given an initial screening after booking, but some are put on the more intensive special watch until they're screened, depending on the crimes they committed or things they said, Ormond said.",
      "How the suspect was captured",
      "Cox said Robinson's father recognized his son as the subject of photos that were released by law enforcement and urged him to turn himself in.",
      "Robinson admitted to his father that he was the person in the photos, two federal law enforcement sources told CBS News. Robinson said he would rather die by suicide than turn himself in, the federal law enforcement sources said.",
      "Robinson's father called a youth pastor who knows the 22-year-old and is close to the family, and he and the pastor tried to calm Robinson down. The sources said the pastor, who also serves as a court security officer, called the U.S. Marshals Service and other law enforcement agencies. Marshals  then detained Robinson and kept him secure while waiting for the FBI. The FBI later took him into custody.",
      "Investigators reviewed video footage and said they identified Robinson arriving on Utah Valley University's campus in a gray Dodge Challenger at around 8:29 a.m. local time Wednesday, the day of the shooting, according to the governor. Robinson was wearing a plain maroon T-shirt, light-colored shorts, a black hat with a white logo and light-colored shoes, Cox said.",
      "He is believed to have changed clothing on the roof, where the shot was fired from, before changing back into what he was originally wearing. When investigators encountered Robinson, he was wearing clothing consistent with that outfit, the governor said.",
      "Tracking the suspect",
      "On Thursday, Utah Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason described the suspect they were seeking as a male who \"blended in\" with the college community and appeared to be college age.",
      "The public safety department and the Salt Lake City FBI office posted images of someone they called a \"person of interest,\" showing an individual appearing to wear a dark long-sleeve shirt, a hat and sunglasses. More photos posted later on Thursday showed the person wearing a backpack.",
      "Mason said investigators were able to track the shooter's movements before and after the assassination.",
      "According to a probable cause statement filed by investigators after Robinson's arrest, investigators were able to track his movements on campus starting at approximately 11:50 a.m. local time on Wednesday. He was observed entering a building called the Losee Center near where Kirk's event was taking place, which was the shooting location, and going up to the roof, according to the statement.",
      "Mason said the shooter moved to the other side of the building after firing a single shot, then jumped off and fled into a neighborhood off campus. Investigators contacted homeowners with cameras and witnesses to identify leads, he said.",
      "In a news briefing Thursday evening in Orem, Utah, with Patel in attendance, officials released security video that showed a man \u2014 who Mason called a suspect \u2014 running across the roof and then climbing down the side of the building immediately after the shooting.",
      "As he climbed off the edge of the building and dropped down, he \"left some palm impressions, some smudges, some places we're looking to collect DNA,\" along with a shoe print that indicated he was wearing Converse tennis shoes, Mason told reporters while showing the video.",
      "\"It's important to note his black t-shirt, his black pants, and there appears to be some white on the soles of those Converse tennis shoes,\" Mason said. \"Those are all identifiable items that we're looking for.\"",
      "After dropping off the building, the video showed the man moving across a grassy area before entering traffic. Mason said he crossed the street into a wooded area, where the firearm believed to have been used in the shooting was later found.",
      "The FBI said it was offering a reward of up to $100,000 for information that leads law enforcement to identify and arrest the person or people involved in Kirk's assassination. Patel said authorities had received more than 11,000 leads as of Friday morning.",
      "Gun and bullet casings recovered",
      "FBI special-agent-in-charge Robert Bohls said Thursday that investigators recovered a \"high-powered, bolt-action rifle,\" which they believe was the weapon used in the assassination. It was found in a wooded area where the shooter fled and was wrapped in a towel, according to Bohls. The rifle was determined to be a Mauser .30-06-caliber bolt-action rifle, according to the probable cause statement.",
      "Cox said that there were inscriptions on the casings of the bullet that was fired, as well as on the casings of three bullets that were not fired.",
      "According to the probable cause statement, the fired bullet casing contained the inscription, \"Notices Buldge OWO what's this?\" An unfired bullet casing read, \"hey fascist! CATCH!\" followed by an up arrow symbol, a right arrow symbol and three down arrow symbols. And a second unfired casing read, \"O Bella ciao, Bella ciao, Bella ciao, Ciao, ciao!\" A third unfired casing said, \"If you read This, you are GAY Lmao.\"",
      "Cox didn't speculate on the meaning of the inscriptions.",
      "Investigators also have a footwear impression, palm print and forearm imprints that will be analyzed, the FBI official said.",
      "Timeline of \"targeted attack\"",
      "The event where Kirk was speaking was scheduled to begin in the UVU courtyard at noon.",
      "A CBS News review of livestream footage and video metadata indicates Kirk was shot around 12:23 p.m., which is also when the FBI's Patel said Kirk was shot. He was struck in the neck by a single gunshot.",
      "A map produced by CBS News' Confirmed team shows where Kirk was when he was shot \u2014 in the central courtyard of Utah Valley University, which is surrounded by campus buildings.",
      "A university spokeswoman said Wednesday that they believed the shot was fired from the Losee Center. A law enforcement source told CBS News that the gunman appeared to have fired from the building's roof.",
      "The FBI released a video\u00a0\u2014 timestamped at 12:23 p.m. local time \u2014 that appears to show a person climbing off a roof at Utah Valley University and fleeing the scene. Dispatch audio reviewed by CBS News described a person on the roof of a nearby building wearing black clothing and carrying a long rifle.",
      "Video captured at 2:37 p.m. shows officers searching an area around a quarter mile north of the campus.",
      "At 2:40, more than two hours after the shooting, Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social that Kirk had died.",
      "While authorities have not specified a potential motive for the shooting, Mason said they believe it was a \"targeted attack toward one individual.\" Only one shot was fired, and Kirk was the only victim, the commissioner said.",
      "Cox called the shooting \"a political assassination,\" while Mr. Trump, in a video posted to Truth Social, blamed it on \"radical left political violence,\" which he said \"has hurt too many innocent people and taken too many lives.\"",
      "Charlie Kirk's influence in politics",
      "Kirk was shot while he was speaking at a \"Prove Me Wrong\" debate, a trademark event for Kirk's Turning Point USA, which is a conservative organization focused on young people. He would hold political debates with a group that usually consisted of left-leaning attendees.",
      "Kirk had visited the Utah university as part of a nationwide tour of college campuses that was scheduled to continue for the next two months. About 3,000 people attended the outdoor event where he was assassinated, the Utah Department of Public Safety said in a statement.",
      "Mr. Trump called Kirk legendary, saying, \"No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie. He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us.\"",
      "Kirk was a close Trump ally and was credited with galvanizing younger voters during his campaign. He made it his mission to engage more young people in politics and register them to vote. Kirk was also a close friend of the president's son, Donald Trump Jr.",
      "Kirk was the host of \"The Charlie Kirk Show,\" a daily conservative talk radio show and amassed millions of followers on social media.",
      "Kirk's politics, however, weren't without controversy. He pushed false claims about voter fraud after Mr. Trump lost the 2020 presidential election, stoked skepticism about the COVID-19 pandemic and spread anti-trans rhetoric. He also amplified the \"Great Replacement\" conspiracy, which is based on the belief that there's a plot to replace White people with minorities.",
      "He was a friend of JD Vance, who said Kirk advocated \"in public and private\" for Mr. Trump to pick him as his running mate last year.",
      "\"So much of the success we've had in this administration traces directly to Charlie's ability to organize and convene,\" Vance said after Kirk was killed. \"He didn't just help us win in 2024, he helped us staff the entire government.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 14 Sep 2025 10:38:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The murder of Charlie Kirk last week follows a litany of violent acts against political targets. Historian Jon Meacham talks about the existential questions now facing America.",
    "story": [
      "For Jon Meacham, the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian, and author of \"The Soul of America: The Battle for Our Better Angels,\" this past week has been disturbing \u2014 and all too familiar. Asked what is the state of America's soul today, he replied, \"I think that we are in a dangerous place. There's never been a once-upon-a-time in American history. There's not going to be a happily-ever-after. But there are moments that you and I could agree we would like to see replicated \u2014 and this is not one of them.",
      "\"Political violence erupts in America when there is an existential question \u2014 who is an American? Who deserves to be included in 'We the people,' or 'All men being created equal'?\" he said. \"When that is in tension, when we don't have common agreement about that, then, if you look at it historically, violence erupts.\"",
      "And on Wednesday, it did.",
      "At Utah Valley University, the crack of a gunshot once again rattled America. Charlie Kirk, a prominent 31-year-old conservative activist, was assassinated as he engaged in public debate.",
      "By Thursday, a suspect was in custody: 22-year-old Utah resident Tyler Robinson.",
      "Kirk had a fervent following on the right, and was a key organizer in President Donald Trump's movement. (At the 2020 GOP Convention, Kirk referred to Trump as \"the bodyguard of Western civilization.\") He also had his critics, who called him an incendiary voice [as when, on his eponymous show, he exclaimed, \"The entire Democrat Party project is how quickly we can turn America into a third-world hellhole\"].",
      "His death has become the latest convulsion in a divided country.",
      "Meacham told Robert Costa, \"We do not want to be in a place where because you disagree with someone, you pick up a gun. That is not what the country can be. And if it is, then it's something different.\"",
      "It's not America? \"It's not the America we want,\" he said.",
      "Kirk's murder is the latest of numerous acts of political violence since last summer, when we saw the first of two assassination attempts on candidate Trump, followed by (to name just a few) the firebombing of the home of Pennsylvania's governor, Democrat Josh Shapiro; the killing of Democratic lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband in Minnesota; the murder of two Israeli embassy workers\u00a0in Washington; and the killing of police officer David Rose\u00a0in a shooting outside\u00a0CDC headquarters in Atlanta.",
      "Costa asked Meacham, \"Are we in a particular time in America when all of this seems to keep happening?\"",
      "\"We are, self-evidently,\" Meacham replied. \"And I think it's because we are experiencing an era in which we are debating, not only the means of politics, but the purpose of politics.\"",
      "Meacham says the purpose of America is an urgent cause for leaders, and for citizens: \"When we lose the capacity to engage in argument and dissent and debate peaceably, we are breaking faith with the American covenant,\" he said. \"And the American covenant is that we live in contention with each other, but we're not at each other's throats.\"",
      "Asked what our political leaders can do to keep that covenant, Meacham said, \"Make the case. Tell the story. What do you want the country to be? This is why history matters, I think, more than ever, because there's not a hell of a lot going on in the present that you want to say, 'Yeah, we want more of that,' right?",
      "\"You want to tell the story of Omaha Beach. You want to tell the story of the Pettus Bridge. You want to tell the story of Gettysburg. Because those were moments where imperfect people actually created a more perfect union. It's not that they were superhuman. Quite the opposite,\" he said.",
      "They got through it, Meacham said, \"barely.\"",
      "But even if Americans can just barely carry on this weekend, Meacham says we must: \"If they could do it, then we can, too, if we decide that this country is about a more perfect union, it is about dissent, it is about respecting each other, and it is not about hunting each other down.\"",

    "summary": "AI wants to help you save time and money when planning your next trip, but how good is it at getting you the best deals?",
    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence is poised to change how businesses and consumers interact in virtually every industry, including travel, which is ripe for disruption by AI.",
      "When the first online trip planning sites emerged in the mid-1990s, they let consumers act as their own travel agents. Decades later, artificial intelligence tools are able to take over that role, and plan and book trips on behalf of travelers, saving them time and even money.",
      "\"It takes a lot of research and clicking around. It takes an average of 30 days between when you start planning a trip and when it's fully finished,\" Skylar Erickson, co-founder of Gondola AI, which helps consumers maximize their loyalty points, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You have 40 tabs open on your browser, so it takes a lot of work to get to that right answer.\"",
      "Also, because airfares and hotel room rates fluctuate constantly based on demand, shoppers could save a lot of time using a chatbot or other AI-powered tool to track and compare prices rather than manually refreshing their browsers.",
      "\"You log into a site, and you're trying to find the right price based on what other airlines are charging \u2014 that's the ultimate goal,\" Ram Reddy, an AI expert and chief technology officer at Nagarro, a consulting firm, said. \"AI tools that know you well can get you to the right place at the right time, when prices, which aren't static, are changing every minute.\"",
      "Consumers booking trips are already seeing AI's value: 41% of more than 2,000 consumers\u00a0surveyed\u00a0by Oliver Wyman, a management consulting firm, said they had recently used AI tools for travel inspiration or itinerary planning.",
      "From inspiration to booking",
      "There are a range of AI-powered apps and bots at consumers' fingertips that can help plan a trip \u2014 from inception to booking. AI-powered bots can help travelers dream up trip ideas, turn visual inspiration into ready-to-go itineraries, and complete bookings and payments while maximizing the consumer's own loyalty points and other rewards so that they save money. In other words, AI provides the services in which travel agents at brick-and-mortar travel agencies once specialized.",
      "Ways AI can assist travel planning",
      "Did you see a social media post of a trip you'd like to be on? Send it to Expedia to book your own version through a feature called Trip Matching, which can turn social media reels into bookable trip itineraries.",
      "Don't know what to plan for the kids while on a family vacation? ChatGPT can generate a list of free activities in any locale.",
      "Not sure how many loyalty points or rewards you've accrued, or what they're worth? A company called Gondola AI can figure that out, helping users maximize their loyalty points so their dollars take them further.",
      "Trip planning and booking is prime territory for AI agents to test their skills, and hopefully, make the process easier for consumers, according to AI leaders.",
      "\"These days, it's easier to identify where AI is not being used to help travelers. It is everywhere, from planning to booking,\" Melanie Fish, head of global PR for Expedia Brands, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Jennifer Yellin, travel expert at Points Path, a browser extension that helps consumers compare flight deals, said the more she utilizes AI for trip planning, the better the technology gets to know her, and the more useful it becomes.",
      "\"The more you use it, it starts to recognize your patterns and preferences. It gets to know you as a traveler,\" she said of a Gondola AI, one of her favorite new tools. \"If you've been booking stays at Ritz Carltons, it won't suggest a Marriott Residence Inn as a first option; it will suggest a stay of a similar caliber.\"",
      "\"I used it dozens of times\"",
      "Other travel industry pros say they see more value in AI's ability to help them navigate locales once they've arrived.",
      "\"ChatGPT totally revolutionized how we were able to get along in China \u2014 I used it to scan menus and translate them into English,\" Scott Keyes, founder of flight deals site Going.com, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I used it dozens of times a day.\"",
      "As far as trip planning goes, Keyes said that while he's generally an AI optimist, \"the use case has not yet proven itself to me.\"",
      "Which tools are the most helpful? These are some popular trip planning tools. Here's how they can help, and where they fall short.",
      "AI travel planning tools",
      "ChatGPT:\u00a0The AI chatbot can suggest places to stay or things to do anywhere in the world. Tell it you're visiting New York City around Christmastime with young children and you're not sure what neighborhood to stay in. It can suggest parts of town and outline their pros and cons.",
      "Google Flight Deals: Enter a destination and desired dates, or describe the type of trip you'd like to take, such as \"beach escape,\" or \"Paris in the fall.\" Let the AI-powered search engine \u2014 designed for travelers who want to save money \u2014 try to find you the best deal based on such parameters. The tool is not an AI agent though, and can't book tickets for you.",
      "Expedia Trip Matching:\u00a0The AI tool lets you send a public Instagram travel reel, or video, to Expedia, which will create an itinerary based on the visual inspiration you provide. The reel must be publicly available on Instagram, and the AI tool can only suggest trips in the U.S. market.",
      "Gondola AI: Give the tool access to your email, and it will cull your loyalty points and rewards from airlines, hotels and credit card companies to let you know what they are worth. It will compare prices in cash versus combinations of points, and can save you hundreds of dollars. It comes into play after you've decided where you want to go and stay. \"We are about finding you money, earning you money and redeeming at the highest possible value,\" Erickson said.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with University of Chicago professor Robert Pape that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 14, 2025.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back. We're going to take a closer look at the problem of political violence in America. And we're joined now, I'm glad to say, by University of Chicago Professor Robert Pape. He's the founding director of the Chicago Project on Security and Threats. Professor, it's great to have you with us. Thanks for joining us. What are the trend lines, and what is the key terminology you want my audience to understand?",
      "PROFESSOR ROBERT PAPE: We are now in a watershed moment for what I call the era of violent populism in America. This era is defined, first and foremost, by two factors: Number one, a rising tide of political violence on both the right and the left. And just think, and I want to go back to 2002 just think of the attack- the assassination attempt on Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Leader of the House, missed her, almost killed her husband. The attempt on Brett Kavanaugh, conservative Supreme Court Justice. Two attempts on Republican candidate Donald Trump, and then the- in Minnesota just a few months ago, not just attempts, but actual assassinations of Democratic leaders. Josh Shapiro, Governor of Pennsylvania. And now, we see Charlie Kirk assassinated. And what we are seeing is this clear rising trend in numbers of attacks, side-by-side with that, though, we are also seeing a rising tide, a groundswell of support for political violence on both the right and the left that corresponds with this rising trend of political violence on both the right and the left. Our Center at the University of Chicago Project on Security and Threats, we have been conducting highly reliable national surveys on political violence- the support for political violence among Americans for over four years. We started this in the summer of 2021. Our most recent survey in- survey in May found higher levels of support for political violence on both the right and the left than we have ever seen, and that's one of the reasons why I rang the alarm bell with that big op-ed in the New York Times in June saying we're on the cusp of major political violence, and I'm sorry to say we're now right in the grip of violent populism.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And in that survey data, is it that people who respond to your survey say, to reconcile myself to the political outcome I want- I will be willing to resort to violence? Is that the key connection point?",
      "PAPE: The key connection is the particular political grievance. So we asked, just give you an example, 39% of Democrats say they agree that the use of force is justified to remove Donald Trump from the presidency. When we go deeper to probe what do they mean by use of force? 55% are talking about assassinations. They're talking about lethal uses of force. That's why we use that term. On the right, we also asked that very same survey. We found 24% of Republicans agree that Donald Trump is justified in using the US military to suppress democratic protesters. So these are very specific questions. We have a whole slew of these questions so that we really can speak with great precision about what are the grievances that people want to say use of force is justified. We know what the meaning of that term is, and then we can see Democrat-Republican in the cross-tabs.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Does your research buttress the point that both Senator Lankford and Senator Coons made, which is the internet is an accelerant and an amplifier?",
      "PAPE: It's an accelerant, but it's not the root cause. So, studying this problem now for five years, I found that just as around the world, big social change, it drives political violence. We see this in other countries around the world, and- but the details of the change vary. We are now moving for the first time in our country's 250-year history, from a white majority democracy, to a white minority democracy. In 1990, we were 76% non-Hispanic white. Today, we're 57% non-Hispanic white. It will be another 10 years, maybe 15 if we deport a lot of those undocumented, illegal immigrants, before we make the transition to a truly white-minority democracy. Well, this generational change has happened. It started about 10 years ago, with the real tipping point generation and corresponds with the rise of Donald Trump, why his issue of immigration is meteoric, why it's morphed from immigration meaning stop people crossing the border to now deporting mass numbers of people, because there are people on the right who want to stop or reverse this, and also the virulent reaction to Donald Trump on the left- on parts of the left, who want to keep this going. This is really the taproot, and that's why we need to expect- this left to its own devices will get worse and be with us for 10 years.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: So, this is a demographic story that is creating a political backlash that gets amplified and accelerated online. Do I have that right?",
      "PAPE: You've got it exactly right. And these are why it's not the internet is not important. It's a reinforcing factor. And there is \u2013",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: In other words, it's too simplistic to say it's the internet?",
      "PAPE: Exactly. Because-that's why- a few years ago, people challenged my findings, and said, oh no, no, we'll just deplatform people. So the problem here is just the internet, so we're going to deplatform X, Y, and Z. We deplatformed X, Y, and Z, and you know what? Didn't miss a beat. And the reason is because, yes, it is an additional- it's like throwing gasoline on the fire, but the internet is not the fire itself. There's something going on, which is really radicalizing our politics. And I'm sorry to say, this is a story that we've seen around the world, in other countries, other times. And so this is- this is the social change leading to radicalized politics that changes winners and losers in our society for real, and that's leading to political violence.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Professor, it has always been a hallmark of this country, we have sort of thought about ourselves as having this experiment that has lots of differences of opinion, spasms of violence, but in the end, we reconcile and we move forward. Are you any more or less optimistic about that and that underlying assumption about the core ability of America than you were previously?",
      "PAPE: The future is in our hands. This is not locked-in with destiny. That said, if we do nothing, this will keep getting worse. The number one thing we have to do is we need our political leaders to step up. And we just saw an instance of that, just previously, where we have Senators from both sides of the aisle making a joint video appearance. Well, that's really quite- to condemn violence. That's important, because the leaders can restrain their own constituents. When they bad-mouth the other side's constituents, our data shows that makes everything worse. That's the worst of all possible worlds, because it produces defiance. We need to step that up. What would step that up? A summit between President Trump, Governor Newsom, and Governor Pritzker, a public session where they, all together, condemn political violence.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Professor Pape, I'm very glad you're here. Modeling behavior matters in many contexts, in life, political, and otherwise. Thank you very much. We'll be back in just a moment."

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sens. Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, and James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 14, 2025.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to \"Face The Nation.\" For a look at how Congress may- may help bridge political divisions in the country presently, we turn to a couple of lawmakers with a lot of experience in that space. Democratic Senator Chris Coons, who joins us from Wilmington, Delaware, Republican Senator James Lankford, who joins us from Oklahoma City. Gentlemen, you have a well-earned reputation, both, for preaching bipartisanship, taking the rhetorical temperature in Washington and nationwide down a notch or two. Senator Coons, I want to start with you. After the events of this week, do you feel that's harder than ever to achieve?",
      "SEN. CHRIS COONS: It is. And, Major, thank you, for a chance to be on with you and with my friend, Senator Lankford. The brutal assassination of Charlie Kirk, while he was in the middle of a debate on a college campus, goes to the very heart of what it means to be American, of the importance of the First Amendment, of free speech, and someone like Charlie Kirk, who was a nationally known figure, who dedicated himself to debate, to engagement with his political adversaries, should not have paid with his life for the opportunity to speak out. No matter how much I might deeply disagree with his political views, the idea that he would be killed in such a grotesque and public way has to bring all of us to reflect about how hard it's getting, because the internet is an accelerant. It is driving extremism in our country. It's driving us apart, left and right, and leaders like Senator Lankford, Governor Cox, have an obligation and an opportunity to join with leaders from my party in urging folks to set aside any thought of political violence and to respect each other, even as we keep advancing our political differences through discourse.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Lankford, do you ever at times feel as if your appeals for better angels, calmer rhetoric, more bipartisanship, is shouting into an internet void?",
      "SEN. JAMES LANKFORD: It is, because the algorithm pushes people to the most extreme. The algorithm is all- on social media is always pushing who's the angriest, who's the loudest, who says the craziest thing, that's what gets repeated over and over and over again. So anytime that there is cogent dialogue or an issue on something where people may disagree, but they're having a civil conversation on it, that gets pushed aside, towards someone that's just angry and focused. This is somewhat human nature, to be able to say, we disagree. We find areas where we disagree, and we try to be able to solve those. The best way to be able to solve those is through words, talking it out, finding an opportunity to be able to do it. But I would tell you, this kind of anger is as old as Cain and Abel. To be able to go back and say, I'm mad at you, so I'm going to try to destroy you, whether it's destroy you online, or to try to humiliate you, or to cancel you, or to, in this case, try to murder you publicly. It is- it is painful to be able to see that part of humanity, and it is better for us to be able to push better angels.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Lankford, first you, then Senator Coons. Senator Lankford, are you afraid for your own security right now?",
      "SEN. LANKFORD: I am- I am attentive to my own security, how about that, for myself and for my family. My staff and I have to- have to talk through each public event, but we've had to do that for a while. As you may know well, there have been 14,000 threats against members of Congress just this calendar year. This is not new, but it continues to be able to rise. As we've seen, Democratic lawmakers in Minnesota, in their own home, have a home invasion, to be murdered in their home, as we've seen a governor in Pennsylvania have his home set on fire. It's not just public events, it's also in our private spaces as well, that we're keenly aware that there are people that are irrational, that do irrational acts.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Coons?",
      "SEN. COONS: I agree that for all of us who serve in public life, whether it's leading a nonprofit or a church, teaching in a school, or being a public advocate, someone engaged in public debate as Charlie Kirk was, the risk is getting higher. And to have to worry about the safety of your own family, if you step forward to serve as a judge, if you write editorials, if you lead a nonprofit, or if you serve in Congress or run for president, to have to worry not just about your own physical safety, but the safety of your spouse and children, I think, weakens our ability to have good and robust debates, to have a well-led nation, and to demonstrate to the world that we're a nation committed to free speech, but where we reject political violence. So of course, anyone in public life today is more concerned about the tragedy in Utah, about the incidents that Senator Lankford just referenced, the attempt to kidnap the governor of Michigan, to assault Speaker Pelosi's husband, the shooting of Steve Scalise and the shootings at other members of Congress. The recent incidents have gotten worse and worse and I think I know the reason. It's principally because the internet is fueling and accelerating those deep-seated inclinations towards violence and seeing others as enemies that James was referencing. And there are steps we can and should take in Congress to address that.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The administration this weekend, as I'm sure you two are both aware, putting before Congress $58 billion in security for members of Congress, the judiciary and the like. Senator Coons, you believe Congress will be disposed to agree to that?",
      "SEN. COONS: I hope that we will step up and invest more. I just hosted a bipartisan event last week on protecting state judges, and we had state judicial leaders from across the country, from Delaware and Texas and many other states, talk about harrowing incidents and tragic killings of members of the judiciary. I hope we will invest in securing our public life, because incidents like this tragedy in Utah, like the murder of Melissa and her husband Mark Hortman in Minnesota, frankly, fuel further anger in our country, and the ways in which folks are then taking the horrific images of these incidents and propagating them on the internet, adds fuel to the fire. We can and should pass bills, as we just did. Senator Cruz and Senator Klobuchar worked together to pass, and President Trump signed into law, the TAKE IT DOWN Act, to remove some of the most harmful pornographic, revenge porn images from the internet. And we have a bill right in front of us, the Kids Online Safety Act that's broadly bipartisan, that we should pass to help reduce some of the risks and harms to our families in our country, from the internet.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Lankford, I misspoke that's 58 million, not 58 billion, but it's a substantial sum.",
      "SEN. LANKFORD: Yeah, it is a substantial sum. What was funny was I was going to actually correct you on that, to let you know it's an 'M', not a 'B' on that particular one, but it is something to be able to set aside and say, what are we doing? It's not- it is about the person and their family, but it's also about the title. It's about the task, because that person represents that state, that- that part of the nation, that particular task, my wife and I often talk about the fact that I have this title of senator for a season. Someone else had it before me, someone else will have it after me. But while I have it, I'm a steward of that task and that responsibility. And so when we're talking about protecting judges and protecting individuals, it's not just their personal safety. It is really declaring to the nation that we believe that these tasks are hard, that there should be intense debate, that we have very different perspectives. Chris Coons and I are very close friends, but we have very different ideas on some things. But we have the ability to be able to represent our individual states instead of ideas, and to be able to talk those two things out, and to be able to bring things together and say, I know areas where we disagree, where do we agree? How can we solve it? That is where we are at our best as Americans is to say we don't oppress each other. We try to be able to find our common ground and to be able to move forward as we can and- but as Chris has mentioned, the online kids safety Act is a great piece of legislation to be able to protect our kids. We are seeing people radicalize online, on social media and through the internet in the United States, by other Americans and by the algorithm that's there. And I would tell you, as recently as just a couple of weeks ago, I was in a school in Oklahoma that now Oklahoma schools have banned all cell phones from bell to bell at school. You cannot have a cell phone on your- on your- on from bell to bell on campus. And the principals and the teachers all talk about how dramatically different the environment is on campus right now because people are looking up, people are interacting. People are talking again. They're not just staring at their phone. They're not getting fed all this vitriol all day long. And so it changes the mood of everything just by looking at each other in the face and saying, let's see if we can work this out.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Lankford, I'm going to bring up something that's playing out through the country right now, and it's making all the things you and Senator Coons have talked about more difficult, which is people who have posted about Charlie Kirk have jobs and are being fired because what they've posted online has been viewed by their personnel directors or leaders as inappropriate. At any governmental level or in the private sector, are you comfortable having someone fired for an utterance about Charlie Kirk's death?",
      "SEN. LANKFORD: Yeah, this is about protecting the individual businesses. And what people are seeing is this cancel culture that still persists, that if you voice something that becomes a big push back from the community, the employer will step up and say, hey, you're about to kill our business based on what you're saying online. Everyone has to understand what they say privately online can get connected to their business. We have a veterinarian clinic in Oklahoma City right now that one of the veterinarians posted something just absolutely horrific about--and now we're calling out the sick ones right after Charlie Kirk was murdered that now there's been big pushback through that veterinary clinic, because people are saying, okay, this is the person- do I want to do business with that person if they have that belief? So this is part of the challenge that we have with social media and with employments. Employers are going to say, don't hurt our business based on the foolish things that you choose to say, to be able to say online.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Coons, how about within the federal government?",
      "SEN. COONS: Well, the way James put it there, I think, is a good balance between it's okay to have codes of conduct to say to an employee, you shouldn't be speaking out on behalf of this company or this department of the federal government, where your role, for example, requires that you be trusted and that you not take partisan political positions. One of the challenges of the intersection of the line between social media and one's conduct on behalf of the government is that today we can see into your internal views. But it's not that new. So, let's imagine that you're a career federal prosecutor or you're a judge. Historically, there have been clear rules against engaging in partisan politics while you're performing those functions. The internet just makes it easier for folks to police and punish those who make statements that are considered extreme or out of the mainstream. Cancel culture is a real challenge to us, to balancing free speech with positions of responsibility, and we have to find our way through this together in a way that offers some grace and humility while celebrating the free speech that is the foundation of our republic, and urging people to think twice before they post things that are outrageous online.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Lankford, the country is going to look to Congress here in the next couple of weeks to avert a government shutdown. Also possibly extend soon to expire Affordable Care Act subsidies that help people afford insurance. In this climate and with those eyes of the nation upon Congress, how do you expect that to play out?",
      "SEN. LANKFORD: I expect us to be able to solve the budget issues, which the American people expect to be able to- to do as well. These are hard issues. We're sent to be able to do hard things. We should do hard things on it. We should not, first and foremost, have a government shutdown. We have $37 trillion in debt right now. We should have hard conversations about debt and deficit, but they shouldn't be during a government shutdown. What we're currently arguing right now about is a seven-week extension on the current budget spending, to say we're not changing anything, but for the next seven weeks, let's just hold it until we get a longer budget agreement and can actually come to agreement. What has been floated is a $300 billion requirement, by some of my Democratic colleagues, to say, if we don't spend an additional $300 billion, we're not going to keep the government open the next seven weeks. This is also a subsidy, an insurance subsidy, that was put in place during COVID and just after COVID, to say, due to the health care issues around COVID, we're going to extend additional insurance coverage that's there. COVID and the crisis of COVID has now passed on it, it's difficult to say we should spend an additional $300 billion just to stay open the next seven weeks due to a COVID emergency at this point. So yes, we'll have- we'll have hard conversations, but let's have it. Let's- let's talk it out. Let's figure it out.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Coons, you're going to get the last word. Respond to Senator Lankford on that.",
      "SEN. COONS: Well, this is an area where Senator Lankford and I disagree. We are both appropriators. We both want to find a way to work together to keep the government open, but the Republican-only bill that was passed earlier this year, the so-called Big Beautiful Bill, threatens to raise rates for health care for millions of Americans and to throw millions more off of health care. I think there are ways we can reduce the harm to Americans' healthcare through the appropriations process. The bill that we both voted for in our committee in July would restore many of the proposed deep cuts to the National Institutes of Health for example, one positive step forward. We have to find a way to resolve these issues and reduce or reverse some of the harm that's being done to Americans' health care.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Chris Coons, Delaware Democrat. Senator James Lankford, Oklahoma Republican. Thank you both. I appreciate it. And we'll be right back."

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with House Speaker Mike Johnson that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 14, 2025.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, who joins us this morning from Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, it's good to see you. I appreciate your time. The burdens of speakership are always manifold. You know that. Previous speakers I've covered know that, but they feel particularly heavy after the events of this week. I just want to ask you, Mr. Speaker, how are you doing?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: I'm doing okay, Major. Thanks for asking. No question, it was a difficult week for the country. Certainly, it was felt on Capitol Hill. There's a mixture of, you know, anger and sadness and fear, frankly, on the part of a lot of people. It cast a large shadow across the country and the nation's capital. But what I do know, Major, is that my good friend Charlie would not want any of us to be consumed by despair. He would want us to go forward boldly, that was his message, and to do it in love. And I think that, I hope, is the message that continues in the days ahead.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: It's not common for this show to pick up on something said by Connecticut's Young Democrats and Connecticut's Young Republicans, but they put out a statement that has gotten quite a bit of attention on the internet, saying as follows, \"there is no place in our country for such acts, regardless of political disagreements.\" Do you believe on Capitol Hill there will be a method to forge any sort of bipartisan remembrance of Charlie Kirk?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: There will be. You know, we had a moment of prayer and silent reflection on the floor on Wednesday within an hour of his passing. There will be, I participated in a large vigil here in Baton Rouge at LSU, my alma mater, on Friday night. Tonight, we'll have a big, I hope, bipartisan prayer and reflection vigil in Capitol Hill at the Kennedy Center. There will be a members reflection and prayer moment that I'll lead on Monday night. This will continue. I think that the country needs to see leaders in Congress and leaders with platforms all around the country speaking truth and bringing calm to the situation. We should appeal, as Lincoln reminded us so many years ago, to the better angels among us all. And I think this is a real moment for America [TECHNICAL DISRUPTION] -- affirmatively. And I think one of the ways to do that, Major, is to adopt the manner of Charlie Kirk because while he loved vigorous debate and he believed in the free marketplace of ideas, and advancing truth boldly, he also was motivated by love for his fellow man because he never hated the person on the other side of the table. And I think everyone would do well to be reminded of that model.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Mr. Speaker, you mentioned the word fear a moment ago. It is on the lips of members of Congress in ways I've never experienced before. They are talking openly. They already have canceled events. Other members are talking about whether or not it's proper in their family conversations to seek re-election. How do you feel this particular space of anxiety for your membership, Republican and Democrat?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: Yeah, well, I've been talking with a lot of them over the last few days about that and trying to calm the nerves, to assure them that we will, we will make certain that everyone has a level of security that's necessary, that the resources will be there for their residential security and their personal security. We're evaluating all the options for that. But also, to be- to be, you know, reminded that it does take a certain measure of courage to step out and- and to lead. I mean, our first responders do it every day, our members of the military do it every day and political figures as well. But I think if we all adopt these practices together and we turn down the rhetoric, we, you know, cease with this idea that, you know, policy disputes are somehow an existential threat to democracy or the republic, we stop calling one another names. I mean calling people Nazis and fascists is not helpful. Look, there are some deranged people in society and when they see leaders using that kind of language, so often now, increasingly, it spurs them on to action. We have to recognize that reality and address it appropriately. And I'm heartened to know, Major, and to see that many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are stepping up and saying that and addressing it. I think this could be a turning point, frankly, to use Charlie's term, for the country, and I hope that's true.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Would that turning point, from your vantage point, Mr. Speaker, because I know you had a long conversation with President Trump, extend to the White House itself?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: Well, of course. Look, the President knew Charlie very well. He was like a family member to the Trumps. Many of us felt that close association with him, and he admired Charlie's approach to public debate. And you've heard him say that publicly. He was- Charlie was a good man, and I think the best way we honor his memory is to continue to do that very thing, and not shy away from debate, to keep the free marketplace of ideas going, but to work on the tone of those debates. Because I think that- I think that serves the best of our principles, our Judeo-Christian heritage as a nation, our civil discourse, and we got to return to that.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Mr. Speaker, several issues pending before Congress, not the least of which is keeping the government open. I know you prefer a seven-week clean CR, but there is a press for other issues. Extending Obamacare tax subsidies. There's been a push this weekend for Russia sanctions backed by Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, in the Senate. Will either of those, from your vantage point, get into something to keep the government open?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: Well, listen, we've been working very hard in the House to restore regular order in the appropriations government funding process, and that's something that no one's really seen for a long time on Capitol Hill. But I'm encouraged that, in a bipartisan fashion, our House Appropriations Committee has passed all 12 of the annual appropriations bills through the committee. We've got three off the House floor. The Senate's passed a few, and then last week, we voted to move into a conference [TECHNICAL DISRUPTION] --",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: -- Okay, Mr. Speaker, I believe there's a technical glitch that has forced us to lose your audio. We're going to take a quick break, and we'll come right back to House Speaker Mike Johnson in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in just a moment.",
      "[COMMERCIAL BREAK]",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to Face the Nation. Because technical gremlins lurk everywhere, they got in between my conversation with House Speaker Mike Johnson. Mr. Speaker, I'm glad to have you back. You were in the middle of answering about Obamacare tax subsidies, possible sanctions against Russia and a government funding mechanism. Please continue.",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: Yeah, sorry about the interruption there. Listen, we're very encouraged that we've been able to restore the regular appropriations, regular order process --",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: -- Right, but are we going to get this done? Are those two other things going to be added to the process, Mr. Speaker?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: We'll have to see. I got to build consensus around all of it, but I think we'll need a short-term funding measure. A clean CR that will allow more time to figure all this out. We certainly hope that Democrats will go along on that, because, if not, they really have no excuse. If they shut the government down, it would be their unilateral decision to do so.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And when Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, says, as he did this weekend, now is the time for Russia sanctions. President Trump opened the door on tariffs against India and China as a way to create economic leverage to end the war in Ukraine. Where do you stand on all that?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: Listen, I do believe that desperate times call for desperate measures, and I think appropriate sanctions on Russia are far overdue. I mean, I think there's a big appetite for that in Congress, so we're willing to work with the White House and our Senate colleagues in the House to get that done and I'm anxious to do it, personally.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Are you waiting for the President to give you the green light or might Congress act on this on its own volition?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: Well, Congress really can't do this on its own volition because, of course, the President would need to sign whatever we do into law. So it has to be a partnership, but we defer to the commander in chief. I mean, the President is a strong and bold leader on the world stage. He has brokered peace around the world and other conflicts in a way that no one before him has been able to do, and so we're trusting that he can use that same force and that same approach to bring about, finally, an end to this war in Ukraine. Everyone in America wants that bloodshed to end, and President Trump is forcing that, and I certainly [TECHNICAL DISRUPTION]--",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Okay. Mr. Speaker, I'm told that the technical difficulties keep arising, so a bit prematurely we're going to end our conversation here to spare you and spare our audience from continued mayhem by technical gremlins. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the time. Thank you for joining us on Face the Nation."

      "Twenty six police officers were injured \u2014 four who were seriously hurt, including broken teeth and a concussion, a possible broken nose and a spinal injury. At least 25 people were arrested for offenses including violent disorder, assaults and criminal damage, and the investigation continues, police said.",
      "\"There is no doubt that many came to exercise their lawful right to protest, but there were many who came intent on violence,\" Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist said. \"They confronted officers, engaging in physical and verbal abuse and making a determined effort to breach cordons in place to keep everyone safe.\"",
      "The rally drew an estimated crowd of between 110,000 and 150,000 people, far surpassing expectations, police said. The rival \"March Against Fascism\" protest organized by Stand Up To Racism had about 5,000 marchers.",
      "At one point, the larger crowd stretched from Big Ben across the River Thames and around the corner beyond Waterloo train station, a distance of three-quarters of a mile (around a kilometer).",
      "While the crowd was large, it fell far short of one of the biggest recent marches when a pro-Palestinian rally drew an estimated 300,000 people in November 2023.",
      "Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon and is known for his nationalist and anti-migrant views, billed the march as a demonstration for free speech, and also said it was in defense of British heritage and culture.",
      "The marches come at a time when the U.K. has been riven by debate over migrants crossing the English Channel in overcrowded inflatable boats to arrive on shore without authorization.",
      "Numerous anti-migrant protests were held this summer outside hotels housing asylum-seekers following the arrest of an Ethiopian man who was later convicted of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl in a London suburb. Some of those protests became violent and led to arrests.",
      "Participants in the \"Unite the Kingdom\" march carried the St. George's red-and-white flag of England and the Union Jack, the state flag of the United Kingdom, and chanted, \"We want our country back.\" U.K. flags have proliferated this summer across the U.K. \u2014 at events and on village lampposts \u2014 in what some have said is a show of national pride and others said reflects a tilt toward nationalism.",
      "Some Robinson supporters held signs saying \"stop the boats,\" \"send them home,\" and \"enough is enough, save our children.\"",
      "At the counterprotest, the crowd held signs saying \"refugees welcome\" and \"smash the far right,\" and shouted \"stand up, fight back.\"",
      "Robinson supporters chanted crude refrains about U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and also shouted messages of support for slain U.S. conservative activist Charlie Kirk.",
      "Kirk was shot and killed on Wednesday at Utah Valley University as he addressed a large crowd at an outdoor debate. Officials described it as a \"targeted attack,\" and it drew\u00a0condemnation from both sides\u00a0of the political aisle as authorities launched a massive\u00a0search\u00a0for the suspect.",
      "Officials announced they have a person in custody for the fatal shooting and identified him as 22-year-old\u00a0Tyler Robinson, who resides in southern Utah. Robinson was arrested on charges of aggravated murder, obstruction of justice and felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury, according to an inmate booking sheet from the Utah County Sheriff's Office.",
      "One demonstrator held a sign saying: \"Freedom of speech is dead. RIP Charlie Kirk.\"",
      "Robinson had planned a \"Unite the Kingdom\" rally last October, but couldn't attend after being jailed for contempt of court for violating a 2021 High Court order barring him from repeating libelous allegations against a Syrian refugee who successfully sued him. He previously served jail time for assault and mortgage fraud.",
      "Robinson founded the nationalist and anti-Islamist English Defence League and is one of the most influential far-right figures in Britain. He urged followers not to wear masks, drink booze or get violent.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-nato-oil-russia-china-tariffs-ukraine-war/",
    "published": "Sat, 13 Sep 2025 21:14:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump said that NATO's commitment to winning the war in Ukraine \"has been far less than 100%.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said he believes the more than three-year war in Ukraine would end if all NATO countries stopped buying oil from Russia and placed tariffs on China for its purchases of Russian petroleum. The announcement came as Romania became the second NATO country to report a Russian drone incursion.",
      "Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social on Saturday a letter purportedly sent to NATO in which he said he is \"ready to do major Sanctions on Russia\" on the condition that all NATO countries stop buying Russian oil. The president said the military alliance's commitment to winning the war in Ukraine \"has been far less than 100%\" and the purchase of Russian oil by some members is \"shocking.\"",
      "\"It greatly weakens your negotiation position, and bargaining power, over Russia,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "Since 2023, NATO member Turkey has been the third largest buyer of Russian oil, after China and India, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. Other members of the 32-state alliance involved in purchasing Russian oil include Hungary and Slovakia.",
      "Mr. Trump's letter comes at a tense moment in the conflict for NATO after the recent incursion by\u00a0multiple Russian drones into the airspace of alliance member Poland. It's being seen as an escalatory move by Russia and Poland shot down several of the drones.",
      "Earlier this week, Mr. Trump appeared to play down the significance of the incident, saying the incursion may not have been deliberate",
      "\"It could have been a mistake,\" he told journalists late Thursday. A day earlier, Mr. Trump issued a brief reaction on his Truth Social platform: \"What's with Russia violating Poland's airspace with drones? Here we go!\"",
      "The White House did not offer any clarification of Mr. Trump's remarks and Poland's most senior officials dismissed his suggestion\u00a0that it had been a mistake on Friday.",
      "On Saturday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters that NATO responded to the drones \"appropriately\" and that the U.S. believes it was an \"unacceptable and unfortunate and dangerous development.\"",
      "\"There's no doubt about the drones were intentionally launched,\" he said. \"The question is whether the drones were targeted to go into Poland specifically. If that's the case, that if the evidence leads us there, then, obviously, that'll be a highly explanatory move.\"",
      "Polish and allied aircraft were deployed in a \"preventive\" operation in Poland's airspace on Saturday because of a threat of drone strikes in neighboring areas of Ukraine, and the airport in the eastern Polish city of Lublin was closed, authorities said. The alert lasted around two hours.",
      "The Polish military's operational command posted on X on Saturday afternoon that ground-based air defense and reconnaissance systems were on high alert. It stressed that \"these actions are preventive in nature,\" and were aimed at securing Poland's airspace and protecting the country's citizens. It cited a threat of drone strikes in regions of Ukraine bordering Poland, but didn't give further details.",
      "Separately, Romania said it deployed two F-16 jets to intercept a drone that briefly entered its airspace on Saturday afternoon.",
      "\"The drone did not fly over inhabited areas and did not represent an imminent danger to the security of the population,\" the NATO member's defense ministry said in a statement.",
      "The ministry said that teams of specialists would conduct searches for potential debris. Romanian authorities didn't specify where they thought the drone originated from.",
      "During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump promised to end the war quickly. Some lawmakers in Congress are trying to persuade Mr. Trump to support a bill that toughens sanctions, after the president hosted Putin in Alaska for talks that failed to deliver on progress toward peace.",
      "The president in his post said a NATO ban on Russian oil plus tariffs on China would \"also be of great help in ENDING this deadly, but RIDICULOUS, WAR.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said NATO members should impose 50% to 100% tariffs on China and withdraw them if the war that was launched with Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine ends.",
      "\"China has a strong control, and even grip, over Russia,\" he posted, and powerful tariffs \"will break that grip.\"",
      "The U.S. president has already placed an additional 25% import tax on goods from India, which he has said is to punish it for buying Russian energy products.",
      "In his post, Mr. Trump said responsibility for the war fell on his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. As in past statements on the issue, he did not include in that list Russian President Vladimir Putin, who launched the invasion.",
      "Mr. Trump's post builds on a call Friday with finance ministers from the Group of Seven, a forum of industrialized democracies. During the call, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called on their counterparts to have a \"unified front\" to cut off \"the revenues funding Putin's war machine,\" according to Greer's office.",

    "published": "Sat, 13 Sep 2025 19:59:41 -0400",
    "summary": "Earlier this month, the U.S. deported a group of non-Ghanaian nationals to Ghana, including deportees from Gambia and Nigeria.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Saturday accused the Trump administration of trying to do an \"end-run\" around legal obligations that the U.S. has to protect people fleeing persecution and torture following the deportation of a group of African migrants to Ghana, some of whom are now slated to be returned to their home countries.",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan ordered the U.S. government to explain, by 9 p.m. EST on Saturday, what steps it was taking to prevent the deportees \"from being removed to their countries of origin or other countries where they fear persecution or torture.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the U.S. deported more than a dozen non-Ghanaian nationals to Ghana, including deportees from Gambia and Nigeria, making Ghana the latest country to accept these so-called third country deportations at the request of the Trump administration. Ghana's government confirmed the deportations.",
      "Attorneys have alleged in a lawsuit that the deportees have been held in \"squalid conditions and surrounded by armed military guards in an open-air detention facility\" in Ghana.",
      "Lee Gelernt, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, told Chutkan during a hearing Saturday that four of the deportees have been told that Ghana will return them to their native nations as early as Monday, despite the fact that they have orders from U.S. immigration judges that bar their deportation to their home countries due to concerns they could be persecuted or tortured there. One man from Gambia, who attorneys say is bisexual, has already been returned to Gambia, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The deportees' legal protections \u2014 which are rooted in the United Nations Convention Against Torture and a provision of U.S. immigration law known as withholding of removal \u2014 prohibit the U.S. from sending foreigners to countries where they would face persecution or torture. But unlike asylum, they still allow the U.S. to send them to other, third-party countries.",
      "The Justice Department lawyer representing the U.S. government during the hearing did not dispute that Ghana plans to return the deportees to their native countries and conceded that the Ghanaian government appears to be violating diplomatic assurances that it allegedly made vowing not to send these migrants to places where they could be harmed.",
      "But the Justice Department attorney said the U.S. could not tell Ghana what to do at this point.",
      "Chutkan appeared frustrated by that position, suggesting it was \"disingenuous.\" She grilled the Justice Department attorney about whether the U.S. knew this could happen and suggested the deportations seemed to be an \"end-run\" to bypass the legal protections the deportees have. She suggested the U.S. can retrieve the deportees and return them to the U.S. or transfer them to another country where they would be safe. Or, she added, it could tell Ghana it is violating its agreement with the U.S.",
      "\"How's this not a violation of your obligation?\" she asked the Justice Department attorney.",
      "But Chutkan acknowledged her \"hands may be tied\" since the deportees are not on American soil nor in U.S. custody. She also implied that the Supreme Court would almost certainly pause any order that required the American government to act to stop the returns.",
      "Representatives for the Departments of State and Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests to comment on the deportations to Ghana and Chutkan's order.",
      "Gelernt, the ACLU attorney representing the African deportees, hailed Chutkan's mandate.",
      "\"The Court properly recognized that the United States government, with full knowledge that these individuals are going to be sent to danger, cannot simply wash their hands of the matter,\" Gelernt told CBS News.",
      "As part of its mass deportation campaign, the Trump administration has sought to convince countries around the globe to receive deportees who are not their citizens, brokering agreements with nations including El Salvador, Kosovo, Panama and South Sudan.",

      "Israeli settlers attacked his village, injuring two of his brothers and one cousin, Adra told The Associated Press. He accompanied them to the hospital. While there, he said that he heard from family in the village that nine Israeli soldiers had stormed his home.",
      "The soldiers asked his wife, Suha, about his whereabouts and went through her phone, he said, while his 9-month-old daughter was home. They also briefly detained one of his uncles, he said.",
      "As of Saturday night, Adra said he had no way of returning home to check on his family, because soldiers were blocking the entrance to the village and he was scared of being detained.",
      "Israel's military said that soldiers were in the village after Palestinians had thrown rocks, injuring two Israeli civilians. It said its forces were still in the village, searching the area and questioning people.",
      "Adra has spent his career as a journalist and filmmaker chronicling settler violence in Masafer Yatta, a group of villages in the southern reaches of the West Bank, where he was born. After settlers\u00a0attacked his co-director, Hamdan Ballal, in March, he told the AP that he felt they were being targeted more intensely since winning the Oscar. Adra said he witnessed the detention and said around two dozen settlers \u2014 some masked, some carrying guns, some in Israeli uniform \u2014 attacked the village of Susiya.\u00a0Ballal said the settlers beat him\u00a0in front of his home while filming the assault.",
      "Adra described Saturday's events as \"horrific.\"",
      "\"Even if you are just filming the settlers, the army comes and chases you, searches your house,\" he said. \"The whole system is built to attack us, to terrify us, to make us very scared.\"",
      "Another co-director, Yuval Abraham, said he was \"terrified for Basel.\"",
      "\"What happened today in his village, we've seen this dynamic again and again, where the Israeli settlers brutally attack a Palestinian village and later on the army comes, and attacks the Palestinians.\"",
      "\"No Other Land,\"\u00a0which won an Oscar this year for best documentary, depicts the struggle by residents of the Masafer Yatta area to stop the Israeli military from demolishing their villages. Ballal and Adra made the joint Palestinian-Israeli production with Israeli directors Abraham and Rachel Szor.",
      "The film has won a string of international awards, starting at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2024. It has also drawn ire in Israel and abroad. In March this year, Miami Beach proposed ending the lease of a movie theater that screened the documentary, although it later backed down.",
      "Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem. The Palestinians want all three for their future state and view settlement growth as a major obstacle to a two-state solution.",
      "Israel has built well over 100 settlements, home to more than 500,000 settlers who have Israeli citizenship. The 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority administering population centers.",
      "The Israeli military designated Masafer Yatta in the southern West Bank as a live-fire training zone in the 1980s and ordered residents, mostly Arab Bedouin, to be expelled. Around 1,000 residents have largely remained in place, but soldiers regularly move in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive orchards \u2014 and Palestinians fear outright expulsion could come at any time.",
      "During the war in Gaza, Israel has killed hundreds of Palestinians in the West Bank during wide-scale military operations, and there has also been a rise in settler attacks on Palestinians. There has also been a surge in Palestinian attacks on Israelis.",

    "summary": "Trump says he assured Qatar's leader that Israeli strikes against Hamas in Doha wouldn't be repeated. Netanyahu has threatened to do just that.",
    "story": [
      "As the people killed in Israel's surprise strike on a Hamas meeting in the Qatari capital were buried at Doha's Grand Mosque on Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threatened to launch new attacks on the country \u2014 a close U.S. ally \u2014 if it refused to eject the U.S.- and Israeli-designated terrorist group's political representatives.",
      "Qatar's government has condemned Israel's Tuesday strikes, saying the \"criminal attack constitutes a blatant violation of all international laws and norms, and poses a serious threat to the security and safety of the State of Qatar and its people.\"",
      "The U.S. has relied on Qatar to act as a go-between with Hamas, with which it has long had ties. Working through Hamas' political office in Doha, both the Trump administration and the Biden administration before that have pushed hard, along with Egypt, to broker a ceasefire in the nearly two-year\u00a0war between Israel and Hamas, sparked by the Palestinian group's Oct. 7, 2023 attack. Senior Israeli officials have also traveled to Qatar many times to take part in these negotiations since the war began.",
      "Qatar also hosts the largest U.S. military base in the Middle East, the Al-Udeid Air Base, where thousands of American military personnel are stationed.",
      "President Trump, in a post on his Truth Social network on Tuesday, said the White House had been \"notified by the United States Military that Israel was attacking Hamas which, very unfortunately, was located in a section of Doha.\"",
      "American officials told CBS News that the U.S. was notified of the attack by Israel as it was about to happen, and that the U.S. did not coordinate with Israel on planning the strikes.",
      "\"This was a decision made by Prime Minister Netanyahu, it was not a decision made by me,\" Mr. Trump said in his social media post. \"Unilaterally bombing inside Qatar, a Sovereign Nation and close Ally of the United States, that is working very hard and bravely taking risks with us to broker Peace, does not advance Israel or America's goals.\"",
      "He called \"eliminating\" Hamas \"a worthy goal,\" but added that he had spoken with both Netanyahu and leaders in Qatar, and had assured the prime minister in Doha, \"that such a thing will not happen again on their soil.\"",
      "For his part, Netanyahu has continued to defend the attack and suggested Israeli could launch another one.",
      "\"I say to Qatar and all nations who harbor terrorists, you either expel them or you bring them to justice,\" Netanyahu said Wednesday. \"Because if you don't, we will.\"",
      "Netanyahu drew a parallel between Israel's attack in Doha and the U.S. invasion of Taliban-ruled Afghanistan following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States.",
      "\"We went after the terrorist masterminds who committed the October 7th massacre. And we did so in Qatar, which gives safe haven, it harbors terrorists, it finances Hamas,\" Netanyahu said.",
      "President Trump said in his social media post that, in their phone calls, Netanyahu \"told me that he wants to make Peace,\" but some regional officials have said the attack in Doha doomed any chances for a brokered end to the war in Gaza.",
      "Qatar's prime minister said Netanyahu had \"killed any hope\" of returning the remaining 48 Israeli hostages held by Hamas, 20 of whom are believed to be alive in Gaza.",
      "Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said, before appearing Thursday at the United Nations, that Israel's attack had inflamed anti-Israeli sentiments among many Arab nations in the Middle East, telling CNN: \"I think that what Netanyahu has done yesterday (Tuesday), he just killed any hope for those hostages.\"",
      "Al Thani spoke as thousands of Palestinians continued to flee Gaza City ahead of Israel's ongoing offensive there. The numbers leaving the city have grown in recent days, though many have not heeded Israel's orders to leave because they say they no longer have the strength or money to relocate.",
      "The Israeli military's plans for the next phases of its operation in what it calls Hamas' last remaining stronghold are aimed at taking over the largest Palestinian city, which is already devastated from earlier raids and is now experiencing famine, according to the world's leading expert body on food crises.",
      "The plans have drawn widespread condemnation and added to Israel's global isolation, which intensified further this week following the strike on Qatar.",
      "Al Thani was expected to attend a U.N. Security Council meeting later Thursday, part of a diplomatic push by Qatar after the strike. The Foreign Ministry in Doha also said Thursday that it was convening an emergency Arab-Islamic leaders summit next week in Qatar to discuss the attack.",
      "Hamas said Tuesday that its top leaders survived the strike but that five lower-level members were killed, including the son of Khalil al-Hayya \u2014 Hamas' leader for Gaza and its top negotiator \u2014 as well as three bodyguards and the head of al-Hayya's office.",
      "Hamas, which has sometimes only confirmed the assassination of its leaders months later, offered no immediate proof that al-Hayya and other senior figures had survived. Israel has not confirmed the identities of any members of the group killed by its strikes.",
      "Qatar has hosted Hamas' political leadership for years in Doha, in part over a request by the U.S. to encourage negotiations between the militant group and Israel.\u00a0Israel had also approved\u00a0this arrangement and before October 7, 2023, it had also given\u00a0its blessing\u00a0for Qatar to channel millions of dollars of cash support to Hamas each month.",

      "\"We would also wish that the drone attack on Poland was a mistake. But it wasn't. And we know it,\" Prime Minister Donald Tusk said in a message posted on social media.",
      "Polish authorities said they had recovered parts of 17 Russian-made drones, which fell without causing any injuries or major damage in the east of the country on Wednesday.",
      "Polish and allied NATO fighter jets from Holland were scrambled to intercept the drones \u2014   a first such response to aerial Russian military incursions into NATO airspace since Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than three years ago.",
      "Poland's relatively new, conservative President Karol Nawrocki, in a social media post on Thursday, called the Russian drone incursion \"nothing more than an attempt to test our capabilities and response. It was an attempt to test the mechanisms of action within NATO and our ability to respond.\"",
      "Other European capitals and the European Union also labelled the raid a Russian test of the NATO alliance's resolve in the face of Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine, but Mr. Trump suggested otherwise.",
      "\"It could have been a mistake,\" he told journalists late Thursday when asked about the incident. A day earlier, Mr. Trump issued a brief reaction to the incident, saying on his Truth Social platform: \"What's with Russia violating Poland's airspace with drones? Here we go!\"",
      "The White House did not offer any clarification of Mr. Trump's remarks.",
      "Previously, U.S. Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker\u00a0said\u00a0in a social media post that the U.S. stood \"by our NATO Allies in the face of these airspace violations and will defend every inch of NATO territory.\"",
      "Poland's Deputy Minister of Defense Cezary Tomczyk also rejected Mr. Trump's suggestion on Thursday that the drone incursion could have been inadvertent.",
      "\"I think this is a message that should reach President Trump today: there's no question of a mistake - this was a deliberate Russian attack,\" he told the Polsat News television network.",
      "\"On the night that 19 Russian drones crossed into Poland, 400 (drones) plus 40 missiles crossed into Ukraine,\" added Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski in a video message shared on social media, ahead of a visit to Ukraine's capital. \"These were not mistakes.\"",

    "story": [
      "Australia will spend $1.1 billion on building dozens of locally developed underwater attack drones, Defense Minister Richard Marles said on Wednesday.",
      "The first of the stealthy, long-range \"Ghost Sharks\" will be delivered to the Australian navy in January next year under a five-year contract with Sydney-based Anduril Australia, Marles said.",
      "\"Australia is leading the world in terms of autonomous, underwater military capabilities,\" Marles told reporters in Sydney.",
      "The large, autonomous underwater vehicles would significantly boost Australia's undersea warfare capabilities, complementing a fleet of submarines powered with U.S. nuclear technology, Marles said.",
      "The first of those submarines provided under the AUKUS partnership with the United States and Britain won't be delivered to Australia until 2032.",
      "Marles would not say precisely how many Ghost Sharks would be built. But he said the Australian navy would be provided with \"dozens\" over the next five years.",
      "He also wouldn't comment on the Ghost Sharks' range other than to describe it as \"very long range.\"",
      "As an island continent and a trading nation, Australia sees the possibility of its sea routes being blocked by an enemy as a major strategic threat.",
      "A Chinese navy flotilla conducted a live-fire exercise in the sea between Australia and New Zealand in February in what was widely regarded as a demonstration of China's growing military reach.",
      "The flotilla almost completely circumnavigated Australia. The Chinese navy rarely travels so far south.",
      "California-based Anduril Industries was contracted in 2022 to produce three Ghost Shark prototypes for the Australian navy.",
      "The Ghost Shark is designed to perform intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance roles as well as strike operations, a government statement said.",
      "Chief of Navy Vice Adm. Mark Hammond said the drones could be launched from the shore and from surface ships.",
      "Hammond said he expected the \"undersea battlespace\" will become increasingly congested and contested.",
      "\"I believe our allies and partners will continue to enjoy a capability advantage in that space provided we invest in capabilities like Ghost Shark and others as well as our crewed systems for years to come,\" Hammond said.",

Whether you're not a Christian or you're conservative or Democrat or whatever you are, that's not what this is about.\"",

There were times that you could see people, I don't know, getting political or getting dirty \u2026 and they would move, and they could pass you career-wise at that moment. And so it was just trusting that I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing. It was hard to do sometimes, but just to stick to it. And now I'm seeing how it's paid off, and so it's been great.\"",

      "They may have gained popularity for diabetes and weight loss, but GLP-1 medications like Ozempic and Wegovy have been linked to ever-expanding health benefits.",

      "How GLP-1s work",
      "GLP-1 receptor agonists work by mimicking a hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1, which is released from the gut after eating.",

      "\"Sugar's the enemy, and these drugs affect sugar in your blood,\" Dubrow told Fox News Digital. \"They affect the way insulin reacts.\"",
      "GLP-1s help insulin move the glucose (sugar) out of the bloodstream and into the body\u2019s cells, where it can be used for energy or stored, the doctor said. The drugs also help to prevent the inflammation and damage sugar can cause in the blood vessels, nerves and organs.",
      "'NEXT OZEMPIC' AIMS TO DELIVER 30% WEIGHT LOSS WITH FEWER SIDE EFFECTS",
      "\"I don't think anyone would argue that if there was a way to manipulate the amount of sugar and inflammation your body's exposed to, that is something we want to lean into. And that's exactly what these drugs do,\" Dubrow added.",

      "\"I have never seen a drug in the history of medicine be on such a rapid path to approval,\" Dubrow said.",
      "The case for microdosing",
      "Along with other experts, Dubrow is an advocate for microdosing, which is where people take low, steady doses of GLP-1s every day, even if they don\u2019t need them for diabetes or obesity.",
      "While patients with diabetes take doses that increase every four weeks, microdosing entails using a low-level dose that doesn\u2019t go up.",

      "A younger population on TikTok has zeroed in on microdosing, Dubrow pointed out \u2014 and he thinks everyone should be doing it.",
      "\"I am obsessed with the concept of microdosing,\" he said. \"I think maybe half the starting dose for diabetes is the way to go \u2014 and you probably don't need it every seven days, it's probably every 10 days, just to sort of modulate the amount of sugar in the blood.\"",
      "\"Even if you\u2019re not overweight, being on these GLP-1 drugs \u2026 helps to minimize and prevent a repeat recurrent heart attack,\" Dubrow said. (iStock)",

      "\"We are just figuring out now how to use these drugs for different indications, for different reasons,\" he said. \"We're learning as we're using it.\"",
      "\"I am obsessed with the concept of microdosing.\"",
      "As with other drugs, like Botox, Dubrow said there is a bit of \"human experimentation\" at play.",
      "\"We're figuring it out, and we're teaching the medical profession how to do it. The patients are telling us how to use these drugs.\"",
      "Potential risks",
      "GLP-1 medications have been linked to several potential risks. The most prevalent is gastrointestinal issues, such as nausea and vomiting.",
      "Others have reported an increased risk of pancreatitis, muscle loss and thyroid tumors.",
      "\"I read every study that comes out on these drugs, and I can tell you, it's very clear they don\u2019t cause pancreatitas,\" Dubrow said.",
      "OZEMPIC PUSH FOR SENIORS? SOME DOCTORS SAY MORE PEOPLE AGE 65 AND OVER SHOULD BE ON IT",
      "\"In fact, if you really look at the populations who have been using it, pancreatitis is less in those populations.\"",

      "Those who experience severe side effects from GLP-1s should talk to a doctor, Dubrow advised.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "\"If you have a family history of that, that's a contraindication to you using these drugs,\" he said.",

      "\"These particular drugs are natural hormones that occur in our small intestine, and you get used to the side effects. They go away.\"",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "The severity of side effects is linked to the dose amount, Dubrow noted.",
      "\"The low dose, particularly the microdose, really has a low propensity toward the constipation, the nausea, the potential diarrhea, the GERD (reflux),\" he said. \"I think those side effects are less significant for people who microdose.\"",
      "To counteract the risk of muscle loss, Dubrow recommends increasing protein intake and incorporating resistance training as a core component of an exercise routine.",
      "Those who do experience severe side effects should talk to a doctor, he advised.",

      "Drugmakers weigh in",
      "When contacted by Fox News Digital, manufacturers of GLP-1 medications warned against microdosing the products.",
      "\"Lilly does not have any data on the benefits or risks of microdosing of Zepbound and Mounjaro,\" said a spokesperson for Eli Lilly, maker of the GLP-1 drugs Mounjaro and Zepbounda. \"Both autoinjectors and Zepbound vials are approved for single-use only \u2014 dose-splitting or \u2018microdosing\u2019 is not contemplated by the FDA label.

Patients should work with their healthcare professional to select either 1.7 mg or 2.4 mg for the maintenance dose.\"",
      "CHEAP OZEMPIC KNOCK-OFFS HAVE RISEN IN POPULARITY",
      "\"It is also important to note that the authentic Wegovy\u00a0injectable pen is designed as a single-use pen, the dose is already set, and should not be altered or tampered with, and the pen must be disposed after one use.\"",
      "\"Ozempic\u00a0is a multi-use pen with one pen and multiple needles,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Accessing GLP-1s",
      "Dubrow said he\u2019s not concerned about supply issues amid the growing popularity of GLP-1s, as major drug companies have the resources to \"scale up\" to meet the demand.",

      "The doctor cautioned against buying these drugs from online marketplaces, which he referred to as the \"wild wild west.\"",
      "\"It's hard to find these drugs online from compounding pharmacies, because essentially they're going rogue \u2014 it's illegal. They're not allow to do it,\" he warned.",
      "\"These drugs are natural hormones that occur in our small intestine, and you get used to the side effects.\"",

      "Looking ahead",
      "There are several next-generation drugs in development that combine multiple hormone pathways, Dubrow said.",

      "The governor's endorsement is significant, as it may help Mamdani secure the backing of other key members of the party's establishment. And it will likely put more pressure on two other top Democrats in New York State who are still withholding their backing of Mamdani - Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, the top two Democratic Party leaders in Congress.",
      "Mamdani, in a statement, said he was \"grateful to the Governor for her support in unifying our party \u2014 as well as the work she\u2019s done standing up to President Trump, securing free lunch meals for our kids, and expanding access to childcare.\"",

      "Mamdani surged to the Democratic primary victory thanks to an energetic campaign that put a major focus on affordability and New York City's high cost of living. It was fueled by a grassroots army of supporters and backing from top national progressive champions, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.",
      "Mamdani made smart use of social media platforms, including TikTok, as he engaged low-propensity voters. He proposed eliminating fares to ride New York City's vast bus system, making CUNY (City University of New York) \"tuition-free,\" freezing rents on municipal housing, offering \"free childcare\" for children up to age 5 and setting up government-run grocery stores.",
      "Mamdani has been heavily criticized by his rivals for his past critical comments of the New York City Police Department (NYPD), and his proposal to shift certain responsibilities away from the NYPD and focus on social services and community-based program.",
      "Hochul recently said an apology from Mamdani was in order, and the mayoral hopeful told the New York Times a couple of days ago that he intended to apologize.",
      "Hochul said that in her conversations with Mamdani she made \"it very clear that our police officers should have every resource to keep our streets and subways safe. I urged him to ensure that there is strong leadership at the helm of the N.Y.P.D. \u2014 and he agreed.\"",

      "The FBI's success in apprehending Charlie Kirk's alleged assassin came one day after Director Kash Patel initially misreported that the suspect was in custody, a move that sparked consternation and criticism as the nation reeled over Kirk's violent death.",
      "Patel's misstep during the fast-moving investigation was overshadowed Friday by the breakthrough news that a 22-year-old Utah man had been detained and will face charges for the deadly shooting. But the flaws during the whirlwind 33-hour manhunt did not go unnoticed.",
      "Patel on Wednesday announced \u2014 then quickly retracted \u2014 that authorities had detained the person responsible for killing Kirk.",
      "Fox News' Laura Ingraham responded \"unreal\" to Patel's revelation that the gunman was still at large. Conservative activist Chris Rufo said Friday he was \"grateful\" authorities arrested a suspect but that it was \"time for Republicans to reassess\" whether Patel was fit for the job.",

      "\"He performed terribly in the last few days,\" Rufo wrote on social media Friday, adding that he has been talking with conservative leaders who are questioning the FBI's leadership structure, which includes Patel, Deputy Director Dan Bongino, and, as of next week, Andrew Bailey, who is taking on the unprecedented role of FBI co-deputy director.",
      "A White House spokesman said in a statement that \"Patel and his team worked night and day to find this murderer and bring him to justice.\"",
      "\"Anyone who doubts his resolve and dedication - especially when Charlie was such a close friend to him - simply is using this extremely sad moment in a disgusting act of political gamesmanship,\" Communication Director Steven Cheung said, adding the suspect will \"face the full wrath of the justice system.\"",
      "The backlash began after Patel said Wednesday that \"the subject for the horrific shooting today that took the life of Charlie Kirk is now in custody,\" before saying less than two hours later that he had the wrong person. It was the second time that day authorities had arrested someone in the case then let them go.",
      "\"The subject in custody has been released after an interrogation by law enforcement,\" Patel then said, adding the investigation was ongoing.",

      "The blips during the manhunt for the person responsible for Kirk's killing also put a spotlight on Patel's and Bongino's apparent fixation on social media, a point that a lawsuit against Patel and the Department of Justice laid out in thorough detail days prior.",
      "The lawsuit was brought by three top FBI officials who alleged their constitutional rights were violated when they were fired without explanation. One of the fired officials said Patel and Bongino lamented the \"political capital\" they had to spend to keep the official on the job, a reference to pressure Patel and Bongino were getting on social media about the official. Patel's and Bongino's actions were often dictated by social media comments, the lawsuit said.",
      "Also fueling the fire was a delayed news conference on Thursday that offered little new detail as the investigation was underway. Patel appeared at the news conference but did not speak. Upon announcing the suspect's arrest Friday morning, the FBI director gave remarks of gratitude to the agency, local law enforcement, the media and public for contributing to the arrest. Patel made clear that he had been directing the FBI behind the scenes during the past couple days.",
      "\"Warroom\" podcast host Steve Bannon, a former Trump advisor, said on his show that he didn't \"know why Kash Patel flew out there, thousands of miles\" merely to thank people. Bannon suggested he wanted more details about the suspect and any possible accomplices.",

The source said the focus should be on the success of the FBI\u2019s operation and the \"good police work\" involved.",

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out whats clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "What if your old bottle of cooking oil could help save the planet and your smartphone? That's the big idea behind a groundbreaking discovery by researchers in Finland.",
      "Scientists from the University of Helsinki and the University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 have found that you can recover silver from electronic waste using common kitchen ingredients like vegetable oil and hydrogen peroxide. This sustainable, scalable method published in the Chemical Engineering Journal could change how we mine precious metals from our growing piles of electronic junk.",

      "OLD SMARTPHONES ARE BEING TURNED INTO TINY DATA CENTERS",
      "Scientists have discovered a new method of silver extraction from electronics by using cooking oil. (Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "How cooking oil recovers silver from electronic waste",
      "Here's how it works. Fatty acids found in oils like sunflower or olive oil are mixed with hydrogen peroxide. When heated slightly, this combo safely dissolves silver from old circuit boards, wires or keyboard connectors. Then, using ethyl acetate, a far less toxic alternative to industrial solvents, researchers pull out the silver in a solid form. Unlike traditional methods that rely on harsh acids or cyanide-based solutions, this technique avoids toxic runoff and air pollution. Think of it as salad dressing meets science lab, without the environmental mess.",
      "Why recycling silver from e-waste is urgently needed",
      "Silver powers the devices you use every day, such as phones, solar panels, electric vehicles and even medical tech. But less than 20% of it gets recycled. As demand rises and natural resources shrink, finding clean ways to reclaim silver isn't just smart, it's necessary. Silver prices have surged sixfold in the last 25 years. At the same time, supply has lagged. That makes e-waste a goldmine, literally, for anyone who can unlock its hidden metals without poisoning the environment.",

      "Fatty acids found in cooking oil can stabilize silver ions for easier extraction. (Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images)",
      "How scientists extract silver using fatty acids and light",
      "To figure out exactly how this all works, researchers used advanced computer models to study how fatty acids interact with silver ions. The process not only stabilizes the silver but also allows for easy recovery using light and simple solvents. Better still, the ingredients can be reused, and there's no chemical waste or massive cost. And it's highly selective. The method targets silver while leaving other metals behind, a major step forward in urban mining. In testing, even silver-coated keyboard connectors were cleanly processed into pure elemental silver powder using this system.",
      "Indian laborers sift through a heap of pre-owned mobile phones in an electronic waste workshop Dec. 5, 2023, in New Delhi, India.\u00a0 (Yawar Nazir/Getty Images)",
      "What this means for you",
      "This research brings us closer to safe, at-home or small-scale recycling kits that could recover silver from old gadgets. Recyclers and manufacturers could adopt this method to reduce chemical waste and operating costs, while protecting workers and the environment. This method supports a future where nothing goes to waste. It keeps valuable materials in use, cutting down the need for mining and pollution. Silver is vital for making many of the tech items we use every day. Reusing it responsibly means cleaner energy at a lower cost and less reliance on mined resources.",

      "We've long known that waste is a problem. Now, it might also be the solution. By turning everyday ingredients into powerful recycling tools, scientists are showing us what's possible when chemistry and sustainability meet.

      "Why AI cybercrime is more dangerous than ever",
      "Cyber extortion is not new. But this case shows how AI transforms it. Instead of acting as an assistant, Claude became an active operator scanning networks, crafting malware and even analyzing stolen data. AI lowers the barrier to entry. In the past, such operations required years of training. Now, a single hacker with limited skills can launch attacks that once took a full criminal team.

      "How to protect yourself from AI cyberattacks",
      "Here's how to defend against hackers now using AI tools to their advantage:",
      "Hackers who break into one account often attempt to use the same password across your other logins. This tactic becomes even more dangerous when AI is involved because a chatbot can quickly test stolen credentials across hundreds of sites. The best defense is to create long, unique passwords for every account you have. Treat your passwords like digital keys and never reuse the same one in more than one lock.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords",
      "The hacker who abused Claude didn't just steal files; they organized and analyzed them to find the most damaging details. That illustrates the value of your personal information in the wrong hands. The less data criminals can find about you online, the safer you are. Review your digital footprint, lock down privacy settings, and reduce what's available on public databases and broker sites.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Illustration of a hacker at work. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Even if a hacker obtains your password,\u00a02FA\u00a0can stop them in their tracks. AI tools now help criminals generate highly realistic phishing attempts designed to trick you into handing over logins. By enabling\u00a02FA, you add an extra layer of protection that they cannot easily bypass. Choose app-based codes or a physical key whenever possible, as these are more secure than text messages, which are easier for attackers to intercept.",
      "AI-driven attacks often exploit the most basic weaknesses, such as outdated software. Once a hacker knows which companies or individuals are running old systems, they can use automated scripts to break in within minutes. Regular updates close those gaps before they can be targeted. Setting your devices and apps to update automatically removes one of the easiest entry points that criminals rely on.",
      "One of the most alarming details in the Anthropic report was how the hacker used AI to craft convincing extortion notes. The same tactics are being applied to phishing emails and texts sent to everyday users. If you receive a message demanding immediate action, such as clicking a link, transferring money or downloading a file, treat it with suspicion. Stop, check the source and verify before you act.",
      "The hacker in this case built custom malware with the help of AI. That means malicious software is getting smarter, faster and harder to detect. Strong antivirus software that constantly scans for suspicious activity provides a critical safety net. It can identify phishing emails and detect ransomware before it spreads, which is vital now that AI tools make these attacks more adaptive and persistent.",

      "A dangerous new malware campaign is targeting Mac users worldwide. Security researchers at CrowdStrike uncovered Shamos, a new variant of the Atomic macOS Stealer (AMOS), developed by a cybercriminal group called COOKIE SPIDER.",
      "The attack relies on ClickFix tactics, where victims searching for Mac troubleshooting help are lured to fake websites or GitHub repositories. These spoofed sites trick users into copying and pasting a one-line command in Terminal, supposedly to fix an error. Instead, the command silently downloads Shamos, bypasses macOS Gatekeeper protections, and installs the malware.",
      "Once inside, Shamos searches for sensitive data, Apple Notes, Keychain items, browser passwords, and even cryptocurrency wallets. The stolen information is zipped and sent directly to attackers, often alongside additional malware like botnet modules or fake Ledger wallet apps.",

These pages pose as trusted troubleshooting guides and appear in search results for common Mac issues, such as \"how to flush resolver cache.\"",
      "The websites encourage victims to copy and paste commands that download malicious Bash scripts. These scripts grab the user's password, remove file protections, and launch Shamos.

      "Copy-pasting commands into Terminal may seem like an easy fix, but it's also one of the easiest ways for attackers to bypass Apple's built-in protections. If you see a command on a website, forum, or GitHub repository, don't execute it unless you fully understand what it does. Instead, confirm with Apple's official support site or the Apple Community forums, where experienced users and moderators can verify safe troubleshooting steps.",
      "Hackers know that when your Mac has a problem, you'll search for a quick solution. That's why they buy sponsored ads like the one below to push fake troubleshooting websites higher in search results. Clicking the top link may feel natural, but it could be a trap.

Attackers often clone popular apps or tools, then hide malware inside. Before downloading anything, check the publisher's name, stars, and activity history. If the account looks suspicious, inactive, or brand-new, avoid it.",
      "Mac malware is evolving fast, and Apple's built-in security features can't catch everything.

      "Since Shamos is designed to steal personal information and send it to cybercriminals, reducing your online footprint can help limit the fallout. A personal data removal service scans data broker sites and removes your exposed information, making it harder for attackers to resell or exploit it after a breach.

Pairing this with good digital hygiene, like avoiding shady downloads, dramatically lowers your risk of infection.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",

The company's CEO, Tim Cook, led the presentation with sweeping visuals, confident pacing and a clear message: Apple is still betting big on premium innovation. But the real headline wasn't so much the tech; it was the prices.",
      "Earlier this year, President Donald Trump granted Apple a tariff break. Still, the company raised prices across its iPhone lineup. The new ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air, which Apple positioned as a reinvention of last year's iPhone 16 Plus, jumps to $999. The iPhone 17 Pro begins at $1,099, while the Pro Max tops out at $1,199. The entry-level iPhone 17 starts at $799.",
      "Apple positioned the price hikes as a reflection of breakthrough innovation. The company spotlighted the iPhone Air's sleek redesign, the powerful A19 chip and major camera upgrades. Yet the takeaway was clear: tariff relief didn't lead to consumer savings. Instead, Apple leaned into its premium identity, signaling that cutting-edge tech now comes with a steeper price tag.",

      "Apple unveiled the iPhone 17 Air, its slimmest model yet at 5.6mm and 165 grams, built with recycled aluminum, glass and titanium. (Apple)",
      "Apple calls the iPhone 17 Air a game-changer. At just 5.6mm thin and weighing around 165 grams, it stands as the slimmest iPhone the company has ever made. The design uses recycled aluminum, glass and titanium to reduce weight while staying durable. Engineers reinforced the frame and applied new drop-test algorithms to make sure it holds up in daily use.",
      "The Air debuts silicon anode battery technology, which allows Apple to shrink the device without cutting power. During the presentation, Apple promised \"all-day battery life,\" but never gave an exact hour count. That vague description raised questions. Moments later, Apple introduced a new low-profile MagSafe battery accessory. When paired with the iPhone 17 Air, Apple says the combo delivers up to 40 hours of video playback. The timing of that announcement made it clear that battery life could still be a concern.",
      "Apple also pushed the Air forward with a new ultra-wide 48MP fusion camera system, which uses advanced image processing to improve detail and low-light performance. The display gained a ProMotion 120Hz refresh rate that makes scrolling and animations feel smoother. Outdoor use should also improve, thanks to 3,000 nits of peak brightness, making it easier to see in direct sunlight. On the durability side, the Air features Ceramic Shield 2 coating, which Apple claims resists scratches and accidental drops better than before.",

      "The iPhone 17 Pro introduces a striking unibody design that relies on laser-welded vapor chamber cooling to keep performance steady even under heavy use. Apple gave the back a ceramic shield finish, while the front now features its upgraded seven-layer coating. That change reduces glare both indoors and outdoors, making the display easier on the eyes in all conditions.",
      "At the core of the Pro sits the new A19 Bionic chip built on 3nm architecture. Apple paired it with a 16-core Neural Engine and an updated display engine to push speed and efficiency even further. The company claims this is the most power-efficient iPhone yet and promises the longest battery life ever offered in a Pro model.",
      "Apple also turned its attention to the camera system. The Pro camera lineup includes a 48MP main sensor and a 12MP ultra-wide, with ProRes support for high-quality video recording. It even offers Genlock syncing, which professionals can use to line up multiple cameras in studio and live production setups.",

      "What you need to know about the QR code scam",
      "The scheme is a twist on what is known as a brushing scam. Traditionally, brushing scams involved online sellers sending products to strangers and then using the recipient's details to post fake reviews. It was more of a nuisance than a serious crime.",
      "An Amazon package with a QR code. (Lindsey Nicholson/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)",
      "Now the practice has shifted from harmless free items to deliberate fraud. Instead of receiving a product, many victims find only a printed QR code. Once scanned, the code redirects them to fraudulent websites that ask for sensitive personal information, such as banking information, credit card numbers or login credentials. Some codes go a step further and install malicious software designed to track activity and steal data directly from the device.",
      "\"The FBI warns the public about a scam variation in which criminals send unsolicited packages containing a QR code that prompts the recipient to provide personal and financial information or unwittingly download malicious software that steals data from their phone,\"\u00a0the agency said in a public notice.\u00a0\"To encourage the victim to scan the QR code, the criminals often ship the packages without sender information to entice the victim to scan the QR code.\"",
      "WHATSAPP BANS 6.8M SCAM ACCOUNTS, LAUNCHES SAFETY TOOL",
      "Why QR codes appeal to scammers",
      "QR codes have become common in everyday life. They are used in restaurants, stores, airports, on polls and payment systems and most people scan them without a second thought. Unlike suspicious links that can be spotted, a QR code reveals nothing until it is scanned.",
      "That makes it a perfect disguise for a scam. The setup is simple: a package arrives with no sender information and no explanation. The mystery sparks curiosity, and many people scan the code to figure out who sent it. That moment of curiosity is what the scammers rely on.",
      "Taylor Swift fans gather outside a building where a mural featuring a large QR code was being painted to promote Swift's latest album, \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" on April 17, 2024, in Chicago. (Scott Olson/Getty Images)",
      "The consequences can be serious. Fake websites may harvest names, addresses and financial details. Malware may silently monitor accounts, log keystrokes or even target cryptocurrency wallets. Victims often do not notice until they see unauthorized charges or suspicious withdrawals. By then, their information may already be in the hands of criminals.",
      "DON\u2019T FALL FOR THIS BANK PHISHING SCAM TRICK",
      "7 ways to stay safe from QR code scams",
      "Scammers rely on curiosity and convenience to trick people into scanning malicious QR codes. A few simple habits can help you avoid becoming a target. Here are seven ways to stay safe from QR code scams.",
      "Avoid scanning QR codes from mystery deliveries, random flyers or stickers on public signs. A QR code is just a disguised link, and until you know where it leads, it shouldn't be trusted. To stay safe even if you accidentally scan a risky code, keep strong antivirus software on your phone. Mobile security apps can block fraudulent sites, warn you before downloads and protect against malicious QR code attacks.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Only scan QR codes from businesses and organizations you already trust. Examples include your bank's mobile app, an airline boarding pass or a known retailer's checkout page. If you wouldn't click a random link in a text message, don't scan a random QR code either.",
      "Most phones let you press and hold a QR code link to preview where it goes. If the URL looks suspicious, with misspellings, random numbers or shortened links, don't open it. Taking a second to check can save you from a phishing trap.",
      "Scammers are sending fake packages with QR codes that trick recipients into scanning and giving criminals access to their personal data. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The less personal data available about you online, the harder it is for scammers to target you with convincing fraud attempts. Consider using data removal services that scrub your information from people-search sites and marketing databases. This reduces the chances that your address or phone number ends up in the wrong hands and is connected to a scam package.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",
      "Check out my top picks for data removal services and get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web by visiting Cyberguy.com.Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web:\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Even if your login details are stolen, 2FA\u00a0makes it harder for criminals to access your accounts. By requiring a secondary code sent to your phone or generated through an authenticator app, 2FA helps prevent unauthorized logins to your banking, email and trading accounts.",
      "Software updates often contain fixes for security vulnerabilities that scammers try to exploit. Running the latest version of your phone's operating system, as well as updating apps regularly, gives you stronger protection against malware that can be delivered through a malicious QR code.",
      "If an unexpected package arrives at your door with a QR code inside, do not simply throw it away. Report it to local authorities and consider filing a complaint with the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center. Reporting not only helps protect you, but it also gives law enforcement more information to track how these scams are spreading.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "This scam might not be everywhere yet, but it shows just how quickly criminals adapt to new technology. QR codes were meant to make life easier, and most of the time they do, but that same convenience can turn into a weakness when people let curiosity override caution. The lesson here is that a mystery package with a QR code is not some fun puzzle to figure out. It is a red flag. The safest move is to step back, resist the urge to scan and if something feels off, report it instead of interacting with it.",

      "GOOGLE AI EMAIL SUMMARIES CAN BE HACKED TO HIDE PHISHING ATTACKS",
      "When private conversations end up in recaps",
      "Many people are discovering that AI notetakers capture more than project updates and strategy points. Jokes, personal stories and even casual side comments often slip into the official meeting summaries.",
      "What might feel harmless in the moment, like teasing someone, chatting about lunch plans or venting about a frustrating errand, can suddenly reappear in a recap email sent to the whole group. In some cases, even affectionate nicknames or pet mishaps have shown up right alongside serious action items.",

      "Casual catch-ups mixed into meeting notes",
      "Embarrassing slip-ups becoming part of official records",
      "These surprises can be funny in hindsight, but they highlight a bigger issue. AI notetakers don't separate casual conversation from work-related discussion. And once your words are written down, they can be saved, forwarded or even archived in ways you didn't intend. That means an offhand remark could live far longer than the meeting itself.",

      "A Google Gemini generative artificial intelligence webpage. (Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Why AI notetakers capture too much",
      "These tools work by recording conversations in real time and then generating automatic summaries. Zoom's AI Companion flags its presence with a diamond icon. Google Meet's version uses a pencil icon and an audio cue. Only meeting hosts can switch them on or off.",
      "That sounds transparent, but most people stop noticing the icons after a few minutes. Once the AI is running, it doesn't separate \"work talk\" from \"side chatter.\" The result? Your casual remarks can end up in a summary sent to colleagues or even clients.",
      "And mistakes happen. An AI notetaker might mishear a joke, twist sarcasm into something serious or drop a casual remark into notes where it looks out of place. Stripped of tone and context, those words can come across very differently once they're written down.",

    "summary": "FBI Director Kash Patel\u2019s activities during the investigation of Charlie Kirk\u2019s killing raise questions about his decision-making, current and former officials said.",
    "story": [
      "FBI Director Kash Patel\u2019s activities during the investigation of conservative activist Charlie Kirk\u2019s assassination raise questions about his decision-making during a crisis, four former FBI officials and two administration officials told NBC News.",
      "From the shooting Wednesday to a suspect\u2019s arrest Friday, Patel took steps that gave pause to some federal and local officials and raised questions about his judgment, the sources said. Several spoke on the condition of anonymity, some because they were not authorized to speak publicly and others citing fear of retaliation from the Trump administration.",
      "Those actions ranged from where Patel was on the evening of the assassination to what a former official described as \u201cgrandstanding\u201d by Patel about his own role after the arrest.",
      "\u201cHe has heard concerns about how this looks,\u201d an administration official said in a statement. \u201cThere are a lot of shaking heads.\u201d",
      "Christopher O\u2019Leary, a senior former FBI counterterrorism official, said Patel\u2019s handling of the investigation showed that \u201che\u2019s got zero leadership experience and capabilities.\"",
      "A current law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the \u201chorrific event\u201d of Kirk\u2019s killing showcased Patel\u2019s \u201cpublic inability to meet the moment as a leader.\u201d",
      "A White House official defended Patel\u2019s performance, saying in a statement that the FBI director \"is working night and day\" on the case.",
      "\"Anyone who doubts his resolve and dedication \u2014 especially when Charlie was such a close friend to him \u2014 simply is using this extremely sad moment in a disgusting act of political gamesmanship,\" the official said. \"The focus is justice, and this killer will face the full wrath of the justice system.\u201d",
      "A senior White House official said in a separate statement Sunday that President Donald Trump has confidence in Patel and his handling of the investigation. \u201cThe president spoke on it this morning and said he thinks everyone has done an amazing job,\" the official said.",
      "Dinner at Rao's",
      "Hours after the shooting at Utah Valley University, Patel dined at the exclusive New York restaurant Rao\u2019s, two sources familiar with his whereabouts said. A reservation at Rao\u2019s, on the Upper East Side, is famously difficult to obtain.",
      "Patel posted on X at 6:21 p.m. that \u201cthe subject\u201d in Kirk\u2019s killing was \u201cin custody.\u201d Roughly 90 minutes later, at 7:59 p.m., he posted a follow-up message saying the \u201csubject in custody has been released after an interrogation by law enforcement.\u201d",
      "It is not clear if Patel was at Rao's, which opens at 7 p.m., when he published the second post. The restaurant did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Four former senior FBI officials told NBC News that the posts were premature and unnecessary. O\u2019Leary said they undermined public confidence in the bureau.",
      "\u201cThey gave the public the perception that the FBI is not that organized at a time when the public is concerned because there\u2019s an unfolding crisis,\u201d said O\u2019Leary, an MSNBC national security contributor. \u201cThey need to be reassured that the FBI and its partners have the situation under control, and that is done through accurate strategic messaging.\u201d",
      "Asked whether Patel had dined at Rao\u2019s and for a response to the criticism, a spokesperson for the bureau said in a statement: \u201cThe FBI worked with our law enforcement partners in Utah to bring to justice the individual allegedly responsible for the horrific murder of Charlie Kirk, and we will continue to be transparent with the American people with real-time updates as we are able.\u201d",
      "Two former senior FBI officials said it was premature for Patel to post on X that \u201cthe subject\u201d was in custody.",
      "\u201cHe should not have posted anything about the case until there was certainty,\u201d the first former senior FBI official said. \u201cPeople need to trust what the director says. He needs to be measured and always right. It wasn\u2019t a good look.\u201d",
      "A second former senior FBI official said \u201cinvestigations aren\u2019t a publicity contest\u201d or about \u201cwho can tweet out information first.\u201d",
      "A heated call",
      "With the suspect still at large the morning after Kirk\u2019s killing, Patel and his deputy, Dan Bongino, held a tense conference call with agents nationwide, according to two law enforcement officials and a Trump administration official.",
      "Patel and Bongino said on the profanity-laced call Thursday morning that they were under intense pressure to arrest the killer, according to The New York Times, which cited three people familiar with the exchange. Patel also called out agents in Salt Lake City for not having shared photos of the suspect with him sooner.",
      "That afternoon, Patel chose to travel from New York to Utah after he attended 9/11 anniversary ceremonies. Two administration officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Patel was told not to appear at news conferences in Utah or make other public comments until there was an arrest.",
      "On Thursday evening, Patel appeared at a news conference in Utah with state and local officials but did not speak. One of the administration officials said Patel \u201cmade the right decision\u201d by remaining silent.",
      "A third former senior FBI official criticized Patel\u2019s decision to travel to Utah before an arrest. He said Patel\u2019s arrival could have distracted agents or pulled them away from the investigation.",
      "\u201cNo serious director would show up at this stage,\u201d the former senior FBI official said. \u201cThey can\u2019t help. They can only distract. Every agent needed to support the visit is an agent not available to work the case.\u201d",
      "On Saturday, the day after 22-year-old Tyler Robinson was arrested in connection with the killing, Patel said on X that the FBI had solved the case by overruling other law enforcement agencies.",
      "\u201cAgainst all law enforcement recommendations, we demanded the video footage and enhanced stills of the suspect be released to the public,\u201d Patel wrote. \u201cRobinson\u2019s father, who ultimately turned him in to authorities, told law enforcement that he recognized his son in that released video.\u201d",
      "The Utah Department of Public Safety, the state\u2019s main law enforcement agency, issued a statement contradicting Patel\u2019s claim and emphasizing the importance of a \u201cunified investigation.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the agency said it first tried to identify the suspect using facial recognition technology to give officers an element of surprise and to prevent people who looked like the suspect from being unfairly scrutinized.",
      "\u201cWe did not recommend they not be released, however we first used technology (facial recognition) to try to identify,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWhen that was unsuccessful we were fully supportive and in agreement we should release the photos.\u201d",
      "A former senior official in a large police department who repeatedly worked with the FBI questioned Patel\u2019s criticism of local officials.",
      "He said the FBI traditionally brings sweeping resources to investigations, but the agency generally has local officials \u2014 who are sometimes more trusted by the public than federal officials \u2014 be the faces of the investigations.",
      "\u201cThese things should be left to the actual on-the-ground investigators,\u201d said the former senior law enforcement official, who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation.",
      "The former official added that he believed Patel\u2019s need to please Trump to keep his job may have caused him to criticize Utah officials.",
      "He said that \u201cit never benefits the FBI to criticize the locals\u201d and added that Patel appeared to be \u201cgrandstanding to impress an audience of one.\u201d",
      "Past firings",
      "O\u2019Leary, now a senior vice president at the Soufan Group, a security consulting firm, noted Patel\u2019s management of the bureau has also been marked by firings of supervisors and agents who investigated Trump or Jan. 6 rioters.",
      "He cited as an example the ouster last month of Brian Driscoll, a senior FBI official who was its acting director before Patel took office. Driscoll, who tried to protect agents who worked on Jan. 6 investigations, and two other former senior FBI officials sued Patel last week and requested their jobs back.",
      "O\u2019Leary also cited the demotion and subsequent retirement of Mehtab Syed, the head of the bureau\u2019s Salt Lake City office. He said it was not clear why Syed, who had worked multiple high-level terrorism cases and been a senior counterintelligence official, was forced out.",
      "\u201cThe corrosive nature of their policies is starting to have an impact,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cAnd it is leading to generational destruction to an institution that is essential to the protection of our nation, both from external and internal actors.\u201d"

Former adviser to President Donald Trump and right-wing podcaster Steve Bannon called for mass arrests and a crackdown on universities, while Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has directed staff to identify and discipline service members who mocked or condoned Kirk\u2019s killing, two defense officials told NBC News.",
      "Kirk was one of the right\u2019s most prominent and polarizing voices. He built his following by amplifying the false claim that the 2020 election was stolen and by railing against what he called \u201cwoke\u201d culture. His comments on race, feminism, LGBTQ rights and immigration often drew sharp criticism, sparking campus protests when he visited and making him a lighting rod for mockery and inspiration.",
      "Kirk was the 31-year-old co-founder of conservative youth organization Turning Point USA, a nonprofit that promotes conservative politics on high school and college campuses nationwide. He was fatally shot Wednesday during an event at Utah Valley University.",

      "Updating the investigation into Charlie Kirk\u2019s assassination Sunday, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that the suspect was in a romantic relationship with his roommate, who is cooperating with authorities.",
      "\u201cWhat we have learned specifically is that this person did not have any knowledge, was shocked when they found out about it,\u201d Cox said of the roommate.",
      "That person \u201cis a boyfriend who is transitioning from male to female,\u201d Cox said, misgendering the roommate. Cox was confirming earlier reporting from Fox News.",
      "The roommate has been \u201cvery cooperative,\u201d Cox said.",
      "That tracks with what a federal official close to the investigation told NBC News on Sunday.",
      "There still is \u201cnot a solid understanding\u201d of how the personal relationship factors into the attack, the official said.",
      "Asked on CNN how the roommate\u2019s transitioning was relevant to the suspect\u2019s motive, Cox said, \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to figure out right now.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s easy to draw conclusions from that, and so we\u2019ve got the shell casings, other forensic evidence that is coming in and trying to piece all of those things together,\u201d Cox said.",
      "\"We\u2019re all drawing lots of conclusions and how someone like this could beradicalized,\" Cox told \"Meet the Press.\" \"And I think that those are those are important questions for us to ask, and important questions for us to answer.\"",
      "Cox also said Robinson has not been cooperating with authorities. The federal official told NBC News that Robinson has invoked his Fifth Amendment rights.",
      "Authorities have not provided details about the suspect\u2019s possible motive. Cox said that suspect, Robinson, 22, had a \u201cleftist ideology\u201d despite having come from a conservative family. Robinson was not registered to any political party. Authorities said he scrawled messages about fascism, video games and internet memes on ammunition.",
      "Officials said Robinson had only recently shown interest in politics, and a relative recalled his criticizing Kirk during a dinner ahead of his Utah Valley University event. Kirk built a dedicated audience in part through a willingness to argue contentious stances online and in on-campus events, including calling a trans person \u201can abomination to God.\u201d",
      "Cox emphasized that \u201cmuch more\u201d will be revealed Tuesday, when charges are expected to be filed. Federal officials told NBC News that there are no active discussions about federal charges.",
      "A federal official said, \u201cWe are taking our time,\u201d while another said investigators are still working to assess Robinson\u2019s digital content, which could determine whether there is a potential for federal jurisdiction.",
      "Investigators are also pursuing legal avenues to gain access to cloud storage linked to Robinson, the two officials said, in hope of shedding light on his thinking and possible intentions.",
      "Cox described Robinson as once a \u201cvery normal, very smart\u201d young man who earned a 4.0 grade-point average and a 34 on the ACT before he briefly attended Utah State University. But Cox said he seemed to change after he moved back home to southern Utah after a decision to leave school after one semester.",
      "Robinson spent much his time gaming and immersed in the \u201cdeep, dark internet, the Reddit culture and these other dark places,\u201d Cox said. The inscriptions on the bullet casings near the scene reflect that meme-driven online world, Cox said.",
      "In the aftermath of the shooting, Cox has taken on a lead role in urging calm amid soaring tensions. He urged Americans to find an \u201coff-ramp\u201d at a time of rising political violence and a polarized political landscape and has also spoken against social media, which he has called a \u201ccancer.\u201d",
      "Cox, a Republican, echoed those messages Sunday, arguing that \u201csocial media has played a direct role in every single assassination and assassination attempt that we have seen over the last five, six years.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is no question in my mind that \u2018cancer\u2019 probably isn\u2019t a strong enough word,\u201d he added.",
      "He also said he could not \u201cemphasize enough the damage that social media and the internet is doing to all of us.\u201d Powerful companies \u201chave figured out how to hack our brains, get us addicted to outrage,\u201d he added.",
      "Cox urged people to use their own agency to move the country away from the brink, rather than wait for a political figure to show the path forward.",
      "\u201cPeople keep waiting for somebody to lead us out of this. And I think that\u2019s a mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think any one person, certainly not a governor, I don\u2019t think a president, I don\u2019t think anyone can change the trajectory of this. It truly is about every single one of us.\u201d",
      "Asked about President Donald Trump\u2019s saying last week that \u201cthe radicals on the left are the problem,\u201d Cox said Trump \u201cis angry, and he has every right to be angry.\u201d",
      "Cox said the White House asked him to appear on morning shows \u201cbecause they\u2019re worried about the escalation that\u2019s happening out there.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut again, I don\u2019t know why we feel like we need to take our cues, that we as Americans have to get up in the morning and decide how we\u2019re going to react or act based on what the president says or what a governor says or what anyone else says,\u201d he said.",
      "He said his conservative philosophy and his faith led him to believe that \u201cwe are each individually responsible for ourselves.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe United States of America is a collection of a lot of different people,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd again, no president is going to lead us out of this. It\u2019s going to be every single one of us.\u201d"

    "summary": "Nate Bargatze hosts the 2025 Emmy Awards on September 14. What to know about the record-breaking comedian's approach to TV's biggest night on CBS.",
    "story": [
      "For Nate Bargatze, the Tennessee-born comic who\u2019s become one of America\u2019s most beloved stand-up performers, hosting the 77th Emmy Awards represents the culmination of a career built on understated charm and everyman relatability.",
      "Known for his commitment to clean humor, Bargatze had a series of successful comedy specials, like \u201cThe Greatest Average American\u201d and \u201cThe Tennessee Kid.\u201d",
      "After decades in the business, he shot to fame after his 2023 \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d appearance. His 2024 tour crowned him the highest-grossing comedian of the year.",
      "Follow live Emmys 2025 coverage",
      "Now, Bargatze is approaching his hosting duties with a clear mission: keep things light, fun and genuinely enjoyable for everyone in attendance.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to be mean,\u201d Bargatze told USA Today when discussing his hosting philosophy. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make someone sad that\u2019s there.\u201d",
      "In an interview with TheWrap, he echoed the sentiment, saying that he wants to avoid making people in the audience feel uncomfortable.",
      "\u201cWhen the celebrities are there, you want to be able to see them afterwards and it not be weird. Jokes are naturally going to be kind of mean. That\u2019s the only way it\u2019s going to be funny,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have jokes about shows, but I\u2019m not trying to be, I don\u2019t want to make anybody sad.\u201d",
      "And to CNN, he said something similar: \u201cI would not want to do something that\u2019s just inherently mean, and to really be mean to a person. That would break my heart if I found out anybody was really hurt by anything.\u201d",
      "What viewers can expect, however, is stripped-down compared to traditional Emmy spectacle. Don\u2019t look for elaborate song-and-dance numbers or musical interludes under Bargatze\u2019s watch. \u201cI would be terrible at that stuff,\u201d he said to USA Today. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want the show to be bad. I want it to be good. So I don\u2019t plan on singing. I hope I don\u2019t.\u201d",
      "He's also devised an unconventional strategy for keeping speeches under 45 seconds each. Bargatze promised a personal $100,000 donation to the Boys & Girls Club of America \u2014 and the number will change depending on how speeches go.",
      "He explained the scheme on \"The Jimmy Kimmel Show.\"",
      "\u201cEverybody gets 45 seconds to do all the thank-yous,\u201d Bargatze said. \u201cSo what I came up with is I\u2019m going to donate $100,000 to the Boys & Girls Club. \u2026 That\u2019s what the show\u2019s starting at. When everybody uses their 45 seconds, if someone goes over, we take away $1,000 a second every time they go over.\u201d",
      "This year\u2019s ceremony follows the 2024 show helmed by father-son duo Dan and Eugene Levy.",
      "The 2025 nominees represent a particularly strong field, with Apple TV+\u2019s workplace thriller \u201cSeverance\u201d leading the pack with a 27 nominations. Close behind is HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Penguin,\u201d Colin Farrell\u2019s transformative turn as the Batman villain earning the limited series 24 nominations, while Apple TV+\u2019s behind-the-scenes comedy \u201cThe Studio\u201d nabbed 23 nods.",
      "Viewers can also expect to see on-stage appearances from a diverse roster of celebrity presenters, including Tina Fey, Parker Posey, Jenna Ortega, and Mariska Hargitay.",
      "The 77th Emmy Awards air live on Sunday, Sept. 14.",

      "Swift and Kelce started dating after she performed her \"Eras Tour\" in Kansas City in July 2023. Kelce later said on his podcast that he tried and failed to give her a friendship bracelet with his phone number on it, leading the two to connect. And the rest was history.",
      "In in the interview, Kelce also discussed playing his 13th season in the NFL. Andrews said there was a speculation among fans over whether or not the three-time Super Bowl champ would play another year. The 2024-2025 season notably ended in heartbreak for his team, with the Philadelphia Eagles defeating the Chiefs, 40-22, in the Super Bowl. (Kelce's interview with Andrews aired Sept. 14, the same day as the Chiefs-Eagles rematch game at Kansas City's Arrowhead Stadium.)",
      "\"I love what I do,\" Kelce said. \"I'm still a kid on Sundays that enjoys every single aspect of the game. I built a family here. I don't want to give that up yet. I still feel like I've got a lot to prove.\""

      "JERUSALEM \u2014 President Donald Trump may have hoped to be stitching together the final details of a peace deal, but instead his top diplomat landed in Jerusalem on Sunday to douse blazing tensions between U.S. allies.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio has signaled that Washington wants answers from Israel after its unprecedented attack on Hamas leaders inside Qatar, another key American partner in the Middle East. The Trump administration has sought to distance itself from the strike, which has outraged regional powers and left efforts to end Israel\u2019s devastating assault on the Gaza Strip in tatters.",
      "But while Rubio said Saturday that the U.S. was unhappy about the attack on Doha, he made clear that it would not fundamentally alter the close relationship between the two countries.",
      "\u201cObviously we\u2019re not happy about it,\u201d Rubio told reporters. \u201cThe president was not happy about it. Now we need to move forward and figure out what comes next.\u201d",
      "He said he would talk about \u201cwhat the future holds\u201d during his two-day visit to Israel, where he met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others in Jerusalem.",
      "Speaking on a joint visit to the Western Wall, Netanyahu said that ties between the two countries had \"never been stronger.\"",
      "Rubio's visit was \u201ca testament to the durability, the strength of the Israeli-American alliance. It\u2019s as strong and as durable as the stones of the Western Wall we just touched,\u201d Netanyahu said.",
      "Rubio said the U.S.-Israel relationship remains \u201cvery strong,\u201d but his comments ahead of the trip underline Washington's awkward scramble to balance relations with key allies in the wake of the attack.",
      "Trump met with Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani in New York on Friday. The Qatari premier, who accused Israel of having \u201ckilled any hope\u201d of releasing hostages still held in Gaza, also met with Rubio and Vice President JD Vance.",
      "\u201cTrump wants Hamas defeated,\u201d Rubio added Saturday. \u201cHe wants the war to end, he wants all 48 hostages home, including those that are deceased, and he wants it all at once. And we\u2019ll have to discuss about how the events last week had an impact on the ability to achieve that in short order.\u201d",
      "Possible Israeli plans to annex parts of the occupied West Bank are also expected to be on the agenda during Rubio\u2019s trip.",
      "His visit comes just a week before several countries, including France, Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom, are expected to formally recognize a Palestinian state. Bezalel Smotrich, the far-right Israeli finance minister, has called for the annexation of 82% of the West Bank to block any vision of a future Palestinian state from becoming a reality.",
      "Trump has a \u201cstark choice,\u201d said Dan Shapiro, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank who was U.S. ambassador to Israel during the Biden administration. He can draw a \u201cclear line against\u201d West Bank annexation and \u201csteer an end to the war in Gaza.\u201d",
      "Or, Shapiro said on X, he can \u201cwatch his first term achievement of the Abraham Accords wither on the vine,\u201d referring to landmark deals mediated by the U.S. in Trump\u2019s first term that saw the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain recognize the state of Israel.",
      "Qatar is hosting a summit of Arab and Muslim leaders starting Sunday in the wake of the strikes, which drew condemnation from the UAE, Saudi Arabia and others.",
      "Rubio was also set to meet with families of hostages while in Israel, according to the State Department, and \u201cunderscore that their relatives\u2019 return remains a top priority.\u201d He and Israeli leaders are also expected to discuss \u201cIsraeli operational goals and objectives\u201d for the ongoing ground offensive in Gaza.",
      "Israeli forces have intensified aerial attacks on famine-stricken Gaza City and nearby areas, ordering the evacuation of two high-rise buildings Sunday morning as they continued a wave of strikes.",
      "\u201cGaza\u2019s skyline is changing,\u201d Defense Minister Israel Katz said on X as he posted footage of an airstrike leveling one high-rise.",
      "The offensive has prompted mass displacement and worsening humanitarian conditions. Israeli authorities said Saturday that roughly 250,000 Palestinians have fled the area after evacuation orders.",
      "Forty-one people had been killed by the Israeli military since dawn Sunday, Dr. Muhammad Abu Salmiya, director of Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, told NBC News.",
      "Since United Nations-backed global food security experts confirmed a famine in Gaza City on Aug. 22, Gaza\u2019s health ministry has reported that at least 142 people have died from starvation and malnutrition across the territory.",
      "Israel launched its military campaign after the Hamas-led terrorist attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, in which 1,200 people were killed and around 250 people taken hostage.",
      "Since then, Palestinian health officials say, Israeli forces have killed more than 64,000 people in Gaza, including thousands of children, while driving most of the population from their homes and destroying or damaging most of its buildings and infrastructure.",
      "Netanyahu says Gaza City is Hamas\u2019 last major stronghold, but the plan to occupy it has drawn international criticism. The U.N. has warned that pressing the offensive in an area already facing famine risks pushing civilians into an \u201ceven deeper catastrophe.\u201d",
      "Gaza is being \u201ccompletely obliterated,\u201d Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner general of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, said Sunday on Facebook, calling the enclave a \u201cwasteland.\u201d",

      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio will travel to Israel this weekend to discuss with officials the latest developments in the war in Gaza, the State Department said Friday.",
      "\u201cIn Israel, he will convey America\u2019s priorities in the Israel-Hamas conflict and broader issues concerning Middle Eastern security, reaffirming the U.S. commitment to Israeli security,\u201d State Department Principal Deputy Spokesperson Tommy Piggot said in a statement. \u201cHe will also emphasize our shared goals: ensuring Hamas never rules over Gaza again and bringing all the hostages home.\u201d",
      "The visit comes at a moment of high tension for the longtime allies following Israel\u2019s attempted assassination of Hamas leaders on Qatari soil earlier this week. Israel\u2019s strikes in the middle of peace negotiations to end the war in Gaza have outraged Qatar, a key mediator in the war, as well as other key U.S. allies in the region and the Trump administration has attempted to distance itself from the action.",
      "\u201cThe unilateral bombing inside Qatar, a sovereign nation working very hard and bravely taking risks alongside the United States to broker peace, does not advance Israel\u2019s or America\u2019s goals,\u201d Dorothy Shea, the acting U.S. permanent representative to the UN, said Thursday at an emergency Security Council session.",
      "President Donald Trump told reporters Tuesday that he was \"very unhappy\" with the Israeli strikes.",
      "\u201cI was very unhappy about it, very unhappy about every aspect, and we got to get the hostages back. But I was very unhappy about the way that went down,\u201d he said.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened further strikes on Qatar if it continues to host Hamas, which Qatar has done for years at the request of the U.S. Qatar, along with Egypt, had also been helping mediate ceasefire talks between Hamas and Israel.",
      "\u201cI say to Qatar and all nations who harbor terrorists, you either expel them or you bring them to justice,\u201d Netanyahu said Wednesday. \u201cBecause if you don\u2019t, we will.\u201d",
      "Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed Al-Thani, who met with Trump on Friday, also attended the meeting at the U.N. and accused Israel of undermining negotiations to end the war. Al-Thani also met with Rubio and Vice President JD Vance at the White House on Friday for a meeting that a source familiar with the meeting described as \"very positive.\"",
      "\u201cAttacking our territories while we were busy with negotiations has uncovered the intention of Israel. It is trying to undermine any prospect of peace. It is trying to perpetuate the suffering of the Palestinian people,\u201d Al Thani said. \u201cIt also shows that extremists that rule Israel today do not care about the hostages. This is not a priority.\u201d",
      "Rubio will also meet with the families of hostages while in Israel, according to the State Department and \u201cunderscore that their relatives\u2019 return remains a top priority.\u201d Rubio and Israeli leaders will also discuss \u201cIsraeli operational goals and objectives,\u201d for their ongoing ground offensive in Gaza, the department said.",
      "The visit also comes just a week before several countries, including France, Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom, are expected to formally recognize a Palestinian state. Bezalel Smotrich, the far-right Israeli finance minister, has called for the annexation of 82% of the West Bank to block their vision of a future Palestinian state from becoming a reality.",
      "Speaking earlier this month, Rubio called Israel\u2019s retaliation \u201cwholly predictable,\u201d and said he had warned his European allies that their actions would create \u201cbig problems,\u201d and \u201cmake it harder to get a ceasefire.\u201d Rubio added that it is not inevitable.",
      "\u201cAs for what you\u2019re seeing with the West Bank and the annexation, that\u2019s not a final thing,\u201d Rubio said at a news conference in September. \u201cThat\u2019s something that\u2019s being discussed among some elements of Israeli politics.\u201d",
      "In Israel this week, Rubio will discuss the U.S. \u201ccommitment to fight anti-Israel actions,\u201d including unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state that rewards Hamas terrorism, and lawfare at the ICC and ICJ,\u201d the State Department announced.",
      "Rubio will then travel to the U.K., where he will meet with new U.K. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper to discuss U.S.-U.K. \"cooperation on critical global challenges, including ending the Russia-Ukraine war, preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, ensuring release of all Hamas-held hostages and a ceasefire in Gaza, and competing with China.\u201d"

      "LONDON \u2014 Britain's ambassador to the United States, Peter Mandelson, was fired Thursday after new revelations about his association with Jeffrey Epstein were revealed.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer asked his foreign ministry to withdraw Mandelson, saying newly released emails show that the extent of his relationship with the late convicted sex offender was greater than previously known.",
      "Mandelson, a veteran Labour Party politician who was key to its success under former leader Tony Blair, has come under scrutiny over his relationship with Epstein after the release of a birthday book that included a letter purportedly from Mandelson describing Epstein as \u201cmy best pal.\u201d",
      "Starmer had backed Mandelson \u2014 who is not a career diplomat and instead was appointed for his political skills and contacts in Washington \u2014 a day earlier but changed course amid growing pressure from his party.",
      "\u201cIn light of the additional information in emails written by Peter Mandelson, the prime minister has asked the foreign secretary to withdraw him as ambassador,\u201d the foreign ministry said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThe emails show that the depth and extent of Peter Mandelson\u2019s relationship with Jeffrey Epstein is materially different from that known at the time of his appointment.\u201d",
      "The ministry said the revelation of Mandelson\u2019s suggestion that Epstein\u2019s first conviction was wrongful and should be challenged was \u201cnew information.\u201d",
      "\"In light of that, and mindful of the victims of Epstein\u2019s crimes he has been withdrawn as Ambassador with immediate effect,\" it added in the statement.",
      "In an interview with Britain\u2019s Sun newspaper released Wednesday, Mandelson said he felt a \u201cprofound sense of sympathy for those people, those women who suffered as a result of his behavior and his illegal criminal activities.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel a tremendous sense of regret not only that I met him in the first place, but that I continued the association and I took at face value the lies that he fed me and many others,\u201d he said, describing Epstein as a \u201ccharismatic criminal liar.\u201d"

    "summary": "Hundreds of South Korean nationals arrested in an immigration raid last week are en route to the airport in Atlanta where they will leave for Seoul later Thursday, the South Korean foreign ministry said.",
    "story": [
      "Hundreds of South Korean nationals arrested in an immigration raid last week were en route to the airport in Atlanta where they will leave for Seoul later Thursday, the South Korean foreign ministry said, after their flight was previously delayed on what the ministry said were orders from President Donald Trump.",
      "More than 300 South Koreans \u2014 307 men and 10 women \u2014 were detained in the Sept. 4 raid on a Hyundai plant in Georgia, the ministry said, one of whom has decided to remain in the U.S. rather than agree to \u201cvoluntary departure.\u201d The 316 others will be on the flight to Seoul, along with 14 employees of South Korean companies from other Asian countries: 10 from China, three from Japan and one from Indonesia.",
      "The workers were released from the Folkston ICE Processing Center in rural Georgia at 2:18 a.m. ET, the foreign ministry said, and were being driven several hours to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport where a plane sent by the South Korean government is waiting for them.",
      "The Korean Air plane is scheduled to leave Atlanta at noon ET and arrive in Seoul on Friday around 4 p.m. local time (3 a.m. ET).",
      "South Korean officials originally hoped the plane would leave Atlanta as early as Wednesday afternoon local time, shortly after it arrived from Seoul. But the foreign ministry said its departure was likely to be delayed \u201cdue to circumstances on the U.S. side,\u201d and an airport spokesperson later said the charter flight had been canceled.",
      "At a meeting with Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington on Wednesday, South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun learned that Trump had ordered the suspension of the repatriation process in order to discuss with South Korea whether its detained nationals \u2014 all of them skilled workers who were helping set up an electric vehicle battery plant \u2014 should remain in the U.S. to continue their work rather than be sent home.",
      "Cho told Rubio that it would be better for them to return home first and then re-enter the U.S. \u201csince these individuals were already in shock and are exhausted,\u201d a South Korean government official said.",
      "The official said that the U.S. agreed to repatriate the South Koreans and that Trump had instructed that they be transported to the airport without physical restraints such as handcuffs, in a departure from standard U.S. practice.",
      "Images of South Koreans being shackled at the wrists and ankles have caused outrage in South Korea, a key U.S. ally in Asia that has pledged hundreds of billions in U.S. investment as part of tariff negotiations. The raid came weeks after South Korean President Lee Jae Myung reinforced that commitment at a meeting with Trump at the White House.",
      "\u201cWe believe that President Trump\u2019s consideration in this regard stems from the deep bonds formed between the two leaders at the successful South Korea-U.S. summit, as well as the consistent position our government has maintained on this detention issue,\u201d the South Korean government official said.",
      "Lee said all but one of the 317 detained South Koreans had elected to fly home.",
      "\u201cEach person was allowed to choose, and the U.S. government said essentially, \u2018If you want to go, you may go; if you want to stay, you may stay,\u2019\u201d Lee said at a news conference in Seoul marking his 100th day in office.",
      "The raid has raised concerns about the potential impact on U.S.-South Korea relations, though Lee said his government had \u201cnot considered it to that depth yet.\u201d",
      "He said the incident could make South Korean companies more hesitant to invest in the U.S., where they have long sent employees on a temporary basis to provide training or assistance in areas where U.S. expertise is lacking.",
      "\u201cIf this is not allowed, companies will inevitably worry: \u2018If setting up factories in the U.S. brings endless restrictions and difficulties, should we even proceed?\u2019\u201d Lee said.",
      "What happened?",
      "The South Korean nationals were among the 475 people federal and immigration agents arrested in the raid on a construction site in the town of Ellabell, where the South Korean companies Hyundai and LG Energy Solution are jointly building an electric vehicle battery plant.",
      "U.S. officials, who said the arrested people were working or living in the country illegally, have described the raid as the largest single-site enforcement operation in the history of Homeland Security Investigations, a division of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. No criminal charges have been filed.",
      "Of the detained South Koreans, 47 were employed by LG Energy Solution and the rest were hired by subcontractors. Hyundai, South Korea\u2019s largest automaker, said none of its direct employees were detained.",
      "Most of the detained South Koreans either were engineers or they worked in after-sales services and installation, said Charles Kuck, an Atlanta-based immigration attorney who is representing at least seven of them. He said they were in the U.S. under various visa programs that South Koreans and other foreign nationals have long used to do business in the country in the face of U.S. bureaucratic delays and murky regulations.",
      "Sarah Park, president of the Korean American Coalition, said Monday that the detained workers should not be blamed for the challenges companies face trying to secure the proper U.S. visas for employees who are key to getting new facilities up and running.",
      "James S. Kim, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Korea, said Wednesday in an interview in Seoul: \u201cI wish that Americans in America would be a little bit more sympathetic to what the Koreans have witnessed. And as long as they do that, I think the two countries can work together to kind of mitigate what had happened and move forward.\u201d",
      "What\u2019s behind the raid?",
      "Federal authorities showed up at the Hyundai-LG plant to execute a judicial search warrant in connection with what they said was a criminal investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices.",
      "According to the warrant, agents were authorized to seize employment records and immigration documents, as well as ownership and management records related to the construction site. Authorities were also looking for four people, but the reasons the federal government was specifically interested in them remain under seal.",
      "On Sunday, U.S. and South Korean government officials reached a deal to release the workers from immigration custody and return them to their home country.",
      "Consulate officials and other South Korean officials met with those detained at the Folkston ICE Processing Center over the weekend, Meredyth Yoon, a litigation director at Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta, which has been assisting detainees and their families seeking legal help, told NBC News on Tuesday.",
      "Yoon said that, as part of the deal, most of the South Korean nationals had agreed to \u201cvoluntary departure,\u201d avoiding formal deportation orders.",
      "She said that about 175 of the remaining detainees \u2014 who hail from Guatemala, Colombia, Chile, Mexico, Ecuador and Venezuela \u2014 remain in immigration detention and that her organization is working to connect the affected families to aid."

      "Poland's leaders spoke to their European counterparts afterward, and Polish President Karol Nawrocki said he spoke to Trump about the situation Wednesday afternoon.",
      "Russia labeled the accusations \u201cgroundless\" and said it did not plan to attack any targets in Poland.",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry said that it had attacked the \u201cmilitary-industrial complex of Ukraine\u201d in a \"large-scale strike\" but that \"there were no targets envisioned for destruction on the Polish territory,\" pointing to the flight range of the drones it said it used against western Ukraine.",
      "It said it was \"ready to hold consultations with the Polish Ministry of Defense on this matter.\"",
      "Polish Foreign Minister Rados\u0142aw Sikorski said there was no doubt the incursion was intentional, calling the violation an unprecedented attack on NATO and the European Union.",
      "\"In this case there were 19 breaches, and it simply defies imagination that it could be accidental,\" he told reporters.",
      "The European Union needs to create a \"drone wall\" to face the challenges illustrated by the overnight incursion, he said.",

      "Tusk added that a significant number of the drones flew in from Belarus, an authoritarian ally of Russia used as a launching pad for attacks on Ukraine.",
      "\u201cI have no reason to claim we\u2019re on the brink of war, but a line has been crossed,\" he told the Polish Parliament. \u201cThis situation brings us the closest we have been to open conflict since World War II.\"",
      "Belarus said that the drones had \u201clost their way\u201d and that it had also shot some down over its territory.",
      "The Polish military\u2019s operational command called the drones an \u201cact of aggression\" and initially urged residents to stay at home, with three eastern regions at particular risk. It later thanked NATO air command and the Dutch air force, which it said scrambled F-35 fighter jets.",
      "Poland and the United States are members of NATO, which at its core is a mutual defense pact formed after World War II to deal with the threat posed by the Soviet Union, meaning an attack on one may be considered an attack on all.",
      "Tusk said he had activated Article 4 of NATO\u2019s treaty, under which alliance members can demand consultations with their allies, and that he was in touch with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, who called the incursion \"reckless behavior,\" irrespective of whether it was deliberate.",
      "A NATO official confirmed to NBC News that Poland had \"requested consultations under Article 4 of the Washington Treaty,\u201d only the eighth time that the article \u2014 which does not trigger a military reaction \u2014 has been invoked since NATO was established in 1949."
