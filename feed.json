      "Carnival always breathes life into the economy of Vila Vintem, on Rio de Janeiro\u2019s west side, but this year there\u2019s even more, with its Unidos de Padre Miguel samba school back in the top parade league for the first time in 57 years",
      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- Carnival always breathes life into the economy of Vila Vintem, a favela on Rio de Janeiro's west side, but this year the pulse is even stronger with its Unidos de Padre Miguel samba school returning to the top samba parade league for the first time in almost 60 years.",
      "As one of Rio's 12 top-tier samba schools, Unidos de Padre Miguel will have its shot at fame, perhaps even glory \u2014 all while bringing in more money into its community.",
      "Last year, competing in the second division, Padre Miguel received about 900,000 reais ($150,000) from City Hall, missing out on the lucrative sponsorship deals and revenue from television rights, pre-Carnival parties and ticket sales enjoyed by top-flight samba schools. But their victory in last year's Carnival secured their place in the main event that kicks off Sunday night.",
      "The shift has sent Padre Miguel\u2019s budget this year ballooning more than tenfold, to about 11 million reais ($2 million), including nearly 2 million reais from the city, according to the samba school's deputy chairman Dr. Willie Baracho.",
      "The school has already invested a significant portion into the community, funding local seamstresses, carpenters and welders for parade preparations.",
      "Vila Vintem is already experiencing the positive effects. Several of the favela's formerly jobless residents told The Associated Press they have bought smartphones and household appliances.",
      "Padre Miguel's new headquarters, nearing completion, will relocate rehearsals and other community activities from a hangar-like space that served as a vital center for the community during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cOur samba school has projects, it helps people, distributes food, throws parties for our children,\u201d Luana Borges, 42, said as she fixed details on several costumes, some bearing the school's traditional red and white colors.",
      "\u201cWhen Carnival comes, it offers opportunities to people like me,\" said Borges, who used to be unemployed.",
      "Nearly all samba schools sit in working-class neighborhoods around Rio\u2019s metropolitan region and compete against each other in the legendary Sambadrome parade grounds. Favelas in Rio are typically associated with dense, hillside neighborhoods, but they feature other geographies, too. The 14,000-resident Vila Vintem cropped up almost a century ago on flatlands next to a railway under construction.",
      "When first settled, the swampy area was said to be worth not even a \u201cvintem,\u201d the cheapest coin at the time, akin to a penny. Decades passed before basic services arrived, sometimes only after residents agreed to do the work themselves.",
      "Even with its new Carnival windfall, Padre Miguel remains a financial underdog.",
      "Baracho said its more popular rivals don\u2019t depend as much on city money, and can bring in up to 18 million reais ($3 million) when accounting for corporate sponsorships, sales of merchandise, coveted parade positions and cover charges for their pre-Carnival parties.",
      "While Padre Miguel employs almost all locals, Baracho said wealthier samba schools can spend over 1 million reais, for instance, on coaches and dancers, whose performance is one of the categories scored by judges.",
      "\u201cThe sky is the limit for some, but we fight,\u201d Baracho said. \u201cWe managed to get promoted because we are invested in our people, we work hard to foster our own creativity.\"",
      "Padre Miguel will be the first samba school to parade on Sunday night. Their procession will tell the story of Iya\u0301 Nasso\u0302, the founder of the first space in Brazil for rituals of the Afro-Brazilian faith Candomble.",
      "Experts say the best path for scrappy samba schools like Padre Miguel to sustain their community impact is to focus on avoiding relegation, rather than pursuing Carnival\u2019s top prize, amounting to 20% of the revenue of the tickets sold for the Champions Parade, which takes place the following weekend.",
      "\u201cThere's little chance for a samba school to win the title coming from the second division,\" said F\u00e1tima Costa de Lima, a Carnival researcher and scenic arts professor at Santa Catarina State University. \u201cIt happened before, but it is rare. The main goal for a samba school like (Padre Miguel) is to stay on.\u201d",
      "Ingrid Lima Leal has worked for Padre Miguel for 15 years, and paraded with the school for even longer. The 66-year-old says that creating jobs in Vila Vintem and being at the world-famous parade is worth every cent. She wants to see more next year \u2014 hopefully still in the top division.",
      "While sewing a white costume in her home workshop, Leal expressed the \u201camazing emotion\u201d of marching in the parade wearing something she helped create.",
      "\u201cCarnival brings a lot of jobs. Not only here, but everywhere,\u201d she said.",

      "Each ensemble was a perfect combination of soothing neutrals, harmonizing seemingly contrasting materials.

While his Pacific Palisades house was spared, O\u2019Brien has been living out of a hotel the last two months. Oscar producers have said the show will celebrate the city\u2019s resilience.",
      "The lead nominee is Netflix\u2019s \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d with 13 nominations, but that film has seen its chances crater following uproar over years-old offensive tweets by its star, Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, the first openly trans actor nominated for best actress.",
      "The favorite is Sean Baker\u2019s \u201cAnora,\u201d about a sex worker who weds the son of a Russian oligarch.

Trump has called those involved with the film \u201chuman scum.\u201d",
      "The political tenor of this year\u2019s ceremony could be volatile, with the Oscars coming weeks into the second Trump administration and falling two days after the president\u2019s dramatic rupture with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House.",

      "While the supporting acting categories feature overwhelming favorites in Zoe Saldana (\u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d) and Kieran Culkin (\u201cA Real Pain\u201d), both best actor and best actress are close contests.",
      "In best actress, Demi Moore (\u201cThe Substance\u201d) is most likely to win, but Mikey Madison (\u201cAnora\u201d) or Fernanda Torres (\u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d) could pull off the upset.",
      "Adrien Brody is favored in best actor for his performance in \u201cThe Brutalist. But Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet stands a decent chance of beating him, for his performance as Bob Dylan in \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d The 29-year-old Chalamet, who won at the Screen Actors Guild, would become the youngest best actor winner ever, edging Brody\u2019s record, set in 2003 in his win for \u201cThe Pianist.\u201d",
      "This year's Oscars are unspooling after a turbulent year for the film industry. Ticket sales were down 3% from the previous year and more significantly from pre-pandemic times. The strikes of 2023 played havoc with release schedules in 2024. Many studios pulled back on production, leaving many out of work. The fires, in January, only added to the pain.",
      "Last year\u2019s telecast, propelled by the twin blockbusters of \u201cOppenheimer\u201d and \u201cBarbie,\u201d led the Oscars to a four-year viewership high, with 19.5 million viewers. This year, with smaller independent films favored in the most prominent awards, the academy will be tested to draw as large of an audience.",
      "With a not particularly starry array of best song nominees, the academy has done away with performances of original songs this year. But there will be music, including a performance by \u201cWicked\u201d stars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, and a tribute to the late Quincy Jones, with Queen Latifah.",
      "Last year\u2019s acting winners \u2014 Emma Stone, Robert Downey Jr., Cillian Murphy, Da\u2019Vine Joy Randolph \u2014 will also take part in the ceremony. Though the academy initially said it would bring back the \u201cfab five\u201d style of presenting the acting awards, with five previous winners per category, organizers have reportedly abandoned those plans.",
      "The ceremony will be taking place days following the death of Gene Hackman. The 95-year-old two-time Oscar winner and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, were found dead Wednesday at their New Mexico home.",

      "An artist in Denmark aims to raise awareness of the suffering caused by modern pig production with an art installation that opened Friday that includes three piglets who will be denied food and water and will starve to death.",
      "Chilean-born Marco Evaristti is courting controversy to make a point about the treatment of pigs in Denmark, where about 25,000 piglets die daily as a result of the conditions in which they are bred.",
      "The central exhibit at Copenhagen's \u201cAnd Now You Care\u201d exhibition is a makeshift cage created with shopping carts containing three piglets. As the exhibition opened Friday evening, they were still fine, but they will not be given food and drink, and can be expected to die of hunger within a few days.",
      "Evaristti says on his Instagram page that the exhibition \u201cis a confrontation with Denmark's bloody reality\u201d in slaughterhouses, and that he urges people to reduce their meat consumption and support agriculture that improves animal welfare.",
      "Denmark's largest and oldest animal welfare organization, Animal Protection Denmark, says it is grateful for Evaristti's interest in the problem, but disagrees with how he wants to convey it.",
      "\u201cWe completely understand the indignation\u201d of the artist, said Birgitte Damm, a spokesperson for the organization. \u201cBut we do not agree that three piglets, three individual living beings, should be starved and prevented from drinking until they die from it. It is illegal and it is abuse of the animals.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe fact that happens to thousands each day in the industry doesn\u2019t make it right,\u201d she said. But she also praised the artist for asking \u201cthe large questions about who we are as human beings or want to be, and what we are doing to fellow creatures in the name of enormous amounts of mass-produced cheap meat.\u201d",
      "Damm explained that sows are bred in the Danish pig industry to produce about 20 piglets at a time, but only have 14 teats, forcing the piglets to compete for breastmilk, and leading to the starvation of many. She said some 25,000 piglets die every day from starvation or the result of the conditions in which they are held in Denmark.",
      "It's not Evaristti's first controversial project.",
      "One of his projects included goldfish in blenders, tempting viewers to press the button and create goldfish soup.",
      "In 2006 he used some of his own body fat removed via liposuction to prepare meatballs, and then ate some of them.",
      "He described that project called \u201cPolpette Al Grasso Di Marco\u201d as a critique on people overconsuming and then buying their way to slimness with liposuction, and at the same time an attempt to transcend the taboo of cannibalism.",

      "Hackman's performance as an obsessed and amoral cop in the 1971 film \u201cThe French Connection\" earned an Oscar for best actor in a leading role and was considered one of his defining roles. Hackman swung another Oscar for playing a sadistic sheriff in 1992's \u201cUnforgiven.\"",

      "A depressed German loaf of bread named Bernd das Brot is celebrating his 25th anniversary as the reluctant star of a children\u2019s television program",
      "BERLIN -- Forget SpongeBob SquarePants, Sesame Street and the sourdough starter craze: a depressed German loaf of bread named Bernd das Brot is celebrating his 25th anniversary as the reluctant star of a children's television program that accidentally became equally popular with adults.",
      "A cult classic in Germany, Bernd das Brot (Bernd the Bread) is a puppet renowned for his deep, gloomy voice, his perpetual pessimism and his signature expression, \"Mist!\" (Think \u201ccrap!\u201d in English.)",
      "Played and voiced by puppeteer J\u00f6rg Teichgraeber, Bernd is a television presenter who wants nothing to do with TV and can\u2019t wait to go home to stare at the wallpaper.",
      "This year, his friends \u2014 a sheep and a flower bush \u2014 are urging him to become a bread influencer.",
      "Born as a sketch on the back of a napkin in a pizzeria, creator Tommy Krappweis drew Bernd's infamous grimace after co-creator Norman C\u00f6ster's face when they were asked to come up with mascots for KiKA, a German children\u2019s public television channel.",
      "Comic artist Georg Graf von Westphalen designed Bernd as a pullman loaf \u2014 white bread typically sliced for sandwiches \u2014 with short arms and a permanent scowl. Bernd channels German stereotypes with his grumpy disposition, penchant for complaining and dry sense of humor and irony.",
      "Bernd's first episode aired on KiKA in 2000 alongside his more-optimistic pals, Chili the Sheep and Briegel the Bush.",
      "Because KiKA is a children's channel, there was typically dead air from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. On Jan. 1, 2003, the network put Bernd's short episodes into the night loop for the first time.",
      "The move brought an adult audience \u2014 often those sitting at home and smoking pot, or returning after a long night of partying \u2014 into Bernd's world, cementing his popularity as a German cult classic.",
      "In 2004, Bernd won the Adolf Grimme Prize \u2014 the German television equivalent of an Emmy \u2014 because the jury said he represents \u201cthe right to be in a bad mood.\u201d",
      "\u201cBernd shows you that you are less vulnerable with humor and self-irony. And perhaps the most important point is: It\u2019s totally okay if you don\u2019t feel well sometimes. That\u2019s completely fine,\u201d Krappweis, Bernd's creator, said in a KiKA Q&A about Bernd's anniversary.",
      "Bernd is depressed for a multitude of reasons, including his failed attempt to be the mascot for a bakery's advertising campaign (that's how he ended up as a TV presenter, as a last resort).",
      "But it's in Episode 85 that we finally learn about Bernd's broken heart.",
      "\u201cA long, long time ago I fell in love with a beautiful, slim baguette. She was so incredibly charming and funny,\u201d Bernd tells Chili and Briegel. \u201cBut unfortunately it was in vain.",
      "\u201cShe only had eyes for this run-of-the-mill multigrain bread with its 10 types of grain. It was so depressing.\u201d",
      "Despite Bernd\u2019s best efforts \u2014 one of his catchphrases is \u201cI would like to leave this show\u201d \u2014 the episodes have never become stale. He sings, he dances, he\u2019s been to space. He's the star of merchandise, a video game and headlines like \u201cGive Us Our Daily Bernd.\u201d",
      "He was even kidnapped! In 2009, his 2-meter-tall (6.56 feet) statue was stolen from his traditional place outside the town hall in Erfurt, where KiKA is based.",
      "A claim of responsibility surfaced on YouTube, by sympathizers of a group of demonstrators who were protesting a company that had produced cremation ovens for the Nazi extermination camp Auschwitz. The demonstrators, however, denied involvement in Bernd\u2019s kidnapping and the video was removed from the internet.",
      "Bernd was held hostage for nearly two weeks before being discovered unharmed in an abandoned barracks.",
      "KiKA is honoring Bernd's 25th anniversary \u2014 despite his complaints \u2014 with new episodes, an update to his hit song and online activities for kids and adults alike. The celebrations begin now, as Bernd\u2019s birthday is Feb. 29.",
      "The latest series will premiere in September as Bernd, Chili and Briegel launch the social media channel \u201cBetter with Bernd\" in their efforts to make him into a bread influencer.",
      "The trio will present inventions to make school, and life, easier for viewers but naturally their concoctions backfire. Bernd instead becomes a defluencer \u2014 and an involuntary trendsetter.",

      "The musical is one of the most celebrated films of the year but has also been criticized for its depiction of Mexican culture and engulfed in controversy because of Gasc\u00f3n's previous social media posts disparaging Muslims, George Floyd and diversity at the Oscars.",
      "Although Gasc\u00f3n, who was nominated in the best actress category along with her co-star Zoe Salda\u00f1a, did not win a C\u00e9sar, the night in Paris was triumphal for \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d which swept seven trophies.",

      "Old posts from Gascon\u2018s X account resurfaced in January, some going as far back as 2016, that took aim at Muslims\u2019 dress, language and culture in her native Spain. She also suggested that Islam be banned.

      "The Metropolitan Opera is staging a production of Herman Melville's masterpiece about a white whale, \u2018Moby-Dick",
      "When Leonard Foglia was invited to direct an opera based on Herman Melville\u2019s masterpiece about a white whale, his first reaction was: \u201cMoby-Dick. That\u2019s great!\u201d",
      "\u201cThen I ran to a used bookstore and got the book,\u201d he recalled, \u201cand I thought: \u2018Oh my God, what am I in for here?\u2019 It\u2019s so daunting. I didn\u2019t panic, but I thought, \u2018How do we do this?\u2019\u201d",
      "How he and his collaborators did it will be on display at the Metropolitan Opera beginning March 3. The opera is composed by Jake Heggie to a libretto crafted by Gene Scheer.",
      "To begin with, Scheer had to whittle a novel of more than 600 pages down to a 64-page libretto. He kept as much of Melville\u2019s language as possible, and estimates that 40% to 50% of his libretto can be found in the original text, though he often tweaked the phrasing to make it more singable.",
      "Heggie and his initial partner, Terrence McNally (who withdrew for health reasons), had already decided to lop off the opening chapters, which take place on land. They set the entire opera aboard the whale-hunting ship Pequod.",
      "Another crucial change was renaming the narrator, calling him Greenhorn to reflect his status as a novice aboard the ship. Now the book\u2019s famous opening line, \u201cCall me Ishmael,\u201d is transposed to the very end of the opera when the character has matured.",
      "\u201cIn the novel, Ishmael is telling a story that happened many years ago,\u201d Scheer said. \u201cBut in the theater, you want to see it happen in real time. \u2026 We\u2019re watching him take in all the experiences so that when he says \u2018Call me Ishmael,\u2019 he\u2019s ready to write the book. In essence, this opera is the education of Ishmael.\u201d",
      "Tenor Stephen Costello, who is performing the role for the fifth time and is the lone cast holdover from the Dallas premiere in 2010, sees his character as \u201cthe only one who really has an arc.",
      "\u201cHe goes on the Pequod because there was nothing for him on land,\u201d Costello said. \u201cSo he\u2019s either going to die at sea or figure out who he is.\u201d",
      "In addition to Costello, the Met cast includes tenor Brandon Jovanovich as the vengeance-obsessed Captain Ahab. Pip, his cabin boy, is written as a \u201ctrousers role\u201d (a male character portrayed by a woman) and will be sung by soprano Janai Brugger. Starbuck, the first mate, will be baritone Peter Mattei, and bass-baritone Ryan Speedo Green will sing the part of Queequeg. Karen Kamensek conducts the eight performances through March 29.",
      "The opera, commissioned to celebrate the opening of a new opera house in Dallas, has been a success from the beginning, drawing praise from audiences and critics \u2014 and even scholars.",
      "Bob Wallace, a professor at Northern Kentucky University and past president of the Melville Society, admired the opera so much that he wrote a book about its creation.",
      "\u201cScheer and Heggie did a brilliant job of shrinking the novel to make it fit the stage and yet preserve so much of the essence of it,\u201d he said in an interview.",
      "As much as critics admired Scheer\u2019s adaptation and Heggie\u2019s tuneful, atmospheric and at times gripping score, they lavished special praise on the physical production, with sets by Robert Brill and projections by Elaine J. McCarthy.",
      "The action, Steve Smith wrote in The New York Times, \u201cplayed out against a multimedia-enriched staging that ranged from striking to near-miraculous.\u201d",
      "Perhaps the most stunning effect is the way animated projections superimposed on a climbing wall that is curved a bit like a skateboard ramp create the illusion of the crew leaving the Pequod to board three whaling boats.",
      "\u201cA lot of the excitement and thrill of watching this is due to the work of the production team,\u201d Scheer said. \u201cLenny kept saying to me, \u2019You imagine it the way you want it, and let me figure out how to do it.\u201d",
      "That often involved imposing unusual physical demands on the singers. For instance, when Pip gets lost at sea, his character sings the equivalent of an operatic mad scene dangling high above the stage, with projections making it appear he\u2019s treading water.",
      "\u201cI said to Janai when we first rehearsed it,\u201d Foglia recalled, \u201cOK, you can just get mad at me now, because you have to sing your hardest aria hanging from not even a full harness, just a single wire.\u201d",
      "In addition, Queequeg and Greenhorn climb up and down ladders to sing at the top of the mastheads. Ahab, who has lost a leg in a prior encounter with Moby-Dick, has to hobble on a wooden prosthesis. And Greenhorn \u2014 finally named Ishmael \u2014 ends the opera grabbing onto a whale hook from a passing ship that lifts him to safety.",
      "\u201cI joke with them that everything opera singers count on in life \u2014 having both feet planted on the ground \u2014 I\u2019ve taken away from them,\u201d Foglia said.",

But the team behind last year\u2019s show is \u201caiming for the stars\u201d once more.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re feeling the pressure,\u201d said Oscars executive producer and showrunner Raj Kapoor. \u201cBut we\u2019re not ones to rest on our laurels. We always want to push the envelope.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe want people when they watch the Oscars to be inspired by the films but also be inspired by the broadcast and feel something like it\u2019s a show that you can watch with your friends and your family and debate on who should have won and who is winning,\u201d Kapoor said. \u201cWe want people to have all the feels when they watch the show.\u201d",

O\u2019Brien, he said, has been a \u201cwealth of ideas and imagination\u201d since he accepted the gig and that he and his team are going to keep writing up until the show \u2014 and as a veteran of live television, he's skilled at in-the-moment improvisation as well.",
      "\u201cHe is going to be this great, exciting, warm hug and guide us through the night,\u201d said Oscars executive producer Katy Mullan. \u201cHe\u2019s got some surprises up his sleeve, which is fantastic because we love to keep people guessing.\u201d",
      "The Oscars this year decided to nix performances of the original songs, but there will still be some big names gracing the stage including \u201cWicked\u201d stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo \u2014 though they\u2019re staying mum on whether any gravity will be defied in that performance.",

      "Last year the Oscars made a moment out of what is usually just a list of names by inviting past Oscar acting winners to speak about each of the nominees before the winner was read. This year it's back, but evolved. It won\u2019t be the actors this time, but some of the other categories that \u201cmaybe don\u2019t normally get the spotlight on the Oscar stage,\u201d Mullan said.",
      "She added: \u201cOur theme is all about collaboration and the alchemy of filmmaking and really taking a look behind the scenes and understanding a bit more of the interconnectedness of how a film comes together.\u201d",
      "First, Mullan said, it\u2019s only Wednesday \u2014 there\u2019s still time to catch the diverse group of 10 best picture nominees before Sunday if you really try. But don\u2019t fret if you\u2019ve only seen a few. The show could be a discovery event.",
      "\u201cIf you love the movies, like come to the Oscars and maybe you\u2019ll discover things that you actually have not seen yet but will want to,\u201d Kapoor said. \u201cHopefully you\u2019ll fall in love even with a few pictures while watching the show.\u201d",

      "New York musician Larry Saltzman isn't really a movie fan, but he'll be sure to watch the Oscars this year",
      "NEW YORK -- He's not a movie buff, so New York musician Larry Saltzman doesn't always watch the Oscars. This year, however, he's got a rooting interest.",
      "Saltzman taught actor Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet how to play guitar for the role of Bob Dylan in \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d In turn, Chalamet earned a best actor nomination and the film is also up for best picture at the Academy Awards on Sunday.",
      "A guitarist who's performed with Simon & Garfunkel, Bette Midler and David Johansen, as well as in the pit at Broadway productions \u201cHairspray\u201d and \u201cAin't Too Proud to Beg,\u201d Saltzman has developed a specialty in teaching actors how to play music for their roles. Besides Chalamet, recent pupils have included Adam Driver and Sadie Sink of \u201cStranger Things.\u201d",
      "On a fellow musician's recommendation, Saltzman first got a call from a movie studio about a decade ago. He admits to being cranky as discussions dragged on. \u201cI almost did everything to talk them out of hiring me,\u201d he said.",
      "Not until the fifth phone call did the studio identify the client: Meryl Streep.",
      "She needed to learn the electric guitar for her starring role in the 2015 film \u201cRicki and the Flash,\u201d where she portrayed an aging rocker trying to keep her career and life together in the wake of a series of disappointments.",
      "Working with Streep is a little like a political consultant's first client being elected president. If she likes you and word gets around, other students will follow. Teaching actors now represents about 40% of his business, the 69-year-old said.",
      "\u201cMy time spent with her was excellent,\u201d he said of Streep. \u201cShe's smart. She knows how to learn things. There was a steady progress over three or four months. She did very well.\u201d",
      "Faking it just won't do for serious actors and film directors. It's like lip-syncing \u2014 the audience is going to tell the difference, and the characters will be less believable. That was especially true with Chalamet, who needed to sing and play at the same time for a character whose artistry is the centerpiece of the film.",
      "\u201cWhen the actors come to you, they're kind of vulnerable,\u201d Saltzman said. \u201cThey want to do a great job.\u201d",
      "Saltzman had more than 50 sessions with Chalamet, starting in person and retreating to Zoom during the pandemic. It wasn't easy. Chalamet had to learn some 25 songs in the script.",
      "\u201cSometime in 2018 I had my first lesson with this great guitar teacher named Larry Saltzman who at some point became less of a teacher and more a co-sanity artist through COVID,\u201d Chalamet recalled during a recent interview with The Associated Press. \u201cI think we were keeping each other sane. We would Zoom three, four times a week and doing songs that never made it into the movie.\u201d",
      "It helped that Saltzman is a Dylan buff. Focusing on imparting \u201cthe guitar playing of \u2018pre-electric Bob,\u2019\u201d he taught his charge so well that Chalamet was a musical guest as well as host on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d performing obscure Dylan cuts last month. Saltzman says, in the course of their sessions, Chalamet \u201cwent the extra mile\u201d and unearthed \u201cvery early, obscure\u201d Dylan songs that weren't even in the script.",
      "Saltzman generally likes teaching actors more than common folk, in part because there's a specific goal: They need to learn certain songs to inhabit a particular character. When it's open-ended \u2014 someone just wants to learn the guitar \u2014 it can be more of a challenge, he said. Saltzman also believes that it's an advantage to not be a regular teacher, someone who may approach clients with a more rigid style.",
      "Actor Johnny Cannizzaro said he appreciated Saltzman's calming \u201cbedside manner\u201d and felt welcome in an apartment filled with guitars. Cannizzaro has the role of E Street Band member \u201cLittle Steven\u201d Van Zandt in the upcoming Bruce Springsteen biopic, \u201cDeliver Me From Nowhere.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere was never really a moment where he expressed any sort of frustration or impatience with me during a session,\u201d said Cannizzaro, who has background playing keyboards but not guitar. \u201cIf anything, he would express some excitement when you grasped something he was teaching. That put me at ease.\u201d",
      "Saltzman also studied film of Van Zandt so he wasn't just teaching Cannizzaro guitar \u2014 he was showing specifics of how Van Zandt plays, the actor said.",
      "Beyond teaching, Saltzman's time is divided between studio work, playing in New York clubs accompanying different artists and Broadway \u2014 he's just about to begin \u201cSmash.\u201d",
      "It's an eye-opening experience for him to later see his students on screen. That was particularly the case when he saw \u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d and marveled at Chalamet's ability as an actor.",
      "All the more reason to watch the Oscars, and to take some pride in his own work.",
      "\u201cIn my own humble way, I'm a small gear in that machinery,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is rewarding is knowing that in some small way I'm contributing to making a better film.\u201d",

      "A new album documents jazz legend Ella Fitzgerald in concert in Oakland, California, in 1967",
      "The setting is less grand than suggested by the title of a new Ella Fitzgerald album, \u201cThe Moment of Truth: Ella at the Coliseum.\u201d In this case, the coliseum is not in Rome or Los Angeles, but the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Arena in Oakland, California.",
      "Jazz giant Fitzgerald\u2019s presence elevated any event, however, and that was the case on June 30, 1967, when she performed at a concert that also included The Duke Ellington Orchestra and other luminaries.",
      "\u201cThe Moment of Truth\u201d documents Fitzgerald\u2019s set, and her incomparable alto is in typically fine form. She bounces and glides, blares and coos, bellows and whoops and scats and swings to the audience\u2019s delight. \u201cIf you love her, clap!\u201d someone shouts.",
      "The album, which will be released Friday, features performances of nine songs unearthed from the private tape collection of Verve Records founder Norman Granz. The vinyl release offers outstanding sound quality and extensive, informative liner notes by the critic Will Friedwald. He notes that while it was unusual for Fitzgerald to sing contemporary pop tunes, the set includes her only known performance of two classics from the mid-1960s \u2014 the Burt Bacharach and Hal David penned \"Alfie\u201d and Bob Crewe's \u201cMusic to Watch Girls By.\u201d",
      "Fitzgerald is accompanied by a piano trio, and on several songs by the Ellington orchestra, with whom she had a lengthy 1960s collaboration. Ellington doesn\u2019t play, however, and the understated arrangements leave the spotlight entirely to Fitzgerald. She\u2019s in a playful mood in her on stage banter, teasing a late arrival, impersonating Louis Armstrong, and ruling out a striptease.",
      "Her singing is radiant as she turns sophisticated melodies into a thrill ride. Their direction is as unpredictable as a pinball, with rhythmic daring and inventiveness that could make an arena sway. And it probably did.",
      "Fitzgerald flies high on \u201cMack the Knife,\u201d and displays jazzy verve on Benny Goodman\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Be That Way\u201d and the Tony Bennett staple \u201cThe Moment of Truth,\u201d while \u201cYou\u2019ve Changed\u201d shimmers with bluesy beauty. On \u201cLet\u2019s Do It (Let\u2019s Fall in Love),\u201d her phrasing is as clever as Cole Porter\u2019s lyrics. In her version, she injects references to the Beatles,James Bond, Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor.",
      "As Friedwald notes, Fitzgerald rarely drew from the Burt Bacharach-Hal David catalogue. But her interpretation of their classic ballad \u201cAlfie\u201d is a marvel of technique, emotional investment and creativity, including a brief digression. Fitzgerald navigates the complicated melody and rhythm with ease. It's an exemplar of the album, because as always, in keeping with the advice of the lyrics, her heart leads the way.",

      "Paiva, a popular author in Brazil for four decades, has had intense days and exchanges since the movie based on his 2015 book \u201cI'm Still Here\u201d became a box-office success. The film, a rare blockbuster in the South American nation, garnered three Oscar nominations ahead of the awards ceremony Sunday.",
      "While millions of Brazilians love the story for its long-overdue truth-telling about the country\u2019s 1964-1985 military dictatorship, others see it as left-wing propaganda. Paiva has been dismayed at the outpouring of hatred, mostly online, directed at him.",
      "\u201cIt is simply (our) history being told in the way we believe it must be told, the way our family lived it, so it never happens again,\u201d Paiva, 65, told The Associated Press in his Sao Paulo apartment. \u201cI assure you that some of those on the far-right or on the right have watched it and maybe changed their opinion.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d is up for best picture and best international feature, while Fernanda Torres, who portrayed Paiva's mother Eunice, is competing for best actress. The film centers on the disappearance of Rubens Paiva, the author's father, and Eunice's decadeslong quest to force authorities to confirm his death.",
      "Paiva, one of five siblings, has known success, but not as much controversy. His 1982 book \u201cHappy Old Year\u201d narrating his life before and after a diving accident put him in a wheelchair, sold more than 1.5 million copies. He is also an award-winning playwright, former TV talk show host and political activist.",
      "But he says nothing prepared him for the sudden impact \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d had since it won best screenplay at the Venice Film Festival. Many other awards followed since.",
      "\u201cThis is very different; it is more intense because of social networks,\" Paiva said. \u201cPeople (around the world) react in the same way to this movie, with the same emotion that Brazilians felt.\u201d",
      "After his book about his accident, he knew he still had another important story to tell.",
      "\u201cI was the son of a disappeared politician; few people knew what had happened during the dictatorship,\u201d he said.",
      "That was largely because Congress passed an amnesty law in 1979, as the dictatorship neared its end, sparing perpetrators of political crimes from prosecution.",
      "Cracks started to emerge in 2011 after then President Dilma Rousseff \u2014 a former guerrilla who was tortured during the dictatorship \u2014 established a national truth commission to investigate its abuses. It was one of the seeds for Paiva's book and, later, the film.",
      "\u201cPeople were asking for reparations for families of missing politicians, they sued my father\u2019s torturers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe military showed they were upset, because their colleagues and their fellow coup mongers were under fire. The accusations were being published, so they started to threaten Brazil\u2019s democracy. And little by little it was once again in doubt.\u201d",
      "Past ire toward the Paiva family has notably come from one man: Jair Bolsonaro, the former army captain who rode a wave of anti-establishment populism to his presidency (2019-2022).",
      "In 2014, then-lawmaker Bolsonaro spat on a statue of the late Paiva in Congress, accusing him and his family of being at the service of communist terrorists. His claims date to the 1990s and falsely link a farm the Paiva family owned, near where Bolsonaro grew up, to a guerrilla group.",
      "\u201cEvery year, he made a speech against my father, making up stories,\u201d Paiva said. \u201cOnce, he said my father had been killed by his comrades who were in the armed struggle, because he had revealed things during the torture sessions. It was the first time I heard anyone tell such an absurd story, with no evidence, and people believed it. It was the first time I saw the power of social media in creating a new narrative, a lie.\"",
      "Bolsonaro said in an interview Monday he hasn't seen the film, but his allies have railed against it, saying Paiva died in a war, as did many on both sides. Brazil\u2019s Truth Commission found that at least 434 people died at the hands of the military regime, including 136 who disappeared.",
      "Paiva published \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d as Alzheimer\u2019s disease washed away his mother\u2019s memory. Director Walter Salles bought the rights in 2017, but chose not to make the film during Bolsonaro's presidency. Last week, Brazil's prosecutor-general indicted Bolsonaro for allegedly staging a coup to remain in power. It included inciting a riot in capital Brasilia by encouraging his supporters to riot marking an echo of the Capitol insurrection in the U.S.",
      "\u201cPeople everywhere are afraid of watching their democracies become dictatorships,\" Paiva said. \"This movie glorifies democracy and the understanding that human rights, empathy are in short supply.\u201d",
      "Adding to Paiva's recent achievements since the film premiered, his father\u2019s death certificate, first obtained by his mother in 1996, was updated in January to go beyond mere confirmation to include: \u201cviolent death caused by the Brazilian State in the context of systematic persecution to the population identified as dissidents of the policies of the dictatorial regime installed in 1964.\u201d",
      "Brazil's Supreme Court said earlier this week it will rule whether the sole survivor among Rubens Paiva\u2019s torturers, Gen. Jos\u00e9 Ant\u00f4nio Nogueira Belham, can be tried. Brazilian human rights activists have argued that concealing bodies is a continuous crime not covered by the country\u2019s amnesty law.",
      "\u201cI see literature as a mission, and I feel mine was accomplished,\" said Paiva. \u201cThe movie\u2019s mission is accomplished, even if it doesn\u2019t win any Oscars.\u201d",

      "With contributions from artists including Kate Bush, Annie Lennox, Cat Stevens and Damon Albarn, the album was released Tuesday to protest proposed British changes to artificial intelligence laws that artists fear will erode their creative control.",
      "The U.K. government is consulting on whether to let tech firms use copyrighted material to help train AI models unless the creators explicitly opt out.",
      "Critics of the idea fear that will make it harder for artists to retain control of their work and will undermine Britain\u2019s creative industries. Elton John and Paul McCartney are among those who have spoken out against the plan.",
      "The protest album features recordings of empty studios and performance spaces, to show what they fear will be the fate of creative venues if the plan goes through. The titles of the 12 tracks spell out: \u201cThe British government must not legalize music theft to benefit AI companies.\u201d",
      "Profits will be donated to the musicians\u2019 charity Help Musicians.",
      "\u201cThe government\u2019s proposal would hand the life\u2019s work of the country\u2019s musicians to AI companies, for free, letting those companies exploit musicians\u2019 work to outcompete them,\u201d said composer and AI developer Ed Newton-Rex, who organized the album.",
      "\u201cIt is a plan that would not only be disastrous for musicians, but that is totally unnecessary,\u201d Newton-Rex said. \u201cThe U.K. can be leaders in AI without throwing our world-leading creative industries under the bus.\u201d",
      "Britain\u2019s center-left Labour Party government says it wants to make the U.K. a world leader in AI.

      "A routine deep-sea diving mission in the North Sea goes terribly wrong when a young diver is stranded some 300 feet below the surface in the new film \u201cLast Breath.\u201d His umbilical cable has severed. The support vessel above is aimlessly drifting away from the site through violent, stormy waters. And the diver has only ten minutes of oxygen in his backup tank.",
      "As if that wasn\u2019t enough, it\u2019s also a true story.",
      "If merely reading this is giving you heart palpitations already, you can only imagine the white-knuckle experience of watching this all play out on the big screen. It\u2019s 40ish minutes of pure suspense and anxiety as the story shuffles between the man at the bottom of the ocean, Chris Lemons (Finn Cole), his fellow saturation divers (Woody Harrelson as Duncan and Simu Liu as Dave) in the diving bell below the waters who are unable to help and the crew in the support vessel above (including Cliff Curtis and Mark Bonnar) scrambling to get their systems back online and operational as the clock rapidly runs out. Ten minutes has never felt so short \u2014 and then it just gets worse as the clock starts counting up, showing Chris\u2019s time without oxygen.",
      "At one point, Liu\u2019s character Dave, a no-nonsense, all-business diver says matter-of-factly at that it\u2019s a body recovery, not a rescue. Deep-sea saturation diving is a dangerous business, described at the start of the film as the most dangerous job on earth. Chris tells his fianc\u00e9, in a short introduction, that it\u2019s no more dangerous than going to space. She replies that it\u2019s funny that he thinks that is comforting.",
      "The real incident happened in September 2012 \u2014 Dave, Duncan and Chris were just one team of divers sent to the ocean floor off the coast of Aberdeen, Scotland, to repair oil pipeline.",
      "The seas were particularly rough that day, with winds up to 35 knots, common for the North Sea but also not what one might call safe. Chris and Dave were in the middle of their work when they heard the urgent calls to abort: The dynamic positioning system in the support vessel above had failed and they were in drift. Chris scrambled to maneuver out of the pipeline corridors, but his umbilical got caught. For a brief, awful moment he\u2019s the anchor to the ship above, but soon enough the cord snapped, and he was thrown back to the ocean floor in pitch black with no coms, no heat and very little hope for survival. News articles about the incident clock his backup oxygen supply as being closer to five or six minutes \u2013 perhaps the movie wanted to give the audience a little buffer.",
      "If this sounds at all familiar, it may be because it was made into a documentary, also called \u201cLast Breath\u201d and released in 2019. While it was well-received, some true stories are just too gripping to exist solely in that form. It\u2019s not exactly a surprise that a narrative film was made as well. There\u2019s a good track record of recent complimentary adaptations \u2014 think Ron Howard\u2019s \u201c13 Lives\u201d and \u201cThe Rescue\u201d about the Thai boys soccer team stuck in the cave.",
      "This one was made by Alex Parkinson, the same director who co-directed the doc, and it\u2019s a well-executed narrative interpretation that doesn\u2019t get in its own way with padding. Harrelson gets to be the wise mentor who really doesn\u2019t want to lose someone on his last mission. Liu gets to flex his action muscles (literally and figuratively) in a modest but solid role. And they don't go out of their way to shoehorn in a villain \u2014 this is just a group of people trying their best to save a life.",
      "The only real problem, if one can even call it that, is that it\u2019s so short. The film doesn\u2019t take liberties with stretching out the timeline much at all and after 93 minutes, the whole thing is over. It feels strange to want a movie to be longer, but in the case of \u201cLast Breath\u201d I was both desperate for it to end, for anxiety reasons, and also wanting more.",
      "\u201cLast Breath,\u201d a Focus Features release in theaters Friday, is rated PG-13 Motion Picture Association for \u201cbrief strong language.\u201d Running time: 93 minutes. Three stars out of four."

      "LOS ANGELES -- Often when Robert Pattinson gets a script, one of the first things he does \u2014 to the annoyance of his girlfriend, Suki Waterhouse \u2014 is try on different voices to bring his character to life.",
      "\"I\u2019ve always had that sort of response to a script,\u201d he reflected, but said it became a practice while making his 2014 film, \u201cThe Rover.\u201d \u201cI think I feel very uncomfortable just doing something in my own accent. And for a while I felt like just doing an American accent felt like I was acting more.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s unsurprising, then, that when he was offered a starring role in \u201cMickey 17\u201d \u2014 director Bong Joon Ho\u2019s first feature film since his Oscar-winning \u201cParasite\u201d \u2014 Pattinson\u2019s wheels immediately began turning over what his character(s) would sound like.",
      "\u201cMickey 17,\u201d a Warner Bros. release hitting theaters March 7, tells the story of Mickey Barnes, a naive but sympathetic protagonist who signs up to be an \u201cexpendable\u201d in a world that makes use of \u201chuman printing\u201d for dangerous tasks and research. When an expendable dies on the job, another version of them is printed with their consciousness and memories of their death intact.",
      "But Mickey\u2019s immortality is threatened when a very different version of him is printed while the 17th Mickey is mistakenly believed to be dead.",
      "\u201cI needed to find an actor who could cover both personalities,\u201d Bong said through a translator, recalling Pattinson\u2019s performances in \u201cThe Lighthouse\u201d and \u201cGood Time\u201d as he considered the more sinister and conniving Mickey 18.",
      "The film is based on Edward Ashton's 2022 novel, \u201cMickey7.\u201d But Pattinson, who read the book before he got the script, said he still can\u2019t believe how different they are from one another. \u201cWhen I read the script and Bong\u2019s changes to it, I was like, \u2018How did you see this tone in this book at all?\u2019 It\u2019s very, very different tonally. But I thought it\u2019s fascinating to have that interpretation,\u201d he said.",
      "Although Pattinson was eager to work with the acclaimed Korean filmmaker, he wasn\u2019t given a lot of initial information about the movie or role. \u201cThe only thing I knew was that it was in English and that the part was impossible,\u201d Pattinson said, laughing.",
      "As he eventually gleaned more about the story and his character, ideas for Mickey \u2014 and Mickey\u2019s voices \u2014 began swirling around in his head.",
      "Pattinson envisioned slapstick montages of his myriad deaths \u00e0 la \u201cThe Tom and Jerry Show\u201d \u2014 but that portion of the film turned out to be much darker than he expected. One early idea for voices that Bong shut down was inspired by Steve-O and Johnny Knoxville \u2014 Pattinson was a devout \u201cJackass\u201d fan growing up and even repped a \u201cJackass\u201d T-shirt to school \u201calmost every day.\u201d",
      "But one initial idea the 38-year-old had did stick. \u201cMy first thought, on pretty much the first read of it, was, \u2018It\u2019s like Ren and Stimpy,\u2019\u201d he said of the irreverent animated Nickelodeon series from the 90's about a cat and dog.",
      "The dynamic between the two Mickeys is an apt comparison given Ren\u2019s short temper and diabolical nature (Mickey 18), which stands in stark contrast to Stimpy\u2019s naivete (Mickey 17). The similarities in their voices can also be heard.",
      "\u201cI kind of wanted to do this like cartoon character performance. You start out really, really extreme and then kind of gradually tone it down,\" he said of how he refined the characters. \u201cWhen directors just let you do stuff, you just come out of the box doing whatever and wherever your instinct is taking you.\"",
      "In addition to Pattison, the sci-fi comedy boasts an impressive cast, including Mark Ruffalo,Steven Yeun,Toni Collette and Naomi Ackie. Although Ackie, who plays Mickey\u2019s romantic partner in the film, hadn\u2019t worked with Pattinson before, she said they quickly hit it off.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re both quite similar in how we work, which is very chatty up until the point of \u2018Action,\u2019 and then we do the acting. And I really enjoy that kind of separation between character and self. I find it quite difficult to hold onto characters once there\u2019s no cameras on,\u201d she said.",
      "But it wasn\u2019t just Pattinson who made the experience a positive one for her. \u201cI\u2019m pretty certain you could ask anyone who works with Bong Joon Ho, \u2018Would you go back?\u2019 And they\u2019d be like, \u2018I\u2019d pay money.\u2019\u201d",

It was actually very mentally and physically exhausting because the campaign is so long and I just remember thinking, \u2018Wow, this is really tough,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe kept just like handing each other vitamins.\u201d"

      "And one-third of the population is covered by Medicaid in GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski's Alaska, one of the nation\u2019s costliest corners for health care.",
      "Each of these Republicans \u2014 and some of their conservative colleagues \u2014 lined up last week to defend Medicaid, in a departure from long-held GOP policies. Republicans, who already have ruled out massive cuts to Social Security and Medicare, are turning their attention to siphoning as much as $880 billion from Medicaid over the next decade to help finance $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.",
      "But as a deadline to avoid a partial government shutdown nears, hesitation is surfacing among Washington's Republican lawmakers \u2014 once reliable critics of lofty government social welfare programs such as Medicaid \u2014 who say that deep cuts to the health care program could prove too untenable for people back home.",
      "\u201cI've heard from countless constituents who tell me the only way they can afford health care is through programs like Medicaid,\u201d Valadao said on the House floor. \u201cAnd I will not support a final reconciliation bill that risks leaving them behind.\u201d",
      "And on Wednesday, President Donald Trump, too, made his position on Medicaid clear: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to touch it.\u201d",
      "States and the federal government jointly pay for Medicaid, which offers nearly-free health care coverage for roughly 80 million poor and disabled Americans, including millions of children. It cost $880 billion to operate in 2023.",
      "Johnson has ruled out two of the biggest potential cuts: paying fixed, shrunken rates to states for care and changing the calculation for the share of federal dollars that each state receives for Medicaid. Just a few years ago, Johnson spearheaded a report that lobbied for some of those changes during the first Trump administration.",
      "Johnson insisted in a CNN interview that the focus will instead be ferreting out \u201cfraud, waste and abuse, in Medicaid, although it's unlikely to deliver the savings Republicans seek.",
      "GOP pressure over Medicaid is mounting, with some state party leaders joining the calls to preserve the program. States are already struggling with the growing cost of sicker patients and could be left to cover more if the federal government pulls back. In some states, the federal government picks up over 80%.",
      "More than a dozen Minnesota GOP lawmakers wrote the president recently warning that \u201ctoo deep of a cut is unmanageable in any instance.\u201d Gov. Joe Lombardo, R-Nev., told Congress in a letter that \u201cproposed reductions would put lives at risk.\" In Alaska, state Senate Majority Leader Cathy Giessel, a Republican and nurse, cited \u201chuge concerns\u201d during a floor speech.",
      "Nationally, 55% of Americans said the government spends too little on Medicaid, according to a January poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s now a very popular program that touches a very broad cross-section of American society,\u201d said Drew Altman, president of the health care research firm KFF. \u201cRoughly half of the American people say that they or a family member have at one time been served by the program.\u201d",
      "Significant changes to Medicaid are still on the table. They have to be for Republicans get the savings they need to pay for tax cuts.",
      "Work requirements, which could save as much as $109 billion over the next decade, seem to have solid support among GOP members, with some individual Republican-led states already moving to implement them.",
      "Republicans also could consider cuts in benefits or coverage, as well as eliminating a provider tax that states use to finance Medicaid, Altman added.",
      "Democrats warn that reductions are inevitable and could be dire.",
      "Starting Monday, TV ads will caution people across 20 congressional districts that hospitals are at risk of closing and millions of people could lose coverage if Republicans cut Medicaid \"to fund massive tax cuts for Elon Musk and billionaires.\u201d The Democratic super political action committee House Majority Forward has launched the seven-figure campaign.",
      "Trump and Republicans have for years called to lower government spending on health care, but they have struggled to formulate a serious plan that gains traction. Trump, for example, has spent nearly a decade arguing for an overhaul of the Affordable Care Act. His efforts to repeal the Obama-era national health care law failed during his first term and in his most recent presidential campaign he offered only \u201cconcepts of a plan\u201d to adapt the program.",
      "Michael Cannon, a director of health studies at libertarian Cato Institute, believes Medicaid needs an overhaul because it is a significant part of the federal budget and a contributor to the nation's growing debt.",

      "Data from large-scale population studies showed that eating a lot of saturated fat and simple carbohydrates made it harder to get deep, restorative sleep, she said. The inverse was also true. People who don\u2019t get enough sleep, for example, were more likely to be obese.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a cycle of having poor sleep leading to poor dietary choices, and lower dietary quality that further propels poor sleep,\u201d St-Onge said.",
      "If bad food could keep you awake, she wondered, can good food help you sleep? Her research led to a new cookbook, \u201cEat Better, Sleep Better,\u201d co-written with Kat Craddock, editor-in-chief of the food magazine Saveur.",
      "St-Onge said the answer is yes. The book's recipes reflect her findings that people with high-fiber diets report better sleep, and the dishes rely heavily on what she called sleep-supporting ingredients.",
      "Nuts, seeds and whole grains such as barley, buckwheat and kasha contain melatonin, a compound the body also produces naturally to regulate the circadian rhythm. Research suggests the anti-inflammatory properties of ginger and turmeric improve sleep quality, as do the phytochemicals in brightly colored fruits and vegetables like squash, cherries, bananas and beefsteak tomatoes, St-Onge said.",
      "Besides the properties of particular ingredients, the combination of certain foods is key to encouraging your body to produce the hormones it needs to fall and stay sleep, she said. Tryptophan, for example, is an essential amino acid only found in food, but it requires nutrients such as magnesium, zinc and B vitamins to be converted into melatonin and serotonin.",
      "St-Onge noted that people shouldn\u2019t expect to fall dead asleep after loading up on certain ingredients at dinner. Food has to be processed, with chemical reactions transforming nutrients over time before they are absorbed.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s making sure you have a healthy diet across the day to have the nutrients at the ready,\u201d she said.",
      "Recipes were developed for every meal of the day, plus snacks and desserts, the authors said. The two then arranged them into a 28-day meal plan designed to improve your sleep.",
      "Craddock said developing the recipes came naturally because the research stressed using a variety of foods she likes to cook with anyway. The challenge was making sure the recipes fell within the nutritional requirements.",
      "\u201cMy instincts are to go hard on bacon and butter and cheese and heavy cream, and she pared a lot of that back,\u201d Craddock said.",
      "Instead of bacon, Craddock said, she could achieve similar flavors with a little olive oil and smoked paprika. \u201cIt was a bit of a dance back and forth between my more restaurant approach to making foods delicious and her nutritional goals.\u201d",
      "A Creole gumbo recipe, for instance, is inspired more by a vegetarian version often served during Lent than the heavier traditional one. The andouille often used \u2014 a pork product high in saturated fat \u2014 is swapped out for healthier chicken sausage. Adding more than a pound of mixed greens makes it more like a vegetable stew, and brown rice adds a complex carbohydrate.",
      "With numerous charts and scientific research, the book is a practical guide to improving your diet in general. But Craddock said it also introduces people to international ingredients and dishes so they might think beyond what they eat every day.",
      "\u201cIf you dig a little deeper and look a little further, there are healthful and flavorful and exciting ingredients from many cultures that are right in our own backyard,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Forest Service has terminated $75 million awarded to the Arbor Day Foundation to help disadvantaged communities plant trees",
      "Arthur Johnson has lived in New Orleans' Lower 9th Ward for nearly three decades, long enough to appreciate the trees that filter pollution from the big ships traveling the nearby Mississippi River and that offer shade on sweltering summer days.",
      "When Hurricane Katrina roared through two decades ago, it wiped out 200,000 trees across the city, including many in Johnson's neighborhood and several in his own yard. The city has struggled ever since to restore its tree canopy.",
      "Those efforts will be set back by the U.S. Forest Service's decision in mid-February to terminate a $75 million grant to the Arbor Day Foundation, which was working to plant trees in neighborhoods that might not otherwise be able to afford them. The program is the latest victim of a drive by President Donald Trump's administration against environmental justice initiatives.",
      "In New Orleans, part of the money was going to the environmental group Sustaining Our Urban Landscape (SOUL), which has planted more than 1,600 trees in the historically Black community but has now paused plans for another 900.",
      "Those are trees that largely low-income residents otherwise couldn\u2019t afford to plant or maintain, said the 71-year-old Johnson, who runs a local nonprofit, the Lower 9th Ward Center for Sustainable Engagement and Development, that has helped SOUL with its work and done some tree plantings of its own in the area.",
      "\u201cYou're not just cutting out the tree, the environment\u201d with such cuts, said Johnson. If those trees aren\u2019t replaced and more aren\u2019t continually added, \u201cit really takes a toll on the sustainability of the Lower 9th Ward and its community.\u201d",
      "The benefits of trees are vast. They capture stormwater and replenish groundwater. They help clean the air in polluted areas, improve mental health, and cool air and surfaces of the built environment, especially during heat waves that are growing more intense and frequent with climate change.",
      "One study by the UCLA Luskin Center found that shade can reduce heat stress on the human body from 25% to 35% throughout the day. And much research shows that low-income and communities of color have fewer trees \u2014 and are hotter \u2014 than better-off neighborhoods.",
      "The Arbor Day Fund's grant was part of former President Joe Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, which sent $1.5 billion to the forest service\u2019s Urban and Community Forestry program. In a Feb. 14 email canceling the grant, the Forest Service wrote that the award \"no longer effectuates agency priorities regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and activities.\u201d",
      "But Dan Lambe, the Arbor Day Foundation's chief executive, said the projects weren't just going to serve disadvantaged people. They were going to benefit every member of the community, he said. In total, 105 nonprofits, municipalities and Indigenous organizations \u2014 from Alaska to Florida to Maine \u2014 have lost funding for critical environmental projects, the foundation said.",
      "\u201cThis was an opportunity to make a really meaningful impact on people\u2019s lives, so it\u2019s been disappointing,\" Lambe said.",
      "The Forest Service didn't say if other recipients of the $1.5 billion forestry investment also had grants terminated. In a statement, its parent agency, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said the agency was following directions to comply with Trump's executive orders.",
      "\u201cProtecting the people and communities we serve, as well as the infrastructure, businesses, and resources they depend on to grow and thrive, remains a top priority for the USDA and the Forest Service,\u201d the agency said.",
      "For SOUL in New Orleans, losing the grant means they don't have the money to water trees already planted, and they've had to drop plans to hire three people. Another $2.5 million grant is on hold due to the federal funding freeze, and founder and executive director Susannah Burley said the nonprofit's survival is uncertain. Its annual budget is a little more than $1 million.",
      "\u201cWe kind of are lost because we don\u2019t know if we should be planning to close our doors or if we should be planning for next season,\u201d she said.",
      "For others who were set to get Arbor Day Foundation money, the loss is not existential but still devastating. In the city-county of Butte-Silver Bow in southwest Montana, forester Trevor Peterson was going to use a $745,250 grant to buy chain saws, rigging gear and other essential tools, remove up to 200 dead or dying cottonwoods and plant as many as 1,000 trees as part of a decades-long effort to replenish trees cut to make way for copper mining. He wanted to help organize large community events focused on education, hoping to impart the knowledge necessary for future stewardship of the urban forest.",
      "\u201cWe will now have to go back to the drawing board to determine where to go from here,\u201d he said.",
      "Jackson County, Oregon, was awarded a $600,000 grant to replant trees after wildfires in 2020 destroyed thousands of homes and charred more than 60,000 trees. The town of Talent lost two-thirds of its trees.",
      "The nonprofit Oregon Urban Rural and Community Forestry, founded in the fires' aftermath, fought for years to get a single dollar, recalled Mike Oxendine, the group's founder and director.",
      "The grant money from the Arbor Day Foundation was being used to help low-income and disadvantaged mobile home park residents \u2014 among the hardest-hit by the fires \u2014 identify and remove hazardous trees badly burned or killed, and replant trees for shade and cooling.",
      "\u201cThis is a rural red area that needs it badly,\u201d said Oxendine. \u201cWe hit temperatures that exceed 110 degrees every summer now. We go through massive droughts and we\u2019re always prone to wildfire here.\u201d",
      "The loss of funding will create a \u201ctremendous burden\u201d for the organization, he said.",

      "Escorted by police, polio teams go door-to-door to administer the oral vaccine, though they are often attacked by militants who falsely claim that vaccination efforts are part of a Western plot to sterilize Muslim children.

      "Nurse Tosha Trostle wrote that she had begged the attacker to let her go and that he pushed the gun against her neck and spine. When they encountered police, she prayed as she heard gunshots and smelled smoke, then heard bullet casings hitting the floor, she wrote.",

      "Authorities say Diogenes Archangel-Ortiz, 49, brought a gun and zip ties to UPMC Memorial Hospital in York on Saturday morning and was holding hostages when responding officers fatally shot him.",
      "West York Patrolman Andrew Duarte, 30, was shot and killed. Two other officers and three hospital employees were wounded, authorities said.",
      "Trostle recounted that she had been drawing blood when she heard a commotion and went into a hallway.",
      "\u201cAfter all I thought I was responding to a staff assist, patient fall, one in a dozen possible occurrences; not an active shooter. When I rounded the corner of the back hall I was met in the distance by the shooter holding my coworker, Jess, at gunpoint,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Her colleague, Jessica Breighner, was forced to zip-tie her.",
      "\u201cI saw the fear in her eyes, fear does not sound like enough really though,\u201d Trostle wrote.",

      "\u201cSo many things happened I cannot recount step by step,\" she wrote, \"but how I remember those red sneakers.\"",
      "Jason Huff, Breighner\u2019s partner of more than 20 years, also described the incident in a separate Facebook post on Wednesday that said the attacker had pulled the trigger three times with the gun against Breighner\u2019s head, but it was apparently out of ammunition.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s when she knew it was time to take her shot,\u201d Huff wrote. \u201cShe broke her zip ties while he reloaded and ran -- thank God.\u201d",

      "York County District Attorney Tim Barker said Saturday that Archangel-Ortiz appeared to have had recent contact with the intensive care unit \u201cfor a medical purpose involving another person\u201d but declined to elaborate.",
      "Asked about the nurses\u2019 accounts, a UPMC spokesperson said the health system prioritizes safety and privacy but referred questions to law enforcement.",

      "\u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe,\u201d starring Natalie Morales and Sonequa Martin-Green, confronts a dark reality of post-combat struggle with as much humor and playfulness as it does trauma and sorrow",
      "Even for a film titled \u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe,\u201d the opening scenes of Kyle Hausmann-Stoke\u2019s movie have a startling rhythm.",
      "First, two female American soldiers are riding in a Humvee in Afghanistan 2016 blasting Rihanna\u2019s \u201cUmbrella.\u201d They are clearly friends, and more concerned with the music coming through loudly than enemy fire. Merit (Natalie Morales) tells Zoe (Sonequa Martin-Green) that they ever set foot in \u201csome dopy group therapy,\" to please kill her.",
      "Cut to years later, they\u2019re sitting in a counseling meeting for veterans and Morales\u2019 character has a sour look at her face. She turns to her friend: \u201cDid we survive the dumbest war of all time just to sit here all broken and kumbaya and ouchie-my-feelings?\u201d",
      "But after this rush of cavalier soldiering and bitter sarcasm comes a sobering moment. Merit blinks her eyes and is instead staring at an empty chair. Zoe isn\u2019t there at all.",
      "\u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe,\u201d co-starring Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris, confronts a dark reality of post-combat struggle with as much humor and playfulness as it does trauma and sorrow. It comes from a real place, and you can tell. Hausmann-Stoke is himself a veteran and \u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe\u201d is dedicated to a pair of his platoon mates who committed suicide. The opening titles note the film was \u201cinspired by a true story.\u201d",
      "Audience disinterest has characterized many, though not all, of the films about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and the output has pretty much dried up over the years. \u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe\u201d feels like it was made with an awareness of that trend and as a rebuke to it.",
      "This is an often breezy and funny movie for what, on paper, is a difficult and dark story. But the comic tone of \u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe\u201d is, itself, a spirited rejection to not just the heaviness of many films about veterans but of the grief that can consume those who have dealt with loss and post-traumatic stress disorder.",
      "Throughout the film, Zoe appears only to Merit, ala Brad Pitt in \u201cFight Club,\u201d singing alongside her as she drives or impatiently waiting for Merit to come home from a run. Whether this, following some unspecified end to Zoe, is a healthy thing or not for Merit is increasingly in doubt. Merit needs to cling to her friend, or her memory of her. But Zoe also rolls her eyes at any suggestion of talking through her feelings. Zoe, as an apparition, is both the cause and relief to her pain.",
      "There are a few other points of view, courtesy of two of our finest actors. Freeman plays the counselor of Merit\u2019s mandatory group sessions. He refuses to let Zoe coast. To pressure her to share and participate, he threatens withholding Zoe's certification.",
      "Meanwhile, Merit\u2019s grandfather, Dale (Harris), a Vietnam vet, has just been diagnosed with early Alzheimer\u2019s. Merit is tasked with keeping an eye on him at his rural lakeside cabin and helping him into a retirement community \u2014 a prospect that infuriates him. As Merit\u2019s original inspiration for joining the army, Dale \u2014 stubborn and tight-lipped \u2014 epitomizes an earlier generation of soldier.",
      "In toggling between the present and wartime flashbacks, \u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe\u201d is sometimes a bumpy ride. The interplay between Merit and Zoe also shifts, beginning more like a buddy comedy and veering toward horror-film haunting, especially when Merit hesitantly agrees to a date with a worker at the prospective retirement home (Utkarsh Ambudkar).",
      "But the movie\u2019s earnestness carries it through these less smooth moments. So does the cast. Any opportunity to see Freeman or Harris, still at the top of their games, is a chance to be treasured. Freeman is typically sage and Harris characteristically fiery. But the leads are even better. Morales is at her finest as a cynical soldier, devoted to her friend but little else. And with compelling poise, Martin-Green (\"The Walking Dead\") carries a movie that at times can feel scattershot but never not sincere.",
      "\u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe,\u201d a Briarcliff Entertainment release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language. Running time: 101 minutes. Three stars out of four."

      "The Department of Veterans Affairs has temporarily suspended billions of dollars in contract cuts after an uproar that critical veterans health services were harmed, lawmakers and veterans service organizations said Wednesday",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Department of Veterans Affairs has temporarily suspended billions of dollars in planned contract cuts following concerns that the move would hurt critical veterans' health services, lawmakers and veterans service organizations said Wednesday.",
      "The pause affects hundreds of VA contracts that Secretary Doug Collins a day earlier described as simply consulting deals, whose cancellation would save $2 billion as the Trump administration works to slash costs across the federal government.",
      "\u201cNo more paying consultants to do things like make Power Point slides and write meeting minutes!\u201d Collins posted to X Tuesday, in a post that was then lauded by Elon Musk, President Donald Trump's cost-cutting chief at the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.",
      "The Associated Press has obtained the full list of 875 affected contracts, which shows the cuts would affect everything from cancer care to the ability to assess toxic exposure. The list underscores how the Trump administration\u2019s approach to broad spending reductions has immediate and potentially unintended consequences, generating significant concern not just among Democrats but also Republican lawmakers.",
      "The VA said in a statement to the AP that its review of the contracts \u201cis ongoing and not final.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will not be eliminating any benefits or services to Veterans or VA beneficiaries, and there will be no negative impact to VA health care, benefits or beneficiaries. We are always going to take care of Veterans at VA. Period,\u201d VA press secretary Pete Kasperowicz said in a statement.",
      "One contract that was on the chopping block supports assessing veterans' disability ratings. Those evaluations are one of the most important steps needed for a veteran to qualify to have their medical care covered and receive financial compensation if they were wounded due to their military service. An inaccurate rating can have a long-term impact on their access to care and financial support.",
      "Another contract is intended to identify and integrate data between the Pentagon, VA and other agencies to support the Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act of 2022, a bill passed in 2022 to increase veterans\u2019 access to care.",
      "Some of the other contracts marked for cancellation also directly affect veterans' care.",
      "At a joint House and Senate hearing Wednesday with veterans services organizations, Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal submitted a partial list of the affected contracts his office had received and submitted it for the congressional record.",
      "If carried out, these cuts \u201cwill harm veterans and taxpayers for years to come,\u201d Blumenthal said in a statement.",
      "In an internal VA email sent Tuesday and seen by the AP, a VA contracting official said DOGE targeted contracts broadly categorized as \u201cconsulting\u201d but they included ones that if terminated would halt chemotherapy and imaging services.",
      "Contracts to calibrate radiation detection equipment, to support cancer care and veterans cemetery management, among others were also targeted. Another would directly affect the ability to assess toxic exposure because it supports more than 24,000 research requests to look through the National Archives and Records Administration and other government sources to validate service and toxic exposure events.",
      "Former VA Secretary David Shulkin, who served in the Trump administration in his first term, said that while the agency has gotten larger and there are likely savings to be found, the VA grew, in part, to meet the large expansion of veterans enrolling to get care under the PACT Act. More than 740,000 veterans signed up for coverage after the law passed, according to a September 2024 VA press release.",
      "\u201cI do think slowing down and pausing to see what the consequences are, even if they are unintended consequences, is important to do,\u201d Shulkin told The Associated Press.",
      "Veterans service organizations called for \u201dimmediate transparency\u201d on what contracts were affected.",
      "\u201cWith funding suddenly stripped from contractors processing claims, conducting medical screenings and expanding outreach, there are growing concerns veterans will face delays, denials and disruptions in accessing critical services,\u201d said Rosie Torres, executive director of Burn Pits 360.",

      "The number of babies born in South Korea has rebounded for the first time in nine years",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- The number of babies born in South Korea rebounded for the first time in nine years in 2024, welcome news for a country grappling with one of the the world\u2019s most serious demographic crises.",
      "South Korea\u2019s statistics agency said Wednesday that 238,300 babies were born last year, an increase of 8,300 from a year earlier. It said the country\u2019s fertility rate \u2014 the average number of babies born to each woman in their reproductive years \u2014 was 0.75 in 2024, up from 0.72 in 2023.",
      "It\u2019s the first time that the yearly number of births has increased since 2015.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say this is a considerably meaningful rebound,\u201d Choi Yoon Kyung, an expert at the Korea Institute of Child Care and Education, said Thursday. \u201cWe still have to see figures in the next few years to find whether it was a temporary rebound or it was driven by structural changes.\u201d",
      "Park Hyun Jung, a senior official at the Statistics Korea, said that her agency assessed the increase in births was partly attributable to an increase in marriages among couples who delayed weddings during the COVID-19 pandemic period.",
      "Park said that another factor behind the rebound was a growing number of people entering their early 30s. She also cited a government survey showing a small increase in the number of young people hoping to have children after marriage.",
      "Official data show South Korea\u2019s fertility rate has been the lowest in the developed world in recent years. In 2022, it was the only country whose fertility rate was below 1 among members of the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.",
      "The low fertility rate poses a major potential threat to South Korea\u2019s economy, Asia's fourth largest, as it will cause labor shortages and greater welfare spendings. South Korea\u2019s central and regional governments have been increasingly offering a variety of financial incentives and other support programs to those who give birth to children.",
      "But experts say that it will be extremely difficult to address the country's demographic challenges as young people don't want to have babies, owing to a mix of factors that make it difficult to raise them in the brutally competitive, fast-changing country. They cite expensive housing, low levels of social mobility, the huge cost of raising and educating children and a culture that requires women to handle far more of childcare.",
      "Park said that the fertility rate will likely stay on an upward trend at least for another year. But observers say it remains to be seen whether the rate will go back down as post-pandemic marriages even out. The country\u2019s demographic structure will also eventually see a drop in people in their early 30s.",
      "Some experts argue that the government should focus on supporting young couples who want to have babies, rather than providing broad programs meant to address diverse social problems.",
      "\u201cThere are still people with solid wills to have a family and babies. When we help them realize their hopes, our fertility rate won\u2019t suffer a steep, 45-degree drop,\u201d Choi said."

      "\"Measles anywhere is a threat everywhere,\" the U.S. Centers for Disease Control say on their website.",
      "Here's a brief look at the global measles situation.",
      "According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 10.3 million people were infected with measles in 2023 and 107,500 died. Most were unvaccinated people or children younger than five. Cases were most common in parts of Africa, the Middle East and Asia where incomes are low and health services insufficient.",
      "In places where measles have largely been eradicated, cases have been spread by travelers from other countries.",
      "While measles-related deaths declined slightly in 2023, the number of outbreaks increased. Major outbreaks took place in 57 countries in 2023, including India and Indonesia, Russia, Yemen and Iraq. The largest number of cases in 2023 was 311,500 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",
      "The worldwide rate of childhood vaccinations has fallen in recent years, to 83% in 2023 from 86% in 2019, partly due to disruptions in immunization and health care due to the pandemic.",
      "The WHO estimates that vaccination helped to prevent more than 60 million deaths worldwide between 2000 and 2023, as efforts to get the shots to more people ramped up. In 2000, 800,062 people are estimated to have died of measles. Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, major epidemics caused about 2.6 million deaths a year.",
      "Measles is so highly infectious that 95% immunity is required to prevent epidemics, the WHO says. Put another way, it infects about 9 of 10 people exposed if they lack immunity.",
      "The WHO and others are backing an effort called \u201cImmunization Agenda 2021-2030,\u201d to push for elimination of measles.",
      "Independent experts declared the Americas free of endemic measles in 2016 but that status was lost in 2018 due to measles outbreaks in Brazil and Venezuela. Reduced vaccination rates are undermining efforts to fully eradicate the disease, experts say.",
      "Global health organizations and other groups have increased their efforts to speed up immunization programs and close the gaps in prevention."

      "A bill that would strip gender identity protections from Iowa\u2019s civil rights code has received final legislative approval and now goes to the governor",
      "DES MOINES, Iowa -- Iowa lawmakers became the first in the nation to approve legislation removing gender identity protections from the state\u2019s civil rights code Thursday, despite massive protests by opponents who say it could expose transgender people to discrimination in numerous areas of life.",
      "The measure raced through the legislative process after first being introduced last week. The state Senate was first to approve the bill on Thursday, on party lines, followed by the House less than an hour later. Five House Republicans joined all Democrats in voting against it.",
      "The bill would remove gender identity as a protected class from the state\u2019s civil rights law and explicitly define female and male, as well as gender, which would be considered a synonym for sex and \u201cshall not be considered a synonym or shorthand expression for gender identity, experienced gender, gender expression, or gender role.\u201d",
      "The measure would be the first legislative action in the U.S. to remove nondiscrimination protections based on gender identity, said Logan Casey, director of policy research at the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ+ rights think tank.",
      "The bill now goes to Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, who signed earlier policies banning sports participation and public bathroom access for transgender students. A spokesperson for Reynolds declined to comment on whether she would sign the bill. If she does, it will go into effect on July 1.",
      "Hundreds of LGBTQ+ advocates streamed into the Capitol rotunda on Thursday waving signs reading \u201cTrans rights are human rights\u201d and chanting slogans including \u201cNo hate in our state!\u201d There was a heavy police presence, with state troopers stationed around the rotunda. Of the 167 people who signed up to testify at a 90-minute public hearing before a House committee, all but 24 were opposed to the bill.",
      "Protesters who watched the vote from the House gallery loudly booed and shouted \u201cShame!\u201d as the chamber adjourned. Many admonished Iowa state Rep. Steven Holt, who floor managed the bill and delivered a fierce defense of it before it passed.",
      "Supporters of the change say the current law incorrectly codified the idea that people can transition to another gender and granted transgender women access to spaces such as bathrooms, locker rooms and sports teams that should be protected for people who were assigned female at birth. Holt said the inclusion of gender identity in the civil rights codes threatens recent \u201ccommonsense\u201d laws to ban transgender participation in sports and access to bathrooms.",
      "\u201cThe legislature of Iowa for the future of our children and our culture has a vested interest and solemn responsibility to stand up for immutable truth,\u201d Holt said.",
      "The Iowa lawmakers\u2019 actions came as the Georgia House backed away from removing gender protections from the state\u2019s hate crimes law, which was passed in 2020 after the death of Ahmaud Arbery.",
      "Iowa\u2019s current civil rights law protects against discrimination based on race, color, creed, gender identity, sex, sexual orientation, religion, national origin or disability status.",
      "Sexual orientation and gender identity were not originally included in the state\u2019s Civil Rights Act of 1965. They were added by the Democratic-controlled Legislature in 2007, also with the support of about a dozen Republicans across the two chambers.",
      "Iowa state Rep. Aime Wichtendahl was the last Democrat to speak out Thursday against the bill removing those protections, becoming emotional as she offered her personal story as a transgender woman, saying: \"I transitioned to save my life.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe purpose of this bill and the purpose of every anti-trans bill is to further erase us from public life and to stigmatize our existence,\u201d Wichtendahl said. \u201cThe sum total of every anti-trans and anti-LGBTQ bill is to make our existence illegal.\u201d",
      "About half of U.S. states include gender identity in their civil rights code to protect against discrimination in housing and public places, such as stores or restaurants, according to the Movement Advancement Project. Some additional states do not explicitly protect against such discrimination but it is included in legal interpretations of statutes.",
      "Iowa\u2019s Supreme Court has expressly rejected the argument that discrimination based on sex includes discrimination based on gender identity.",
      "Several Republican-led legislatures are pushing to enact more laws this year creating legal definitions of male and female based on the reproductive organs at birth following an executive order from President Donald Trump.",

      "EL PASO, Texas -- On the Texas border, Dr. Hector Granados treats children with diabetes at his El Paso clinics and makes hospital rounds under the shadow of accusations that have thrown his career into jeopardy: providing care to transgender youth.",
      "In what's believed to be a U.S. first, Texas is suing Granados and two other physicians over claims that they violated the state's ban on gender-affirming care for minors, calling the doctors \u201cscofflaws\u201d in lawsuits filed last fall that threaten to impose steep fines and revoke their medical licenses. He denies the accusations, and all three doctors have asked courts to dismiss the cases.",
      "The cases are a pivotal test of intensifying Republican efforts to prevent such treatments, including President Donald Trump's executive order that would bar federal support for gender-affirming care for youth under 19.",
      "Some hospitals have already begun unwinding services for pediatric patients. But, so far, only Texas is demonstrating what punishing doctors looks like when bans are allegedly broken.",
      "Granados, in an interview with The Associated Press, said he was meticulous in halting transgender care before Texas' ban took effect in 2023. He denied that he continued prescribing puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones to transitioning patients and said he was initially unclear which patients, who are not named in the lawsuit, he is accused of wrongfully treating.",
      "The other accused doctors \u2014 both in Dallas \u2014 are under temporary court orders not to see patients and only practice medicine in research and academic settings.",
      "\u201cLooking at the patients was hard because they were kind of disappointed of what was going on,\u201d Granados said of ending their care. \u201cBut it was something that needed to be followed because it\u2019s the law.\u201d",
      "The lawsuits are believed to be the first time a state has brought enforcement under laws that ban or restrict gender-affirming care for minors, which Republicans have enacted in 27 states, including this month in Kansas over the Democratic governor\u2019s veto. Although those accused of violating bans face criminal charges in some states, they do not in Texas.",
      "Nationwide, doctors and hospital executives are reevaluating transgender health programs that carry a widening risk of litigation and losing federal funding. For transgender Americans, the climate has narrowed options for care and deepened fears.",
      "Trump has launched a broad charge against transgender rights quickly in his second term, signing executive orders that include barring schools from using federal education dollars to support students who are socially transitioning. Supporters say restrictions protect vulnerable children from what they see as a \u201cradical\u201d ideology about gender and making irreversible medical decisions.",
      "The Texas lawsuits were brought by Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has previously gone beyond the state's borders to launch investigations into gender-affirming treatment.",
      "His office did not respond to requests for an interview. At a court hearing Wednesday involving the Dallas doctors, an attorney in Paxton\u2019s office declined to comment and referred questions to the agency\u2019s press office.",
      "\u201cI will enforce the law to the fullest extent to prevent any doctor from providing these dangerous drugs to kids,\u201d Paxton said in a statement this month.",

      "Granados, 48, is from Ciudad Juarez, the neighboring Mexican city that sprawls out south of El Paso. He said that after attending medical school in Mexico he completed additional training in New York and Connecticut but he wanted to return to what he said is an underserved region.",
      "He opened a gender clinic at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in El Paso before starting his own practice in 2019. Before the ban, Granados said, treating transgender youth was just an extension of his practice that also treats youth with diabetes, growth problems and early puberty.",
      "He said he accepted transgender patients only if they had first received a diagnosis of gender dysphoria from a mental health provider.",
      "\u201cIt was not different from doing everything else that a pediatric endocrinologist does,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just taking care of children who required that specific therapy.\u201d",
      "Emiliana Edwards was among them. Now 18, she called Granados an \u201camazing\u201d caregiver who carefully explained her gender-affirming treatment. But at her first appointment after Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed the ban in 2023, Edwards said the room felt different, \u201clike there were wires everywhere.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt felt like we couldn\u2019t talk about anything really, even the most simple stuff,\u201d she said.",
      "Her mother, Lorena Edwards, said Granados put a \u201ccold stop\u201d to her daughter\u2019s care.",
      "\u201cIt was just: \u2018I don\u2019t provide that care anymore.\u2019 And it was done,\u201d she said.",
      "At the heart of Texas' lawsuits against Granados, Dr. May Lau and Dr. M. Brett Cooper are allegations of prescribing treatment to transition their patients' sex after the ban took effect.",
      "In one instance, the state accuses Granados of prescribing testosterone to a 16-year-old, alleging that although the doctor's records identify the patient as male, the teenager's sex assigned at birth is female. Granados and Lau are also accused of having instructed patients to wait until after the ban was in place to fill prescriptions.",
      "Granados does not dispute that he has continued prescribing puberty blockers and hormone replacement therapy. He said those treatments are not for gender transition but for children with endocrine disorders, which occur when hormone levels are too high or too low.",
      "He said he prescribes testosterone for many reasons, including for patients whose testicles don\u2019t work or had to be removed because of cancer. Others have brain tumors, or surgery or radiation to the brain, that impact puberty. Patients with early onset puberty also need puberty blockers, he said.",
      "Attorneys for Lau said she has always complied with the law and the claims have no merit. Attorneys for Cooper did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "\u201cThis is really part of a bigger pattern of extremism within the state that even other states have shied away from replicating,\u201d said Sarah Warbelow, vice president of legal for the Human Rights Campaign.",
      "Transgender adults and youth make up less than 1% of the U.S. population, according to estimates by the Williams Institute, an LGBTQ+ research center at the UCLA School of Law.",
      "Granados' trial has been set for late October; trial dates have not yet been set yet for Lau and Cooper. While the cases are pending, Lau and Cooper agreed to practice medicine only in research and academic settings and not see patients.",
      "Neither Lau or Cooper attended the Wednesday hearing in their cases by a judge who is set to decide where their trials will be held.",
      "Under Texas' ban, the state medical board is instructed to revoke the licenses of doctors who are found to have violated the law.",
      "Lorena Edwards said she watched her daughter thrive during her transition then descend into melancholy as laws targeting transgender rights gained steam.",
      "Emiliana Edwards has switched to receiving treatment in neighboring New Mexico \u2014 where gender-affirming care is legal \u2014 but she said attacks on the transgender community have taken a toll on her mental health.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re normal people, too, and we\u2019re just trying to live,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "Argentina\u2019s libertarian president Javier Milei has signaled that a new and much-anticipated deal with the International Monetary Fund is imminent",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- Argentina\u2019s libertarian president Javier Milei signaled late Saturday that a new deal with the International Monetary Fund was imminent, as he used his annual address to congress to project an optimistic picture of his economic overhaul following a divisive first year in office and recent swirl of controversies.",
      "In a speech that played to the sentiments of his right-wing base but included little in the way of new policy, Milei promised the crisis-stricken nation that, in the coming days, he would \u201cask congress to support the government in this new agreement with the International Monetary Fund\" even as it seemed Argentina had yet to close the deal.",
      "Revisiting the economic themes of his 2023 presidential campaign ahead of crucial midterm elections in October, Milei declared: \u201cWe went from talking about hyperinflation to talking about long-term stability.\u201d",
      "He cited his standard refrain about the government\u2019s success in dragging down the monthly inflation rate from a peak of 26% in December 2023, when he entered office, to just over 2% in January, and in helping the country claw its way out of a painful recession.",
      "\u201cWe have gone from being a global laughing stock ... to being an unexpected protagonist,\u201d Milei said.",
      "Tech billionaire Elon Musk, who waved a chainsaw gifted by Milei at the Conservative Political Action Conference last week in Washington, has cited the Argentine president\u2019s approach as inspiration for his own rampage through American federal bureaucracy.",
      "\u201cThe eyes of the world are now on Argentina after a long time,\u201d he said. \u201dAs is the case of Elon.\"",
      "On trade policy, Milei announced Argentina would leave the Mercosur bloc of South American nations if needed to clinch a free trade agreement with the United States.",
      "It marked Milei's latest effort to align his nation with U.S. President Donald Trump's administration at the expense of Argentina\u2019s previous allies and regional partnerships.",
      "\u201cTo take advantage of this historic opportunity, we must be willing to make things more flexible or even, if necessary, to leave Mercosur,\u201d he said.",
      "In his speech, Milei gave no further details about the supposed new financing deal with the Washington-based lender \u2014 a program his government has sought for months in order to help lift Argentina's strict capital and currency controls in hopes of reaping the benefits his free-market reforms, which, in 2024, delivered Argentina\u2019s first fiscal surplus in 14 years.",
      "Milei said his government would use a cash infusion from the IMF to replenish the central bank\u2019s diminished hard currency reserves, helping prevent a possible run on the peso as Argentina attempts to lift its complex web of capital controls before the year's end.",
      "\u201cThis new agreement will give us the tools to pave the way toward a freer and more efficient exchange rate system for all our citizens, to attract greater investments that will translate into lower inflation, greater growth and employment levels,\u201d Milei told congress.",
      "Foreign companies consider the notorious currency controls, which set an official exchange rate and restrict access to dollars in Argentina, to be the greatest impediment to investing in Argentina.",
      "The IMF, encouraged by Milei\u2019s progress but wary about the sustainability of his austerity, has been weighing whether to lend more money to troubled Argentina, its largest debtor with a history of defaults that still owes over $40 billon for its most recent program that ended in December.",
      "The fund did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "While Milei's speech couched his successes as wins for the Argentine people, a boycott by members of Argentina\u2019s left-leaning opposition Peronist party, Uni\u00f3n por la Patria, left the typically packed legislative chamber half-empty.",
      "The Peronist bloc controls 46% of seats in the senate and 39% in the lower house \u2014 compared with just 10% and 15% respectively for Milei\u2019s La Libertad Avanza party.",
      "That Milei\u2019s political opponents remain hostile is no surprise, experts say, as the president pushes at the generally understood limits of executive power to steer around congress.",
      "The irascible former rocker and TV personality has brought a softer tone to his negotiations with lawmakers in recent months, borrowing some votes from the former center-right government of Mauricio Macri to ensure the passage of some key initiatives.",
      "But Milei has largely relied on decrees and other executive powers to deregulate industries, dissolve ministries, lay off over 40,000 public employees, eliminate public works projects, slash inflation adjustments for pensions and wages and curb the powers of trade unions, among other changes.",
      "\u201cHe showed that he can govern the country without congress,\u201d said Sebasti\u00e1n Menescaldi, an economist with the Buenos Aires consultancy firm EcoGo.",
      "Last week, Milei inflamed the political opposition by announcing he would bypass the country\u2019s senate to appoint two Supreme Court justice nominees by decree \u2014 one of whom has triggered backlash over accusations of money laundering and illicit enrichment.",
      "The appointments were widely criticized an overreach of executive authority that would ensure favorable rulings on his sweeping reforms whose constitutionality has been questioned in federal courts.",
      "As tensions rise between the government and lawmakers, midterm elections in October 2025 will prove crucial. A good result in the ballot would allow Milei \u201cto make all the changes he wants and not have to make any concessions,\" said Menescaldi, warning, \u201cThat could mean he becomes more authoritarian.\u201d",
      "In recent weeks, the far-right economist has confronted the biggest crisis in his 14-month-old administration after promoting an unknown cryptocurrency token that shot up after his endorsement and rapidly cratered, prompting dozens of criminal complaints and calls for his impeachment.",
      "Federal prosecutors have opened an investigation into possible fraud and abuse of authority.",
      "Milei made no mention of the crypto scandal during his speech Saturday, which lasted over an hour."

    "story": [
      "Pope Francis is resting as he continues his recovery from double pneumonia",
      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Pope Francis was in stable condition and resting on Sunday as he continued his recovery from double pneumonia, but again skipped his weekly noon blessing to avoid even a brief public appearance.",
      "For the third weekend in a row, Francis cancelled the appointment delivering the Angelus prayer. He could have delivered it from his 10th floor hospital suite at the Gemelli hospital if he were well enough.",
      "Instead, the Vatican planned to distribute the prepared text as Francis continued his recovery.",
      "\u201cThe night was quiet, the pope is still resting,\u201d the Vatican said in its Sunday update.",
      "He had no fever or signs of elevated white blood cells, which would signal his body was still fighting an infection.",
      "Doctors on Saturday reported that Francis was in stable condition, with no mention of him being critical, and signaled once again continued improvement. Their upbeat assessment came a day after a respiratory crisis that resulted in him being put on noninvasive mechanical ventilation.",
      "The 88-year-old pope though had a \u201cgood response\u201d in his gas exchange levels even during the \u201clong periods\u201d he was off the ventilator mask and only using high-flow supplemental oxygen, the Vatican said.",
      "The pope, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, has lung disease and was admitted to Gemelli on Feb. 14 after a bout of bronchitis worsened and turned into a complex pneumonia in both lungs.",
      "The fact that Francis was able to use just high-flow oxygen for long periods, without any significant effect on the levels of oxygen in his blood, was a sign his respiratory function was improving.",
      "Doctors were cautious however and kept his prognosis as guarded, meaning he wasn\u2019t out of danger. He was eating and drinking and continued his respiratory physiotherapy, and spent 20 minutes in his private chapel down the hall on Saturday, the Vatican said.",
      "Francis\u2019 hospitalization has come as the Vatican is marking its Holy Year, drawing pilgrims to Rome from all over. They are walking through the Holy Door at St. Peter\u2019s Basilica and also making pilgrimages to the hilltop Umbrian town of Assisi, to pray at the home of Francis\u2019 namesake, St. Francis.",
      "\u201cEvery day we\u2019re praying for the pope,\u201d said the Rev. Jacinto Bento, a priest visiting Assisi on Saturday with a group of 30 Jubilee pilgrims from the Azores Islands. \u201cWe\u2019re very sad for his situation.\u201d",
      "In an odd coincidence, Francis was supposed to have presided Saturday over a Holy Year audience in the Vatican\u2019s auditorium for the staff of the Gemelli hospital and other healthcare workers. They came as planned and completed the pilgrimage, while Francis continued his recovery at the hospital.",
      "\u201cWe thought we would be able to meet him this morning in Paul VI Hall for the Jubilee Catechesis, but he surprised us by coming to us,\u201d said Monsignor Claudio Giuliodori, spiritual guide of the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, of which Gemelli is a part.",
      "Giovanni Frisullo, a Gemelli neurologist, said the atmosphere at Gemelli was one of tension and prayer. \u201cThere is a situation of waiting but also of hope,\u201d he said.",

      "Israel has cut off the entry of all food and other goods into Gaza in an echo of the siege it imposed in the earliest days of its war with Hamas. The United Nations and other humanitarian aid providers are sharply criticizing the decision and calling it a violation of international law.",
      "\u201cA tool of extortion,\u201d Saudi Arabia\u2019s foreign ministry said. \u201cA reckless act of collective punishment,\u201d Oxfam said. Key mediator Egypt accused Israel of using \u201cstarvation as a weapon.\u201d",
      "Hunger has been an issue throughout the war for Gaza\u2019s over 2 million people, and some aid experts had warned of possible famine. Now there is concern about losing the progress that experts reported under the past six weeks of a ceasefire.",
      "Israel is trying to pressure the Hamas militant group to agree to what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government describes as a U.S. proposal to extend the ceasefire\u2019s first phase instead of beginning negotiations on the far more difficult second phase. In phase two, Hamas would release the remaining living hostages in return for Israel\u2019s withdrawal from Gaza and a lasting ceasefire.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at what Israel\u2019s decision means and the reactions.",
      "The ceasefire\u2019s first phase ended early Sunday. Minutes later, Israel said it supported a new proposal to extend that phase through the Jewish holiday of Passover in mid-April. It called the proposal a U.S. one from Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff. Israel also warned it could resume the war after the first phase if it believes negotiations are ineffective.",
      "Negotiations on the second phase were meant to start a month ago, increasing the uncertainty around the fragile truce. Hamas has insisted that those talks begin.",
      "Later Sunday, Israel announced the immediate cutoff of aid to Gaza.",
      "The U.S. National Security Council said Washington will support Israel's \"decision on next steps, given Hamas has indicated it\u2019s no longer interested in a negotiated ceasefire.\u201d The statement didn't confirm the proposal was Witkoff's or mention the cutoff of aid.",
      "It\u2019s not clear when Witkoff will visit the Middle East again. He had been expected to visit last week.",
      "The U.S. under the Biden administration pressed Israel to allow more aid into Gaza, threatening to limit weapons support. Aid organizations repeatedly criticized Israeli restrictions on items entering the small coastal territory, while hundreds of trucks with aid at times waited to enter.",
      "Israel says it has allowed in enough aid. It has blamed shortages on what it called the U.N.\u2019s inability to distribute it, and accused Hamas militants of siphoning off aid.",
      "For months before the ceasefire, some Palestinians reported limiting meals, searching through garbage and foraging for edible weeds as food supplies ran low.",
      "The ceasefire\u2019s first phase took effect on Jan. 19 and allowed a surge of aid into Gaza. An average of 600 trucks with aid entered per day. Those daily 600 trucks of aid were meant to continue entering through all three phases of the ceasefire.",
      "However, Hamas says less than 50% of the agreed-upon number of trucks carrying fuel, for generators and other uses, were allowed in. Hamas also says the entry of live animals and animal feed, key for food security, were denied entry.",
      "Still, Palestinians in Gaza were able to stock up on some supplies. \u201cThe ceasefire brought some much-needed relief to Gaza, but it was far from enough to cover the immense needs,\u201d the Norwegian Refugee Council said Sunday.",
      "Israel\u2019s announcement came hours after Muslims in Gaza marked the first breaking of the fast during the holy month of Ramadan, with long tables set for collective meals snaking through the rubble of war-destroyed buildings.",
      "The sudden aid cutoff sent Palestinians hurrying to markets. Prices in Gaza \u201ctripled immediately,\u201d Mahmoud Shalabi, the Medical Aid for Palestinians\u2019 deputy director of programs in northern Gaza, told The Associated Press.",
      "Prominent in the immediate criticism of Israel\u2019s aid cutoff were statements calling the decision a violation.",
      "\u201cInternational humanitarian law is clear: We must be allowed access to deliver vital lifesaving aid,\u201d said the U.N. humanitarian chief, Tom Fletcher.",
      "Hours after Israel's announcement, five non-governmental groups asked Israel\u2019s Supreme Court for an interim order barring the state from preventing aid from entering Gaza, claiming the move violates Israel\u2019s obligations under international law and amounts to a war crime: \u201cThese obligations cannot be condition on political considerations.\u201d",
      "Last year, the International Criminal Court said there was reason to believe Israel had used \u201cstarvation as a method of warfare\u201d when it issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu. The allegation is also central to South Africa\u2019s case at the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of genocide.",
      "On Sunday, Kenneth Roth, former head of Human Rights Watch, said Israel as an occupying power has an \u201cabsolute duty\u201d to facilitate humanitarian aid under the Geneva Conventions, and called Israel\u2019s decision \u201ca resumption of the war-crime starvation strategy\u201d that led to the ICC warrant.",

      "Carnival always breathes life into the economy of Vila Vintem, on Rio de Janeiro\u2019s west side, but this year there\u2019s even more, with its Unidos de Padre Miguel samba school back in the top parade league for the first time in 57 years",
      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- Carnival always breathes life into the economy of Vila Vintem, a favela on Rio de Janeiro's west side, but this year the pulse is even stronger with its Unidos de Padre Miguel samba school returning to the top samba parade league for the first time in almost 60 years.",
      "As one of Rio's 12 top-tier samba schools, Unidos de Padre Miguel will have its shot at fame, perhaps even glory \u2014 all while bringing in more money into its community.",
      "Last year, competing in the second division, Padre Miguel received about 900,000 reais ($150,000) from City Hall, missing out on the lucrative sponsorship deals and revenue from television rights, pre-Carnival parties and ticket sales enjoyed by top-flight samba schools. But their victory in last year's Carnival secured their place in the main event that kicks off Sunday night.",
      "The shift has sent Padre Miguel\u2019s budget this year ballooning more than tenfold, to about 11 million reais ($2 million), including nearly 2 million reais from the city, according to the samba school's deputy chairman Dr. Willie Baracho.",
      "The school has already invested a significant portion into the community, funding local seamstresses, carpenters and welders for parade preparations.",
      "Vila Vintem is already experiencing the positive effects. Several of the favela's formerly jobless residents told The Associated Press they have bought smartphones and household appliances.",
      "Padre Miguel's new headquarters, nearing completion, will relocate rehearsals and other community activities from a hangar-like space that served as a vital center for the community during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cOur samba school has projects, it helps people, distributes food, throws parties for our children,\u201d Luana Borges, 42, said as she fixed details on several costumes, some bearing the school's traditional red and white colors.",
      "\u201cWhen Carnival comes, it offers opportunities to people like me,\" said Borges, who used to be unemployed.",
      "Nearly all samba schools sit in working-class neighborhoods around Rio\u2019s metropolitan region and compete against each other in the legendary Sambadrome parade grounds. Favelas in Rio are typically associated with dense, hillside neighborhoods, but they feature other geographies, too. The 14,000-resident Vila Vintem cropped up almost a century ago on flatlands next to a railway under construction.",
      "When first settled, the swampy area was said to be worth not even a \u201cvintem,\u201d the cheapest coin at the time, akin to a penny. Decades passed before basic services arrived, sometimes only after residents agreed to do the work themselves.",
      "Even with its new Carnival windfall, Padre Miguel remains a financial underdog.",
      "Baracho said its more popular rivals don\u2019t depend as much on city money, and can bring in up to 18 million reais ($3 million) when accounting for corporate sponsorships, sales of merchandise, coveted parade positions and cover charges for their pre-Carnival parties.",
      "While Padre Miguel employs almost all locals, Baracho said wealthier samba schools can spend over 1 million reais, for instance, on coaches and dancers, whose performance is one of the categories scored by judges.",
      "\u201cThe sky is the limit for some, but we fight,\u201d Baracho said. \u201cWe managed to get promoted because we are invested in our people, we work hard to foster our own creativity.\"",
      "Padre Miguel will be the first samba school to parade on Sunday night. Their procession will tell the story of Iya\u0301 Nasso\u0302, the founder of the first space in Brazil for rituals of the Afro-Brazilian faith Candomble.",
      "Experts say the best path for scrappy samba schools like Padre Miguel to sustain their community impact is to focus on avoiding relegation, rather than pursuing Carnival\u2019s top prize, amounting to 20% of the revenue of the tickets sold for the Champions Parade, which takes place the following weekend.",
      "\u201cThere's little chance for a samba school to win the title coming from the second division,\" said F\u00e1tima Costa de Lima, a Carnival researcher and scenic arts professor at Santa Catarina State University. \u201cIt happened before, but it is rare. The main goal for a samba school like (Padre Miguel) is to stay on.\u201d",
      "Ingrid Lima Leal has worked for Padre Miguel for 15 years, and paraded with the school for even longer. The 66-year-old says that creating jobs in Vila Vintem and being at the world-famous parade is worth every cent. She wants to see more next year \u2014 hopefully still in the top division.",
      "While sewing a white costume in her home workshop, Leal expressed the \u201camazing emotion\u201d of marching in the parade wearing something she helped create.",
      "\u201cCarnival brings a lot of jobs. Not only here, but everywhere,\u201d she said.",

      "The mountains of northern Iraq have for years been a sanctuary for Kurdish militants fighting a decades-long insurgency against the government in neighboring Turkey",
      "GUHARZE, Iraq -- Iraqi Kurdish villagers, displaced by fighting between Turkish forces and Kurdish militants that has played out for years in northern Iraq, are finally allowing themselves to hope they will soon be able to go home.",
      "Their hopes were raised after the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, on Saturday declared a ceasefire in the 40-year insurgency against the Turkish government, answering a call to disarm from earlier in the week by the group's leader, Abdullah Ocalan, imprisoned in Turkey since 1999.",
      "The truce \u2014 if implemented \u2014 could not only be a turning point in neighboring Turkey but could also bring much needed stability to the volatile region spanning the border between the two countries.",
      "In northern Iraq, Turkish forces have repeatedly launched blistering offensives over the past years, pummeling PKK fighters who have been hiding out in sanctuaries in Iraq's northern semi-autonomous Kurdish region, and have set up bases in the area. Scores of villages have been completely emptied of their residents.",
      "Adil Tahir Qadir fled his village of Barchi, on Mount Matin in 1988, when Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein launched a brutal campaign against the area's Kurdish population.",
      "He now lives in a newly built village \u2014 also named Barchi, after the old one that was abandoned \u2014 about 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) away, south of the mountain.",
      "He used to go back to the old village every now and then to farm his land. But that stopped in 2015 when Turkish forces moved in and set up camp there in the fight against PKK, hitting the group with wave after wave of airstrikes.",
      "Iraqi Kurdish farmers and their lands became collateral damage. The Turkish airstrikes and ground incursions targeting PKK positions displaced thousands of Iraqi Kurdish civilians, cutting off many from their land.",
      "\u201cBecause of Turkish bombing, all of our farmlands and trees were burned,\u201d Qadir said.",
      "If peace comes, he will go back right away, he says. \u201cWe wish it will work so we can return.\u201d",
      "In the border area of Amedi in Iraq's Dohuk province \u2014 once a thriving agricultural community \u2014 around 200 villages had been emptied of their residents by the fighting, according to a 2020 study by the regional Iraqi Kurdish government.",
      "Small havens remained safe, like the new Barchi, with only about 150 houses and where villagers rely on sesame, walnuts and rice farming. But as the fighting dragged on, the conflict grew ever closer.",
      "\u201cThere are many Turkish bases around this area,\" said Salih Shino, who was also displaced to the new Barchi from Mount Matin.",
      "\u201cThe bombings start every afternoon and intensify through the night,\u201d he said. \u201dThe bombs fall very close ... we can\u2019t walk around at all.\u201d",
      "Airstrikes have hit Barchi's water well and bombs have fallen near the village school, he said.",
      "Najib Khalid Rashid, from the nearby village of Belava, says he also lives in fear. There are near-daily salvos of bombings, sometimes 40-50 times, that strike in surrounding areas.",
      "\u201cWe can't even take our sheep to graze or farm our lands in peace,\u201d he said.",
      "Iraqi Kurdish villagers avoid talking about their views on the Kurdish insurgency in Turkey and specifically the PKK, which has deep roots in the area. Turkey and its Western allies, including the United States, consider the PKK a terrorist organization.",
      "Still, Rashid went so far as to call for all Kurdish factions to put aside their differences and come together in the peace process.",
      "\u201cIf there\u2019s no unity, we will not achieve any results,\u201d he said.",
      "Ahmad Saadullah, in the village of Guharze, recalled a time when the region was economically self-sufficient.",
      "\u201cWe used to live off our farming, livestock, and agriculture,\u201d he said. \u201cBack in the 1970s, all the hills on this mountain were full of vines and fig farms. We grew wheat, sesame, and rice. We ate everything from our farms.\u201d",
      "Over the past years, cut off from their farmland, the locals have been dependent on government aid and \"unstable, seasonal jobs,\" he said. \u201cToday, we live with warplanes, drones, and bombings.\u201d",
      "Farooq Safar, another Guharze resident, recalled a drone strike that hit in his back yard a few months ago.",
      "\u201cIt was late afternoon, we were having dinner, and suddenly all our windows exploded,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole village shook. We were lucky to survive.\u201d",
      "Like others, Safar's hopes are sprinkled with skepticism \u2014 ceasefire attempts have failed in the past, he says, remembering similar peace pushes in 1993 and 2015.",
      "\u201cWe hope this time will be different,\" he said."

      "A summit of European leaders to discuss Ukraine's defense has been overshadowed by the diplomatic row at the White House",
      "LONDON -- It was supposed to cap a week of whirlwind diplomacy advancing the prospect of peace in Ukraine.",
      "But a summit of European leaders on Sunday has been overshadowed by the extraordinary scolding by U.S. President Donald Trump of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Friday for being ungrateful for U.S. support. The London meeting has now taken on greater importance in defending the war-torn ally and shoring up the continent's defenses.",
      "\u201cThere's a real problem for European leaders to pick up the pieces and try and move forward,\u201d Peter Ricketts, the former British national security adviser, told BBC radio on Saturday. \"It\u2019s going to be a damage limitation exercise. It\u2019s going to have to be an exercise in where do we go from here?\u201d",
      "The meeting at Lancaster House, a 200-year-old elegant mansion near Buckingham Palace, follows a charm offensive last week to engage with Trump at the White House to put Ukraine at the center of negotiations and tilt his allegiances toward Europe.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who is hosting the leaders of more than a dozen countries and other officials, said he is determined to find an end to Russia's war on Ukraine.",
      "\u201cWe have an opportunity to come together to ensure a just and lasting peace in Ukraine that secures their sovereignty and security,\" Starmer said in advance. \u201cNow is the time for us to unite in order to guarantee the best outcome for Ukraine, protect European security, and secure our collective future.\u201d",
      "The summit will also include leaders from France, Germany, Denmark, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Canada, Finland, Sweden, the Czech Republic and Romania. The Turkish foreign minister, NATO secretary-general and the presidents of the European Commission and European Council will also attend.",
      "Zelenskyy received broad support from leaders across Europe after the White House fiasco, which was exceptional for featuring an attack on an ally \u2014 and because it was broadcast on live television.",
      "Starmer embraced Zelenskyy when he arrived Saturday for a private meeting \u2014 a day before a get-together had been scheduled before the summit.",
      "\u201cAs you heard from the cheers on the street outside, you have full backing across the United Kingdom,\u201d Starmer said. \u201cWe stand with you, with Ukraine, for as long as it may take.\u201d",
      "Europe has been uneasy since Trump initiated direct peace talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had been isolated by most Western leaders since invading Ukraine three years ago. The scramble to remain relevant and protect European interests as their once stalwart ally appeared to be cozying up to Putin was even more troubling when Trump called Zelenskyy a dictator and falsely said Ukraine started the war.",
      "Meetings in recent days had provided some hope \u2014 until Zelenskyy\u2019s visit to the White House.",
      "Visits to the Oval Office by French President Emmanuel Macron, who had declared his visit a \u201cturning point,\u201d and Starmer were seen as steps in the right direction. The meetings were cordial and Trump even took a gentler tone toward Ukraine though he would not commit to providing U.S. security guarantees and maintained Europe would need to provide peacekeeping troops.",
      "Within 12 hours of Starmer's return from Washington, the talk of peace seemed to collapse as Vice President JD Vance berated Zelenskyy for challenging Trump's assertions that Russian President Vladimir Putin could be trusted.",
      "\u201cStarmer did an impressive job of asserting Europe\u2019s agency in the war on Ukraine and conveying to President Trump that Europe is willing and able to take a leading role in implementing any credible peace deal,\" said Rachel Ellehuus, director-general of Royal United Services Institute, a defense and security think tank. \u201cUnfortunately, Friday\u2019s White House meeting was a major step backward.\u201d",
      "Ukraine can no longer count on military or political support from the U.S. after Trump declared himself neutral in negotiations, Ellehuus said. She said Europe needs to step in and could release some 200 billion euros ($207 million) in seized Russian assets to help fund that effort.",
      "\u201cThe immediate goal of the meetings in London must be to keep Ukraine in the fight so it can negotiate from a maximum position of strength,\u201d she said.",
      "Starmer pledged this week to boost military spending to 2.5% of gross domestic product by 2027. Other European nations may follow suit.",
      "Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said Saturday that Europe faces a historic test and has to care for itself. He said European countries have to increase their arms spending to reach at least 3% of GDP.",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t increase our effort fast enough and let the aggressor dictate its conditions we won\u2019t end up well,\u201d he said.",
      "Macron, who said it was legitimate for the U.S. to shift its focus to dealing with China and Asia, also called for more defense spending as he called for unity among his neighbors.",
      "\u201cWe should have woken up earlier,\u201d Macron said. \u201cI\u2019ve been saying for years that we need a more sovereign, more united, more independent Europe.\u201d",

    "summary": "As Pope Francis remains hospitalized, a group of migrant transgender women are praying for his recovery",
    "story": [
      "As Pope Francis remains hospitalized, a group of migrant transgender women are praying for his recovery",
      "TORVAIANICA, Italy -- Moira Camila Garnica and a group of fellow migrant transgender women have been gathering at their parish church to pray for Pope Francis as he continues to battle pneumonia in a Rome hospital, about an hour away from this modest seaside town.",
      "Many grew up Catholic in Argentina like Francis, and their prayers encompass gratitude for his outreach \u2013 several met him in person \u2013 as well as hope that\u202fthe door he opened toward a doubly marginalized community\u202fwill not be shut in the future.",
      "\u201cThe biggest fear is that you never know how things will be in the future, should he no longer lead the church, that it might go backwards,\u201d said Garnica, 47. \u201cWe hope that the church will continue with this empathy, continue to be open to everyone, continue to help, because sometimes one person can take a big step forward and then others take three steps back.\u201d",
      "Garnica and several other Latin American women, most sex workers who have been in Italy for a couple of decades, gathered for evening Mass in late February at the Blessed Immaculate Virgin Church. It was here they found food, medicine and basic financial assistance when\u202f Italy\u2019s strict COVID-19 lockdown rendered them unable to work, isolated and destitute.",
      "The parish priest, the Rev. Andrea Conocchia, invited them to write letters to Francis outlining their needs. The Vatican\u2019s almoner office not only provided money but brought a few dozen of them to the Vatican for vaccines. Years later, some were invited to a lunch for the poor with the pope.",
      "\u201cIn this Covid period, it was important that Pope Francis got inside the mind of transgender women, in the mind of the human beings that we are, and started to treat us like human beings, and that I think is the moment when faith or Christianity could embrace us,\u201d said Carla Segovia.",
      "The 48-year-old woman, of Indigenous Bolivian descent, left her native Argentina as a college student during its financial crisis more than 20 years ago. She has been working as a prostitute since she started to pay for her gender surgeries as a youth, and calls the violence and discrimination she has faced a tough test of \u201cyour potential to survive.\u201d",
      "Now that Francis is ill, she said she wants to \u201ctransmit to him our strength, the same thing that he brought to us in the difficult time of the pandemic. We want to inoculate him with this strength that is so crucial \u2013 the fact that you need to fight for your life.\u201d",
      "Gender transition is a\u202f controversial issue in many countries including the United States, where Catholic bishops reject it, and\u202f immigration is also roiling politics \u202fon both sides of the Atlantic. But Francis has made inclusion a hallmark of his papacy; specifically, the Vatican has stated it\u2019s permissible, under certain circumstances,\u202f for trans people to be baptized as Catholics \u202fand serve as godparents.",
      "Segovia and other women in their community were involved in the church as children but later felt their identity and work pushed them away \u2013 until they came to the Torvaianica parish\u2019s food distribution site, during the pandemic lockdown.",
      "\u201cWe Latin Americans are very Catholic, but being trans, many doors close, and people walk away from us, and we walk away too,\u201d Garnica said. \u201cThe word-of-mouth was that this church welcomed you, helped you, and I came to ask for help because I felt so alone.\u201d",
      "So did Minerva, a Peruvian 54-year-old who asked only her professional name be used, her voice shaking with emotion as she recounted how the experience changed her life in town.",
      "\u201cWe had no work, we had no money to buy food. A friend through word of mouth told me, go to the parish and knock, ask for Father Andrea. I came, I knocked, and like never before he opened his arms, he provided a support so big that still today he\u2019s helping us,\u201d Minerva said.",
      "\u201cHe opened for us so many doors. At the beginning even here people didn\u2019t pay attention to us. Now, when they see us, they greet us.\u201d",
      "For the Rev. Conocchia, helping this group of women is perfectly in line with the model of an open church reaching out to the margins that Francis has promoted, as well as the pope\u2019s famous \u201c who am I to judge\u201d \u202fapproach to LGBTQ+ issues.",
      "\u201cWe put the poor back at the center, we put people back at the center, and that\u2019s the Gospel,\u201d Conocchia said. \u201cWhat matters to me is a person, a person\u2019s life and their story \u2026 a person is never what they do.\u201d",
      "He said the Vatican\u2019s more open attitude, as well as its concrete welcome for this group of women, can help abolish prejudices that religious people hold \u2013 since it\u2019s possible the women\u2019s clients might include people who attend Mass, he wryly noted.",
      "For the women, who often are rejected by their own families, it\u2019s a moment of grace that went straight to the heart.",
      "\u201cA trans girl would have never imagined in her life that she could see the pope receive her, welcome her, and help her,\u201d Garnica said. \u201cAlready here people mistreat you for being Latin American, imagine Latin America and trans. \u2026 But thanks to Father Andrea, people understood that we also have a heart, we also can contribute, we need the church, too.\u201d",
      "Minerva was a First Communion catechist in her parish in Peru, until she said she was kicked out for her identity. In the Torvaianica sacristy, under a picture of Francis, she practiced singing a Spanish-language version of \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d in hopes of joining the local choir. One verse, that she likes to sing to Mary, is about coming out of the shadows and into the light.",
      "\u201cI am church \u2013 not part of the church, I am church because each one of us is church,\u201d she said.",

      "For Palestinians observing Ramadan in Gaza, the Muslim holy month started this year under a fragile ceasefire agreement that paused more than 15 months of the Israel-Hamas war",
      "JABALIYA, Gaza Strip -- Before the war, the Muslim holy month of Ramadan was a festive time of increased worship, social gatherings and cheer for Fatima Al-Absi. Together with her husband, the resident of Jabaliya in Gaza said she used to do Ramadan shopping, visit relatives and head to the mosque for prayers.",
      "But the Israel-Hamas war has shredded many of the familiar and cherished threads of Ramadan as Al-Absi once knew it: her husband and a son-in-law have been killed, her home was damaged and burnt and the mosque she attended during Ramadan destroyed, she said.",
      "\u201cEverything has changed,\u201d she said on Saturday as her family observed the first day of Ramadan. \u201cThere\u2019s no husband, no home, no proper food and no proper life.\u201d",
      "For Al-Absi and other Gaza residents, Ramadan started this year under a fragile ceasefire agreement that paused more than 15 months of a war that has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and devastated the Gaza Strip. Compared to last Ramadan, many found relief in the truce \u2014 but there's also worry and fear about what\u2019s next and grief over the personal and collective losses, the raw wounds and the numerous scars left behind.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve lost a lot,\u201d said the 57-year-old grandmother, who\u2019s been reduced to eking out an existence amid the wreckage. \u201cLife is difficult. May God grant us patience and strength,\" she added.",
      "Israel\u2019s government said early Sunday it supports a proposal to extend the first phase of the ceasefire in Gaza through Ramadan and Passover even as Hamas has insisted earlier on negotiating the truce\u2019s second phase. The statement by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office came minutes after the first phase ended, and as talks have begun on starting the second phase.",
      "The statement gave new details on what Israel described as a U.S. proposal, which it said was made after U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff got \u201cthe impression that at this stage there was no possibility of bridging the positions of the parties to end the war, and that more time was needed for talks on a permanent ceasefire.\u201d,",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re scared because there's no stability,\" Al-Absi said and added that she\u2019s praying for the war to end and that she can\u2019t bear any more losses. She spoke before Israel\u2019s statement.",
      "Though Ramadan is still far from normal, some in the Gaza Strip said that, in some ways, it feels better than last year\u2019s.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t predict what will happen next,\u201d Amal Abu Sariyah, in Gaza City, said before the month\u2019s start. \u201cYes, the country is destroyed and the situation is very bad, but the feeling that the shelling and the killing ... have stopped, makes you (feel) that this year is better than the last one.\u201d",
      "Overshadowed by war and displacement, last Ramadan, was \u201cvery bad,\u201d for the Palestinian people, she said. The 2024 Ramadan in Gaza began with cease-fire talks then at a standstill, hunger worsening across the strip and no end in sight to the war.",
      "The war was sparked by the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel in which Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages. Israel\u2019s military offensive has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Vast areas of Gaza have been destroyed.",
      "Under the ceasefire, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians flooded back into northern Gaza. After initial relief and joy at returning to their homes \u2014 even if damaged or destroyed \u2014 they\u2019ve been grappling with living amid the wreckage.",
      "As Palestinians in the Gaza Strip prepared for Ramadan, shopping for essential household goods and food, some lamented harsh living conditions and economic hardships, but also said they rely on their faith in God to provide for them.",
      "\u201cI used to help people. ... Today, I can\u2019t help myself,\u201d said Nasser Shoueikh. \u201cMy situation, thank God, used to be better and I wasn\u2019t in need for anything. ... We ask God to stand by us.\"",
      "For observant Muslims the world over, Ramadan is a time for fasting daily from dawn to sunset, increased worship, religious reflection, charity and good deeds. Socially, it often brings families and friends together in festive gatherings around meals to break their fast.",
      "Elsewhere in the Gaza Strip, Fatima Barbakh, from the southern city of Khan Younis, said her Ramadan shopping was limited to the essentials.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t buy lanterns or decorations like we do every Ramadan,\u201d she said.",
      "Back in Jabaliya, Al-Absi bitterly recalled how she used to break her fast with her husband, how much she misses him and how she remembers him when she prays.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- A U.S. aircraft carrier arrived in South Korea on Sunday in a show of force, days after North Korea test-launched cruise missiles to demonstrate its counterattack capabilities.",
      "The arrival of the USS Carl Vinson and its strike group at the South Korean port of Busan was meant to display a solid U.S-South Korean military alliance in the face of persistent North Korean threats, and boost interoperability of the allies\u2019 combined assets, the South Korean navy said in a statement.",
      "It said it was the first U.S. aircraft carrier to travel to South Korea since June.",
      "The deployment of the carrier is expected to infuriate North Korea, which views temporary deployments of such powerful U.S. military assets as major security threats. North Korea has responded to some of the past deployments of U.S. aircraft carriers, long-range bombers and nuclear-powered submarines with missile tests.",
      "Since his Jan. 20 inauguration, President Donald Trump has said he will reach out to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un again to revive diplomacy. North Korea hasn\u2019t directly responded to Trump\u2019s overture but alleged U.S.-led hostilities against North Korea have intensified since Trump\u2019s inauguration.",
      "North Korea said Friday it test-fired strategic cruise missiles earlier last week to inform its adversaries of its military\u2019s counterattack capability and the readiness of its nuclear operations. After watching the launches, the North's fourth missile testing event this year, Kim ordered his military to be fully ready to use its nuclear weapons.",
      "Experts say Kim won\u2019t likely accept Trump\u2019s overture anytime soon as he is now focusing on his support of Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine with provision of weapons and troops. They say Kim could consider resuming diplomacy with Trump when he thinks he cannot maintain his country's current booming cooperation with Russia",
      "Kim and Trump met three times from 2018-19 during Trump\u2019s first term to discuss the future of North Korea\u2019s nuclear program. Their high-stakes diplomacy eventually collapsed due to wrangling over U.S.-led economic sanctions on North Korea.",

      "Here\u2019s the latest:",
      "With a thaw in U.S.-Russia relations, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the \u201cforeign policy\u201d alignment of the U.S. administration largely mirrors that of Moscow.",
      "\u201cThe new (U.S.) administration is rapidly changing all foreign policy configurations. This largely coincides with our vision,\u201d Peskov said, according to a post by state TV reporter Pavel Zarubin on Sunday on the Telegram channel.",
      "Peskov spoke on Wednesday, before the Zelenskyy-Trump blowout on Friday.",
      "His remarks were seen as a follow-up on the U.S. splitting with its European allies by refusing to blame Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. In the U.N. General Assembly last week, the U.S. joined Russia in voting against a Europe-backed Ukrainian resolution that calls out Moscow\u2019s aggression and demands an immediate withdrawal of Russian troops.",
      "Ties between Moscow and Washington had plummeted to their lowest levels since the Cold War after Russia illegally annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and invaded Ukraine in 2022.",

      "As she traveled to the United Kingdom, von der Leyen said the aim of the 27-nation bloc is to create a path \u201cto a just and lasting peace in Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Von der Leyen, the head of the EU\u2019s executive arm, wrote on the social network X: \u201cThe path to peace is strength. Weakness breeds more war. We will support Ukraine, while undertaking a surge in European defense.\"",
      "Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, who has positioned herself as a bridge between Trump and Europe, spoke with the U.S. president on Saturday night, ahead of the London meeting, her office said.",
      "Meloni, the only European leader to attend Trump\u2019s inauguration, has been a strong supporter of Ukraine, making her position difficult given the White House clash.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron says Russia must be stopped or it's likely to expand its military operations in Ukraine further west.",
      "Macron told La Tribune Dimanche newspaper ahead of a summit in London that Vladimir Putin\u2019s ambitions pose an existential threat to Europe.",
      "\u201cWe have an over-armed and aggressive Russia on our borders. It is carrying out terrorist actions and massive disinformation campaigns here and in Europe,\u201d Macron said. If Putin is not stopped, Macron said, \u201che will certainly move on to Moldova and perhaps beyond to Romania.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s our security that\u2019s at stake,\u201d Macron added.",
      "\u201cThe clear destiny of the Americans is to be on the side of the Ukrainians, I have no doubt about that,\u201d he said. \u201cI want the Americans to understand that disengagement from Ukraine is not in their interests.\u201d",
      "The British prime minister says the Unted Kingdom, France and Ukraine have agreed to work on a ceasefire plan to present to the United States.",
      "Starmer says the plan emerged after talks among the four countries\u2019 leaders following President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s spat with President Donald Trump at the White House on Friday.",
      "The prime minster told the BBC he believes the U.S. president wants a durable peace in Ukraine. He repeated his assertion that American security guarantees will be needed to make it stick.",
      "The meeting at Lancaster House, a 200-year-old elegant mansion near Buckingham Palace, follows a charm offensive last week to engage with Trump to tilt his allegiances toward Europe.",
      "That offensive, however, devolved into a meltdown on live television from the Oval Office on Friday with Trump's extraordinary scolding of Zelenskyy.",
      "It seemed to dash, at least for now, Ukrainian hopes that the United States could be locked in as a reliable partner in helping fend off, and conclude, Russia\u2019s three-year onslaught on Ukraine.",
      "Sunday's summit will also include leaders from France, Germany, Denmark, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Turkey, Finland, Sweden, Czechia and Romania, as well as the NATO secretary-general and the presidents of the European Commission and European Council.",
      "The summit on Sunday will also include leaders from France, Germany, Denmark, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Turkey, Finland, Sweden, Czechia and Romania, as well as the NATO secretary-general and the presidents of the European Commission and European Council.",

      "Rutte told the BBC on Saturday that he told Zelenskyy that \u201che really had to respect what President Trump has done so far for Ukraine.\u201d He was referring to the first Trump administration\u2019s decision in 2019 to supply Ukraine with Javelin antitank missiles that Ukraine used to deadly effect against Russian tanks in the first wave of the 2022 invasion.",
      "Calling the Friday meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy \u201cunfortunate,\u201d Rutte said he \u201cknew as a fact that the American administration is extremely invested in making sure that Ukraine gets to a durable peace\u201d with Russia.",
      "Rutte said he expected European leaders, who were meeting in London on Sunday, to help secure a future peace deal by providing Ukraine with security guarantees."

      "An international border fence may soon split the village of Longwa in two",
      "LONGWA, India -- To the people who live there, Longwa is a typical hilltop village. The most imposing structure is a corrugated tin roof belonging to the Angh, a hereditary tribal chief.",
      "But recently, residents have been worried about another, less visible, local landmark: the border between India and Myanmar, which runs right through the village's center.",
      "National boundaries never mattered before to the local Konyak tribe. \u201cI eat in Myanmar and sleep in India,\u201d says Tonyei Phawang, the Angh, whose house sits on the border.",
      "The Indian government is now seeking to stop border crossings for the first time, revoking a system that made it legal for Indigenous people to cross freely and threatening to build a border fence that could cut villages like Longwa in two.",
      "On a Thursday in December, Longwa's marketplace was bustling with shoppers from the Myanmar side, motorbikes loaded with as much salt, flour, biscuits, clothes, milk, tea, soap as they could carry. The nearest town with a market on the other side of the border is Lahe, a full day\u2019s drive away.",
      "Locals have long come and gone to shop, study or seek medical care, with no sign that they're crossing an international border except a border marker sitting on a hilltop in the village. The Angh and village council members say their forefathers had no idea that the concrete pillar was meant to divide them when it was built in the early 1970s.",
      "\u201cAt that time we had no idea this is India or Myanmar. It was a free land. There was nobody who understood English or Hindi. They understood nothing,\u201d Phawang says.",
      "Like dozens of other Indigenous Naga tribes, the Konyak\u2019s land straddles the mountains that divide India and Myanmar. Naga villages are usually built on hilltops for security, something that wasn't considered when the British East India Company drew the border in an agreement with the then-Kingdom of Burma.",
      "The Constitution of India does not allow dual citizenship, but people in Longwa see themselves as belonging to both countries.",
      "\u201cI am from both India and Burma,\u201d Phawang said, using another name for the country officially known as Myanmar. \u201cI vote in the Burmese election. And when the Indian election comes I vote there too.\u201d",
      "Phawang is chief of six Konyak villages in India and more than 30 in Myanmar, whose residents pay allegiance with a yearly feast as they have for some 10 generations.",
      "The reach of the Indian state was very limited in these borderlands until recently. People here often have documents from both governments, said Khriezo Yhome, a senior fellow and editor at Asian Confluence, a think tank working to create an understanding of eastern South Asian. \u201cHowever, there was practically no way for the state to do anything to check it.\u201d",
      "Until recently, residents from both sides could travel legally within 16 kilometers (9.9 miles) of the border, but that started to change in February 2024, when the government revoked the Free Movement Regime \u201cto ensure the internal security of the country and to maintain the demographic structure of India\u2019s North Eastern states bordering Myanmar.\u201d",
      "Change has come slowly in Longwa: it took almost a year before soldiers stationed in the village began checking documents, and Longwa residents still move freely after their shifts end in the early afternoon. But people from other villages in Myanmar are afraid to travel beyond Longwa to reach schools or medical care, said B. Phohi Konyak, a former local leader of an organization representing Konyak women.",
      "Indian Home Minister Amit Shah said the government has decided to construct a fence along the entire 1,643-kilometer (1,021-mile) long Indo-Myanmar border.",
      "If it follows the legal border, it would have to cut through dozens of houses. Of the 990 buildings in the village, 170 lie on the boundary line \u2014 including a government school, the church and an army camp.",
      "Wangron Konyak, 23, drove five hours on his motorcycle from the village of Momkho to pick up his sister as school closed for vacation. \u201cIf we are not allowed to come this side then we will suffer a lot. For those studying in Myanmar school it will be alright, but people like my sister who study in India will be very affected.\u201d",
      "Residents and state officials are rejecting the changes.",
      "The Nagaland state government passed a resolution opposing the end of the Free Movement Regime and plans for border fencing, and on Feb. 3 Longwa residents staged a protest carrying placards with slogans like \u201cRespect Indigenous rights, not colonial legacy!\u201d",
      "Yhome, the expert, said that an effort to stop locals from crossing the border could violate the U.N. Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous People, which seeks to protect the integrity of border-straddling communities.",

      "In its brief morning update Saturday, the Vatican said: \u201cThe night has passed quietly, the pope is resting.\"",
      "In the late Friday update, the Vatican said the 88-year-old suffered an \u201cisolated crisis of bronchial spasm,\u201d a coughing fit in which Francis inhaled vomit, that resulted in a \u201csudden worsening of the respiratory picture.\u201d Doctors aspirated the vomit and placed Francis on non-invasive mechanical ventilation.",
      "The pope remained conscious and alert at all times and cooperated with the maneuvers to help him recover. He responded well, with a good level of oxygen exchange and was continuing to wear a mask to receive supplemental oxygen, the Vatican said.",
      "The episode, which occurred in the early afternoon, marked a setback in what had been two successive days of increasingly upbeat reports from doctors treating Francis at Rome\u2019s Gemelli hospital since Feb. 14. The pope, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, has lung disease and was admitted after a bout of bronchitis worsened and turned into pneumonia in both lungs.",
      "The Vatican said the episode was different to the prolonged respiratory crisis on Feb. 22, in that it was an isolated spasm that resulted in Francis aspirating the vomit that he produced.",
      "Dr. John Coleman, a pulmonary critical care doctor at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago, said the episode as relayed by the Vatican was alarming and underscored Francis\u2019 fragility and that his condition \u201ccan turn very quickly.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think this is extremely concerning, given the fact that the pope has been in the hospital now for over two weeks, and now he\u2019s continuing to have these respiratory events and now had this aspiration event that is requiring even higher levels of support,\u201d he told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cSo given his age and his fragile state and his previous lung resection, this is very concerning,\u201d added Coleman, who is not involved in Francis\u2019 care.",
      "Dr. William Feldman, a pulmonary specialist at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, said it was a good sign that the pope remained alert and oriented during the episode, but concurred that it marked \u201ca worrying turn.\u201d",
      "\u201cOften we will use noninvasive ventilation as a way of trying to stave off an intubation, or the use of invasive mechanical ventilation,\u201d Feldman said.",
      "Types of noninvasive ventilation include a BiPAP machine, which helps people breathe by pushing air into their lungs. Doctors will often try such a machine for a while to see if the patient\u2019s blood gas levels improve so they can eventually go back to using oxygen alone.",
      "Doctors did not resume referring to Francis being in \u201ccritical condition,\u201d which has been absent from their statements for three days now. But they say he isn\u2019t out of danger, given the complexity of his case.",
      "Late on Friday, Francis\u2019 closest friend in the Vatican bureaucracy, Argentine Cardinal Victor Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez, led the nightly prayer in St. Peter\u2019s Square to pray for Francis\u2019 health.",
      "With other cardinals bundled against the night chill, Fern\u00e1ndez urged the crowd to pray not just for Francis but for others, as the pope himself would.",

      "Ocalan, 75, has been imprisoned on the island of Imrali, off Istanbul, since 1999, after being convicted of treason. Despite his incarceration, he continues to wield significant influence over the PKK, which he founded in 1978.",
      "The group has led an insurgency in Turkey\u2019s southeast since 1984. The PKK is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey and its Western allies.",
      "Celik said: \u201cThe process will be meticulously followed by state institutions.\u201d",
      "Previous peace efforts have ended in failure, most recently in 2015."

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea said Friday it had test-fired strategic cruise missiles to demonstrate its nuclear counter-attack capability, days after it vowed to respond to what it called escalating U.S.-led hostilities since the start of the Trump administration.",
      "The official Korean Central News Agency said leader Kim Jong Un oversaw the missile tests off the country\u2019s west coast Wednesday. They were the North\u2019s fourth missile launch event this year and the second of President Donald Trump's second term.",
      "The launches were designed to inform \u201cthe enemies, who are seriously violating our security environment and fostering and escalating the confrontation environment,\u201d of the North Korean military\u2019s counterattack capability and the readiness of its nuclear operations, KCNA said.",
      "Kim expressed satisfaction over the results of the drills and said the military must be fully ready to use its nuclear weapons, the report said.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement later Friday that it had detected and tracked the North Korean launches. It said the South Korean military maintains readiness to repel any potential provocation by North Korea based on the solid South Korea-U.S. military alliance.",
      "Since his Jan. 20 inauguration, Trump has boasted of his summitry with Kim during his first term and said he would reach out to Kim again. North Korea hasn\u2019t directly responded to Trump\u2019s overture as it continues its typical aggressive rhetoric against the U.S. and weapons testing activities.",
      "Many experts say Kim, now preoccupied with his support of Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine with supply of weapons and troops, won\u2019t likely embrace Trump\u2019s outreach anytime soon. They say Kim could reconsider if he doubts he'll maintain North Korea's current solid cooperation with Russia after the war ends.",
      "Last Saturday, North Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry alleged the U.S. and its allies were ramping up more serious military provocations targeting North Korea since Trump took power. It cited the recent U.S.-South Korean aerial exercise involving a U.S. B-1B bomber and other reported activities involving U.S. military assets. A Defense Ministry statement said North Korea will counter the strategic threat of the U.S. with strategic means.",
      "Kim and Trump met three times from 2018-19 to discuss the fate of North Korea\u2019s nuclear program, but their diplomacy derailed due to disputes over U.S.-led sanctions on the North. Kim has since sharply increased the pace of weapons tests to expand and modernize his nuclear arsenal. Having a bigger nuclear arsenal now, experts say Kim would think he could win greater U.S. concessions if he revives diplomacy with Trump.",

Turkey has yet to make a detailed response to the PKK's ceasefire announcement.",
      "\u201cWe do not trust them, they said the same things before, nothing has changed. Twelve years ago they said peace, peace, peace. Then there was a ceasefire and then we saw what happened,\u201d said Turkan Duman, 56, referring to a previous peace process that broke down in 2015.",

      "Vahap Coskun, a law lecturer at Diyarbakir\u2019s Dicle University, said this indicated how closely the PKK leadership based in northern Iraq was in step with Ocalan despite his 25 years behind bars.",

      "Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf announced that 182 out of 273 lawmakers voted to dismiss Abdolnasser Hemmati, just six months after President Masoud Pezeshkian\u2019s government took office.",
      "Pezeshkian, who defended Hemmati, emphasized that the government is locked in a tough battle with the West. He called for greater unity and cooperation from Parliament to face these challenges.",
      "The decision comes amid rising tensions over Iran\u2019s nuclear program and worsening relations with the West. Iran\u2019s economy has been severely affected by international sanctions, especially after the U.S. withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal. In 2015, the rial was worth 32,000 to the dollar, but by the time Pezeshkian took office in July, it had plummeted to 584,000 to the dollar. Recently, it dropped even further, with exchange shops in Tehran trading 930,000 rials for each dollar.",
      "During the impeachment proceedings, Mohammad Qasim Osmani, a lawmaker supporting Hemmati, argued that rising inflation and exchange rates were not the fault of the current government or Parliament. He pointed to the budget deficit left by the previous administration, which he said contributed to the economic instability. Osmani also cited recent geopolitical events as factors that undermined public confidence, causing many people to convert their savings into foreign currency, which in turn further devalued the rial.",
      "Hemmati acknowledged the tough economic climate during his five months in office, including a 10% reduction in inflation. However, he acknowledged that inflation remained high, standing at 35%. He assured lawmakers that his team was working hard to address the issue, but warned that the process would take time.",

      "MAE SOT, Thailand -- Eighty-four Indonesians freed from scam centers in Myanmar were set to return home Friday as the repatriation of thousands of such workers after a crackdown strains regional resources.",
      "The Indonesians were among more than 7,000 people being held in the Myanmar border town Myawaddy following a crackdown on the scam centers by Thailand, Myanmar and China. Two buses carrying the Indonesians arrived Thursday in the Thai border city of Mae Sot, where the passengers had health checks and their identities were verified.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of people are believed to have been lured to work in Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos to commit global scams through false romances, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes. Many of the workers were recruited under false pretenses, only to find themselves trapped in virtual slavery.",
      "The Indonesian Foreign Affairs Ministry said the 84 Indonesians, which included 69 men and 15 women, were healthy and will fly to Jakarta on three commercial flights Friday. The ministry had said last week as many as 270 Indonesians were stranded in Myanmar after leaving the scam centers, but it was not clear why only 84 were being repatriated.",
      "Judha Nugraha, director of Indonesian citizen protection at the ministry, has said that approximately 6,800 Indonesians have fallen victim to illegal job scams, ending up in online gambling operations or bogus investment schemes in Myanmar and several other countries over the past few years.",
      "The crackdown on the scam centers in Myanmar followed a meeting in Beijing in early February between Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra and Chinese leader Xi Jinping where she said Thailand would crack down on the scam networks.",
      "Thailand has cut off electricity, internet and gas supplies to several areas in Myanmar hosting scam centers along the border.",
      "More than 600 Chinese nationals were repatriated last week. Earlier, some 260 people from 20 countries, including Ethiopia, Brazil and the Philippines, crossed from Myanmar into Thai custody. Many have returned home but more than 100 remain in Thailand awaiting repatriation, Thai officials said.",
      "The size and scale of the repatriation effort is straining Thai government resources and leading to delays for those waiting to go home. Officials from Thailand, Myanmar and China were expected to meet Friday to address the logistics of the crackdown as concerns grow about a possible humanitarian crisis along the border.",

      "\u201cWe must eliminate all possibilities of restoring constitutional autocracy. Now is the time to dream anew, to march forward, and to build a new Bangladesh,\u201d Islam said as he read out the declaration.",
      "He said that the mass uprising wasn't merely about ousting a government, but also about reshaping the entire political framework.",
      "The party is committed to fostering a political culture where \u201cunity prevails over division, justice replaces vengeance, and merit triumphs over dynastic politics,\u201d Islam said.",

      "Islam and his colleagues have been campaigning for months for Hasina to be put on trial for hundreds of deaths during the July-August uprising. The student leaders involved in the new party have also talked fiercely against India, accusing the neighboring country of exhibiting hegemony over Bangladesh, drawing a sharp reaction from India.",
      "On Friday, a giant stage was installed on a major thoroughfare just in front of the Parliament building in Dhaka. The organizers said they expected up to 300,000 people during the party\u2019s launch. But witnesses said up to 50,000 attended the event.",
      "After the installation of the interim government, Yunus repeatedly said that he was appointed by the students who led the anti-Hasina uprising.",
      "It wasn't clear if Yunus had any direct role behind forming the new party, but many critics of Yunus said, mainly on social media, that the formation of the party is an effort to unveil a \u201cking\u2019s party.\u201d",

      "A key price gauge declined last month, a sign that inflation may be cooling though stiff tariffs threatened by the White House threaten that progress",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. consumers cut back sharply on spending last month, the most since February 2021, even as inflation declined, though stiff tariffs threatened by the White House could disrupt that progress.",
      "Americans cut their spending by 0.2% in January from the previous month, the Commerce Department said Friday, likely in part because of unseasonably cold weather. Yet the retreat may be hinting at more caution by consumers amid rising economic uncertainty.",
      "Inflation declined to 2.5% in January compared with a year earlier, down from 2.6% in December, the government said. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices dropped to 2.6%, the lowest since June, from 2.9%.",
      "One other bright spot in the report was that incomes jumped 0.9% in January from December, fueled in part by a large annual cost of living adjustment for Social Security beneficiaries.",
      "Inflation spiked in 2022 to its highest level in four decades, propelling President Donald Trump to the White House and causing the Federal Reserve to rapidly raise interest rates to tame prices. It has since fallen from a peak of 7.2%.",
      "Last month\u2019s decline could reassure Fed officials that inflation is still slowly cooling. The Fed prefers Friday\u2019s measure to the more widely-known consumer price index, which rose for the fourth straight month in January to 3%. Friday\u2019s gauge calculates inflation slightly differently: For example, it puts less weight on the costs of housing and used cars.",
      "Even so, the key question preoccupying many American consumers, investors, and business executives is whether Trump\u2019s extensive tariff proposals will push prices higher in the coming months. Trump said Thursday he will double his recently-announced tariffs on Chinese imports to 20%, and will impose 25% import taxes on Canada and Mexico next Tuesday. The three countries are the United States\u2019 top trading partners.",
      "Trump is also calling for widespread layoffs of federal workers, which could cause hundreds of thousands of job losses and potentially lift the unemployment rate.",
      "\u201cIncreased uncertainty surrounding trade, fiscal and regulatory policy is casting a shadow over the outlook,\u201d said Lydia Boussour, a senior economist at accounting and consulting firm EY.",
      "Americans also likely cut back on their spending after a healthy winter holiday season that saw a surge in credit card debt in December, economists noted.",
      "On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.3% in January from the previous month, matching December\u2019s 0.3% increase. Core prices rose 0.3%, up from 0.2% in December. If sustained, January\u2019s increases would keep inflation running above the Fed\u2019s target. The Fed pays more attention to core prices because they provide a better read of future inflation.",
      "A big concern right now is whether tariffs will push up inflation, or slow the economy, or \u2014 in a particularly toxic combination \u2014 both.",
      "A report from the Federal Reserve\u2019s Boston branch this month concluded that 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, along with Trump\u2019s initial 10% import taxes on China, could lift core inflation by as much as 0.8 percentage points.",
      "The last time Trump imposed tariffs in 2018-19, inflation was largely unaffected \u2014 but those tariffs were on a much narrower range of goods. And the economy still slowed, prompting the Fed to cut interest rates.",
      "Worries about tariffs pushing prices higher have sent consumer confidence plunging, unwinding the modest gains that had occurred after the election. Americans are also expecting inflation to move higher in the coming months. That\u2019s a risky trend because if consumers and businesses expect higher prices, they may act in ways to lift inflation, such as accelerating their purchases and boosting demand."

      "The U.S. lobster industry continued a multiyear slide in catch last year",
      "SCARBOROUGH, Maine -- The U.S. lobster industry's catch keeps sliding as fishermen contend with the northward migration of the valuable crustaceans.",
      "The industry is based mostly in Maine, where lobsters are both a cultural signifier and the backbone of the coastal economy. The state's haul of lobsters has declined every year from 2021, when it was nearly 111 million pounds, to 2023, when it was less than 97 million pounds.",
      "That decline extended into 2024, when the haul was about 86.1 million pounds, according to data released by state regulators on Friday. That is the lowest figure in 15 years. A series of major storms that damaged waterfront communities and disrupted fisheries was a key factor in the reduced catch, officials said.",
      "Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, praised the industry for its perseverance.",
      "\u201cDuring a year shaped by unprecedented storms and damage to our working waterfronts, Maine\u2019s commercial fishermen, aquaculturists, and seafood dealers once again delivered a major economic benefit to our state,\u201d she said.",
      "Last year\u2019s catch was still historically high, as Maine fishermen never exceeded 80 million pounds prior to 2009. Hauls in the 2000s were typically between 50 million and 80 million pounds. Hauls in the mid-2010s were routinely above 120 million pounds.",
      "The fishery remained economically strong in 2024. Maine fishermen took home more than $528 million at the docks, and that was the highest total since 2021, state officials said. Demand for the product, one of the most expensive seafoods, remained high, and the price per pound was one of the highest on record.",
      "The state is meeting the challenges of climate change head-on, said Patrick Keliher, the commissioner of the Maine Department of Marine Resources. The governor has secured funding to \"help rebuild damaged coastal infrastructure, make it more resilient to the effects of climate change, and protect critically important waterfront access for those who make a living on the water,\u201d he said.",
      "But numerous environmental and economic challenges threaten the industry's future. One of the biggest is the decline in the number of baby lobsters settling off New England. The young lobsters have to take shelter and grow to legal size to sustain the future of the fishery. Scientists have said the lobster population is migrating north to cooler habitats as oceans warm.",
      "The Maine lobster industry is also linked to Canada\u2019s seafood industry and could be disrupted by new tariffs. Canadian fishermen harvest the same species of lobster as American fishermen, and much of the processing capacity for the seafood is in Canada. Tariffs are likely to increase prices on both sides of the border, members of the industry have said.",
      "Another major challenge is the possibility of new rules to protect critically endangered North Atlantic right whales, which are vulnerable to entanglement in commercial fishing gear. Fishing groups have engaged in protracted court cases against the government over stricter fishing rules.",
      "Other states, including Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Hampshire, also have lobster fishing industries, but Maine's is by far the largest, and the size of the Maine harvest gives a firm indication of the health of the American lobster industry at large. Maine accounted for about 78% of the country's total lobster haul in 2023."

      "Egg producers blame the ongoing bird flu outbreak for driving prices up to record highs",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Egg producers blame the bird flu outbreak for driving prices to record highs, but critics believe giant companies are taking advantage of their market dominance to profit handsomely at the expense of budget-conscious egg buyers.",
      "Advocacy groups, Democratic lawmakers and a Federal Trade Commission member are calling for a government investigation after egg prices spiked to a record average of $4.95 per dozen this month. The Trump administration did unveil a plan this week to combat bird flu, but how much that might ease egg prices \u2014 a key driver of inflation \u2014 remains to be seen.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump promised to lower food prices on \u2018Day One\u2019, but with egg prices skyrocketing out of control, he fired the workers charged with containing bird flu. Working families need relief now,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren said in a statement.",
      "The industry, and most experts, squarely blame bird flu. More than 166 million birds have been slaughtered to contain the virus. Some 30 million egg layers have been wiped out just since January, significantly disrupting egg supplies. The Department of Agriculture's longstanding policy has been to kill entire flocks anytime the virus is found on a farm.",
      "As a result, the number of egg layers has dropped nationwide by about 12% from before the outbreak to 292 million birds, according to a Feb. 1 USDA estimate, but another 11 million egg layers have been killed since then, so it's likely worse. When prices spiked to $4.82 two years ago and prompted initial calls for price gouging probes, the flock was above 300 million.",
      "\u201cThis has nothing to do with anything other than bird flu. And I think to suggest anything else is a misreading of the facts and the reality,\u201d American Egg Board President Emily Metz said.",
      "\u201cOur farmers are in the fight of their lives, period, full stop. And they\u2019re doing everything they can to keep these birds safe,\" Metz said. \"This is a supply challenge. Due to bird flu. Nothing else.\u201d",
      "Farm Action suspects monopolistic behavior. The group that lobbies on behalf of smaller farmers, consumers and rural communities notes that egg production is only down about 4% from last year and some 7.57 billion table eggs were produced last month, yet some consumers are still finding egg shelves empty at their local grocery stores.",
      "\u201cDominant egg corporations are blaming avian flu for the price hikes that we\u2019re seeing. But while the egg supply has fallen only slightly, these companies profits have soared,\u201d said Angela Huffman, Farm Action's president. The Justice Department acknowledged receiving the group's letter calling for an investigation but declined to comment on it.",
      "The fact that a jury ruled in 2023 that major egg producers used various means to limit the domestic supply of eggs to increase the price of products during the 2000s only adds to the doubts about their motives now.",
      "Retail egg prices had generally remained below $2 per dozen for years before this outbreak began. Prices have more than doubled since then, boosting profits for egg producers even as they deal with soaring costs.",
      "Most of the dominant producers are privately held companies and don't release their results. But the biggest, Cal-Maine Foods, which supplies about 20% of the nation's eggs, is public, and its profits increased dramatically. Cal-Maine reported a $219 million profit in the most recent quarter when its eggs sold for an average of $2.74 per dozen, up from just $1.2 million in the quarter just before this outbreak began in early 2022 when its eggs were selling for $1.37 per dozen.",
      "Sherman Miller, Cal-Maine\u2019s president and CEO, said in reporting the numbers that higher market prices \"have continued to rise this fiscal year as supply levels of shell eggs have been restricted due to recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza.\u201d",
      "But he said Cal-Maine also sold significantly more eggs \u2014 some 330 million dozens, up from 288 million the year before \u2014 in the quarter because demand is so strong and Cal-Maine has made a number of acquisitions. Cal-Maine also suffered few outbreaks on its farms, outside of a couple facilities in Kansas and Texas. The Mississippi-based company didn't respond to calls from The Associated Press.",
      "Economists and analysts say the record egg prices aren't a sure sign of something nefarious, and short-term profits might only last until farms get hit. Once a flock is slaughtered, it can take as long as a year to clean a farm and raise new birds to egg-laying age. The USDA pays farmers for every bird killed, but it doesn't cover all the costs for farmers as they go without income.",
      "\u201cThe consumer, I think, will probably feel like they\u2019re getting the rough end of the stick. But I guarantee you, the farmers that are having to depopulate the barns, they\u2019re having a rougher time,\u201d CoBank analyst Brian Earnest said.",
      "Inflation in the costs of feed and fuel and labor have contributed to rising egg prices, and farmers have been investing in biosecurity measures to help keep the virus away. So production costs also appear to be at an all-time high, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' producer price index.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t a case where they\u2019re taking the price up to gouge the market. It is the price is going up through auction at wholesale. And they\u2019re benefiting from higher prices because supplies are tight,\u201d University of Arkansas agricultural economist Jada Thompson said.",

      "President Donald Trump has made the raw materials of modern life a pillar of U.S. foreign policy",
      "CHEYENNE, Wyo. -- President Donald Trump is taking a step toward granting the U.S. mining industry\u2019s biggest wishes by singling out one metal as a focus of his domestic minerals policy: copper.",
      "From talk of acquiring Greenland and its vast mineral wealth to prodding Ukraine for minerals in exchange for help fending off Russia's invasion, Trump has made the raw materials of modern life a pillar of his foreign policy.",
      "An executive order Trump signed Tuesday calls for boosting the domestic copper industry by investigating the national security implications of imports and weighing tariffs as a response.",
      "\u201cThe United States has ample copper reserves, yet our smelting and refining capacity lags significantly behind global competitors,\u201d the order reads.",
      "It could mean a new day for U.S. copper mining, and new worries for environmental groups that are contesting proposals such as the stalled Twin Metals project in northern Minnesota's Boundary Waters, a lake-filled wilderness on the U.S.-Canada border.",
      "\u201cThe White House itself acknowledges that America has \u2018ample supplies\u2019 of copper. Sacrificing an irreplaceable national treasure for an insignificant amount of copper is reckless and unnecessary,\u201d Ingrid Lyons, executive director of the Save the Boundary Waters, said by email.",
      "Copper is at least as crucial as lithium and cobalt for rechargeable batteries and rare-earth elements for cellphones, LED lights and flat-screen TVs. Copper goes into the cords and transmission lines that plug gadgetry into power.",
      "\u201cCopper is, I think, the metal that is really the most critical because it is the electricity metal,\u201d said Debra Struhsacker, a mining industry policy consultant. \u201cThe electricity demand is, I think, going to stay. And copper is indispensable for that.\u201d",
      "U.S. copper use, imports and exports have fluctuated somewhat over the past two decades, according to the Copper Development Association, but a dearth of smelting compared with the amount mined domestically has remained a consistent theme.",
      "While the U.S. in 2024 mined an estimated 1.1 million tons (1 million metric tons) of copper and exported about a third of that in primarily unrefined form, it imported 810,000 tons (735,000 metric tons), nearly all of it refined, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.",
      "Trump's executive order accurately refers to China as the world's leading refiner of copper, with over half the world's smelting capacity. China, however, does not directly factor into U.S. supplies. Two-thirds of U.S. imports of refined copper comes from Chile, which is the world's leading copper producer, with lesser amounts from Canada, Mexico and Peru.",
      "How much those numbers might change with rising copper demand to support construction of transmission lines and manufacturing of wind turbines and electric vehicles remains to be seen. Some predict global demand to double by 2030 and keep rising, notes the National Mining Association.",
      "Even before Trump's plan for copper, the association was encouraged by Trump executive orders promoting mining. One lifts government rules and regulations responsible for \u201cundue burdens\u201d on mining and mineral processing, calls for updating the U.S. Geological Survey's list of minerals deemed critical to the nation and backs efforts to find and mine new sources of those minerals.",
      "\u201cMade in America, America first, starts with American mining and American miners that supported this president across the country,\u201d National Mining Association president and CEO Rich Nolan said.",
      "The mining association's top priorities include:",
      "\u2014 The planned $1.7 billion Twin Metals copper-nickel-cobalt mine that environmental groups contend poses an unacceptable risk to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in northeastern Minnesota, the most visited federally designated wilderness area. The latest blow to the project came when a judge refused to reinstate mining leases.",
      "\u2014 The stalled $1 billion NewRange Copper Nickel mine, also in northeastern Minnesota, which developers look to redesign to make more environmentally and cost-efficient after a series of court and regulatory setbacks.",
      "\u2014 The contested Resolution Copper project at Oak Flat in central Arizona, which is believed to be the world's third-biggest deposit of copper ore and was the site of a battle between locals who want the mine for economic development and native Apache who consider the land sacred. An appeals court panel in 2024 refused to block a crucial land transfer for the mine.",
      "\u2014 Southern Arizona's proposed Copper World copper-molybdenum mine, formerly known as the Rosemont mine, which has been delayed by a court ruling that limited how mining companies can discard tailings on U.S. Forest Service land under the 1872 Mining Law.",
      "All four projects are led by non-U.S. companies including Toronto, Canada-based Hudbay Minerals Inc., developer of Copper World.",
      "The federal government should have a national strategy to protect the environment and public health by avoiding new terrain and increasing production at existing mines operating at less than full capacity, said Rob Peters, executive director of Save the Scenic Santa Ritas, a group opposing Copper World.",
      "\u201cThat would make sense, right? But there\u2019s nothing like that. Instead, it\u2019s sort of like the Wild West where companies \u2014 in our case here in Arizona, the majority of them foreign companies \u2014 just can come in. And the only decision-making process is the company figures out where they think they can make the most money,\u201d Peters said.",
      "Decades ago, Arizona copper made the U.S. the world's top producer. Now it ranks fifth.",
      "To Struhsacker, the industry consultant, lack of government coordination has stalled permits and stifled mine development. Trump's executive orders recognize the need \u201cto make permitting work again,\u201d she said."

      "For 47 million American households, cooking means a gas stove",
      "NEW YORK -- For years, Ed Yaker, treasurer of a New York City co-op with nearly 1,500 units, and fellow board members have dealt with gas leaks. It can mean the gas at an entire building is shut off, leaving residents unable to use a stove for months until expensive repairs are made to gas lines.",
      "So Yaker was all in when he learned of a California startup called Copper that was manufacturing an electric stove and oven that could simply be plugged into a regular outlet. The sleek, standard four-burner electric induction stove runs on 120 volts, meaning there is no need to pay a licensed electrician thousands of dollars to rewire to 240 volts, which many electric stoves require.",
      "\u201cIn terms of, \u2018Is this the way to go?\u2019 It\u2019s a no brainer,\u201d Yaker said, demonstrating a quart of water that boiled in about two minutes. His apartment is full of books, many on energy and climate change, and the energy efficiency was a motivation, too.",
      "Then there are the health benefits of cooking with electricity. Gas stoves, which 47 million Americans use, release pollutants like nitrogen dioxide that has been linked to asthma and cancer-causing benzene.",
      "\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t stand over the tailpipe of a car breathing in the exhaust from that car. And yet nearly 50 million households stand over a gas stove, breathing the same pollutants in their homes,\u201d said Rob Jackson, an environmental scientist at Stanford University and lead author on a study on pollution from gas cooking.",
      "\u201cI had a gas stove until I started this line of research. Watching pollutant levels rise almost immediately every time I turned a burner on, or my oven on, was enough to get me to switch\u201d to an electric stove, he said.",
      "Induction stoves are also a way to address the considerable amount of climate change that comes from buildings \u2014 emissions from cooking, heating and cooling living spaces and hot water.",
      "In the case of gas stoves, about half of the flame\u2019s heat escapes into the room. Electric stoves by comparison can be up to 80% efficient. Of those, induction stoves come out on top with up to 90% efficiency in part because they only heat where the surface contacts the pot.",
      "Just the presence of a gas stove in a home contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, even when it\u2019s not turned on. Jackson's team found gas stoves bleed methane \u2014 the main constituent of natural gas \u2014 when they\u2019re off, from loose fittings and at connections between the stove and wall. The climate impact of leaky stoves in U.S. homes was estimated to be comparable to carbon emissions from 500,000 gasoline-powered cars.",
      "The stove contains a battery that is smart, meaning it can charge up when electrical rates are low, allowing people to cook without incurring peak-rate electrical charges.",
      "The new Copper stoves are not cheap. Early adopters are relying on government incentives to defray the cost. When Yaker, who worked as a teacher and was a saver, bought his, it was $6,000 and a federal tax credit for clean energy appliances brought that down to $4,200.",
      "The manufacturer now has an agreement with the New York City Housing Authority to buy 10,000 stoves at a maximum price of $3,200 each, set to arrive in 2026.",
      "Eden Housing in Martinez, California, retrofit one of its 32-apartment buildings with Copper stoves using state and local programs. The affordable housing group plans to purchase more.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool, it looks nice and it\u2019s easy to clean,\u201d said Jolene Cardoza, about the new appliance. Her adult daughter\u2019s asthma was irritated by her old gas stove when she would come over to bake and she\u2019s happy the Copper doesn\u2019t release pollutants.",
      "Other tenants found the transition to induction cooking more bumpy.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t really like the way it cooks my food in the oven,\u201d said Monica Moore, who notices a difference in the texture of her cornbread. She is impressed with how quickly water boils, but misses cooking with a flame and said it was a hassle to switch out her pans with ones that are compatible with induction stoves.",
      "For Jackson, though, the change is important.",
      "\u201cI think shutting the gas off to our homes and electrifying our homes is one of the best things that we can control individually to reduce our personal greenhouse gas emissions. I think of cars and homes as the two places to start for reducing our greenhouse gas footprint,\u201d said Jackson.",

      "LONDON -- The U.K. government gave its provisional backing Thursday to the creation of a second runway at Gatwick Airport outside London if certain improvements were met, including on noise reduction \u2014 a move that has been met with incredulity from environmental campaigners.",
      "Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said in a written statement that she was \"minded to approve\u201d the expansion, which would involve moderately moving Gatwick's northern standby runway used for planes to taxi or as a backup.",
      "The original Gatwick project, which was rejected but then revised by planning inspectors, means that the final approval may be delayed by nine months.",
      "Under the new plan, Gatwick will have to ensure at least 50% of passengers traveling to and from the airport do so by public transport and take steps to mitigate noise.",
      "Gatwick, which is about 40 miles (65 kilometers) south of London and serves more than 40 million passengers a year, is the country's busiest single-runway airport, and second-busiest overall behind London's Heathrow Airport.",
      "Under the plan, Gatwick will have to move the current emergency runway 12 meters (39 feet) north away from the main runway in order to meet international safety standards. That would allow it to be used for departures of narrow-bodied planes such as Airbus A320s and Boeing 737s.",
      "The project, which will be funded privately, is expected to cost 2.2 billion pounds ($2.8 billion), could be completed by the end of the decade, if construction begins later this year.",
      "The expansion would allow it to cater for another 100,000 flights a year, taking capacity up to more than 380,000. It's projected to create 14,000 new jobs and generate 1 billion pounds ($1.26 billion) in annual economic benefits to the country.",
      "Gatwick, which is majority-owned by France-based VINCI Airports, has until April 24 to formally respond to the new proposals, while Alexander is expected to make a final decision shortly after that date, although a deadline has been extended to Oct. 27.",

      "A spike in demand for electricity from tech companies competing in the artificial intelligence race is upending forecasts for natural gas-fired power in the U.S., as utilities reconsider it as a major new power source",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- A spike in demand for electricity from tech companies competing in the artificial intelligence race is upending forecasts for natural gas-fired power in the U.S., as utilities reconsider it as a major new power source.",
      "That is not what many scientists and climate activists envisioned in the fight against climate change. And it is endangering progress on the greenhouse gas-reduction goals that scientists say are necessary to manage the damage from burning fossil fuels that warms the planet.",
      "Across the nation, tech companies are snapping up real estate and seeking new power projects to feed their energy-hungry operations.",
      "In some cases, Big Tech is building climate-friendlier projects like solar, wind, geothermal or battery storage.",
      "But industry decision-makers are also turning to natural gas for what they say is a cheap and reliable source of power, raising the prospect that gas-fired power will play a bigger role \u2014 and for a longer period of time \u2014 than even they had anticipated.",
      "\u201cGas is growing faster now and in the medium term than ever before,\u201d said Corianna Mah, a power and renewables analyst at data analytics firm Enverus.",
      "Before the spike in electricity demand last year, many in the industry had assumed that there would be few new gas plants and that the nation's fleet would gradually retire in favor of a grid powered by wind, solar, geothermal, batteries and possibly the next generation of nuclear power \u2014 sources that don't emit the planet-warming greenhouse gas carbon dioxide.",
      "For many countries, that ramp down is happening as they work toward the goal of slashing their emissions to zero \u2014 or at least, net zero \u2014 by 2050, which scientists say could help the world avoid the worst effects of climate change.",
      "In the U.S., the electric power sector is the second-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, according to government figures. And the construction of every new natural gas plant \u2014 built to last for decades \u2014 is a setback for climate goals, said John Quigley, a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania's Kleinman Center for Energy Policy.",
      "\u201cAt a top level, we will not get to net zero by 2050 if we are building new gas plants. Period,\u201d Quigley said.",
      "Burning natural gas emits carbon dioxide, and before that, when it escapes from wellheads or pipelines in its unburned form, it's an even more potent greenhouse gas called methane.",
      "Quigley and others say there is enough solar, wind and battery storage projects on the drawing board to satisfy growing electricity demand. But, they say, utilities and grid operators lack the will to abandon natural gas.",
      "Enverus now projects the next five years will bring roughly 46 gigawatts of gas-fired power online. That compares to 39 gigawatts in the past five years, it said.",
      "Announcements last year alone include:",
      "\u2014 two 705-megawatt plants by Evergy in Kansas;",
      "\u2014 Entergy's 2,300-megawatt plant to serve Meta\u2019s $10 billion AI data center in northern Louisiana, a pair of new plants in Texas and another in Mississippi;",
      "\u2014 a 1,450-megawatt plant by the Tennessee Valley Authority;",
      "\u2014 a 1,400 megawatt Duke Energy project in North Carolina;",
      "\u2014 and Georgia Power's plans for three oil or gas units with a capacity of up to 1,300 megawatts.",
      "And that\u2019s not all.",
      "Calpine said it's exploring new gas-fired capacity in the congested mid-Atlantic region, especially Pennsylvania and Ohio, where analysts say the grid operator is trying to fast-track new gas-fired power plants into service.",
      "In Pennsylvania, the former Homer City coal-fired power plant is being transformed into a massive gas-fired station that's expected to supply a data center \u2014 and got a $5 million state grant to do it.",
      "On top of the artificial intelligence boom, the frenzy for new electricity is fueled by cryptomining, the broader electrification of society and a bipartisan push to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.",
      "It is coinciding with the closure of coal plants and aging nuclear plants, unable to compete with cheaper gas, solar and wind.",
      "Across the U.S., gas pipeline operators are exuberant about the new demand and are reporting strong interest in extending their lines.",
      "Chris Kalnin, the CEO of BKV, the largest natural-gas producer in the Barnett Shale gas reservoir in Texas, said the trend there is toward gas plants being built next to data centers in a booming data center corridor in metropolitan Dallas.",
      "Data center developers there are in an \u201carms race\u201d to secure power, Kalnin said.",
      "\u201cData center guys are trying to source power and trying to get to market with their data centers as fast as possible,\" Kalnin said. The key to signing up cloud-computing customers \"is getting your facility online quickly and getting your facility online quickly requires you to have power and dependable power and a cost-efficient power source.\u201d",
      "Rob Jennings of the American Petroleum Institute, said the sudden growth in actual and forecast electricity demand has put a premium on power sources that can be built fast and cheaply and are reliable.",
      "That means natural gas is once again attractive to investors over solar and wind, he said.",
      "\u201cIn the near term, the reality has dawned on most that it has to be gas,\u201d Jennings said.",
      "Industry officials say they strive to deliver electricity that is clean, reliable and affordable.",
      "For instance, some new gas plants are replacing higher-pollution coal-fired plants, some are designed to run only at times of high demand, some are paired with battery storage or a wind farm nearby and some are designed with carbon-capture technology or to run on a hydrogen blend, said Alex Bond of the Edison Electric Institute, which represents U.S. investor-owned electric companies.",
      "At the very least, building gas-fired capacity will have high-level political support.",
      "In his remarks to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland last month, President Donald Trump declared that he'd issue \u201cemergency declarations\u201d to get coal - and gas-plants built to make the U.S. a superpower of manufacturing, cryptomining and artificial intelligence.",
      "But Amanda Levin of the Natural Resources Defense Council said the U.S. must take big steps by 2035 to reduce its reliance on gas.",
      "That means slashing a fleet of roughly 1,500 gas plants down to about 100 if the U.S. is to meet strong climate commitments and preserve a chance of addressing climate change, she said.",
      "Still, she said there are reasons to be optimistic that gas plant projects on the drawing board won\u2019t get built.",
      "In recent weeks, Chinese tech startup Deepseek released a new AI model that it boasted was on par with similar models from U.S. companies and at a fraction of the cost \u2014 calling into question the need for a massive expansion of energy-hungry data centers.",
      "And some analysts believe utilities overestimate the electricity they\u2019ll need, essentially by double- or triple-counting data center proposals when firms express interest in multiple locations \u2014 but only build in one.",
      "Besides, Levin said, data center operators are getting better at energy efficiency, particularly in how they cool their servers.",
      "Even if all the gas plants are built, they may not get used, she said.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of reasons,\u201d Levin said, \"for why we might not actually see all of this (demand) materialize.\u201d",

      "PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. -- Two days after Joe Highsmith made a nervy par putt to make the cut, he won the Cognizant Classic with the lowest weekend ever at PGA National and is going to the Masters.",
      "Highsmith rallied from a four-shot deficit Sunday with three straight birdies around the turn and a 20-foot birdie putt on the par-3 17th that all but clinched it, giving him another 6-under 64 to win his first PGA Tour title by two shots.",
      "\u201cWinning was the last thing on my mind,\u201d Highsmith said. \u201cIt's incredible to come out on top. I played probably the best round of my life.\u201d",
      "Highsmith had a little help from Jake Knapp, who opened the tournament with a 59 and held it together until one shot into the water and two more to get out.",
      "Knapp, trying to become the first wire-to-wire winner in tournament history, had a one-shot lead when his wedge to the 11th came up short and into the water, with only half of the golf ball submerged. He tried to blast out and it trickled down the slope and back to the water. He tried again, this time the ball holding up in the rough.",
      "\u201cDidn\u2019t hit any of them really hard enough, unfortunately,\u201d Knapp said.",
      "He would up with a triple bogey and never caught up. Knapp didn't make another birdie the rest of the way, closed with a 72 and tied for sixth along with Michael Kim (71), who played with him in the final group.",
      "Jacob Bridgeman closed with a 64 and J.J. Spaun had a 66 to share second place.",
      "\u201cI was trying to make as many birdies as I could,\u201d Bridgeman said. \u201cI knew I had to do something kind of extraordinary today to catch the leaders, and I caught them, but they\u2019re only on the ninth hole.\u201d",
      "His runner-up finish was enough to get him into the Arnold Palmer Invitational next week.",
      "Highsmith, a 24-year-old lefty with a bucket hat and a broad smile, became the first player to make the cut on the number and win since Brandt Snedeker at Torrey Pines in 2016.",
      "With so many players in the mix going into the final round, it was set up to be a wild finish, and five players had at least a share of the lead at one point.",
      "Highsmith eliminated the drama in the final hour with a flawless round and an unforgettable weekend he played in 14-under 128. His big run started with a wedge to 3 feet on No. 9. He two-putted for birdie on the par-5 10th and rolled in an 18-foot birdie on No. 11.",
      "He added a 15-foot birdie putt at the 13th to take control, and then sealed it with his birdie putt down the slope on the 17th.",
      "Highsmith was all smiles coming off the 18th green with his caddie Joe LaCava IV, the son of the caddie who was on the bag for Masters champions Fred Couples in 1992 and Tiger Woods in 2019, and who now works for Patrick Cantlay.",
      "Highsmith is the second first-time winner in as many weeks, following Brian Campbell winning the Mexico Open. He finished at 19-under 265 and picked up plenty of perks. Along with earning a place in the Masters and PGA Championship, Highsmith is in the remaining five signature events, starting next week at Bay Hill.",
      "Jordan Spieth had four birdies in a five-hole stretch around the turn to get on the fringe of contention, only to play the final six holes in 1 over for a 68 to tie for ninth, his second top 10 in four starts since returning from wrist surgery last August.",
      "Florida State junior Luke Clanton, who secured a PGA Tour card through the PGA Tour University program by making the cut, shot 69 and tied for 18th.",
      "Highsmith shot the lowest 72-hole score since the tournament moved to PGA National, which has held two PGA Championships and a Ryder Cup, in 2007. The course was overseeded, making the rough less daunting and the fairways softer.",
      "\u201cI get that the overseed was there and the wind was down, but it\u2019s still a stressful golf course, and this was some of the best golf I\u2019ve seen played relative to what I would have thought would have happened on a golf course in quite a while,\u201d Spieth said. \u201cIt's crazy good golf out there.\u201d",

      "A private lunar lander has touched down on the moon, delivering a drill and other experiments for NASA",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- A private lunar lander carrying a drill, vacuum and other experiments for NASA touched down on the moon Sunday, the latest in a string of companies looking to kickstart business on Earth's celestial neighbor ahead of astronaut missions.",
      "Firefly Aerospace\u2019s Blue Ghost lander descended from lunar orbit on autopilot, aiming for the slopes of an ancient volcanic dome in an impact basin on the moon\u2019s northeastern edge of the near side.",
      "Confirmation of successful touchdown came from the company's Mission Control outside Austin, Texas, following the action some 225,000 miles (360,000 kilometers) away.",
      "\u201cYou all stuck the landing. We\u2019re on the moon,\u201d Firefly\u2019s Will Coogan, chief engineer for the lander, reported.",
      "An upright and stable landing makes Firefly \u2014 a startup founded a decade ago \u2014 the first private outfit to put a spacecraft on the moon without crashing or falling over. Even countries have faltered, with only five claiming success: Russia, the U.S., China, India and Japan.",
      "A half hour after landing, Blue Ghost started to send back pictures from the surface, the first one a selfie somewhat obscured by the sun's glare. The second shot included the home planet, a blue dot glimmering in the blackness of space.",
      "Two other companies\u2019 landers are hot on Blue Ghost\u2019s heels, with the next one expected to join it on the moon later this week.",
      "Blue Ghost \u2014 named after a rare U.S. species of fireflies \u2014 had its size and shape going for it. The squat four-legged lander stands 6-foot-6 (2 meters) tall and 11 feet (3.5 meters) wide, providing extra stability, according to the company.",
      "Launched in mid-January from Florida, the lander carried 10 experiments to the moon for NASA. The space agency paid $101 million for the delivery, plus $44 million for the science and tech on board. It\u2019s the third mission under NASA\u2019s commercial lunar delivery program, intended to ignite a lunar economy of competing private businesses while scouting around before astronauts show up later this decade.",
      "Firefly\u2019s Ray Allensworth said the lander skipped over hazards including boulders to land safely. Allensworth said the team continued to analyze the data to figure out the lander's exact position, but all indications suggest it landed within the 328-foot (100-meter) target zone in Mare Crisium.",
      "The demos should get two weeks of run time, before lunar daytime ends and the lander shuts down.",
      "It carried a vacuum to suck up moon dirt for analysis and a drill to measure temperature as deep as 10 feet (3 meters) below the surface. Also on board: a device for eliminating abrasive lunar dust \u2014 a scourge for NASA\u2019s long-ago Apollo moonwalkers, who got it caked all over their spacesuits and equipment.",
      "On its way to the moon, Blue Ghost beamed back exquisite pictures of the home planet. The lander continued to stun once in orbit around the moon, with detailed shots of the moon's gray pockmarked surface. At the same time, an on-board receiver tracked and acquired signals from the U.S. GPS and European Galileo constellations, an encouraging step forward in navigation for future explorers.",
      "The landing set the stage for a fresh crush of visitors angling for a piece of lunar business.",
      "Another lander \u2014 a tall and skinny 15-footer (4 meters tall) built and operated by Houston-based Intuitive Machines \u2014 is due to land on the moon Thursday. It\u2019s aiming for the bottom of the moon, just 100 miles (160 kilometers) from the south pole. That\u2019s closer to the pole than the company got last year with its first lander, which broke a leg and tipped over.",
      "Despite the tumble, Intuitive Machines' lander put the U.S. back on the moon for the first time since NASA astronauts closed out the Apollo program in 1972.",
      "A third lander from the Japanese company ispace is still three months from landing. It shared a rocket ride with Blue Ghost from Cape Canaveral on Jan. 15, taking a longer, windier route. Like Intuitive Machines, ispace is also attempting to land on the moon for the second time. Its first lander crashed in 2023.",
      "The moon is littered with wreckage not only from ispace, but dozens of other failed attempts over the decades.",
      "NASA wants to keep up a pace of two private lunar landers a year, realizing some missions will fail, said the space agency's top science officer Nicky Fox.",
      "\u201cIt really does open up a whole new way for us to get more science to space and to the moon,\" Fox said.",
      "Unlike NASA\u2019s successful Apollo moon landings that had billions of dollars behind them and ace astronauts at the helm, private companies operate on a limited budget with robotic craft that must land on their own, said Firefly CEO Jason Kim.",
      "Kim said everything went like clockwork.",

      "Landing a spacecraft on the moon has long been a series of hits and misses",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Landing a spacecraft on the moon has long been a series of hits and misses.",
      "Last year, a spacecraft built by Intuitive Machines through a NASA-sponsored program put the U.S. back on the moon for the first time since the end of the Apollo program, but the lander ended up tipping on its side and operated briefly on the surface.",
      "Now another U.S. company \u2014 Firefly Aerospace \u2014 on Sunday added its lunar lander to the win list, becoming the first private entity to pull off a fully successful moon landing.",
      "Both U.S. businesses are part of NASA\u2019s effort to support commercial deliveries to the moon ahead of astronaut missions later this decade.",
      "The moon is littered with wreckage from failed landings over the years. A rundown on the moon\u2019s winners and losers:",
      "The Soviet Union\u2019s Luna 9 successfully touches down on the moon in 1966, after its predecessors crash or miss the moon altogether. The U.S. follows four months later with Surveyor 1. Both countries achieve more robotic landings, as the race heats up to land men.",
      "NASA clinches the space race with the Soviets in 1969 with a moon landing by Apollo 11\u2019s Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. Twelve astronauts explore the surface over six missions, before the program ends with Apollo 17 in 1972. Still the only country to send humans to the moon, the U.S. hopes to return crews to the surface by the end of 2026 or so, a year after a lunar fly-around by astronauts.",
      "China, in 2013, becomes the third country to successfully land on the moon, delivering a rover named Yutu, Chinese for jade rabbit. China follows with the Yutu-2 rover in 2019, this time touching down on the moon\u2019s unexplored far side \u2014 an impressive first. A sample return mission on the moon\u2019s near side in 2020 yields nearly 4 pounds (1.7 kilograms) of lunar rocks and dirt. Another sample return mission from the far side in 2024 delivers rocks and soil from the less explored part of the moon . Seen as NASA\u2019s biggest moon rival, China aims to put its astronauts on the moon by 2030.",
      "In 2023, Russia tries for its first moon landing in nearly a half-century, but the Luna 25 spacecraft smashes into the moon. The country\u2019s previous lander \u2014 1976\u2019s Luna 24 \u2014 not only landed, but returned moon rocks to Earth.",
      "After its first lander slams into the moon in 2019, India regroups and launches Chandrayaan-3 (Hindi for moon craft) in 2023. The craft successfully touches down, making India the fourth country to score a lunar landing. The win comes just four days after Russia\u2019s crash-landing.",
      "Japan becomes the fifth country to land successfully on the moon, with its spacecraft touching down in January. The craft lands on the wrong side, compromising its ability to generate solar power, but manages to crank out pictures and science before falling silent when the long lunar night sets in.",
      "A privately funded lander from Israel, named Beresheet, Hebrew for \u201cin the beginning,\u201d crashes into the moon in 2019. A Japanese entrepreneur\u2019s company, ispace, launches a lunar lander in 2023, but it, too, wrecks.",
      "Intuitive Machines becomes the first private outfit to achieve a safe moon landing. The lander tipped over on its side in 2024, but worked briefly with limited communications. Another U.S. company \u2014 Astrobotic Technology \u2014 tried to send a lander to the moon the same year, but had to give up because of a fuel leak, eventually returning to Earth and burning up over the Pacific.",
      "There's another private rush to the moon this year after Firefly landed Blue Ghost, delivering experiments for NASA. Intuitive Machines and ispace also plan more moon deliveries.",

      "LONDON -- Unwanted phone calls are out of control. Whether it's a robocall trying to sell you something or spam calls from scammers trying to rip you off, it's enough to make you want to stop answering your phone. So what can you do to stop them?",
      "The scourge of unwanted phone calls has been branded an epidemic by consumer groups, while the Federal Communications Commission says it's the top consumer complaint. The calls are a nuisance to many ordinary people, some of whom have complained to The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cI need help on getting spam calls to stop,\u201d one reader said in an email. She's getting up to 14 calls a day despite the countermeasures she's employed.",
      "As the name implies, robocalls are automated calls to deliver recorded messages to a large number of phones. A robocall purely to deliver a message or collect a debt is allowed under U.S. regulations, but the Federal Trade Commission says robocalls with a recorded voice trying to sell you something are illegal unless you've given explicit written permission to receive them. Many robocalls are also probably scams, the FTC warns.",
      "If you're flooded by unsolicited calls, here are some ways to fight back.",
      "Smartphone users can turn on some built-in settings to combat unknown calls.",
      "Apple advises iPhone users to turn on the Silence Unknown Callers feature. Go to your \u201cSettings,\u201d then scroll down to \u201cApps,\u201d and then to \u201cPhone,\u201d where you'll see it under the \u201cCalls\u201d section. When you turn this on, any calls from numbers that you've never been in touch with and aren't saved in your contacts list will not ring through. Instead, they'll be sent to voicemail and show up in your list of recent calls.",
      "Android has a similar setting that allows you to block calls from private or unidentified numbers, although you will still receive calls from numbers that aren't stored in your contact list.",
      "Just keep in mind that you could also end up not getting important calls, which sometimes come from unknown numbers.",
      "If an unwanted call does get through, both Android and iPhone users can block the individual phone number by tapping on it in the recent callers or call history list. You can also enter numbers directly into your phone's block list.",
      "Sign up for the national Do Not Call registry, which is a list of numbers that have opted out of most telemarketing calls. The Federal Trade Commission, which runs the registry, says it only contains phone numbers and holds no other personally identifiable information, nor does the registry know whether the number is for a landline or a cellphone.",
      "The FTC says there are some exemptions, including political calls, calls from non-profit groups and charities, and legitimate survey groups that aren't selling anything. Also allowed are calls from companies up to 18 months after you've done \u2014 or sought to do \u2014 business with them.",
      "But it also warns that while having your number on the registry will cut down on unwanted sales calls, it won\u2019t stop scammers from making illegal calls.",
      "Other countries have similar registries. Canada has its own Do Not Call list while the U.K. has the Telephone Preference Service.",
      "Check whether your wireless carrier has a call-blocking service. Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T, three of the biggest U.S. networks, all have their own call filters for customers to block robocalls and report spam. There's typically a free basic version and an advanced version that requires a subscription fee.",
      "If your phone company's filters aren't good enough, try third-party apps to weed out unwanted callers.",
      "There are a host of smartphone apps available that promise to block spam calls, like Nomorobo, YouMail, Hiya, RoboKiller, TrueCaller and others. Many charge a monthly or annual subscription fee but some offer a free basic option. Some also can be installed on landline phones, but only if they use VOIP technology, not copper cables.",
      "The Associated Press hasn't tested any of these apps and isn't making specific recommendations. We recommend you read user reviews and try some out for yourself.",
      "Apple says the apps work by comparing a caller's number with a list of known numbers and labeling them, for example, spam or telemarketing. Then it might automatically block the call. \u201cIncoming calls are never sent to third-party developers,\u201d the company says.",
      "Did you know you can file a complaint with the FCC about specific spam calls? You can do so easily through an online form. It might not give you immediate satisfaction, but the National Consumer Law Center says data on complaints is the best tool federal agencies have for determining how big a problem robocalls are.",
      "While companies you've done business with can make robocalls to you, the National Consumer Law Center says it's probably because you gave consent - possibly hidden in fine print. But you can also revoke your consent at any time.",
      "Just tell the company representative that you want to \u201crevoke consent,\u201d and if that doesn't stop them, contact customer service and tell them that you don't consent to receive calls and want your number added to the company's \u201cdo not call\u201d list, the center says.",
      "You might be tempted to try to engage with the call in an attempt to get your number off the call list or be put through to a real person. The FTC warns against doing this and recommends that you just hang up.",
      "\u201cPressing numbers to speak to someone or remove you from the list will probably only lead to more robocalls,\u201d the agency says on its advice page. \u201cAnd the number on your caller ID probably isn\u2019t real. Caller ID is easy to fake\" and can't be trusted, it says.",

    "story": [
      "In one of the most mud-slinging, wide-open Oscar races in years, picking winners is like walking a tightrope over a pit of snapping scandals.",
      "No sooner did \"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" -- a Spanish-language musical crime drama from a French director -- receive the most nominations (13) of any movie this year than its chances were dinged by resurfaced tweets from the film's star, Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, the first openly trans actress to score an acting nomination.",
      "Though Gasc\u00f3n has since apologized for her comments, many have wondered if the damage is insurmountable.",
      "Then there's the controversy around \"The Brutalist\" -- with 10 nominations, including best picture -- for using artificial intelligence to help acting nominees Adrien Brody and Felicity Jones in the very few scenes where they had to speak Hungarian.",
      "And what's with \"Anora\" -- boasting six nominations, including best picture -- filming all those sex scenes without an intimacy coordinator, as revealed by star and acting nominee Mikey Madison in a Variety chat?",
      "And does the blockbuster musical \"Wicked\" really deserve the top prize if it's only Part 1 of a film that won't be complete until Part 2 is released in November?",
      "Clearly these issues have absolutely nothing to do with the quality of the nominees themselves. The film academy is always concerned with how it looks to the outside world. Still, the heated battle between image and merit only adds to the fun, especially in a super competitive year like this one when trying to figure out how nearly 10,000 Oscar voters are going to come to a consensus is more of a head-scratcher than ever.",
      "The 2025 Oscars will take place Sunday, March 2, airing live on ABC and streaming live on Hulu beginning at 7 p.m. ET.",
      "Let the games begin with my predictions about who should win -- and who will win -- in the major categories.",

      "Chalamet's performance as the young Bob Dylan is acting, singing, guitar-strumming, harmonica-blowing perfection.",
      "And just a week ago, after watching Adrien Brody (\"The Brutalist\") take most of the critics prizes, he finally caught a big break with a significant win from his peers at the Screen Actors Guild for transcending impersonation in a warts-and-all portrait that also captures the petulant arrogance of the future Nobel Prize winner whose music, lyrics and raw vocal rasp helped define a generation. Chalamet's transporting performance catches Dylan in the exhilarating act of inventing himself as multitudes, a fugitive troubadour and poet who's always creating and always in the wind.",
      "Should Chalamet, nominated before in the same category for 2017's \"Call Me By Your Name,\" win the Oscar on Sunday night, he will become, at 29, the youngest nominee ever to win the best actor prize, besting previous record holder Brody by nine months and change.",
      "WILL WIN: Adrien Brody (\"The Brutalist\")",
      "Sorry Timmy, but the one to beat is still Brody -- the current holder of the title of the youngest best actor winner (he was one month shy of his 30th birthday when he won the Oscar for 2002's \"The Pianist\" as musician W\u0142adys\u0142aw Szpilman, a Polish Jew who survived the Nazi invasion of Warsaw.",
      "Brody tops even that career triumph with his \"Brutalist\" portrayal of L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u00f3th, a Hungarian-born Jewish architect and Holocaust survivor who arrives in America after the war in a burst of anticipation and dread. Acting doesn't get better or go deeper than the emotional tour de force given by Brody, who brings every fiber of his being to the role of his career.",

      "While Oscar traditionally makes guys wait until they have some age on them, the gold statue practically climbs into the hands of a young beauty in a breakthrough part. I'm talking Audrey Hepburn (\"Roman Holiday\") to Gwyneth Paltrow (\"Shakespeare in Love\") and Jennifer Lawrence (\"Silver Linings Playbook\"). So why not bestow the crown on Madison, 25, acing the title role in \"Anora\" as the stripper/sex worker who falls for her own fantasy of marrying a handsome prince -- in this case the son of a Russian oligarch -- and living happily ever after.",
      "The comic and dramatic chops Madison brings to the role really are award worthy.",
      "WILL WIN: Demi Moore (\"The Substance\")",
      "The only thing Oscar loves more than a discovery is a comeback, and Moore practically defined the term by scoring her first nomination at 62 for \"The Substance,\" Coralie Fargeat's razor-sharp horror-satire about Hollywood's greatest fear: aging.",
      "During her victory speech at the Golden Globes, Moore talked about being dismissed as a \"popcorn actress\" who should stay in her lane. No way. For pushing past vanity to find the bruised heart of a character who literally splits herself in half to preserve the illusion of timeless allure, Moore spoke to everyone who felt banished to oblivion at the first sign of a wrinkle. She also found her finest two hours on screen.",

Cohn's three commandments for success certainly stuck with his apprentice, played by best actor nominee Sebastian Stan: \"Attack, attack, attack; admit nothing, deny everything; and always claim victory -- never acknowledge defeat.\" Strong plays Cohn with a demonic humor that makes every laugh sting, even those that sow the seeds of his own discussion.",
      "Strong finds a path into Cohn's battered soul in a film that didn't deserve its box-office neglect. He'd be tough to beat, except for...",
      "WILL WIN: Kieran Culkin (\"A Real Pain\")",
      "The \"Succession\" Emmy winner -- he and Strong played feuding brothers on the landmark series -- is in the wrong category since his is a lead performance in every sense of the word as a misfit named Benji on a Holocaust tour of Poland, where his late grandmother escaped the death camps. Director Jesse Eisenberg, who wrote the Oscar-worthy script for this funny, touching and vital dramedy, plays the cousin who accompanies Benji on the trip. There's not a manipulative, sanctimonious, false note in Culkin's off-the-charts great performance.",
      "Forget the category fraud, if there is a sure-thing among this year's Oscar nominees, Culkin is it.",

      "SHOULD WIN: Isabella Rossellini (\"Conclave\")",
      "If you want to know what a true supporting performance is, check out the magnificent Rossellini as Sister Agnes, the only female in this all-male conclave of cardinals in the timely business of electing a new Pope. Critics say that Rossellini has only one big dialogue scene, not enough to cinch the win. Nonsense. She creates a woman in full in the space between words.",
      "This is a first nomination for the gifted daughter of actress Ingrid Bergman and director Roberto Rossellini, and she emerges as the film's moral conscience and its grieving heart.",
      "WILL WIN: Zoe Salda\u00f1a (\"Emilia P\u00e9rez\")",
      "Don't expect the controversies swirling around her film and her co-star Gasc\u00f3n to hurt the chances Salda\u00f1a has at taking home her first Oscar.",
      "As the lawyer at the center of the story -- hardly a supporting role -- Salda\u00f1a proves she's more than the action dynamo of the \"Avatar\" franchise and Marvel Cinematic Universe, but an actress of grit and grace. She might even propel her sensational song-and-dance, \"El Mal,\" into a best song Oscar.",

      "By any measurement of roaring talent and ambition, director Brady Corbet's intimate epic about the immigrant experience in America is the best picture of the year. \"Anora\" and \"Conclave\" are breathing down its neck, but the technical aspects from cinematography to score are top-notch and the direction of the category best Corbet and the acting of Brody, Jones and Guy Peace set a new gold standard. The crucial complaint is that \"The Brutalist\" is too long at three hours and 35 minutes. Length didn't hurt \"Oppenheimer\" and it shouldn't be a problem here -- except for the growing plague of short attention spans.",
      "So unless Oscar voters come to their senses and do the right thing, I'm conceding defeat.",
      "WILL WIN: \"Conclave\" ... in a squeaker victory over \"Anora\"",
      "I expect a dead heat on Oscar night, with the saints of \"Conclave\" just edging out the sinners of \"Anora.\" Either could prevail. \"Anora\" showed a recent surge by claiming victory at the influential producers and directors guilds -- Sean Baker's love letter to sex workers is definitely the cool kids' choice. But throwback voters, blanching at the sex, drugs and F-bombs in \"Anora,\" are more comfortable with Edward Berger's classical approach in \"Conclave,\" which won the day at the BAFTAs (the British Academy with an overlapping membership with the American version) and just a week ago grabbed the best ensemble cast trophy from the Screen Actors Guild, the largest voting group at the Oscars.",
      "It's a coin toss, which should have us all holding our breath on the big night.",

Emilia attempts to right the wrongs of her past years later and reconnect with her former wife, played by Selena Gomez, and her children.",

Some have taken issue with the film's portrayal of the trans community, which critics and LGBTQ advocates, including GLAAD, have called harmful and \"a step backward for trans representation.\" Director Jacques Audiard has also faced criticism for topics related to the film, including his previous comments of Spanish language and his depiction of Mexican cartels and their victims in the film, among other topics.",

In the film, Ani gets her chance at a Cinderella story when she meets and impulsively marries the son of an oligarch.

      "The film sparked conversation when Madison revealed in Variety's \"Actors on Actors\" conversation with Pamela Anderson that she was offered an intimacy coordinator but declined the use of one on set during her explicit nudity and sex scenes, because she and her co-star, Mark Eydelshteyn, \"wanted to keep it small\" with director Sean Baker and Baker's wife, Sammy Kwan, who was a producer on the film.",

      "The film follows Moore as a fading celebrity, who takes a black-market drug, which temporarily creates \"a younger, more beautiful, more perfect\" version of herself. The only catch is that Moore's character must share her time with her new self and the balance must be respected.",
      "At the 2024 Cannes Film Festival, Moore said she saw Fargeat's script as a \"challenge in the best way.\"",
      "\"I look at material that pushes for things that push me out of my comfort zone and if something scares me a little bit, I usually know that there's an opportunity that on the other side it will make me a better person and hopefully a better actor,\" she said.",
      "She added, \"I think that this really touched on so many themes that we all face. We all seek a certain sense of validation, belonging -- and by Coralie doing it in a way that took us to the extreme, I think it really allows for you to kind of step into it in a totally unique way.\"",
      "Fernanda Torres",
      "Torres' powerful performance in the Walter Salles-directed film, \"I'm Still Here,\" has already earned her a Golden Globe for best performance by a female actor in a motion picture, drama. She was also awarded the Virtuoso Award at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.",
      "Torres made history at the time Oscar nominations were announced when she became the second Brazilian actress to earn an Oscar nomination. Her mother, Fernanda Montenegro, who was nominated for best actress in 1998 for her role in \"Central Station,\" was the first.",
      "In \"I'm Still Here,\" Torres plays Eunice Paiva, an activist and mother who is forced to reinvent herself after the disappearance of her husband amid military dictatorship in 1971 Brazil.",
      "Days after Oscar nominations were announced, Torres was back in the news when a decades-old skit she was a part of on the Brazilian TV show, \"Fantastico,\" resurfaced. In the skit, Torres portrayed multiple characters, including one with blackface.",
      "She apologized in a lengthy statement shared by Deadline. \"At that time, despite the efforts of Black movements and organizations, the awareness of the racist history and symbolism of blackface hadn't yet entered the mainstream public consciousness in Brazil,\" she wrote. \"Thanks to better cultural understanding and important but incomplete achievements in this century, it's very clear now in our country and everywhere that blackface is never acceptable.\"",
      "\"This is an important conversation we must continue to have with one another in order to prevent the normalization of racist practices then and now,\" she added. \"As an artist and global citizen, and from my open heart, I remain attentive and committed to the pursuit of vital changes needed to live in a world free from inequality and racism.\"",

      "A federal judge has ruled that the head of a federal watchdog agency must remain in his job, saying President Donald Trump\u2019s bid to remove the special counsel was unlawful",
      "WASHINGTON -- The head of a federal watchdog agency must remain in his job, a judge in Washington ruled on Saturday, saying President Donald Trump's bid to remove the special counsel was unlawful.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson sided with Hampton Dellinger, who leads the Office of Special Counsel, in a legal battle over the president's authority to oust the head of the independent agency that's likely headed back to the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Dellinger sued Trump last month after he was fired, even though the law says special counsels can be removed by the president \u201conly for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d Jackson, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic president Barack Obama, quickly reinstated Dellinger in the job while he pursued his case.",
      "Jackson rejected the Trump administration's claims that the special counsel's removal protections are unconstitutional because they prevent the president from rightfully installing his preferred agency head.",
      "The judge said allowing the president to remove the special counsel at will would have a chilling effect on his crucial duties, which include guarding the federal workforce from illegal personnel actions, such as retaliation for whistleblowing.",
      "\u201cThe Special Counsel is supposed to withstand the winds of political change and help ensure that no government servant of either party becomes the subject of prohibited employment practices or faces reprisals for calling out wrongdoing \u2014 by holdovers from a previous administration or by officials of the new one,\u201d Jackson wrote in her decision.",
      "The Justice Department quickly filed court papers indicating it will challenge the ruling to Washington's federal appeals court. The case has already gone up once to the Supreme Court, which previously temporarily allowed Dellinger to remain in his job.",
      "The ruling comes as Dellinger is challenging the removal of probationary workers who were fired as part of the Trump administration\u2019s massive overhaul of the government. A federal board on Tuesday halted the terminations of several probationary workers after Dellinger said their firings may have been unlawful.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m glad and grateful to see the court confirm the importance and legality of the job protections Congress afforded my position,\" Dellinger said in a statement on Saturday. \"My efforts to protect federal employees generally, and whistleblowers in particular, from unlawful treatment will continue.\u201d",
      "The judge said the special counsel has a \u201cunique status and mission,\" which requires independence from the president to ensure he can carry out his responsibilities. The office investigates whistleblower claims of reprisal, can pursue disciplinary action against employees who punish whistleblowers and provides a channel for employees to disclose government wrongdoing.",
      "\u201cIf I don\u2019t have independence, if I can be removed for no good reason, federal employees are going to have no good reason to come to me,\u201d Dellinger told reporters outside Washington\u2019s federal courthouse after a recent hearing.",
      "The Office of Special Counsel is also responsible for enforcing the Hatch Act, which restricts the partisan political activities of government workers. Dellinger\u2019s firing came as Trump administration employees have touted their support on social media for his policies even though the Hatch Act is meant to restrict political advocacy while on duty.",
      "The Justice Department employed sweeping language in urging the Supreme Court last month to allow the termination of the head of an obscure federal agency with limited power. Acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote in court papers that the lower court had crossed \u201ca constitutional red line\u201d by blocking Dellinger\u2019s firing and stopping Trump \u201cfrom shaping the agenda of an executive-branch agency in the new administration\u2019s critical first days.\u201d",
      "Dellinger was appointed by Democratic President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate to a five-year term in 2024."

      "Skagway residents frequently travel to Whitehorse, the territory's capital, for a wider selection of groceries and shopping, dental care, veterinary services and swimming lessons. The Alaskan city's port, meanwhile, still supports Yukon mining and is a critical hub for fuel and other essentials both communities need.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a special connection,\u201d Orion Hanson, a contractor and Skagway Assembly member, said of Whitehorse, which sits 110 miles (177 kilometers) north and has 30,000 people. \u201cIt\u2019s really our most accessible neighbor.\u201d",
      "Hanson is concerned about what tariffs might mean for the price of building supplies, such as lumber, concrete and steel. The cost of living in small, remote places already is high. People in Whitehorse and Skagway worry about the potential impact on community relations as well as prices.",
      "Norman Holler, who lives in Whitehorse, said the months the tariffs have loomed created \u201can uncomfortable feeling and resentment.\u201d If the threat becomes reality, Holler said he would probably still visit Alaska border towns but not other parts of the United States.",
      "\u201c\u201cIs it rational? I don\u2019t know, but it satisfies an emotional need not to go,\u201d he said.",

      "At the border of Washington state and British Columbia, the tension over tariffs is evident in a waterfront community that is hoping for Canadian mercy.",
      "Point Roberts is a 5-square-mile (13-square kilometer) U.S. exclave whose only land connection lies in Canada, which supplies the unincorporated nub of American soil its water and electricity. It\u2019s a geographic oddity that requires a 20-mile drive around Canada to reach mainland Washington state.",
      "Local real estate agent Wayne Lyle, who like many of his neighbors has dual U.S.-Canadian citizenship, said some of Point Roberts\u2019 roughly 1,000 residents are signing a petition pleading with British Columbia's premier for an exemption to whatever retaliatory tariffs Canada may institute.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re basically connected to Canada. We\u2019re about as Canadian as an American city can be,\u201d Lyle said. \u201cWe\u2019re unique enough that maybe we can get a break.\u201d",
      "Lyle, who serves as the president of the Point Roberts Chamber of Commerce, said it\u2019s too early to identify measurable effects, but he fears Canadians won\u2019t visit the popular summer getaway destination out of spite.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want Canada to think we\u2019re the bad guys,\u201d Lyle said. \u201cPlease don\u2019t take it out on us.\u201d",

      "The 545-mile (877-kilometer) stretch of land that separates Montana from Canada includes some of the sleepiest checkpoints on the binational border. Several of the state's border posts had fewer than 50 crossings a day on average last year.",
      "But unseen, in underground pipelines that cut through vast fields of barley, flows about $5 billion annually worth of Canadian crude oil and natural gas, most of it from Alberta. The lines traverse a continental pivot point -- Montana is the only state with rivers that drain into the Pacific Ocean, Gulf of Mexico and Canada\u2019s Hudson Bay \u2013 and deliver to refineries around Billings.",
      "\u201cCanada is one of our major supply sources for oil across the United States,\u201d said Dallas Scholes, the government affairs director of Houston-based refinery company Par Pacific, which runs a processing facility along the Yellowstone River. \u201cIf tariffs are imposed on the oil and gas industry, \u2026 it\u2019s not going to be good for consumers.\u201d",
      "People in Montana drive long distances given its sprawling size and burn lots of natural gas through harsh winters, making its residents the highest energy consumers per capita in the U.S., according to federal data.",
      "That means a 10% tax on Canadian energy resources would be felt broadly. The state\u2019s farmers would be among those hit more severely, given the large volumes of gasoline needed to run tractors and other equipment, according to Jeffrey Michael, director of the University of Montana\u2019s Bureau of Business and Economic Research.",
      "\u201cIt will be painful, but there are larger concerns if I were an agricultural producer in Montana,\u201d Michael said. \u201cI\u2019d be worried about the trade war escalating to where my products start to get hit with reciprocal tariffs.\"",

According to the Michigan company that owns the bridge, $323 million worth of goods travel each day between Windsor and Detroit, the automotive capitals of their countries.",
      "The U.S., Canada and Mexico have long operated as one nation when it comes to auto manufacturing, noted Pat D\u2019Eramo, CEO of Vaughan, Ontario-based automotive suppler Martinrea. Tariffs will cause confusion and disruption, he said.",
      "Right now, steel coils arrive at a plant in Michigan and get stamped into parts that are shipped to Martinrea in Canada. Martinrea uses the parts to build vehicle sub-assemblies that get shipped back to an automaker in Detroit.",
      "A White House official told The Associated Press that parts would be taxed twice if they crossed the border multiple times, but it's unclear if suppliers or their customers will have to pay for the tariffs. Also unclear is how a separate 25% levy on steel and aluminum that Trump said would take effect starting March 12 factors into the mix.",
      "D\u2019Eramo understands the impulse to strengthen U.S. manufacturing but says the U.S. doesn\u2019t have the capacity to make all the tooling Martinrea would need if it were to shift production there. At the end of the day, he thinks it\u2019s sad tariffs will take up so much time, energy and resources, and only make vehicles even more expensive.",

      "That makes for a complementary relationship. Western New York\u2019s dozens of craft breweries rely on Canada for aluminum cans and much of the malted grain that goes into their brews. Canadians regularly cross one of the four international bridges into the region to shop, go to sporting events and sip Buffalo's beers.",
      "Brewers and other businesses fear there may be less of that, though, if the tariffs on Canada and aluminum go into effect. Trump's repeated comments about making the neighboring nation the 51st U.S. state already offended its citizens - so much so that Buffalo\u2019s tourism agency paused a campaign running in Canada because of negative comments.",
      "\u201cObviously, having a bad taste in their mouth and booing the national anthem at sporting events is not a great thing for them coming down here and drinking our beer and hanging out in our city,\u201d said Jeff Ware, president of Resurgence Brewing Co.",
      "The historic factory building housing Ware\u2019s business in Buffalo is about 4 miles from the Peace Bridge border crossing, where 1.8 million cars and buses and 518,000 commercial trucks entered Buffalo from Ontario last year.",
      "It\u2019s a terrible time to alienate customers, Canadian or American. The snowy first months of the year are hard enough for Buffalo\u2019s breweries, Ware said. Higher prices from 25% tariffs would be yet another obstacle. Ware gets about 80% of the base malt be uses to make his specialty beers from Canada.",
      "\u201cLabor is more expensive, energy is more expensive, all of our raw ingredients are more expensive,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s death by a thousand cuts.\u201d",

      "The relationship between American and Canadian fishermen can sometimes be fraught, but harvesters on both side of the border know they depend on each other, Drouin said. Maine fishermen catch millions of pounds of lobsters every year, but much of the processing capacity for the valuable crustaceans is in Canada.",
      "If Trump follows through with the threatened tariffs next week, lobsters sent to Canada for processing would be subject to customs duties when they return to the U.S. to go to market. Drouin fears what will happen to the lobster industry if the trade dispute persists and Canada enacts a retaliatory tariff on lobsters.",
      "\u201cAs the price goes up to the consumer, there comes a point where it just doesn\u2019t become palatable for them to purchase it,\u201d Drouin said.",
      "Drouin, 60, fishes out of Cutler, Maine, and sees Grand Manan Island, an island in the Bay of Fundy that is part of the province of New Brunswick, when he takes his boat out. He described his business as \u201cright smack on the Canadian border\u201d in terms of both economics and geography.",
      "He described himself as a fan of Trump\u2019s first term who is \u201cnot overly thrilled with what he\u2019s been doing here.\u201d And he said he\u2019s concerned his home state could ultimately be hurt by the tariffs if the president isn\u2019t mindful of border industries such as his.",
      "\u201cThe rhetoric is a bit much, what\u2019s taking place,\u201d Drouin said.",

      "MIAMI BEACH, Fla. -- Miami Beach broke up with spring break last year and city leaders still aren't interested in couples counseling.",
      "Officials recently announced they were bringing back enhanced security measures for practically the entire month of March, including parking restrictions and increased fees for nonresidents.",
      "The new rules were introduced last year after three consecutive years of spring break violence. The city is again warning visitors to expect curfews, bag searches at the beach, early beach closures, DUI checkpoints and arrests for drug possession and violence.",
      "\"Last year\u2019s spring break was a success on any level you measure it,\" Miami Beach Mayor Steven Meiner said. \u201cWe had zero fatalities, zero shootings, zero stampedes. The majority of our businesses did very well and actually thanked us for the measures we took.\u201d",
      "Most spring break activity centers around a 10-block stretch of Ocean Drive known for its Art Deco hotels, restaurants and nightclubs. Before spring break last year, city officials launched a marketing campaign that said, \u201cMiami Beach Is Breaking Up With Spring Break.\u201d A video featured residents \u201cbreaking up\u201d with spring breakers and warning them to expect restrictions if they decided to come anyway.",
      "This year, officials followed up with a \"Reality Check\" video featuring a group of young people on a fictitious reality show having their spring break ruined by the city's enhanced rules.",
      "\u201cWe broke up a spring break,\u201d Meiner said. \u201cSome people ask, are you getting back together? No, we\u2019re done.\"",
      "City leaders want visitors to come and enjoy the beaches, hotels and restaurants, as long as they behave, Meiner said, noting that overall hotel occupancy actually increased in 2024 over 2023.",
      "\u201cAnd that\u2019s because when you walked around Ocean Drive and South Beach, you felt welcoming, you felt safe,\u201d Meiner said.",
      "Miami Beach isn't the only Florida city bracing for spring breakers this year. Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, Miami and Tampa are among the top 10 domestic spring break destinations, according to AAA booking data.",
      "Following a particularly rowdy Presidents Day weekend in Daytona Beach, Volusia County Sheriff Mike Chitwood recently announced plans to crack down on bad behavior from spring breakers.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t bring any financial benefit,\" Chitwood said. \u201cAll they do is bring chaos, and if they want to bring chaos, I am going to bring chaos in return.\u201d",
      "Some Miami Beach business owners see the restrictions as necessary to ensure public safety, while others are concerned that driving away spring breakers could irreparably damage Miami Beach\u2019s status as an iconic tourist destination.",
      "Louis Taic, owner of the Z Ocean Hotel, said he welcomes visitors to Miami Beach any time of the year, but he understands why city officials have taken to actions that they have.",
      "\u201cWhat we don\u2019t like is people that take advantage of Miami Beach, that take advantage by doing things here that they would never do at home,\" Taic said.",
      "David Wallack, owner of Mango\u2019s Tropical Cafe, said Miami Beach has thrived as an entertainment destination for nearly a century, even through Prohibition and the Great Depression.",
      "Instead of trying to scare people away, city officials need to organize events such as concerts, art festivals and sporting events to attract people who will spend money, Wallack said.",
      "\u201cMiami Beach is magical, but you\u2019ve got to still give customers what they want,\u201d Wallack said.",
      "Some civil rights advocates believe the restrictions are racially motivated.",
      "South Beach became popular among Black tourists about two decades ago as promoters organized Urban Beach Week during the Memorial Day weekend. Many locals have complained about violence and other crime associated with the event, which led to an increased police presence. But the event\u2019s continued popularity correlates to a bump in Black tourism throughout the year.",
      "Stephen Hunter Johnson, an attorney and member of Miami-Dade\u2019s Black Affairs Advisory Board, said city leaders are using a brief spike in violence as an excuse to discourage Black visitors.",
      "Most of the problems experienced by Miami Beach in recent years began during the pandemic, when Florida remained open while other popular tourist destinations around the U.S. were locked down, and officials are unfairly crediting the new spring break restrictions with decreasing violence last year, Johnson said.",
      "\u201cArrests were down, and no one was shot,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThose things were going to occur anyway, because the farther we get away from COVID restrictions, the more normalized things are.\u201d",
      "Meiner has repeatedly rejected the notion that the restrictions are racially motivated. He always hates the idea of anyone getting injured, but as an elected official he feels an additional sense of responsibility when people are shot and killed in the city he serves, he said.",
      "\u201cWe are going to keep people safe,\" Meiner said. \"Law and order is the number one priority in our city. There is no compromising on that.\u201d"

      "The old tune is out \u2013 the one where a president declares \u201cwe strongly support NATO,\u201d \u201cI believe strongly in free trade\u201d and Washington must do more to promote clean air, clean water, women\u2019s health and civil rights.",
      "That was Donald Trump in 2017.",
      "That was back when gestures of bipartisanship and appeals to national unity were still in the mix on the night the president comes before Congress to hold forth on the state of the union. Trump, then new at the job, was just getting his footing in the halls of power and not ready to stomp on everything.",
      "It would be three more years before Americans would see Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, then the House speaker and his State of the Union host in the chamber, performatively rip up a copy of Trump\u2019s speech in disgust over its contents.",
      "On Tuesday, Americans who tune into Trump's address will see whether he speaks to the whole country, as he mostly did in his first such speech in the chamber as president, or only to the roughly half who voted for him.",
      "They will see also whether he hews to ceremony and common courtesies, as he did in 2017, or goes full bore on showmanship and incitement.",
      "He comes into it days after assailing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to his face and before the cameras in the Oval Office for not expressing sufficient gratitude for U.S. support in Ukraine's war with Russia. It was a display of public humiliation by an American president to an allied foreign leader with no parallel in anyone's memory.",
      "Jarrett Borden, walking to lunch on Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, Florida, this past week, expressed ambivalence about Trump, having heard a lot of \u201chogwash\u201d from him even while liking some of what he has done. Borden anticipates a good show Tuesday and will watch.",
      "\u201cI want to see if he\u2019s going to leave the mic open for Elon Musk, like it\u2019s an open mic at a club or something,\" he said, citing the billionaire architect of Trump's civil service purge. \"This is what he\u2019s been doing recently, which is comical.\u201d",

      "A new president's first speech to Congress is not designated a State of the Union address, coming so close to the Jan. 20 inauguration. But it serves the same purpose, offering an annual accounting of what has been done, what is ahead and what condition the country is in, as the president sees it.",
      "It is customary in modern times for the president to say the state of the union is strong, no matter what a mess it may be in. Trump won the election saying the state of the union was in shambles and he was going to make it right.",
      "The Trump who addressed Congress on Feb. 28, 2017, is recognizable now, despite the measured tone and content of that speech. After all, he had already shocked the political class by assailing \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d from the inaugural stage.",
      "He told Congress that night he wanted NATO members to spend more on their armed forces, wanted trade to be \u201cfair\u201d as well as free, and wanted foreign countries in crises to be made stable enough so that people who fled to the U.S. could go back home. But he did not open his first term with the wrenching turns in foreign policy, civil service firings, stirrings of mass deportation or cries of \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d of today.",
      "In a line that could have come from any president of either party, Trump noted in his 2017 speech that, \u201cwith the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have formed a council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.\u201d",
      "Now he belittles Trudeau as \u201cgovernor\u201d of a land he wants to make the 51st state and is about to slam with tariffs, along with Mexico. Canadians, not known for displays of patriotism, are seething about their neighbor and rushing to buy and fly their flag.",
      "In Philadelphia, small-time entrepreneur Michael Mangraviti cannot help but take some satisfaction in Trump's scouring of the bureaucracy as the firings pile up with scant regard for how well people did their jobs or how those jobs helped keep services to the public running.",
      "\u201cHe said for years and years, \u2018Drain the swamp, drain the swamp,\u2019\u201d Mangraviti said. \u201cBut, you know, now is the time to actually drain the swamp.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen time and time and time again that the government is horribly, horribly ineffective at everything it wants to do,\u201d he went on. \"The fact that they\u2019re actually taking action on something that they say they\u2019re going to do, the fact that they\u2019re ready to take the ax and take it to our government, is something I appreciate.\u201d",
      "To Cassandra Piper, a Philadelphia instrumentalist, Trump's move to stop making pennies was a \u201cfine decision\" \u2014 unlike everything else he has said and done.",
      "\u201cI comprehensively disapprove of the changes that are being made,\" Piper said, stopping to speak while walking by the Liberty Bell Center. \u201cNot that I was all too happy with the status quo beforehand in the first place, but there\u2019s absolutely no good that can come from the inhumanity of mass deportation, something that this country has already been scarred by.\u201d",
      "So, too, with Trump's selection of vaccination skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as health secretary and his choice of Musk to lead the effort to \u201ceffectively plunder the government of its resources,\u201d in Piper's view.",
      "In Hollywood, Florida, Borden, who is Black, said that to the extent Trump can take money that Washington spends overseas and pump it into the U.S. economy, \u201cthen you are making America great again. But do that without the racial overtones. Do that without the negative energy, and we\u2019re going to be OK.\"",

      "The first time Donald Trump spoke to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, he tried to pressure Ukraine\u2019s new leader to dig up dirt on Joe Biden ahead of the 2020 election",
      "WASHINGTON -- The first time he spoke to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President Donald Trump tried to pressure Ukraine's new leader to dig up dirt on Joe Biden ahead of the 2020 election. It was a 2019 phone call that eventually sparked an impeachment.",
      "On Friday, a meeting in the Oval Office that started out with cordialities turned heated at the end, with Vice President JD Vance telling Zelenskyy to show more gratitude toward Trump, before the president himself began shouting.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re gambling with the lives of millions of people,\" Trump berated Zelenskyy. \"You\u2019re gambling with World War III.\u201d",
      "With that, Trump scrapped plans to sign an agreement that would have allowed the U.S. to access Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals, a deal the U.S. president had said would have helped move the war toward a conclusion. The blowup cast new doubt on the future of U.S. support for Kyiv in fending off Russia's invasion.",
      "A look at the evolution of Trump and Zelenskyy's relationship over the years:",
      "In July 2019, Zelenskyy was anxious for a meeting with Trump at the White House, one of the Ukrainian leader's top foreign policy priorities at the time.",
      "During a 30-minute call, Trump dangled the possibility of a face-to-face meeting. But he also suggested that future U.S. military support for Ukraine might be contingent on its leader helping investigate business dealings there by Hunter Biden, the former vice president's son.",
      "The elder Biden was competing for the Democratic presidential nomination, and Trump seemed to want to weaken him 15 months out from Election Day.",
      "Trump denied wrongdoing and began referring to his exchange with Zelenskyy as a \u201cperfect\" phone call. Even Zelenskyy later insisted that he faced \u201cno blackmail.\u201d",
      "But Trump was impeached by the Democratic-controlled House in December 2019 on abuse of power and obstruction of justice charges, only the third American commander in chief to be in that situation. He was acquitted by the Senate.",
      "Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, triggering the biggest conflict on the European continent since World War II.",
      "Since then, the U.S. has provided more than $65 billion in military assistance to Ukraine. The Biden administration made steadfast military and political support for Zelenskyy's country a centerpiece of his foreign policy.",
      "As the war raged, the Biden White House staunchly defended continuing to provide support to Ukraine, even as some Republicans began grumbling about so much funding for a war that had no end in sight.",
      "In a speech to Congress in December 2022, Zelenskyy thanked \"every American\" for supporting his country.",
      "\u201cYour money is not charity,\u201d he said then. \"It\u2019s an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way.\u201d",
      "Trump, then campaigning for his second term, said repeatedly that Russia would never have invaded Ukraine if he'd been president and that he'd have no trouble solving the conflict.",
      "Upon taking office, he upended years of U.S. policy by dispatching negotiators to Saudi Arabia to meet with officials from Russian President Vladimir Putin's government, and also began hammering out the minerals deal that he and Zelenskyy had planned to sign Friday.",
      "Last September, Zelenskyy accompanied Biden to a Pennsylvania ammunition factory to thank the workers producing some of the most critically needed munitions for his country\u2019s fight with Russian ground forces.",
      "A few days later, he traveled to Trump Tower in Manhattan and discussed ending the war. In comments to Fox News Channel afterward, Trump said of the fighting, \u201cIt should stop and the president wants it to stop,\" meaning Zelenskyy.",
      "\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure President Putin wants it to stop and that\u2019s a good combination,\u201d Trump added. Zelenskyy invited Trump to visit Ukraine, to which Trump responded, \u201dI will.\"",
      "That trip came up again Friday, when Vance told Zelenskyy, \u201cYou went to Pennsylvania and campaigned for the opposition.\"",
      "Zelenskyy's September trip was not billed as political, though, and Trump's election opponent was Vice President Kamala Harris, not Biden. Still, Pennsylvania is a battleground state and some congressional Republicans at the time accused Democrats of using Zelenskyy's visit to bolster Harris politically.",
      "Last December, Trump met with Zelenskyy again during a visit to Paris to attend the reopening of the Notre Dame cathedral. It was a hastily arranged three-way meeting set up by French President Emmanuel Macron, who was trying to push the president-elect to maintain support for Ukraine in its defense against Russia\u2019s invasion.",
      "As president, Trump has publicly prodded Zelenskyy that he had better move quickly to negotiate an end to Russia's war in Ukraine, or risk no longer having a country to lead. On his social media site, Trump decried Zelenskyy for not organizing an election to decide if he should remain in power \u2014 an idea backed by Russia \u2014 calling him a \u201c dictator without elections.\u201d",
      "He also suggested that Ukraine was responsible for Russia's invasion, but later conceded that Russia was the aggressor.",
      "Before this week, Zelenskyy had been to the White House four times \u2014 all during the Biden administration. When the Ukrainian leader announced he was coming to Washington and was ready to sign a minerals deal, Trump's tone got more conciliatory.",
      "He called America\u2019s support for Ukraine against Russia\u2019s invasion \u201ca very worthy thing to do.\u201d And, when pressed about having called Zelenskyy a dictator, Trump responded: \u201cDid I say that? I can\u2019t believe I said that. Next question.\"",
      "It all served to make Friday's blowup all the more spectacular."

After receiving the accelerometers, Bohmerwald dropped off two parcels -- one addressed to a business in China -- at a shipping store, the release said.

      "The Associated Press obtained information that says President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has begun terminating federal grants to organizations that enforce the federal Fair Housing Act's anti-discrimination laws",
      "President Donald Trump's administration has begun terminating grants to organizations that enforce the Fair Housing Act by taking complaints, investigating and litigating housing discrimination cases for Americans across the country, according to documents and information obtained by The Associated Press on Friday.",
      "The grants are disbursed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to private nonprofits, which act as the frontline enforcement of the federal anti-discrimination law passed in 1968. They educate communities on their rights, test whether a landlord is racially discriminating, investigate complaints, resolve disputes and can help with legal counsel.",
      "Of an estimated 34,000 fair housing complaints lodged in the U.S. in 2023, these private nonprofits processed 75%, according to a report from the National Fair Housing Alliance. The rest were fielded by state and local governments, with HUD and the U.S. Department of Justice working on less than 6% combined.",
      "It is the highest number of complaints since the first report in the 1990s, and over half were lodged for discrimination based on a disability.",
      "Now, of the 162 active grants going to the private nonprofits to do that work, nearly half are slated for cancellation, said Nikitra Bailey, executive vice president at the National Fair Housing Alliance. Bailey added that some organizations rely entirely on the grants and may have to shutter, others will have to lay off staff and limit services.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s doing it at a time when Americans want to see an end to the barrage of rising housing costs and a lack of housing supply,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cThey need increased support and intervention from our federal government, not a withdrawal from basic civil rights.\u201d",
      "In a statement, a spokesperson for HUD said: \u201cThe Department is responsible for ensuring our grantees and contractors are in compliance with the President\u2019s Executive Orders. If we determine they are not in compliance, then we are required to take action. The Department will continue to serve the American people, including those are facing housing discrimination or eviction.\u201d",

      "St. Cyr listed several scenarios the nonprofit has helped with: a family being denied housing because they have children, a veteran with a disability needing a ramp and a domestic abuse survivor being evicted because of the actions of the abuser.",

      "The grants intended for fair housing enforcement, part of HUD's Fair Housing Initiatives Program, are largely worth $425,000, an amount which is typically issued annually to organizations.",
      "In a termination letter, a copy of which was obtained by the AP, HUD said that the cancellations were at the direction of Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency, called DOGE, run partly by billionaire Elon Musk.",
      "The letters caused widespread confusion across the country late Thursday night, as fair housing organizations started communicating through listservs, assessing the potential impacts and trying to find answers.",

      "WASHINGTON -- They start the day often as low-profile Cabinet secretaries. They end it that way, too, God willing.",
      "But, when the rest of the government is gathered together for a big event, like President Donald Trump 's joint congressional address Tuesday night, a designated survivor is kept away to ensure someone in the line of presidential succession stays alive.",
      "Picking a failsafe in case of a cataclysmic event that wipes out everyone else dates back to the Cold War. It's been dramatized in novels and an ABC series starring Kiefer Sutherland that aired from 2016 to 2019.",
      "Being the actual designated survivor brings extra adrenaline jolts and humbling thoughts about being unwittingly catapulted into the presidency and unthinkable tragedy \u2014 though the minute-to-minute details usually don't feature the high drama of fictional portrayals, those who have filled the role say.",
      "\u201cIt focuses your mind. It also enhances your prayer that it doesn\u2019t happen to you,\u201d James Nicholson, who was President George W. Bush's veterans affairs secretary and designated survivor during the 2006 State of the Union, said of possibly becoming president after a cataclysmic event.",
      "Trump\u2019s White House hasn\u2019t said who will be the designated survivor choice Tuesday. Historian and journalist Garrett M. Graff said the concept of designated survivor has long captivated people because it combines the public's inherent fascination with danger and the romance of an \u201ceveryman\u201d being thrust into the presidency.",
      "\u201cThe idea of, you\u2019re just a random Cabinet official, and then something terrible happens and, all of a sudden, you\u2019re president of the United States,\" said Graff, author of \u201cRaven Rock: The Story of the U.S. Government\u2019s Secret Plan to Save Itself \u2014 While the Rest of Us Die.\u201d",
      "Until the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, designated survivors had more control over where they went outside Washington. President Bill Clinton's energy secretary, the late Bill Richardson, was picked in 2000 and simply moved up a planned weekend trip with his wife to Oxford, Maryland, a waterfront town about 80 miles away, so he'd be there during the State of the Union.",
      "When Dan Glickman, Clinton\u2019s agriculture secretary, was tapped during the 1997 State of the Union, his hometown of Wichita, Kansas, was too far away, so he chose New York, where his daughter lived.",
      "\u201cI thought it was kind of exciting. But I wasn\u2019t hyped up from a dangerous perspective,\u201d Glickman said. \u201cI don\u2019t even think anybody told me to be careful.\u201d",
      "Alberto Gonzales, Bush's attorney general, was the designated survivor during the 2007 State of the Union. He said White House chief of staff Josh Bolten called a few days before and gave a couple of options for where he could hunker down.",
      "Gonzales chose to be in flight, and he arrived at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland to find \u201cmembers of every major department and agency\u201d there to ride with him. They carried thick binders stuffed with memos and protocol instructions, just in case.",
      "He said there were a series of briefings that may have stretched right into Bush's speech, which he watched from the air.",
      "\u201cIt was during that time that it sort of suddenly hit me, if something happened in the Capitol and everyone's killed, that I'd be president,\u201d Gonzales said. \"It's sort of sobering. And you wonder, would I be up to governing a wounded nation?\u201d",
      "In \u201cRaven Rock,\u201d Graff details how the designated survivor concept was formalized by the Carter and Reagan administrations amid fears that Soviet subs just off the Atlantic Coast could fire nuclear missiles and wipe out Washington with barely 10 minutes\u2019 warning.",
      "Beginning in April 1980, the White House Military Office tasked the Federal Emergency Management Agency with ensuring succession. An aide was directed to recommend to the president who should skip events when all possible successors were together outside the White House.",
      "Officials still prepare for a massive attack or disaster. The military helicopter that collided with a regional jet outside Reagan National Airport in January was on a continuity of government mission \u2014 training to keep the federal government functioning in case of catastrophe.",
      "The first time that a Cabinet member being kept away from a presidential speech to Congress was publicly divulged was President Ronald Reagan\u2019s Education Secretary Terrel Bell in 1981. But Bell wasn\u2019t identified until afterward.",
      "Today, TV images from the House chamber allow political junkies to spot the missing Cabinet member within minutes.",
      "Nicholson said Bush\u2019s then-chief of staff, Andy Card, had asked him a few weeks before the State of the Union to take on the role. He was a natural fit given that his agency played an important role in continuity of government exercises due to its numerous hospitals and clinics nationwide.",
      "Nicholson flew by helicopter to a destination only divulged once he was in the air, and later sat in a command center, where he underwent briefings before watching Bush\u2019s speech.",
      "He was served a \u201cwonderful\u201d dinner, prepared onsite by personnel from the White House mess, though he can't recall if it was T-bone steak or prime rib or something similar. \u201cIt made you think that, at least, if this awful thing happened, you\u2019d be well fed,\" he said.",
      "\u201cThe enormity of that job. You think about, remote as it is, this is something you might have to do,\u201d he said of becoming president.

      "A former Virginia police sergeant was sentenced to three years in prison after he fatally shot a man accused of stealing sunglasses from a shopping center",
      "RICHMOND, Va. -- A former Virginia police sergeant was sentenced to three years in prison on Friday after he fatally shot a man accused of stealing sunglasses from a shopping center.",
      "Wesley Shifflett, 36, was convicted by a northern Virginia jury in October of reckless handling of a firearm in connection to the February 2023 shooting of Timothy McCree Johnson. In a split verdict, the jury acquitted Shifflett of involuntary manslaughter in Johnson's killing.",
      "Judge Randy Bellows in Fairfax County Circuit Court sentenced Shifflett to five years in prison and suspended two years in the felony case.",
      "\u201cTrust in policing is essential to community safety,\" Democratic Commonwealth's Attorney Steve Descano said Friday. \"When tragedies like this occur, trust can only be repaired by seeking accountability through the justice system, and failing to do so would make the work of our police force \u2013- who are as dedicated to community safety as I am \u2013- that much harder.\u201d",
      "Shifflett's defense attorney said that he planned to appeal the case, according to NBC4.",
      "During the trial, prosecutors argued that Shifflett, then a sergeant with Fairfax County police, acted recklessly when he shot and killed Johnson after a short foot chase outside Tysons Corner Center that night. Shifflett testified that he shot Johnson in self-defense after he saw the victim reaching into his waistband after falling down during the chase.",
      "The dimly lit bodycam video played during his trial shows Shifflett yelling \u201cget on the ground\u201d before firing two shots at Johnson, who was 37 at the time. After the shots were fired, Shifflett immediately shouted \u201cstop reaching\u201d and told other officers that he saw Johnson reaching in his waistband.",
      "The video also shows Johnson\u2019s dying words, saying \u201cI wasn\u2019t reaching for nothing. ... I\u2019m shot, and I\u2019m bleeding.\u201d",
      "Melissa Johnson, the victim's mother, said she felt a sigh of relief following Shifflett's sentencing.",
      "\u201cI think it's a testament to what you can do with faith, even if it\u2019s just the size of the grain of a mustard seed,\" she said. \"It felt like a David and Goliath moment. With one smooth pebble, we took on the giant blue wall.\u201d"

      "Rose Girone, believed to be the oldest living Holocaust survivor and a strong advocate for sharing survivors' stories, has died. She was 113.",
      "She died Monday in New York, according to the Claims Conference, a New York-based Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany.",
      "\u201cRose was an example of fortitude but now we are obligated to carry on in her memory,\u201d Greg Schneider, Claims Conference executive vice president, said in a statement Thursday. \u201cThe lessons of the Holocaust must not die with those who endured the suffering.\u201d",
      "Girone was born on January 13, 1912, in Janow, Poland. Her family moved to Hamburg, Germany, when she was 6, she said in a filmed interview in 1996 with the USC Shoah Foundation.",
      "When asked by the interviewer if she had any particular career plans before Hitler, she said: \u201cHitler came in 1933 and then it was over for everybody.\u201d",
      "Girone was one of about 245,000 survivors still living across more than 90 countries, according to a study released by the Claims Conference last year. Their numbers are quickly dwindling, as most are very old and often of frail health, with a median age of 86.",
      "Six million European Jews and people from other minorities were killed by the Nazis and their collaborators during the Holocaust.",
      "\u201cThis passing reminds us of the urgency of sharing the lessons of the Holocaust while we still have first-hand witnesses with us,\u201d Schneider said. \u201cThe Holocaust is slipping from memory to history, and its lessons are too important, especially in today\u2019s world, to be forgotten.\u201d",
      "Girone married Julius Mannheim in 1937 through an arranged marriage.",
      "She was 9 months pregnant living in Breslau, which is now Wroclaw, Poland, when Nazis arrived to take Mannheim to the Buchenwald concentration camp. Their family had two cars and so she asked her husband to leave his keys.",
      "She said she remembers one Nazi saying: \u201cTake that woman also.\u201d",
      "The other Nazi responded: \u201cShe\u2019s pregnant, leave her alone.\u201d",
      "The next morning her father-in-law was also taken and she was left alone with their housekeeper.",
      "After her daughter Reha was born in 1938, Girone was able to secure Chinese visas from relatives in London and secure her husband's release.",
      "In Genoa, Italy, when Reha was only 6 months old, they boarded a ship to Japan-occupied Shanghai with little more than clothing and some linens.",
      "Her husband first made money through buying and selling secondhand goods. He saved up to buy a car and started a taxi business, while Girone knitted and sold sweaters.",
      "But in 1941, Jewish refugees were rounded up into a ghetto. The family of three were forced to cram into a bathroom in a house while roaches and bed bugs crawled through their belongings.",
      "Her father-in-law came just before World War II started but became sick and died. They had to wait in line for food and lived under the rule of a ruthless Japanese man who called himself \u201cKing of the Jews.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey did really horrible things to people,\u201d Girone said of the Japanese military trucks that patrolled the streets. \u201cOne of our friends got killed because he wouldn\u2019t move fast enough.\u201d",
      "Information about the war in Europe only circulated in the form of rumors, as British radios were not allowed.",
      "When the war was over, they began receiving mail from Girone\u2019s mother, grandmother and other relatives in the U.S. With their help, they boarded a ship to San Francisco in 1947 with only $80, which Girone hid inside buttons.",
      "They arrived in New York City in 1947. She later started a knitting store with the help of her mother.",
      "Girone was also reunited with her brother, who went to France for school and ended up getting his U.S. citizenship by joining the Army. When she went to the airport to pick him up in New York, it was her first time seeing him in 17 years.",
      "Girone later divorced Mannheim. In 1968, she met Jack Girone, the same day her granddaughter was born. By the next year they were married. He died in 1990.",
      "When asked in 1996 for the message she would like to leave for her daughter and granddaughter, she said: \u201cNothing is so very bad that something good shouldn't come out of it. No matter what it is.\u201d"

      "In January, an endangered Florida panther known as UCFP479 became the first to die this year in a vehicle collision along a rural southwestern Florida road",
      "FLORIDA PANTHER NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE, Fla. -- In January, an endangered Florida panther known as UCFP479 became the first to die this year in a vehicle collision along a rural southwestern Florida road.",
      "The male panther, just under 2 years old, will not be the last.",
      "In 2024, 36 panther deaths were recorded by state wildlife officials, which was the most since 2016. The majority of those deaths are the result of collisions with vehicles, including one that was struck by a train, state statistics show.",
      "An estimated 120 to 230 adult Florida panthers live in the wild in the state's southwestern corner, where they are faced with a booming human population and the accompanying development.",
      "The Florida panther, which is similar to but smaller than the Western cougar or mountain lion, once roamed across a large swath of the southeastern U.S. Hunting and habitat loss have decimated the species' numbers and confined them to a shrinking space of about 2 million acres (809,000 hectares), according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.",
      "Indeed, along what were once narrow country roads in eastern Collier and Lee counties there are numerous major projects under way that will create tens of thousands of homes and the traffic that comes with them.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re at a critical juncture now,\u201d said Michael McGrath of the Sierra Club, which recently led a tour of panther country for journalists and activists. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see more and more deaths. Sprawl kills.\u201d",
      "Environmental groups have been fighting an uphill battle to curb some of the development and vow to continue those efforts.",
      "\u201cYou can see all of that land is primary panther habitat,\u201d said Amber Crooks, environmental policy manager at the Conservancy of Southwest Florida. \u201cWe have to fight until that last decision is made.\u201d",
      "The Florida panther is the only established population of pumas east of the Mississippi River, according to the state Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. They have been listed as federally endangered since 1967. A 26,600-acre (10,700-hectare) panther refuge was established in 1989 next to the Big Cypress National Preserve, west of the Everglades.",
      "In 1981, the state began capturing panthers to check their health, administer vaccines, take genetic samples and fit them with radio collars to track them.",
      "The panther population at one point in the 1990s dropped to around 50 animals, in part because of inbreeding that caused numerous health problems. That led officials to import eight female Texas pumas to Florida to breed with males, helping boost panther numbers and improving their genetic diversity. The offspring are considered to be Florida panthers and are protected under the Endangered Species Act, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.",
      "Florida panthers resemble the cougars and pumas found in the American West, with beige or tan fur and white markings underneath. They eat various types of prey, especially deer and raccoons.",
      "Males tend to roam more than females in search of territory and sometimes are spotted near the Orlando area. One male was shot and killed by a hunter in Georgia in 2008, wildlife officials say. Because males roam more, they are more prone to being struck by vehicles.",
      "Panthers face the threat of disease, including a form of feline leukemia transmitted to them by domestic cats. Bobcats also are prone to the disease.",
      "A 2002 outbreak of feline leukemia killed at least five panthers, federal wildlife officials say.",
      "Another emerging disease appears to cause weakness in the rear legs of panthers and bobcats, many of them seen walking unsteadily on trail video cameras.",
      "\"We encourage the public to continue to submit footage and pictures of wildlife that appear to have problems with their rear legs,\u201d the Florida wildlife commission said in an online post.",
      "Some are killed through fights among themselves, especially males.",

      "Sometimes the world's attention is unavoidable, as it was this week when Oscar-winner Gene Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, were found dead inside their home in those very foothills.",
      "Hackman, 95, and Arakawa, 65, eschewed fame and made Santa Fe their home decades ago, like many other acclaimed artists, including the former playwright Sam Shepard, actors Shirley MacLaine and Ali MacGraw, and \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d author George R. R. Martin.",
      "In addition to the fresh air and mountain vistas, Santa Fe \u2014 situated more than a mile above sea level \u2014 is known for Pueblo-style architecture, Southwest-themed art galleries and turquoise jewelry-filled boutiques. Initially settled by Indigenous people and once colonized by Spain, the capital city of New Mexico today embraces a low-key vibe where young skateboarders share the sidewalks with wealthy retirees decked out in Pendleton cardigans and cowboy boots.",
      "It's not uncommon to see a famous person strolling downtown, dining out or hiking on the numerous trails; it's just that locals know not to gush over them.",
      "\"You recognize that celebrities who come here are coming here for the same reason. They just want to live and be normal people,\u201d artist Kristin Bortles said, taking a break from planning a mural for a new coffee shop.",
      "The normally laid back city was in collective shock Thursday as news spread about Hackman and Arakawa. The last time a crush of media descended on Santa Fe was when Alec Baldwin shot and killed a cinematographer on the set of the movie \u201cRust.\u201d",
      "On Friday, conversations about what had happened to Hackman and his wife always came back to Santa Fe's reputation as a place where celebrities could unwind and live unassuming lives far from the glitz of Los Angeles or New York City \u2014 and even some of the more glamorous Rocky Mountain enclaves, like Vail, Colorado.",
      "Hackman retired in the early 2000s after a decades-long career that included roles as villains, heroes and antiheroes in dozens of dramas, comedies and action films. Aside from appearances at awards shows, he was rarely seen on the Hollywood social circuit.",
      "He served for several years on the board of trustees at the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe and wrote a novel about the American West centered on New Mexico called \u201cPayback at Morning Peak\u201d and coauthored one on the Civil War entitled \u201cEscape from Andersonville.\" (A real life battle took place just east of Santa Fe in 1862, at Glorieta Pass.)",
      "Hackman and Arakawa lived in a multilevel Pueblo-style home that blends in with the surrounding geography. He enjoyed weekly Pilates classes, bicycle rides along paved trails and getting fresh eggs dropped off by friends.",
      "While Hackman kept a tight circle of friends and didn't go out much, he was sometimes spotted downtown. But one of the most accomplished actors of his generation mostly blended in.",
      "\u201cThe thing I\u2019ve learned about Santa Fe is that you never know who you\u2019re talking to, you never know who you\u2019re going to meet or who\u2019s around the corner,\u201d said Gabriel Garcia, whose family has been selling jewelry and leather crafts on the Santa Fe Plaza for more than 60 years.",
      "Hackman usually was in jeans, a flannel shirt and sometimes a baseball cap, said friend Stuart Ashman, the former head of the New Mexico Department of Cultural Affairs and past CEO of the International Folk Art Market.",
      "\u201cObviously he was a huge star,\" Ashman said, \"but you would never know it when you talked to him because he had that sort of what I call a princely attitude, where he\u2019s focused on you and asks you about you, not talking about himself.\u201d",
      "Hackman enjoyed painting and was drawn to the beauty of the hills surrounding Santa Fe and the light of the high desert, Ashman said.",
      "Arakawa, a classical musician, was soft spoken and never one to expect special treatment, said Larry Keller, owner of a high-end furniture and art store where she would shop.",
      "Being a part of the Santa Fe community, he said, means not drawing extra attention to someone because of their celebrity status.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Furious Democrats filled Republican town halls across America last week to protest President Donald Trump\u2019s power grab in Washington.",
      "But in recent days, the activists behind those protests have turned their anger toward elected officials in their own party, who they believe are not fighting the Republican president and billionaire adviser Elon Musk with the urgency, aggression or creativity that the moment deserves.",
      "\u201cAre we in a constitutional crisis or not?\u201d said Ezra Levin, co-founder of the anti-Trump resistance group Indivisible, which encouraged progressives to attend town halls and protest outside Tesla dealerships.",
      "Of Democratic leaders, he added, \u201cThere\u2019s zero tactical or innovative leadership.\u201d",
      "Indeed, as Trump moves to consolidate control in Washington with little regard for precedent or judges ruling against him, the nation's most powerful Democrats are offering mixed messages while struggling to break from the rules and norms that have long governed U.S. politics.",
      "Key Democratic governors have spoken out with varying levels of concern, but they have also promised to work with the Trump administration to ensure resources flow to their states.",
      "House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York has taken heat for spending part of last week's congressional recess promoting a children's book he wrote about democracy. Asked about activists' frustration, he pointed to his party's united opposition to the GOP budget bill and to the more than 100 lawsuits brought against the president.",
      "\u201cWe have to continue to push back aggressively in every way possible in defense of the American people,\" Jeffries insisted, acknowledging voters' \u201cconcern, fear, shock and anxiety.\u201d",
      "Republicans have control of the House and Senate. Some Democrats think they are nearing the limit of what they can do to stop Trump, and so the party should stand back.",
      "Veteran Democratic strategist James Carville said as much out loud earlier in the week in a New York Times opinion piece in which he encouraged his party to embrace a \u201cstrategic retreat\u201d to let Trump and his Republican allies take the blame for the chaos they create.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s time for Democrats to embark on the most daring political maneuver in the history of our party: roll over and play dead,\u201d Carville wrote.",
      "The piece infuriated Democratic activists. But some officials in Washington quietly welcomed Carville\u2019s call for Democrats to get out of Trump\u2019s way.",
      "\u201cThe Carville point was that there\u2019s got to be an opportunity for people to start experiencing and coming to their own conclusion,\u201d said Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s easier said than done on Carville is that people are freaked out and they do want us to do something and we want to do something,\u201d Welch added. \u201cThat\u2019s the dilemma.\u201d",
      "In Trump's first month in office, he and Musk have moved with extraordinary speed to cut tens of thousands of jobs from the federal workforce. The president is trying to eliminate entire agencies established by federal law. He has signed dozens of executive orders and begun to exact retribution against perceived political enemies across the government, firing independent inspectors general, federal prosecutors and FBI agents involved with his previous prosecutions.",
      "Trump and his allies have lashed out against judges and threatened to defy court rulings.",
      "So far, neither Jeffries nor Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York has been willing to employ perhaps the most dramatic tool at their disposal to stop Trump: their vote \u2014 and the ability to withhold their vote in protest \u2014 even if it means shutting down the government.",
      "There are some Democrats who want their party to pursue a shutdown on March 14 when current funding expires. But historically, shutdowns have been a Republican strategy only. Democrats generally see themselves as the political grown-ups in the room.",

      "Jes Staley was forced out in November 2021 after UK regulators ruled he had failed to accurately disclose the nature and length of his relationship with Epstein to the Barclays board.",
      "The episode cost Mr Staley, a man with a glittering and rewarding career in investment banking, \u00a318m in pay and bonuses and, more importantly for the 68-year-old, his reputation.",
      "Mr Staley is seeking to overturn a decision by the Financial Conduct Authority in 2023 banning him from holding a senior position in financial services.",
      "Jes Staley had been disciplined by regulators in 2018 over his attempts to unmask a whistleblower he felt was unfairly trying to smear a colleague. But the crucial blow to his position at Barclays was his insistence that his relationship with Epstein was \"not close\" and had ended before he took up the top job at the UK bank.",
      "A cache of emails released by his former employer JP Morgan suggested the relationship was in fact very close.",
      "Email exchanges describe time spent together at Mr Epstein's properties in New York and on his private island in the US Virgin Islands.",
      "A now infamous email thread shows Mr Staley remarking to Epstein \"that was fun, say hi to Snow White\". Epstein replies \"what character would you like next? To which Mr Staley replies \"beauty and the beast!\".",
      "There are also allegations that he and Epstein stayed in contact indirectly after he took the Barclays job. Mr Staley's lawyers insist that any such moves were initiated by Epstein and Mr Staley made no attempt to contact Epstein.",
      "All of this will be aired in a court that will call former regulators and executives as witnesses and many have questioned why Mr Staley, who is now 68 and extremely wealthy, would want this publicity all over again.",
      "Jes Staley is a tough and fiercely proud man. He enjoyed a very successful career on Wall Street and many thought he was destined to take over at the helm of his old employer JP Morgan \u2013 the biggest investment bank in the world.",
      "Internally he was popular with most of his banking colleagues. His ill-fated attempt to unmask a whistleblower he thought was smearing an old colleague, was seen by some \u2013 but not all \u2013 as evidence of fierce loyalty to his own troops.",
      "That willingness to go into battle will be on show in the coming days, but seems unlikely to restore his reputation or future position to the one he enjoyed before he was shown the door at Barclays.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly44dknrj8o",
    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 22:25:43 GMT",
    "summary": "Protests, politicking and planning could stall the runway, despite the government being 'minded to approve' it",
    "story": [
      "Expansion at Gatwick Airport has moved a step closer after the government gave the plan its tentative backing.",
      "On the surface Gatwick's plans look relatively straightforward.",
      "In contrast to Heathrow, which wants to bulldoze houses and reroute the M25, Gatwick is proposing to shift an already existing runway just 12 metres north, and bring it into regular use.",
      "Yet it still may not happen for years, or may not happen at all.",
      "How did we get here?",
      "Gatwick officially opened as an airport in 1958. It had one runway and an additional taxi-way, that was expanded so it could be used as a back-up in case the main runway was out of action.",
      "It was never supposed to be for daily use.",
      "In fact, in 1979 Gatwick's owners signed a legally binding agreement with the local council not to build another operational runway for at least 40 years.",
      "Now, though, Gatwick is keen to increase flights in and out, especially for short-haul destinations, by putting the back-up runway into regular use.",
      "In the summer of 2023, it put in a planning application, including for additional buildings, flyovers to local roads and expanding rail links.",
      "However, the centre line of a runway that's in full operation, must be at least 210 metres from the centre line of any other runway.",
      "The back-up runway needs to shift 12 metres northwards to meet that safety rule.",
      "How long would expansion take?",
      "Just because the government has given backing in principle for the privately-funded \u00a32.2bn scheme, doesn't mean it is ready for take-off.",
      "There is strong opposition to the expansion of Gatwick among some local residents objecting to increases in traffic, noise and pollution.",
      "Climate campaigners oppose any airport expansion, pointing out that the extra flights will make it harder for the UK to meet its obligations to reduce emissions that are altering the climate.",
      "And in January MPs called on the government to delay the decision on expanding Gatwick until current noise levels were monitored adequately at the site.",
      "Gatwick has until 24 April to submit more information to support its planning application, and respond with measures, such as noise mitigation and having a proportion of passengers travelling to the airport via public transport.",
      "Then there will be a fresh consultation on the plans, before the government makes a final decision on 27 October.",
      "Even if Gatwick is given the go-ahead then, it could still face further hurdles.",
      "\"There remains the possibility that the final decision could be subject to legal challenge which would lead to further delay,\" Paul Maile, head of planning and infrastructure consenting at Eversheds Sutherland, told the BBC.",
      "\"It is probable that it will still be several years before work is likely to start, at the earliest,\" he said.",
      "Will it actually happen?",
      "Gatwick has previously said it believed the new runway could be ready by the end of the decade.",
      "But there is still a reasonable chance it might not happen at all.",
      "By 2030 there will have been another general election, and a different government could overturn any previous decisions. Planning permissions and regulations may change, and climate targets could be ramped up - all of which would put the project at risk.",
      "It will also depend on what the public want, says Prof Tony Travers of the London School of Economics.",
      "Politicians are \"susceptible to public pressure\" so sometimes choose to slow or cancel infrastructure projects like this.",
      "While there are wider benefits of airport expansion, to the regional and national economy as well as the travelling public, those advantages don't usually prompt people to make placards and write to their MPs. Living under a flight path, on the other hand, does.",
      "Richard Threlfall, global head of infrastructure, government and healthcare at KPMG International, says other countries, which don't have such strong democracies as the UK, can \"just get on and do it\", when they want infrastructure built.",
      "In the UK road bypasses, rail infrastructure, housing and other projects can be slowed or completely blocked, if enough people oppose them.",

      "So what to do with all that money? The growing trend for the ultimate luxury experience is a clue as to what the very rich are doing with their cash. For the tourist industry in particular, it's an opportunity.",
      "In Switzerland, which has long cultivated a reputation for understated luxury, the number of five-star hotels is increasing faster than any other category. Many of them were built in the early 20th century - grand belle epoque palaces serving a then emerging class of privileged, primarily English tourists.",
      "Today, renovated to the highest standards, those hotels leave no guest's wish unmet. There are luxury spas, gourmet restaurants, and designer suites with panoramic views of the alps. Some offer \"ski butlers\" to ferry guests to and from the slopes, carry the skis, and even help put on their boots.",
      "Key markets are the US, the Gulf states, China and South East Asia. American guests in particular, Swiss hoteliers say, expect the full five-star treatment, including 24-hour room service, so that they can order food in the middle of the night.",
      "Meanwhile, China and India are emerging markets, where the first groups to travel from those two countries are among the wealthiest. Switzerland is very keen to get in at the start of that trend.",
      "But the five-star offer comes with a hefty price tag, so where does that leave those who are not billionaires? Markus Berger of Switzerland Tourism says the strategy is not to focus solely on high-end guests, but to take a hard-headed look at the figures.",
      "Stays at Swiss five-star hotels make up around 8% of all overnights, but the guests in them contribute at least 25% of Switzerland's total revenue from tourism.",
      "\"The numbers speak for themselves,\" says Mr Berger. \"The high economic significance justifies a commitment to luxury guests.\"",
      "What's more, he adds, Switzerland, with its high-wage, high-price economy, cannot compete with less expensive neighbours, particularly now that the Swiss franc is so strong.",
      "\"Switzerland has never tried to compete over prices,\" Mr Berger explains. \"There is always somewhere cheaper.\"",
      "Instead, the focus is on quality, service, and added value, like those ski butlers. In exchange, guests who come to five-star hotels also contribute a good deal to the rest of the economy, spending lavishly in the Michelin-starred restaurants and boutique shops that are also becoming a feature in a number of Swiss alpine resorts.",
      "But it's not an entirely win-win situation. In some of Switzerland's most famous up-market resorts, like St Moritz or Zermatt, there are long-standing concerns that the focus on luxury is pricing locals out of the market.",
      "A common challenge is finding accommodation for the hundreds of hotel and restaurant staff needed to provide the five-star service.",
      "They sometimes find themselves commuting, late at night when the cocktail bars and restaurants have finally closed, long journeys to other villages where the accommodation is affordable on a waiter's salary.",
      "Monika Bandi, who leads the Tourism Research Unit at Bern University's Centre for Regional Development, sees Switzerland's pitch to high-end guests as a fine balancing act. It's about \"quantity versus quality\", she says.",
      "More tourists aren't necessarily better, she believes. Instead, higher spending by existing numbers can be positive.",
      "And, she adds, Switzerland needs to watch out for the \"tipping point, where the destinations really lose their character\".",
      "Questions about a tipping point are currently being asked in the resort of Wengen, world famous for its Lauberhorn ski race, and its decades long connection with British skiers \u2013 the much-loved \"Down Hill Only\" ski club celebrated its 100th anniversary this year.",
      "And also this year, Wengen is opening its first ever five-star hotel, and there are plans too for a five-star complex of serviced \"hotel apartments\". They will be sold to wealthy tourists who want a luxury holiday home in the Alps, and they can also be rented out when the owners are absent.",
      "By calling the project a hotel, it exploits a loophole in Switzerland's strict laws against the \"cold beds\" of holiday homes. In theory, the law limits them to no more than 20% of a resort's accommodation.",
      "The Swiss Heritage Society has formally objected to the Wengen plans, because, claims spokesman Simon Weiss, the project is not really a hotel. \"It looks like a typical holiday home complex\u2026 there is no integration into the community.\"",
      "The required public spaces that a hotel would have \u2013 a restaurant and a spa \u2013 are planned, but they will all be underground. The design priority, Mr Weiss fears, is for private luxury apartments that may be occupied for only a few weeks a year. \"The design is unacceptable,\" he adds.",
      "Some Wengen locals also have their doubts. \"It's not St Moritz here,\" one told Swiss media, adding \"Wengen is not posh\".",
      "Wengen's tourism director Rolf Wegm\u00fcller agrees with that assessment, but says the trend towards luxury accommodation won't change the resort's character. \"We're not going to have guests walking around in fur coats all of a sudden,\" he says.",
      "Wengen, he points out, is only accessible by train, so, unlike St Moritz, there will be no Bentleys or Rolls-Royces taking up parking spaces. Even if they could ostentatiously display their wealth, Mr Wegm\u00fcller believes \"our guests won't want to show off what they have\".",
      "The resort also has visitors who come back year after year, contributing to the integration Mr Weiss worries about losing. \"Some families have been coming for generations,' says Mr Wegm\u00fcller. 'The locals know them, and that's good.\"",
      "Among them are Brian Bollen, keen member of the Down Hill Only Club, who has been coming to Wengen for more than 50 years. He loves it, but does worry that some of \"the charm has gone from the place\u2026 it's over built\".",
      "But most in Wengen, like Switzerland Tourism, see the investment in the alpine resorts as positive. These villages were, not much more than a century ago, very poor. A 19th English guide to the Swiss alps wrote that \"most of the children are beggars\".",
      "In more recent years, the global trade rules limiting agricultural subsidies have forced many small alpine dairy farms to close. Tourism, winter and summer, is enormously important for the Swiss economy, especially for the mountain communities.",
      "And, as Mr Berger of Switzerland Tourism points out, while the five-star sector is growing, three-star hotels are still the biggest category. \"We have one to five-star [in Wengen],\" adds Mr Wegm\u00fcller. \"That's a good thing in a resort.\"",
      "And while the people with unlimited money to spend on luxury travel may still be in a tiny minority, their numbers, and their wealth, are growing. Switzerland's approach \u2013 not cheaper, but better, not more people, just richer \u2013 seems to be paying off.",

      "Flat owners are being hit with huge bills for fire safety work because their blocks are not tall enough to qualify for funding announced after the Grenfell Tower fire.",
      "The previous government launched the Building Safety Act after the 2017 fire which killed 72 people. But the rules do not apply to buildings under 11m (36ft) or five storeys high.",
      "Some lawyers claim the new law was \"rushed\" but the government says it covers the majority of leaseholders and it will continue to review the legislation.",
      "Paramedic Tom DeRonde received a \u00a365,000 bill because his flat is in a three-storey building and says he faces bankruptcy.",
      "\"I had to take a month off work with stress. There's not been a day when I've not thought about cladding,\" he told the BBC.",
      "It is estimated there are 1.3 million leasehold flats in low-rise blocks, under 11m high in England, according to the End Our Cladding Scandal campaign.",
      "Tom bought his flat in Luton in 2018 with money he had saved from serving in the army. He said when he came home to a bill for \u00a365,000 he was \"absolutely shocked\".",
      "The invoice from his landlord was his legal share of the costs to make the building fireproof. \"I thought it was a typo to be honest,\" said Tom.",
      "Then he learnt the building's height meant he was a \"non-qualifying leaseholder\" and would be liable to pay for fire safety work.",
      "\"The government says for buildings under 11m, the risk can be mitigated by other means, like using fire alarms and sprinkler systems but in my case, that's not true,\" explained Tom.",
      "\"I've had two fire assessments both saying the cladding is dangerous and needs to be removed, and the price, which they also said would be lower for smaller buildings, is extortionate. I can't pay,\" he added.",
      "After complaining to the building's owners, Tom expects the bill to be reduced but is yet to find out by how much.",
      "Tom had planned to sell the flat to buy a family home but can't. \"It's ruining my life and I'm facing bankruptcy,\" he said.",
      "The Department for Housing told the BBC that owners of buildings under 11m should not pass on the costs of fixing historical safety defects to leaseholders.",
      "But the law does not prevent people like Tom being billed for unlimited amounts of money when the developers are no longer around or landlords cannot afford the remediation costs.",
      "'Falling through the gaps'",
      "Liz Ramsden is an expert in leasehold property at Knights and told the BBC she believes the Building Safety Act was drafted too quickly.",
      "\"The intention was that no leaseholder would have to pay but in reality we are finding a lot of leaseholders are having to pay huge sums of money.",
      "\"There was very little consultation and because of that we have these gaps in the legislation and people are falling through,\" she said.",
      "Even in buildings above 11m the rules fail to protect many leaseholders.",
      "Homeowners with Islamic mortgages or three or more properties also do not benefit  from the full protections.",
      "This is something Martin Batty, who has an Islamic mortgage, only discovered when he put his one-bedroom flat up for sale.",
      "He said his lawyer explained the way Islamic home purchase plans are structured - to comply with Sharia law which does not allow paying interest - means he falls outside the scope of the act.",
      "\"It feels really unfair. I feel like I'm being discriminated against,\" he said.",
      "\"To find out that I'm a non-qualifying leaseholder just because I've got an Islamic home purchase plan is a huge kick in the teeth. It's really upsetting and is a huge let down.\"",
      "The government told the BBC Islamic interest free loans secured against properties were very rare.",
      "But Martin said he can't sell his flat because mortgage providers will not lend against it and solicitors won't advise on non-qualifying leases.",
      "Suzy Spilling and her husband Colin invested in four rental properties to fund their retirement - including two flats in Salford \"mortgaged to the hilt\".",
      "These two flats are in a building where lots of the cladding has been found to be unsafe.",
      "The government will fund the removal but because the couple have more than three properties they too are non-qualifying leaseholders and will have to pay towards the costs of making the tower block fire-safe.",
      "\"Everything we have planned for would be out the window,\" said Suzy. \"How were we going to raise the funds needed? We could be on the hook for \u00a3100,000 for each of our two apartments.\"",

      "Lawyer Mrs Ramsden said: \"There's been a 40% drop in leasehold transactions because of problems with the act. It urgently needs to be looked at so we can make it work better for everybody.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 14:11:21 GMT",
    "summary": "A deal to avoid further trade barriers appears very much on the cards, but challenges remain.",
    "story": [
      "The US-UK trade deal warmly suggested by President Donald Trump should help insulate the UK from the direct impact of global trade tensions.",
      "It signals that the White House has accepted the statistical logic that the US and UK have a balanced trade position.",
      "Essentially each country roughly exports the same amount of goods to one another. Indeed, rather helpfully, according to the US numbers it exports more.",
      "There is no general case that the UK is, in the words and logic of the president,  \"ripping off\" or \"screwing\" the US, as he has suggested of many other countries and the EU.",
      "So a deal to avoid the further trade barriers is very much on the cards.",
      "But this is not the wideranging US-UK free trade agreement to lower almost all existing tariffs, that was the subject of so much debate in the Brexit era.",
      "It is important to remember that the wider deal was never properly prioritised by Trump's own team, because, as they told me, they never truly believed that the UK would find it in its interest to make the necessary hard break from the EU.",
      "It is difficult to see that the UK government would want to further aggravate farmers, or its own base, by putting US farm imports or NHS pricing on the table.",
      "In addition, on goods trade, the government is already prioritising its \"Brexit reset\" - a food standards deal, and some customs arrangements to bring down newish trade barriers with the European Union. Tellingly, the top official on that negotiation was in the Oval Office.",
      "UK-US trade deal could mean tariffs 'not necessary', says Trump",
      "Key takeaways from Starmer's talks with Trump",
      "How could Trump's tariffs affect the UK?",
      "The narrower \"economic deal\", as it was termed by Sir Keir Starmer, centres around technology and what the UK has referred to as the \"further integration of our two countries' tech sectors\".",
      "Perhaps the best analogy is that the tech expertise held within the London-Oxford-Cambridge triangle could become for a booming AI-driven Silicon Valley what London's financial City became to New York's Wall Street. The fact that Vice President and big tech ally JD Vance will be leading some of the US negotiation is key here.",
      "This strategy will have consequences. Trump's team are already railing against digital services taxes.",
      "The UK's digital services tax was introduced in 2020 and imposes a 2% charge on revenues made by big tech firms running social media, internet search engines or online marketplaces.",
      "While the \u00a3700m-\u00a31bn a year it raises in the UK is smallish beer, since the UK and France introduced a hit to big tech's revenues, many other countries have followed suit.",
      "The White House wants to \"stop the contagion\", and that could mean persuading the UK to lower or abolish it. Chancellor Rachel Reeves advocated raising it from 2% to 12% just four years ago.",
      "Likewise the vice president in the Oval Office mentioned US tech firms being unfairly affected by what he called \"freedom of speech\" issues.",
      "This appears to be a reference to the Online Safety Act. This aims to make social media firms and search engines protect children and adults in the UK from illegal, harmful material, although some have argued it risks stifling free expression online. My understanding is that, right now, movement may be less likely here.",
      "The prize will be integration into the massive investments from the best capitalised tech companies in the world.",
      "Could the UK start to attract back some of the investments lost to Dublin, for example? Would the EU stand back and allow the UK to develop as an offshore hub for US tech companies to service the whole of Europe?",
      "There are two other significant issues. It is not unknown for warm words in the Oval Office to be somewhat contradicted by actions soon after. While sat next to the PM, President Trump described the EU's levying of VAT as a trade restriction, seemingly unaware that the UK does exactly the same thing.",
      "And even if it avoids direct new tariffs from President Trump, the open UK economy would be affected by any wide-ranging trade war involving most of the G7 and other countries.",
      "That is still on the cards. Not only would that collapse world growth and potentially spike up inflation again, but could upend entirely the workings of the World Trade Organization.",
      "The PM says the UK doesn't have to choose between the US and other allies, but it may appear like that to them.",
      "The strategy appears to be to become the Switzerland of global economics. Neutrality in a world of trade turmoil, not so much sat on a fence, but tiptoeing along a rather wobbly one."

      "\"Skype led the way for video calls. But now it's officially done. Microsoft is pulling the plug, but honestly... it's been on life support for years.\"",
      "So what happened?",
      "When Microsoft bought Skype, the company was buying into an app that had been downloaded one billion times and had hundreds of millions of users.",
      "\"Together we will create the future of real-time communications,\" Microsoft chief Steve Ballmer said at the time.",
      "But as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger grew in popularity, Skype was waning.",
      "In 2017, Microsoft redesigned Skype, with some features looking very much like rival Snapchat. Users were not happy.",
      "At the time, Rachel Kaser, a reporter at The Next Web, said: \"People are annoyed by this update to the Skype app because it's fixing something that was never broken to begin with.\"",
      "In June 2021, speculation persisted that it was the beginning of the end for Skype.",
      "When Microsoft announced Windows 11, its new operating system, it stated that Microsoft Teams would be integrated by default, while Skype, for the first time in years, was not.",
      "Teams had seen a boost in popularity during the Covid pandemic as people moved their work and personal meetings online.",
      "As the news of Skype's closure was announced, Microsoft published a blog post from Jeff Teper, the company's president of collaborative apps and platforms.",
      "In it, he said the company wants to streamline its free services to focus on Teams.",
      "\"With Teams, users have access to many of the same core features they use in Skype, such as one-on-one calls and group calls, messaging, and file sharing,\" he said.",
      "\"Additionally, Teams offers enhanced features like hosting meetings, managing calendars, and building and joining communities for free.\"",
      "Skype users now have a choice \u2013 move over to Microsoft Teams or export their Skype data including chats, contacts and call history, the post added.",
      "For Skype customers who pay for some features, Microsoft said they will be able to use their service up until their next renewal period."

      "A second runway at Gatwick Airport has been backed by government, providing measures to reduce noise are put in place.",
      "Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said she was \"minded to approve\" the expansion. Some MPs, local authorities and residents are strongly opposed.",
      "The airport wants to move its northern runway, which is currently only used for taxiing or as a back up, and make it operational by the end of the decade.",
      "The transport secretary's support does not guarantee the expansion will go ahead as it would still need planning permission.",
      "If permission is granted, work would start almost immediately, the BBC understands. The \u00a32.2bn expansion will be funded through private investment.",
      "\"I am issuing a minded to approve decision that provides some additional time to seek views from all parties on the provisions, prior to a final decision,\" Alexander said in a written ministerial statement on Tuesday.",

      "The Transport Secretary's support for expansion comes as the government is looking at ways to boost economic growth in a bid to boost living standards, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves backing a third runway at Heathrow last month.",

      "On Tuesday, Alexander told industry leaders aviation was good for economic growth and said she was \"not some sort of flight-shaming eco warrior\".",
      "The growth arguments for expanding Heathrow and Gatwick, the UK's two largest airports, differ with the former catering for more freight traffic relating to international goods trade.",
      "An extra runway at Gatwick would see capacity increased for holidaymakers and business travellers, particularly for short-haul destinations, as opposed to Heathrow's longer-haul flights.",
      "Gatwick managers have said that with 55 take-offs and landings in a busy hour, the airport is \"full\".",
      "Being able to use both runways could increase the number of departures by 50,000 a year by the end of the 2030s, the airport argued.",
      "It said some 30,000 of those flights are planned to depart from the north runway which will only be used for departures and not landings.",
      "But there is strong opposition to any expansion, particularly from climate campaigners.",

    "story": [
      "Donald Trump said he planned to hit goods from China with a new 10% tariff, the latest salvo in the US president's steadily escalating trade fights.",
      "Imports from China already face taxes at the border of at least 10%, after a Trump tariff order that went into effect earlier this month.",
      "China's ministry of foreign affairs said it \"strongly\" expressed its \"dissatisfaction and resolute opposition\" to the plans.",
      "Trump also said on Thursday he intended to move forward with threatened 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, which are set to come into effect on 4 March.",
      "Trump's comments came as officials from Mexico and Canada were in Washington for discussions aimed at heading off that plan.",
      "Trump had announced the plans for 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada for 4 February unless the two nations increased border security.",
      "He paused the measures for a month at the last minute after the two countries agreed to increase border funding and talk more about how to combat drug trafficking.",
      "On social media on Thursday, Trump wrote that he did not think enough action had been taken to address the flow of fentanyl to the US.",
      "\"Drugs are still pouring into our Country from Mexico and Canada at very high and unacceptable levels,\" he wrote, adding that \"a large percentage\" of the drugs were made in China.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, at a press conference from the country's National Palace, said in response: \"As we know, [Trump] has his way of communicating.\"",
      "She added: \"I hope we can reach an agreement and on 4 March we can announce something else.\"",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also said his country was working hard to reach a deal, warning tariffs from the US would prompt an \"immediate and extremely strong response\".",
      "Trump's threats against Mexico and Canada have raised widespread alarm, as the North American economy is closely connected after decades of operating under a free trade agreement.",
      "Leaders of the two countries have previously said they would impose retaliatory tariffs on the United States if the White House went ahead with its plans.",
      "Tariffs are a tax collected by the government and paid for by the business bringing the goods into the country.",
      "China, Mexico and Canada are America's top three trade partners, together accounting for more than 40% of imports into the US last year.",
      "Economists have warned tariffs on goods from the three countries could lead to higher prices in the US on everything from iPhones to avocados.",
      "Trump's call for an additional 10% levy on goods from China - which he said would also go into effect on Tuesday - had not been previously announced, though during his presidential campaign he backed border taxes on Chinese products of as much as 60%.",
      "A spokesperson for China's ministry of foreign affairs, Lin Jian, said that Trump was using the issue of the drug fentanyl entering the US from China as an \"excuse\" to threaten tariffs, adding it had one of the \"strictest\" drug control policies in the world.",
      "\"Pressure, coercion, and threats are not the correct way to deal with China,\" he said.",
      "Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy, had earlier said that his country was already working with the US to address the concerns about fentanyl, and had made \"visual progress\" in areas such as information exchange, case cooperation and online advertisement cleanup.",
      "\"Reducing domestic drug demand and strengthening law enforcement cooperation are the fundamental solutions,\" he said in a statement, which warned that Trump's tariff moves were \"bound to affect and undermine future counternarcotics cooperation between the two sides\".",
      "\"The unilateral tariffs imposed by the US will not solve its own problems, nor will it benefit the two sides or the world.\"",
      "Trump's comments, which called for drug flow to stop or be \"severely limited\", seemed to set the stage for Mexico and Canada to negotiate, said trade expert Christine McDaniel, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Washington University.",
      "On Thursday, as tariff talks intensified, two imprisoned alleged leaders of the violent Zetas cartel long sought by the US - Miguel Angel Trevino Morales and his brother Oscar - were extradited.",
      "Mexican media said they were part of a larger group of drug lords sent from Mexico to the US - a major step in terms of US-Mexico security relations.",
      "Ms McDaniel said Trump's demands of China were less clear, raising the likelihood that those measures will come into effect.",
      "Trump's initial round of tariffs on China was eclipsed by his threats against Canada and Mexico. But the potential for further duties raises questions about how businesses will respond.",
      "Ms McDaniel said she expected the hit to be felt more in China.",
      "\"It's not costless for the US, but so far it seems more costly for China,\" she said.",
      "The impact of tariffs, if they go into effect, is expected to be felt more in the Canadian and Mexican economies, which count on the US as a key export market.",
      "But analysts have warned that the threat of the levies, even if they are never imposed, is still likely to have a chilling effect on investment, including in the US.",
      "China has already responded to the first round of tariffs from the US with its own tariffs on US products, including coal and agricultural machinery.",
      "Trump has dismissed fears about damage to the American economy."

      "BP said it would increase its investments in oil and gas by about 20% to $10bn (\u00a37.9bn) a year, while decreasing previously planned funding for renewables by more than $5bn (\u00a33.9bn).",
      "The move comes as rivals Shell and Norwegian company Equinor have also scaled back plans to invest in green energy and US President Donald Trump's \"drill baby drill\" comments have encouraged investment in fossil fuels.",
      "Murray Auchincloss, BP's chief executive, said the energy giant had gone \"too far, too fast\" in the transition away from fossil fuels, and that its faith in green energy was \"misplaced\".",
      "He said BP would be \"very selective\" in investing in businesses working on the energy transition to renewables going forward, with funding reduced to between $1.5bn and $2bn per year.",
      "He said this was part of a strategy \"reset\" by the company to focus on boosting returns for shareholders.",
      "Helge Lund, chair of BP, added that the new direction of the firm had \"cash flow growth\" at its heart.",
      "Shares in the company climbed before Tuesday's announcement but fell shortly after.",
      "BP is one of several firms in the energy industry to return focus on oil and gas production, which has seen an increase in profits as prices have increased following lows seen during the Covid pandemic.",
      "The firm said it plans to increase its production to between 2.3 million and 2.5 million barrels of oil per day by 2030, with hopes of \"major\" oil and gas projects starting by the end of 2027.",

      "Last week, a group of 48 investors called on the company to allow them a vote on any potential plans to move away from commitments to renewables.",
      "The environmental group Greenpeace UK said the latest move was \"proof that fossil fuel companies can't or won't be part of climate crisis solutions\".",

      "'Not just down to one company'",
      "Challenged on the reduced commitment to investing in renewable energy, Louise Kingham, BP's senior vice president for Europe and the UK, said none of the changes announced on Tuesday would alter the UK's green energy plans, which include three wind farms and carbon capture projects.",
      "She said the shift to renewable energy sources had slowed but that BP's ambition had \"not changed\" to become a net-zero company.",
      "According to the International Energy Agency, no new fossil fuel projects are compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5C compared to pre-industrial levels,",
      "\"We just have to do this transition more smartly and more efficiently and try to get those returns for our owners because they are helping us to do that. If we don't generate the returns, we can't invest and do more,\" Ms Kingham told the Scottish Affairs committee of MPs.",

    "story": [
      "Shares in electric car maker Tesla have slumped more than 9% after EU and UK sales fell by almost half in January.",
      "The drop in Tesla shares took the company's valuation back below $1trn for the first time since November 2024.",
      "Tesla has been facing stiff competition in the European market from Chinese and other manufacturers.",
      "In addition, Tesla owner Elon Musk has been making controversial political waves on both sides of the Atlantic, an analyst said.",
      "Tesla sales in January bucked European electric car sale trends, which grew by more than a third in the month, according to trade body Acea.",
      "Instead, Tesla sales across the EU, EFTA and the UK fell more than 45%, and more than 50% in the EU alone.",
      "It comes after Tesla sales fell last year for the first time in more than a decade as demand faltered and rivals gained pace.",
      "The main factor in the January sales slump was likely to be increasing competition, AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said.",
      "Chinese manufacturer BYD has been making big strides, in part because it includes as standard some features which cost extra from other makers, Mould said.",
      "However, some car buyers may also be taking a \"principled stand\" on Musk's political interventions, he said.",
      "Musk has made waves in the US with his involvement in slashing US development funds and efforts to drastically reduce US federal funding.",
      "In the UK he supports jailed far-right activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson, and repeatedly criticised Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.",

      "Too toxic?",
      "Asked if the reason for Tesla's share price slump was down to Musk being too toxic, a former senior director of the car maker's Europe, Middle East and Asia division said it was \"definitely one of the reasons for the decline\", but added there was a \"cumulative number of things that are piling up a domino effect\".",
      "\"There's no doubt his flirting with the right in politics, running around on TV with a chainsaw is not exactly helping his image,\" Peter Bardenfleth-Hansen told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "\"He may be getting a bigger fanbase within a specific type of clientele, but they're not the ones that are buying the Teslas. They're not the ones putting money in to his company. So he has a problem.\"",
      "Tesla shares got a big boost after the US election due to Musk's closeness to Donald Trump - Musk has described himself as \"first buddy\" to the US president.",
      "Investors thought this would stand his businesses in good stead.",
      "However, Trump is not a supporter of electric vehicles, and has said he will cancel efforts to boost their ownership.",
      "\"How anybody thought this was going to be good for Tesla, I don't know,\" Mould said.",
      "There is also general market skittishness about the path of interest rate cuts and concerns about Trump tariff plans that could be contributing to the fall, he added."

    "summary": "Ireland is investing billions of euros to revamp its healthcare service - will AI help?",
    "story": [
      "For a country famous as Big Tech's European address, Ireland's hospitals often lag far behind in technology.",
      "They lack shared computerised patient records, or unique identifiers to track people when they move between clinics.",
      "In July 2024, a computer system failure made Dublin's Mater hospital push back surgeries and beg people not to come to its A&E.",
      "Three years before, Russian ransomware attackers shut down the Irish health system's entire computer network, and published 520 people's medical records online.",
      "But Ireland now has ambitious goals to modernise its healthcare.",
      "That includes a programme called Sl\u00e1intecare. Announced in 2017, the plan is to use some of its \u20ac22.9bn (\u00a320bn; $24bn) budget surplus to create a healthcare service that is free at the point of care, like the UK's or Canada's.",
      "To improve healthcare, pinch points like diagnostics will have to be improved.",
      "It's a problem being tackled at Dublin's Mater hospital, 164-years-old and the location of Ireland's busiest emergency department.",
      "That's especially so in winter, when one day early this January Irish A&E departments had 444 people on trolleys waiting to be seen.",
      "\"In Ireland, the big problem we have is waiting lists, and in particular waiting for diagnostics, for MRI [magnetic resonance imaging] or CT [computed tomography] scans,\" says Prof Peter McMahon, a consultant radiologist at the Mater.",
      "Because of Prof MacMahon, who as a medical student dabbled as a hobbyist programmer, the Mater is now among the first hospitals in Ireland to use artificial intelligence (AI) across its radiology department - the part of a hospital providing medical imaging to diagnose diseases and guide treatment.",
      "To make sure patients with the most urgent needs are seen first, Prof MacMahon says: \"We use AI to immediately analyse all head scans for bleeds, all chest scans for blood clots, and all bone x-rays for fractures.\"",
      "The AI is particularly helpful in assisting younger doctors, when they don't have experienced consultants to turn to.",
      "\"Now a nurse or junior doctor at 2am isn't alone, they've got a wing man,\" he says.",
      "Rural hospitals face different kinds of challenges.",
      "Letterkenny University Hospital in Donegal is without MRI facilities at evenings and weekends.",
      "Currently, a patient urgently needing an MRI scan at night can face an ambulance ride to Dublin.",
      "But now, Prof MacMahon and the Mater's AI research fellow Paul Banahan have trained a trial AI model to create a \"synthetic MRI\" from CT scans, to immediately triage patients with suspected spinal injuries.",
      "That was done by feeding a \"generative AI\" model around 9,500 pairs of CT and MRI images of the same area on the same person.",
      "Now the AI can predict what the MRI scan would look like from the CT scan, something available in all emergency departments.",
      "And since radiology scans also come with doctors' text reports, he is also exploring using large language models to identify important disease patterns and trends.",
      "Applying AI to medical images in Ireland is easier since the country has stored scans in a central, digital filing system since 2008.",
      "But a lot of other important information, like medical notes or electrocardiograms (ECGs), remains largely in paper format in most Irish hospitals, or in smaller databases that are not shared centrally.",
      "That will \"severely delay\" applying AI to spot potential diseases and improve clinical care, points out Prof MacMahon.",
      "Ageing IT systems in Irish healthcare are more broadly a challenge.",
      "\"Quite bluntly, a lot of hospitals are dealing with legacy IT systems where they're just trying to keep the show on the road,\" says Dr Robert Ross, a senior computer science lecturer at Technological University Dublin.",
      "\"Doing anything else like integrating AI is not easy to do,\" he says.",
      "Using AI in healthcare is not without problems.",
      "An example here is AI speech-recognition tools. Using them could let doctors spend less time on note-taking and report writing.",
      "But some have been found to make things up, including to invent non-existent medication.",
      "To prevent such AI from hallucinating, \"you need to make sure it's penalised in its training, if it gives you something that doesn't exist,\" says Prof MacMahon.",
      "AIs can have biases, but \"humans have biases too\", he points out.",
      "A tired doctor, expecting a young patient to be healthy, can overlook their blood clot.",
      "\"For whatever reason we're far more open to accept human error\", than in new health technology where \"the acceptable risk is zero\", says Prof Se\u00e1n Kennelly, a consultant at Tallaght University Hospital and professor at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "This means we \"continue with the illusion of 100% accuracy in humans\", and ignore areas where AI-supported technology can make better clinical decisions, he says.",
      "Healthcare regulators, who already have a \"weak enough\" understanding of software as a medical device, haven't at all caught up with rules for AI, says Dr Aidan Boran, founder of an Irish medical tech start-up called Digital Gait Labs, and a researcher at Dublin City University.",
      "For example, getting a CE mark, which shows that a medical device meets EU safety regulations, includes providing details about the factory where the product is manufactured.",
      "But in the case of software that is not relevant says Dr Boran. \"For us, manufacturing literally means copying software,\" he points out.",
      "AI can have a black box problem: we can see what goes in them and what comes out, but the deep learning systems that power these models are so complex that even their creators do not understand exactly what happens inside them.",
      "That can create difficulties for a doctor trying to explain treatment decisions that involve AI, says Dr Paul Gilligan, head of St Patrick's Mental Health Services, one of Ireland's largest mental health providers that runs St Patrick's Hospital in Dublin.",
      "When AI influences their decisions, doctors need to \"be able to articulate the reasoning behind those decisions in a manner that is accessible and understandable to those affected,\" he says.",

      "In 2022, 73,684 taxpayers benefitted from this incentive, according to official data.",
      "After a snap election in March, the new centre-right Portuguese government led by Luis Montenegro doubled down on the idea and expanded it from five to 10 years, and to all workers under 35 independently of their educational levels.",
      "The proposal, passed by the Portuguese parliament in late November, is due to benefit up to 400,000 workers, according to the Portuguese Ministry of Finance.",
      "But specialists say it likely won't be enough to keep the young from going abroad.",
      "\"It is unlikely that, on its own, the tax regime will make young workers remain in the country, whether because professional opportunities are more abundant in foreign countries, or due to the fact this tax benefit applies only to yearly incomes under \u20ac28,000,\" says S\u00e9rgio Vasques, professor of tax law at the Cat\u00f3lica Lisbon School of Law.",
      "He points out that the Portuguese government still takes more of the average worker's salary than most richer nations.",
      "Known as the tax wedge, the ratio between the amount of taxes paid by an average single worker without children and the corresponding total labour cost for the employer, stands at 42.3% in Portugal.",
      "That's the 8th highest among the 38 member countries of the OECD.",
      "\"This is a tax regime that is an enemy of qualified work and professional success. This regime will not solve this problem,\" adds Mr Vasques.",
      "Mr Vasques, also a former secretary of state for tax affairs in the early 2010s, adds: \"I also cannot imagine a young professional deciding to move to Portugal just because of an extra couple hundred euros at the end of the year.",

      "Ms de La Feria, who moved to the UK at a young age, told the BBC that when she left Portugal she did not intend to \"leave for good: many leave their countries of origin thinking they will come back at some point. But once they form a family, it's almost impossible to return.\"",
      "Antonio Almeida, a software engineer like Mr Dias, left Portugal during the pandemic in late 2020 for a job in Berlin, right after finishing his degree. He would change the German capital for Brussels two years later. All his work experience was done abroad.",

      "This includes some 19m tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation \"one of the top five leading countries\" for the supply of the mineral. Graphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.",
      "Ukraine has 7% of Europe's supplies of titanium, a lightweight metal used in the construction of everything from aeroplanes to power stations.",
      "It is also home to a third of all European lithium deposits, the key component in current batteries.",
      "Other elements found in Ukraine include beryllium and uranium, which are both crucial for nuclear weapons and reactors.",
      "Deposits of copper, lead, zinc, silver, nickel, cobalt and manganese are also significant.",
      "Further, Ukraine has significant deposits of rare earth metals. These are a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world.",
      "Some of the mineral deposits, however, have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.",
      "In 2022, SecDev, a geopolitical risk consultancy based in Canada, conducted an evaluation, which established that Russia had occupied 63% of Ukrainian coal mines, as well as half of its manganese, caesium, tantalum and rare earth deposits.",

    "story": [
      "A 14-year-old boy has lost a court case he brought against his own parents after they moved him from London to Ghana to go to boarding school.",
      "The boy, described in court as shy, articulate, a keen cook and footballer, said his parents had tricked him into going to Africa, saying it was to visit a sick relative.",
      "He said had he known he was being sent to boarding school \"there would have been no way I would have agreed to it\".",
      "But the High Court in London also heard his parents were worried he was being \"groomed\" into criminal activity.",
      "In a written statement to the court, he said: \"I feel like I am living in hell. I really do not think I deserve this and I want to come home, back to England, as soon as possible.\"",
      "In his judgment, High Court judge Mr Justice Hayden said he recognised that \"this is, in many ways, both a sobering and rather depressing conclusion.\"",
      "He said that he was satisfied that the parents' wish for their son to move to Ghana was \"driven by their deep, obvious and unconditional love\".",
      "The boy was at risk of suffering greater harm returning to the UK, he said.",
      "He said that the boy's parents believe \"and in my judgement with reason\" that their son has \"at very least peripheral involvement with gang culture and has exhibited an unhealthy interest in knives\".",
      "The boy's father told the judge the couple did not want their son to be \"yet another black teenager stabbed to death in the streets of London.\"",
      "The boy, who had lived in the UK since birth, said he was \"mocked\" and \"never settled in\" at the school in Ghana.",
      "He said he \"could also barely understand what was going on and I would get into fights\".",
      "The boy wrote that he was \"so scared and desperate\" that he emailed the British High Commission in Accra as well as contacting the charity Children and Family Across Borders, who it is believed put him in touch with lawyers at the International Family Law Group.",
      "\"I am from London, England, and I want to go back home,\" he wrote.",
      "He said he had been \"mistreated\" at the school, adding: \"I'm begging to go back to my old school.\"",
      "However the High Court heard that the boy's parents had sent him because they feared for his safety in London.",
      "In a statement, his mother said sending him to Africa was \"not a punishment but a measure to protect him\".",
      "She referred to the murder of Kelyan Bokassa, the 14-year-old boy who was stabbed to death on a bus in Woolwich in January. That was \"every parent's worst nightmare\", she said.",
      "She said she did not believe her son would survive in the UK and did not want to be part of her son's \"destruction\".",
      "Rebecca Foulkes, representing the boy's father, said the boy met 11 of the points on a checklist produced by the children's charity NSPCC to indicate whether a child might have joined a gang or was being criminally exploited.",
      "That included being absent from school, having unexplained money, buying new things, and carrying weapons.",
      "She said it was not only the parents who were worried.",
      "His school claimed it had \"suspicions about him engaging in criminal activities\" and had observed him in expensive clothes and with mobile phones.",
      "The boy said he had never been part of a gang, nor \"involved in gangs in any way\". He said he \"does not know anyone involved in a gang\" and he does not carry a knife.",
      "He acknowledged in his statements that \"my behaviour wasn't the best\" and said he thought that was the reason his parents sent him to Africa.",
      "The case centred on the question of parental responsibility, and whether the parents acted unlawfully by sending their son to boarding school without his consent.",
      "In a statement issued after the judgement, his parents said: \"This has been a really difficult time for us all.\"",
      "They added: \"Our priority has always been protecting our son and our focus now is on moving forward as a family.\"",
      "James Netto from the International Family Law Group, who represented the boy, said the court judgment had been a \"real shock\" to the teenager.",
      "\"He was obviously incredibly disappointed, incredibly upset and is considering his next steps carefully.\"",
      "'I want to have an education'",
      "The boy's barrister, Deirdre Fottrell KC, pointed out the school was not simply far from home - but a completely different jurisdiction.",
      "The boy wrote that his education was suffering. He felt the Ghanaian classes were not as challenging as those in his English school, and he had been out of formal education entirely since last summer, studying online.",
      "He wrote: \"I want to have an education again and grow up like a normal person. I feel like my brain is hurt here. I feel like now I am dumber than people I used to be smarter than.\"",
      "The boy's father has recently visited him in Africa, and he told the court that he and his son had got on well.",
      "He said he would like his son to remain in Ghana, and said they visited a different boarding school where the boy could be considered for a place.",
      "The father said they were both very impressed.",
      "However, questioned by Ms Fottrell, he acknowledged there was no place in that school until September, and that his son had not said he wanted to go there.",
      "The boy's solicitor said he had recently seen a rise in similar cases where teenagers were trying to return to the UK.",
      "\"Teenagers are often placed in exceptionally challenging or vulnerable situations, and are now beginning to turn to the court for protection,\" Mr Netto said.",
      "He said he had seen cases where \"in their parents' eyes\" young people were \"falling in with the wrong crowd or are adopting what their parents see as unorthodox or challenging behaviours\".",

    "story": [
      "Nudity, swearing, petulance, club anthems, more nudity and a woman dressed as a horse - the 2025 Brit Awards had it all.",
      "Charli XCX was the big winner, taking home five prizes in all - including best artist, best album and song of the year.",
      "US star - and the BBC's Sound of 2025 - Chappell Roan picked up two awards; while Ezra Collective, The Last Dinner Party, Fontaines DC and Stormzy got one apiece.",
      "But no-one's only interested in all that. Here's what really went down at the 2025 ceremony at London's O2 Arena.",
      "Most predictable winner: Charli XCX",
      "Listen, this was never going to be anything other than Charli's night.",
      "The pop star's seventh album, Brat, captured the cultural zeitgeist in a way that few artists ever manage.",
      "Released in June, the record combined abrasive dance-floor beats, soaring hooks and meme-friendly artwork; as the 32-year-old assessed her place in the music industry, the real and imaginary rivals she's accumulated along the way, and whether or not to leave it all behind to have a baby.",
      "In the star's own words, the album was \"chaos and emotional turmoil set to a club soundtrack\".",
      "Just as everyone was absorbing that, she hired a bunch of guest stars - Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, Lorde, Addison Rae, Bon Iver - and re-recorded an entirely new, sometimes superior, version of the album.",
      "Critics called it \"pop music for the future\" and praised the way its \"painfully relatable\" lyrics captured Charli's coming of age.",
      "Knowingly trashy, yet surprisingly deep, it was easily the best British album of the last 12 months - and one that proved Charli's detractors wrong.",
      "\"I feel like dance music, electronic music, gets a really bad rep because everyone is like, 'It's not that deep, is it? And I kind of feel it is,\" she said after collecting her second award.",
      "\"This genre of music, for me, is euphoric, it allows me to escape, it allows me to feel on such a deep level.\"",
      "Best visual pun: This coat",
      "Teddy Swims, swimming in teddy bears. We see what he did there.",
      "Least practical dress: Jade Thirlwall",
      "Jade Thirlwall was the last of the Little Mix crew to launch a solo career, but she's been giving it her all.",
      "As well as winning best pop artist at Saturday's ceremony, she put on one of the night's highest-concept performances - a five-act melodrama about the cruelty of the music industry and her creative rebirth.",
      "Over the course of the night, she wore six different outfits. But she chose the wrong one for climbing the stairs to pick up her trophy. Thank goodness the Sugababes were there to help.",
      "Sneakiest host: Jack Whitehall",
      "Jack Whitehall made a welcome return as the ceremony's host, after four years away.",
      "As ever, his jokes were close to the bone... including a passing reference to allegations surrounding some presenters on Brits broadcaster ITV.",
      "\"ITV had so many of its presenters cancelled this year that they had to come crawling back to an ex, and what an honour it is to be hosting again the biggest night in British music,\" he joked.",
      "Later, he described Youtuber-turned-musician KSI as \"an inspiration\".",
      "\"Because you listen to Kendrick Lamar and you're like, 'I couldn't do that in a million years'. Then I listen to your song and I'm like, 'Oh, I could do this'.\"",
      "Speaking before the show, Whitehall revealed a sneaky secret: He uses a fake script during rehearsals.",
      "\"Previously I used to do the actual script in rehearsal, and then you'd have an hour of people from record labels and publishers coming and knocking on the dressing room door going, 'You can't say this, you can't say that',\" he told Heart radio.",
      "\"So now I just do this fake script, which if you heard it, you'd be like, 'This is the lamest script ever', because it's all me just complimenting everyone and going, 'Oh, our next award is the best musician I've ever heard. They're great.'\"",

      "The Brits were set up in 1977 to celebrate the British Music Industry, and they are run by the BPI - an organisation funded by, and representing, the biggest record labels in the country.",
      "But lots of the winners on Saturday used their speeches to criticise the way they are being treated.",

      "Asked about the moment he realised it had taken on a life of its own, he told us: \"I got new wi-fi the other day, and they put me on hold... and it was Stargazing.",

      "But was the decision to hand her the \"global success\" award a thinly-veiled ploy to tempt her back on to the stage?",
      "The prize was originally created in 2013 to recognise British acts who had sold millions of records and concert tickets abroad. The previous recipients were One Direction (2013-14), Sam Smith (2015), Adele (2016-17) and Ed Sheeran (2018-19).",
      "Six years ago it was abandoned altogether... until they needed something to honour Sabrina.",

    "story": [
      "\"He loved being an actor, and hated all the stuff that surrounds being an actor.\"",
      "That, for film director Barry Sonnenfeld, is how he'll remember Gene Hackman, who has died at the age of 95.",
      "The endless hours in hair and makeup, repeated takes, and studio notes all frustrated Hackman, Sonnenfeld told BBC News.",
      "So too did actors who showed up not knowing their lines - notably John Travolta, who Hackman clashed with on the set of 1995 film Get Shorty, which Sonnenfeld directed.",
      "In the days since the news of Hackman's death, I've been speaking to people here in Los Angeles and beyond, who, like Sonnenfeld, knew and worked with him.",
      "What's immediately clear is how seriously Hackman took acting, and how meticulously he dealt with scripts.",
      "But what's also clear is that he was wary of the trappings of Hollywood.",
      "What we know about the death of Gene Hackman",
      "What we know about the death of Gene Hackman",
      "Hackman, a two-time Oscar winner, died alongside his wife Betsy Arakawa, 65, and their dog at his home in New Mexico. No cause of death was given, but police said the situation was \"suspicious enough\" to merit investigation.",
      "Officials said on Friday that evidence points to Hackman having been dead since 17 February, 10 days before the couples' bodies were found.",
      "'He put the fear of God into me'",
      "In LA, Hackman's face is everywhere on television bulletins and on newspapers.",
      "His death was all anyone was talking about as stars gathered for pre-Oscars parties.",
      "I was at one of those events on Thursday night, where the American actor John C Reilly told me that he expected the Academy to commemorate Hackman on Sunday. \"I don't see how you could have the Oscars without mentioning a great like him who's passed.\"",
      "For Sonnenfeld and for the Irish director John Moore \u2013 who directed Hackman in 2001's Behind Enemy Lines \u2013 it was Hackman's way of dealing with scripts that demonstrated his brilliance. He would remove all of the scriptwriter's notes about how his character should deliver his lines.",
      "\"Because he didn't want any screenwriter to tell him how he was supposed to feel at that moment,\" Sonnenfeld said.",
      "\"So he had unique cut and pasted scripts that had no information from the writer about anything, because he wanted to make those choices, not the writer.\"",
      "Moore recalls a similar incident from the very first time he filmed with Hackman.",
      "\"He was just quietly sitting there, taking script pages out, cutting them up, removing extraneous stuff like scene descriptions, and then sticking them back onto blank pages,\" he said.",
      "He said Hackman told him: \"Acting is my job, you do the rest.\"",
      "\"It put the fear of God into me,\" Moore said, laughing.",
      "\"It was essentially him saying: 'I don't need anything, as I'm that good. You better bring your A-game, as I'm bringing mine.'\"",
      "It wasn't just superfluous studio notes that bothered Hackman.",
      "\"He had this conflict in that he was this brilliant actor but he hated the tropes of what it took to act in movies,\" said Sonnenfeld.",
      "\"[He] hated putting on makeup. The putting on of wardrobe. The wardrobe person after takes, taking their lip brush and rubbing down their wardrobe. The makeup person recombing his hair while he's talking to me,\" he said.",
      "\"All that sort of fussy hair and makeup and all that stuff, I think that drove him crazy.\"",
      "Nor did he often want to socialise after filming, said Moore.",
      "\"I'd try and have a drink with him after we'd shoot, and go up to the minibar,\" he said.",
      "\"He'd have one, that was it. [Betsy] would give him that look, and off it would be to bed. And he was in great shape in the morning as a result.\"",
      "\"For Gene, it was all about the acting,\" added Sonnenfeld. \"End of story. Get me out of here as fast as possible.\"",
      "Showdown with John Travolta",
      "Hackman could be \"a hard actor\" to work with, said Sonnenfeld. \"He suffered no fools.\"",
      "In Get Shorty, Hackman starred alongside Travolta, who plays a Miami mobster sent to collect a debt.",
      "\"Gene was a consummate actor, both technically and artistically. So he came to set every day knowing his lines,\" Sonnenfeld said.",

      "Hackman responded: \"Nothing except learn the lines,\" to which Travolta replied, \"Well that's a waste of a weekend,\" according to Sonnenfeld.",
      "As filming went on, Hackman grew \"angrier and angrier\" at his co-star not knowing his lines.",
      "Sonnenfeld said he let Hackman take out his rage on him.",
      "\"For the next 12 weeks, he would yell at me whenever John didn't know his lines,\" he said.",

      "\"He was a tough nut, Gene Hackman. But he was really good.\"",

      "\"So I could see how he might be funny about actors who were peacocking themselves,\" he said.",
      "\"But again it goes back to the point - he just really wanted to make the films exceptional.\"",
      "Hackman retired from acting in 2004 and from then on lived a quiet life in New Mexico with his wife.",
      "\"I suspect that one of the reasons he moved to Santa Fe, again, great outdoors and as far away from Hollywood as you can get,\" said Sonnenfeld.",
      "In 2008, Hackman gave a rare interview with Reuters, in which he was asked if he missed acting.",
      "He responded by saying the business was, for him, \"very stressful\".",
      "\"The compromises that you have to make in films are just part of the beast, and it had gotten to a point where I just didn't feel like I wanted to do it anymore.\"",
      "But, he added: \"I miss the actual acting part of it, as it's what I did for almost 60 years.",

      "US investigators are trying to establish how Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman and his wife, classical pianist Betsy Arakawa, died after the discovery of their bodies at their home in the US state of New Mexico.",
      "Officials said on Friday that evidence points to Hackman having been dead since 17 February - 10 days before the couples' bodies were found.",
      "Here is what we know so far about the death of a Hollywood legend known for such films as The French Connection and The Conversation.",
      "Warning: this article contains details some readers may find upsetting",
      "",
      "How were the deaths discovered?",
      "The bodies of the couple and one of their dogs were found by police on Wednesday at their home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, after a maintenance worker called emergency services.",
      "In a recording of the 911 call obtained by the BBC, the emotional caller can be heard telling a dispatcher how he found the two bodies.",
      "Hackman, 95, was discovered in a side room near the kitchen while Arakawa, 65, was found in a bathroom, at the property on Old Sunset Trail in Hyde Park.",
      "The couple appeared to have been \"dead for quite a while\", said Sheriff Adan Mendoza.",
      "Arakawa's body showed signs of \"decomposition\", and \"mummification\" in the hands and feet, a sheriff's detective said.",
      "Hackman's remains \"showed obvious signs of death, similar and consistent\" with those on his spouse.",
      "A German Shepherd dog owned by the couple was found dead in a bathroom closet near to Arakawa.",
      "What do we know about the cause of death for Hackman and Arakawa?",
      "No cause was given in police statements immediately after the announcement of the deaths.",
      "The authorities reported no signs of injury but deemed the deaths \"suspicious enough\" to investigate and did not rule out foul play.",
      "A carbon monoxide poisoning test came out negative for both Arakawa and Hackman, the Santa Fe Sheriff's office said on Friday.",
      "Near Arakawa's head was a portable heater, which the detective determined could have been brought down in the event that she had abruptly fallen to the ground.",
      "An autopsy and toxicology tests have been requested for both Hackman and Arakawa. Authorities said it could be a few months before the results of those are released.",
      "The local utility company found no sign of a gas leak in the area and the fire department detected no indication of a carbon monoxide leak or poisoning, according to the search warrant.",
      "A prescription bottle and scattered pills lay on the bathroom countertop close to Arakawa's body. Prescription pills found in the home were common medications for thyroid and high blood pressure, according to a search warrant.",
      "Hackman was discovered wearing grey tracksuit bottoms, a blue long-sleeve T-shirt and brown slippers. Sunglasses and a walking cane lay next to his body.",

      "Gene Hackman's daughters and Clint Eastwood lead tributes to star",
      "Gene Hackman: One of Hollywood's greatest 'tough guys'",
      "Why are the deaths considered suspicious?",
      "The circumstances of their death were deemed \"suspicious enough in nature to require a thorough search and investigation\", the search warrant says, because the worker who called emergency services had found the front door of the property open.",
      "However, the detective observed no sign of forced entry into the home. Nothing appeared out of place inside.",
      "\"There was no indication of a struggle,\" said Sheriff Mendoza. \"There was no indication of anything that was missing from the home or disturbed, you know, that would be indication that there was a crime that had occurred.\"",
      "Two other, healthy dogs were discovered roaming the property - one inside and one out.",
      "What do we know about the time of their deaths?",
      "Authorities said Hackman's pacemaker last registered activity on 17 February, adding that this gives them a good assumption that was his last day of life.",
      "But police said it is unclear who died first - Hackman or Arakawa.",
      "The two maintenance workers who found the couple, one of whom called the emergency services, say they last had contact with the couple two weeks earlier.",
      "The two said they had sometimes conducted routine work at the property, but rarely ever saw Hackman and Arakawa.",
      "They had communicated with them by phone and text, primarily with Arakawa.",
      "What do we know about the couple's health?",
      "Hackman's daughter Leslie Anne Hackman told the Mail Online that her father had been in \"very good physical condition\" despite his age, and had not undergone \"any major surgeries\" in recent months.",
      "\"He liked to do Pilates and yoga, and he was continuing to do that several times a week,\" she said. \"So he was in good health.\"",
      "The couple, married in 1991, had had a \"wonderful marriage\", she added.",
      "\"I give credit to his wife, Betsy, for keeping him alive,' she said. '[Betsy] took very, very good care of him and was always looking out for his health.\""

    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 22:16:23 GMT",
    "summary": "Fallout from the film about Gaza's children is a reputationally damaging mess, says the BBC's media editor Katie Razzall.",
    "story": [
      "As guests sat down on the red cinema-style seats in the screening room of a plush central London hotel, nobody could have imagined that, less than a month later,  the BBC would find itself forced to apologise for serious and unacceptable flaws in the documentary that was about to be shown.",
      "In the darkness, Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone unfolded over an hour, telling in bleak and upsetting detail the story of Gaza's children over recent months of the war.",
      "Screenings are standard practice for media companies, primarily for outside press to review a programme ahead of broadcast.",
      "Also in the room was BBC News CEO Deborah Turness and other senior executives from the BBC's news and current affairs to view what one described as a \"landmark\" piece of filmmaking.",
      "But after the programme went out on BBC Two, it emerged that the child narrator at the heart of the film, 13-year old Abdullah, was the son of a Hamas government official. The outcry and accusations of anti-Israel bias and lack of transparency led the BBC to pull the film from iPlayer.",
      "Questions were asked in Parliament.",
      "'Fell short of expectations'",
      "Criticism continued about the programme's subtitling choices \u2013 including contributors using the Arabic word for \"Jews\" on camera, which was translated in the subtitles as \"Israelis\" or \"Israeli army\". Some argue that the BBC covered up antisemitism. Others have claimed the subtitles are closer to what the speaker intends rather than a literal translation.",
      "After an initial investigation, the BBC said the programme, which had been commissioned by the BBC and made by an outside production company, \"fell short of our expectations\".",
      "It launched a further review headed by the director of editorial complaints and reviews, Peter Johnston. He will look at whether editorial guidelines were broken and whether anyone should be disciplined.",
      "It's a reputationally damaging mess, but how could it have happened? How did the commissioners of the programme not know that the child narrator's father was a deputy minister for agriculture in the Hamas-run government?",
      "The BBC says it had asked the production company \"a number of times\" in writing during the making of the film about any connections he and his family might have with Hamas, a proscribed terrorist organisation by the US, UK and others.",
      "In a statement on Thursday the BBC said Hoyo Films, the maker of the film, acknowledged it \"never told the BBC this fact\".",
      "But what did it tell the BBC about the child?",
      "Crucially, the BBC failed to uncover the information itself.",
      "Embarking on a documentary about one of the most polarising and contested issues of our age was always going to be challenging.",
      "The talented director at Hoyo, Jamie Roberts, has won an Emmy award for his film about the evacuation of Kabul. He's award-nominated for a powerful documentary about the events of 6 January in the US. He also made a searing film for the BBC about the Ukraine war.",
      "But he hadn't directed a documentary set in the Middle East before. He was working with the Palestinian journalist, Yousef Hammash, whose Gaza reporting for Channel 4 has won him a Bafta and an Emmy last year.",
      "The BBC commissioners in current affairs will have known the programme wasn't without risk.",
      "In circumstances like this, it's even more difficult to understand how the failings that have driven headlines for days - and done terrible damage to the BBC's reputation - could have occurred.",
      "Programme-makers and commissioners have previously told me they draw up risk grids to ensure they have the answers to any criticism thrown at them about their documentaries. They check and check and check to ensure they won't face problems after their programmes go out - or if they do, that they have the counter-argument ready.",
      "Dorothy Byrne, Channel 4's head of news and current affairs until 2020, told BBC Radio 4's Media Show she would have done her own checks rather than relying on the independent company.",
      "\"If I was making this film, I wouldn't just ask who the boy was, who his father was, who his mother was, I would ask for the entire family tree. They could easily have found out about him, it shows that due diligence was not done.",
      "\"I didn't wait for people to inform me of things,\" she added. \"I asked them the right questions.\"",
      "Byrne says in her view the film isn't \"pro-Hamas\".",
      "Watching it, I was struck by the efforts at balance. It contains voices who curse the leaders of Gaza.",
      "BBC impartiality",
      "One of the children followed by the documentary, 11-year old Zakaria, says he doesn't like Hamas \"because they started the war, they caused all this misery, this is wrong\". A woman says \"they are causing us harm\". There's a conversation about why taking Israeli civilians hostage is wrong.",
      "But we also see the horrors and violence of what's taken place in Gaza -  through the eyes of children. Zakaria, who hangs around the hospital to help the paramedics rather than remaining with his family because, he says, there's no food and water where they are, tells the camera he thinks he's seen 5,000 dead bodies.",
      "Renat who's 10 and is building up a social media presence with an online cookery show, describes drones that shoot bullets. She smiles and laughs wildly on camera, as she describes, still clearly traumatised, how a bomb just exploded right next to her as she was walking outside her apartment.",
      "As the press release put it, the documentary is an \"unflinching and vivid view of life in a warzone\". It's the kind of programme Turness said, as the BBC apologised, that her department \"should be doing\".",
      "But she added \"Of course we have to get it right.\"",
      "The BBC brand is based on impartiality - on being trusted around the world. All of us in news and current affairs take fact-checking very seriously. Mistakes are sometimes made, of course. But on this occasion both the independent production company and the BBC made serious errors which threaten trust in the corporation.",
      "Since joining the BBC as head of news in 2022, Turness has prioritised transparency to grow trust. Not informing viewers about the child narrator's family story is the opposite of transparent.",
      "She will have trusted the experienced BBC commissioners who oversaw the programme to do the appropriate due diligence. They will have trusted the filmmakers and the executive working with them.",
      "This isn't the end of the story and questions still remain. What exactly did the BBC ask about the boy and his family's potential connections to Hamas? Hoyo Films has said it's \"co-operating fully with the BBC and Peter Johnston to help understand where mistakes have been made\".",
      "There's also the question about exactly how much was the \"limited sum\" paid for the young narrator's work - and whether that money ended up in the hands of Hamas. Yesterday in Parliament, Lisa Nandy said she had sought assurances from the BBC that it hadn't.",
      "The scandal comes in a week in which the BBC already was apologising over its failure to tackle behaviour by the DJ Tim Westwood - after a separate review that cost more than \u00a33m.",
      "Formal complaint",
      "What's happened has damaged trust in the BBC in so many ways. Those who argue the corporation is biased against Israel will feel vindicated.",
      "Leo Pearlman, co-CEO of the major British production company Fulwell 73, told us on Radio 4 that the BBC has \"gaslit the Jewish community\" in the 16 months since October 7th and that this documentary parroted 'the propaganda of Hamas\".",
      "For others who view the BBC as having anti-Palestinian bias, the decision to pull the documentary and apologise will confirm their beliefs. Artists For Palestine, which includes Gary Lineker, Anita Rani, Riz Ahmed and Miriam Margolyes, says the claims about the identity of the child's father are \"misleading\" and that to conflate his \"civil service role\" with terrorism is \"factually incorrect\".",
      "The International Centre of Justice for Palestinians has lodged a formal complaint against the BBC for taking down the documentary and \"suppressing the testimony of Palestinians\". It says the deputy minister for agriculture's role involves \"food production relating to crops, fishing and livestock\".",
      "What's unfolded since the programme's broadcast is unlikely to change minds on any side.",
      "The losers in all this are the young citizens of Gaza. The stories of the children in this film - and the suffering they have endured - aren't now being seen.",
      "Hoyo Films said it believes \"this remains an important story to tell, and that our contributors \u2013 who have no say in the war \u2013 should have their voices heard\".",
      "The BBC has made clear it has no plans to broadcast the programme again in its current form or return it to iPlayer.",

      "The High Court judgment by Mrs Justice Collins Rice concluded that Ofcom's rulings were unlawful. It is the first time the watchdog has lost such a case.",
      "The judgement said Ofcom's initial rulings -  that the 9 May and 13 June 2023 broadcasts were in breach of its codes on \"due impartiality and due accuracy in news\" - were unlawful.",
      "GB News CEO Angelos Frangopoulos said the decision \"vindicates GB News' position as the fearless defender of free speech in the United Kingdom\", while Ofcom said it \"accepted the court's guidance\".",
      "'Fundamental failure'",
      "Mr Frangopoulos added: \"I call on the government and Parliament to consider the seriousness of this fundamental failure by Ofcom.\"",
      "The judge's ruling stated: \"I am minded to quash the two decisions in this case, and remit them to be reconsidered by Ofcom, subject to whatever further procedure may be fairly indicated.\"",
      "The court found that Ofcom had misapplied Rule 5.3 of the code, saying the provision only applies to \"news programmes\" and not to current affairs shows, such as the one Sir Jacob hosts.",

      "Ofcom's rulings had said the State of the Nation shows hosted by Sir Jacob broke rules stating politicians should not usually front news coverage.",

      "The regulator concluded at the time: \"News was, therefore, not presented with due impartiality.\"",
      "But GB News responded to the rulings, saying: \"These decisions go against established precedent and raises serious questions about Ofcom's oversight over its own regulations.\"",
      "Ofcom said on Friday:  \"We accept the court's guidance on this important aspect of due impartiality in broadcast news and the clarity set out in its judgment.",
      "\"We will now review and consult on proposed changes to the broadcasting code to restrict politicians from presenting news in any type of programme to ensure this is clear for all broadcasters.\"",

    "story": [
      "The long-awaited first trailer for the new Shrek 5 film has been criticised by some film fans over the way characters have been animated, giving them different facial features.",
      "In the 27-second clip, recurring characters Shrek, Donkey, Pinocchio and Princess Fiona appear alongside Felicia - one of Shrek and Fiona's now grown-up children.",
      "The short teaser announces that Zendaya is joining the cast as Felicia, whilst also reintroducing Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz and Eddie Murphy who are all reprising their roles.",
      "Oli Hyatt, who runs Blue Zoo Animation, told the BBC there's often \"an instant reaction\" when changes are made to a film like Shrek, due to its \"nostalgic properties\".",
      "Some users on social media have described the changes as \"disrespectful to the original art style\" and \"an AI interpretation of what Shrek 5 could look like\".",
      "Others have compared it to the film animation of video game character Sonic the Hedgehog, which Paramount Pictures changed after fan backlash in 2019.",
      "Hyatt added: \"The generation of children that watched Shrek back [when it was first released in 2001] are now adults.",
      "\"There's usually a feeling of 'this isn't what I knew' or 'I want the old show I remember back'\", he says.",
      "Hyatt, whose team contributed to The Adventures of Paddington and Lego City - No Limits, said that \"because the trailer is so short it's hard to tell how its going to look in general\".",
      "But, he added: \"You can see from a technical perspective, the advancement in technology.",
      "\"That means that on a similar or lower budget, you can producer a higher sheen and render quality, so it doesn't look quite as CGI (computer-generated imagery) and feels more tangible and real\".",
      "He doesn't feel like much has changed from the original \"art style\" of Shrek, but says \"the colours, vibrancy and realism\" have changed, which is a symptom of animation technology improving.",
      "In the short trailer, Shrek (Mike Myers), Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Felicia (Zendaya) gather round a magic mirror to ask \"Who's the fairest of them all?\".",
      "The face in the mirror, which also appears to have had a bit of a makeover, responds that it is Shrek, with images then flashed up on screen of Shrek wearing glasses and posing, then dancing in a skintight catsuit before appearing with rippling abdominal muscles.",
      "This pays tribute to some of the internet's favourite Shrek memes, whilst giving viewers a first look at the now grown-up Felicia, who first came to life in Shrek The Third in 2007, alongside her triplet siblings Fergus and Farkle.",
      "Shrek's return was teased at the end of the Puss In Boots sequel in 2022, so fans have been expecting this new film for quite some time.",
      "Its perhaps why the much-loved film has sparked so much pushback, with fans joking that Shrek looks like he's has had \"botox and a face lift\" whilst others have criticised the characters for having rounder faces.",
      "But not everyone has a problem with the new looks - some have praised the animators for ageing the characters with greying hair and wrinkles, whilst others say the updated animations are just a symptom of CGI improving.",
      "'Forgotten in two minutes'",
      "Hyatt said that despite the criticism that's been levelled at the trailer, he believes it will be \"forgotten within two minutes of watching the movie\".",
      "\"Shrek has never been about looking cute or beautiful, it's about being gross with all the jokes and silliness,\" he says.",
      "\"If they [the producers] have got the script right and the characters right, then people will still love it, it's still a great franchise.\"",

      "The BBC has apologised and admitted \"serious flaws\" in the making of a documentary about children's lives in Gaza.",
      "The documentary, Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone, was pulled from iPlayer last week after it emerged its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a Hamas official.",
      "It said it has \"no plans to broadcast the programme again in its current form or return it to iPlayer\".",
      "Hoyo Films, the production company that made the documentary for the BBC, said it felt it was \"important to hear from voices that haven't been represented onscreen throughout the war with dignity and respect\".",
      "The company added it was \"cooperating fully\" with the BBC to \"help understand where mistakes have been made\".",
      "The BBC removed the documentary after concerns were raised that it centred on a boy called Abdullah who is the son of Hamas's deputy minister of agriculture. Hamas is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the UK and others.",
      "It also launched a review into the film, and the BBC's Board met earlier on Thursday to discuss it.",
      "In the statement, a BBC spokesperson said both the production company and the BBC had made \"unacceptable\" flaws and that it \"takes full responsibility for these and the impact that these have had on the corporation's reputation\".",
      "It added the BBC had not been informed of the teenager's family connection in advance by the film's production company.",
      "The spokesperson says: \"During the production process, the independent production company was asked in writing a number of times by the BBC about any potential connections he and his family might have with Hamas.",

      "\"It was then the BBC's own failing that we did not uncover that fact and the documentary was aired.\"",

      "It said Hoyo assured the BBC that no payments were made to any members of Hamas or its affiliates \"either directly, in kind or as a gift\", and that it is seeking \"additional assurance\" around the programme's budget.",
      "In its statement, Hoyo added: \"We feel this remains an important story to tell, and that our contributors \u2013 who have no say in the war \u2013 should have their voices heard\".",
      "'No stone unturned'",
      "A full audit of the expenditure on the film will be undertaken by the BBC, and it will be asking for the relevant financial accounts of Hoyo Films so this can be carried out.",
      "The BBC spokesperson said the incident had \"damaged\" the trust in the Corporation's journalism - and \"the processes and execution of this programme fell short of our expectations\".",
      "They added the director-general of the BBC had asked for complaints to be expedited to the Executive Complaints Unit, \"which is separate from BBC News\".",
      "A separate statement from the BBC Board added: \"The subject matter of the documentary was clearly a legitimate area to explore, but nothing is more important than trust and transparency in our journalism. While the board appreciates that mistakes can be made, the mistakes here are significant and damaging to the BBC.\"",

      "Mr Jones admitted he did not often book half-days off work to go to museums and exhibitions but it was because he \"was interested to go and see it\".",
      "Members of the public booked slots to use the toilet in its cubicle as part of the exhibition.",

      "\"I'm scared\u2026but all I want to do is to talk about the truth,\" she says, in the opening scene of her Oscar-nominated documentary Black Box Diaries.",
      "Shiori became the face of Japan's MeToo movement after she accused a prominent journalist, Noriyuki Yamaguchi, of rape. He denies the charges.",
      "Her acclaimed directorial debut, based on her memoir of the same name, is a retelling of her quest for justice, after authorities found insufficient evidence to pursue criminal charges.",
      "But there is one country where the documentary has still not been aired: Japan - where it has run into huge controversy.",
      "Shiori's former lawyers have accused her of including audio and video footage that she did not have permission to use, which, they maintain, has violated trust and put her sources at risk.",
      "She defends what she did as necessary for \"public good\".",
      "It's a startling turn in a story that gripped Japan when it first broke. Then 28 years old, Shiori had chosen to ignore her family's request to remain silent about the alleged rape. And after her public accusation did not result in a criminal case, she filed a civil lawsuit against Mr Yamaguchi - and won $30,000 (\u00a322,917) in damages.",

      "CCTV footage of an intoxicated Shiori being dragged from a taxi and into a hotel forms part of the more than 400 hours of footage which she has edited for the documentary.",
      "Shiori, who directed and wrote Black Box Diaries, describes the editing process as \"really challenging\".",
      "\"It was like hardcore exposure therapy,\" she says.",
      "But when the film was released, the CCTV footage included in the documentary became a source of friction between the director and the team of lawyers who had helped her win her civil case.",
      "The lawyers stated her use of CCTV footage was unauthorised - and that Shiori had violated a pledge not to use it outside of court proceedings. .",
      "Last week, her former lawyers - led by Yoko Nishihiro - held a press conference, in which she said Shiori's use of the footage posed challenges for other sexual assault cases.",
      "\"If the fact that the evidence from the trial has been made public is known, we will be unable to obtain cooperation in future cases,\" Ms Nishihiro said.",
      "Ms Nishihiro claimed Shiori also used unauthorised recordings in the film, which the lawyer only discovered following the screening of the film last July.",
      "The documentary included audio of a police detective who eventually acted as a whistleblower in relation to the investigation process, as well as video of a taxi driver who had provided testimony about the night of the alleged rape.",
      "Both the detective and the taxi driver, the lawyers have argued, were identifiable in the film - and neither had given their consent to be featured.",
      "\"I've been trying so hard to protect her for eight-and-half years, and I feel like I've been completely torn apart,\"  Ms Nishihiro said.",
      "\"I want her to explain and be held accountable.\"",
      "Shiori has previously acknowledged that she did not have the hotel's permission to use the CCTV footage, but has argued that it provided \"the only visual evidence\" of the night she claims she was sexually assaulted.",
      "She said including audio of the police detective was necessary because of \"the cover-up of the investigation\", and has insisted she was releasing the video \"for the public good\".",
      "\"We are standing in different points of view,\" she said, referring to her fall-out with her former lawyers.",
      "\"For me, [it's for the] public good. For them, it's 'do not break any rules'.\"",
      "There has been no official explanation as to why the film has not yet been distributed. According to Shiori, \"Japan is still not ready to talk about [it]\".",
      "However, it remains unclear how far the lack of distribution might also be due to legal hurdles.",
      "In her most recent statement last week, Shiori apologised and said she would re-edit parts of the documentary to make sure individuals could not be identified. She said a redacted version would be screened at a later stage.",
      "\"There are moments I wish I didn't have to put in [the documentary]. There are moments I'm not proud of - but I wanted to put all of it, and to show we are also human,\" she told the BBC.",

      "Shiori's case was followed by other high-profile cases. In 2023, former soldier Rina Gonoi also went public with her story, accusing three ex-soldiers of sexually assaulting her. This was the year Japan passed landmark laws to redefine rape from \"forcible sexual intercourse\" to \"non-consensual sexual intercourse\" and raised the age of consent from 13 to 16.",

      "\"The concept is inspired by intrusive thoughts,\" she says.",

      "It was one of seven films Sarah made for the pop star to accompany tracks from her second album, This Wasn't Meant for You Anyway.",
      "Sarah's also worked with Arlo Parks and says she never imagined she could do this kind of job, let alone reach this level of success.",
      "Part of that, she says, is due to her Gujarati heritage.",
      "\"Sometimes people don't necessarily know where to place you,\" she tells BBC Newsbeat.",

      "On the other side of west Belfast's peace wall, Young Spencer is rapping about subjects similar to Kneecap.",
      "Like them, he references drugs, paramilitaries and identity.",
      "But - it's told from a totally different perspective to the famous (and infamous) Irish language hip-hop trio.",
      "While Kneecap wrap themselves in the Irish tricolour, in one of his songs Young Spencer continually talks about the red, white and blue of the Union flag.",
      "Yet recently they shared a stage in the city and thousands of Kneecap's fans sang along with a man who describes himself as proud to be British.",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme, the rapper said his appearance in front of the sold-out SSE Arena crowd was about bringing communities together based on more than just their religion.",
      "\"At the end of the day, to me that was more so about the unification of the city,\" he said.",
      "\"Yes, you're from the Falls and I'm from the Shankill, but it's more so about this city that we come from.\"",
      "He said when the west Belfast rap trio first reached out about performing at their show in December there were nerves.",
      "\"There's just as much reason to say no as to say yes, and people would go 'why is that? It's the biggest opportunity of your life',\" he added.",
      "\"You are still driven with fear as much as you are driven with love, and you're still worried that people aren't receptive to where you're from and when you're talking about greatness and moving the city forward and the country forward as a whole.",
      "\"Maybe some people won't understand Kneecap and Young Spencer on the same stage until 20, 30 years' time, but that's ok because what's supposed to be understood will be understood.\"",
      "From the Shankill to the SSE",
      "Young Spencer is the alter-ego of Gareth Spence, who during the day works in a school in Belfast.",
      "He was raised on the Shankill Road, which he admits saw guns, drugs, paramilitaries and division during many troubled years in Northern Ireland.",
      "But living there has been in his own words \"a gift\" as well as a curse.",
      "Now 30 years old, he got into rapping as a teenager after getting therapy, and said personal traumas have influenced his music.",

      "\"Real change happens and I feel like that's what the show represented more than anything.\"",
      "Gareth said we can't be shy of acknowledging that there is always likely to be division.",
      "Yet he believes more is shared across Belfast's working-class areas.",
      "\"A lot of people have this sort of warped opinion of the communities that we're from too, whether it be the Shankill or the Falls, anywhere in Belfast because they go back to this troublesome period from 30 years ago and they still stay stuck in that.",
      "\"But you'll find unification in so many ways and so many different forms now in the city than you ever have.\"",
      "United more than divided",
      "The rapper said we're \"a lot closer to peace now than we've ever been\".",
      "\"There will always be division of some extent, we will never get away from that completely because that's life and not everybody likes each other and that's just plain and simple,\" he told Good Morning Ulster.",
      "\"But everybody has the right to be identified as who they identify as.",
      "\"My thing is that being a proud Protestant, being from Belfast, being from the Shankill, doesn't take away from them being proud Catholics and being from west Belfast and being from the Falls Road, why can't we unite?\"",
      "Across Young Spencer's social media platforms is the acronym P.R.O.D - but it is used more so as a set of principles to live by rather than a label.",
      "\"Passion, persistence, respect, resilience, opportunity to overcome, dedication, determination,\" he explained.",

      "So what's next for the Shankill's son?",
      "\"Inspire to inspire, motivate to motivate. Persisting with my passion when they chose to hate,\" he said.",

      "Here are all the major talking points and things to look out for at the ceremony, as an eventful awards season draws to an end.",
      "Which films are in the running?",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez, about a Mexican drug lord who changes gender, has 13 nominations in total \u2013 including best picture, best actress (Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n) and best supporting actress (Zoe Salda\u00f1a).",
      "It is the most-nominated non-English language film of all time. It's actually a French production, largely set in Mexico, with Spanish as the main language spoken.",
      "Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n's nomination made her the first trans person to be nominated in an acting category (although Elliot Page was nominated for Juno in 2008, before the actor transitioned).",
      "However, the film \u2013 which had already caused controversy in Mexico \u2013 has been beset by controversy following a social media row involving Gasc\u00f3n.",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez remains strong in a couple of categories, but it's unlikely to sweep the board in the way Oppenheimer \u2013 which also had 13 nominations \u2013 did last year.",
      "Chasing down Emilia P\u00e9rez with 10 nods is three-and-a-half epic The Brutalist, starring Adrien Brody.",
      "Wicked also has 10 nominations, including for British actress Cynthia Erivo and her co-star Ariana Grande, while Demi Moore has the first Oscar nomination of her career for her role in The Substance.",
      "Meanwhile, pope selection drama Conclave has eight nominations, including best actor for its British star Ralph Fiennes.",
      "All the films above are up for the coveted best picture prize, and are joined by Anora, about a New York stripper who falls for the son of a wealthy Russian.",
      "The film, which has six nominations, leapt ahead in the race after a string of precursor wins at the Critics Choice Awards as well as two major guild ceremonies - the Directors Guild of America and Producers Guild of America Awards.",
      "But there remains no consensus on what will ultimately win the top prize \u2013 with the other contenders for best picture including A Complete Unknown, Dune: Part Two, I'm Still Here and Nickel Boys.",
      "What else is there to look out for?",
      "This has been an unpredictable awards season, and there could still be plenty of surprises in store.",
      "In the best actress category, Moore, 62, is nominated for playing a fading star who swaps her body for a younger and more beautiful version of herself in The Substance.",
      "But it's a tight race.",

      "Baftas 2025: The winners list in full",
      "It was a big blow to the assumed Oscar momentum for Moore, and an incredible moment for Madison, who was relatively unknown before her role in Anora.",
      "This is exactly the type of rags-to-riches story that awards ceremonies love \u2013 and the film itself celebrates.",
      "Best actor may also be up in the air. Adrien Brody is the frontrunner, with his nod for The Brutalist \u2013 but Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is his toughest competition, thanks to his acclaimed portrayal of Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown.",
      "Last week, Chalamet's surprise SAG win shook up the race, after his somewhat eccentric awards campaign.",
      "If he won, not only would Chalamet halt Brody's winning streak, he would also take Brody's record as the youngest-ever winner of best actor.",
      "In the best supporting actor category, Kieran Culkin is the frontrunner for A Real Pain, while Zoe Salda\u00f1a is almost certain to win best supporting actress for Emilia P\u00e9rez, having taken the trophy at a string of precursor events including the Baftas, SAG Awards and Golden Globes.",
      "10 years since #OscarsSoWhite",
      "It's worth noting it's been a decade since the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite started trending, due to the lack of diversity at the 2015 Academy Awards.",

      "However, it's been confirmed she will attend the Oscars ceremony itself \u2013 although it remains to be seen if she will walk the red carpet and sit with her co-stars.",
      "Presenters include Halle Berry, Whoopi Goldberg, Robert Downey Jr, Cillian Murphy, Da'Vine Joy Randolph and Emma Stone.",
      "What impact have the wildfires had?",
      "This year's Oscars race has played out against the grim backdrop of devastating wildfires in Los Angeles.",
      "The nominations themselves were postponed twice due to the fires.",
      "There's no doubt it's going to be hard for the awards to strike the right tone when so many people are suffering. It doesn't sit well with celebrities flaunting their wealth on the red carpet.",
      "Cancelling the whole event, however, was \"never on the table,\" according to Lynette Howell Taylor, an LA-based British film producer and member of the Academy's board of governors, who lost her own house in the fires.",
      "She told me there would \"definitely be recognition of what the city has gone through\" during the ceremony, with clear signposting of support mechanisms and ways to donate.",
      "\"But ultimately the show will be about the celebration of the movies of the year, like it is every year,\" she said.",
      "Who is performing?",
      "This year, the Academy has done away with having the original song nominees perform during the ceremony.",
      "Instead, Wicked stars Erivo and Grande will perform a medley of songs from the film during the Oscars ceremony, which will last a reported 10 minutes long.",
      "I can already see social media going into a meltdown over Defying Gravity, but it remains to be seen if the duo can recreate the energy of Ryan Gosling's viral performance of I'm Just Ken last year.",
      "Doja Cat, Lisa from Blackpink, Queen Latifah and Raye will be among the other performers during the ceremony.",
      "Who is this year's host?",

      "UK viewers can watch on ITV and ITVX from 22:30 GMT.",
      "British buzz",
      "Cynthia Erivo is the first black British woman to receive two Oscar nominations for acting, after also being nominated for Harriet in 2020.",
      "If she wins best actress this time, for playing Elphaba in Wicked, she'll become an EGOT - having completed the set of Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony awards.",
      "Ralph Fiennes is flying the flag in the best actor category with his first nomination for 28 years. He's recognised for playing a cardinal who oversees the selection of a new Pope in Conclave.",

      "But he \"very clearly did not want to buy a lap dance,\" she says.",
      "Miranda, who was 23 at the time, started asking why he and his wife were there.",
      "\"I'm very nosy,\" she says. \"So I kept asking them questions and I finally got it out of them. They were making a film about strippers.\"",
      "She told them she had studied acting, and - after a successful audition - got a call on her 24th birthday, to offer her a part in the film.",

      "It's directed by Baker, and stars Mikey Madison, who is up for best actress for her role as a New York stripper.",
      "Madison, 25, relied on real-life strippers to help her perfect the part.",
      "When she won a Bafta film award last month, she dedicated it to the sex worker community.",
      "\"I have been able to meet some of that community through my research of the film, and that's been one of the most incredible parts of making the film,\" she told us backstage.",
      "They \"deserve respect and don't often get it. And so I had to say something,\" she added.",
      "We've been speaking to the actresses, strippers and dancers in the film about their experiences of working on it - and their thoughts on the finished product.",
      "Some praised the film as realistic, particularly in its portrayal of the rejection and exhaustion that sex workers often feel. But others said the film was \"limited\".",
      "'I debated not showing up'",
      "Edie Turquet was initially unsure whether to take part in the film.",
      "Turquet, who is British and appeared in Harry Potter spin-off Fantastic Beasts as a child, now lives in New York where she's a student and a stripper.",
      "She got cast as a background dancer in Anora after a casting agent spotted her in the club where she was working. But Turquet says the night before filming, she debated not showing up.",
      "\"I didn't want to be part of a bad stripper film, or anything doing a disservice to our industry, so I was apprehensive,\" she told me.",
      "\"Most films about strippers are super over-aestheticised, or bad and exploitative.\"",
      "Turquet points to 2020 film Zola, about a waitress who goes to Florida for a weekend of stripping for quick cash. \"I found it hyperbolic, totally overglamourising the work, and it felt like it was talking down to women,\" she said.",
      "\"And don't get me started on Pretty Woman, which is infuriating, especially the idea of a street worker played by Julia Roberts. Come on.\"",
      "But when Turquet realised Anora was a Sean Baker film, she changed her mind.",
      "\"His films are based on realism, he has a fly-on-the-wall style of filmmaking, which I love,\" she said. \"So I was down.\"",
      "Baker's filmmaking skills were also what attracted Lindsey Normington to the film. The actress and stripper stars as Diamond, Anora's workplace enemy.",
      "She says she saw him at afterparty for a film premiere, and went up to him to tell him she was a fan.",
      "They connected on Instagram, and months later, he contacted her to tell her he might have a role for her in a new film. \"I fell to my knees in my house,\" Normington said.",
      "'I taught Mikey stripper slang'",
      "In the film, Anora is offered a chance at a fairytale escape when she meets and falls for the son of a wealthy Russian.",
      "Miranda, an actress and stripper who plays Lulu, Anora's best friend, says she was tasked with helping Madison sound like a real sex worker from New York.",
      "\"I shared a PDF of language and slang terms that only strippers from New York will understand,\" she said.",
      "One of those words was \"whale\", which, Miranda explains, \"is a customer who is like a bottomless pit of money. He will make your night. And he won't make you work very hard for it at all.\"",
      "Rejection, heartbreak, and Tupperware boxes",
      "This section contains spoilers for Anora",
      "Miranda said a lot of the film's themes, on heartbreak and rejection, were relatable for her.",
      "\"Sometimes I feel like this shiny toy, that people want to play with. They go, 'wow like you're a stripper. You're so cool.' And then they just cast you aside and abandon you,\" she said.",
      "\"I think about the ending a lot because I feel like Anora a lot.\"",
      "Turquet agrees, calling the ending \"very relatable and poignant\", adding that it accurately depicts the \"exhaustion and fatigue\" strippers often feel.",
      "\"The sex industry has trauma built into it. It felt so real. It's an incredible vulnerable industry,\" she said.",
      "\"You're putting yourself in danger every time you go to work. It's a complex and exhausting job.\"",
      "But overall, she said has mixed feelings about the film.",
      "\"What a lot of stripper films miss - and what Anora starts but doesn't go far enough on - is the moral question around men who buy sex,\" she said.",
      "\"It's the question of consent. Most of these films shy away from answering it, or looking into it.\"",
      "She said it also frustrates her that these characters \"never exist outside their profession\".",
      "\"[Anora] is a pretty limited character,\" she said. \"We never learn anything about her. The film takes the perspective of [male leads] Igor and Vanya, in defining who she is.\"",
      "\"It's better than any film I've seen about it, but ultimately it's limited as it's not told by a sex worker,\" she added. \"I can't wait till we're telling our own stories and hopefully this opens the door to that.\"",
      "For Normington, the film reflected \"the insecurity and competition and jealousy\" that she has personally experienced in clubs.",
      "\"I appreciate that it's not attempting to be a quintessential stripper movie.\"",
      "For Kennady Schneider, a Los Angeles-based stripper and choreographer who trained Madison to dance, it was the film's portrayal of the mundane nature of the job that struck a chord.",
      "In the film's early scenes, we see Anora at work, talking to clients in the club.",
      "We also see her and the other strippers on a lunch break, eating from Tupperware boxes in a back room.",
      "\"It felt really accurate,\" Schneider said.",
      "\"A lot of the time in [stripper] films, you have glamorisation, with money falling from the ceiling. Those moments do happen but they're few and far between,\" she said. \"It's much more of a quiet hustle.\"",
      "Oscar hopes",
      "When Anora came out, special screenings were held for sex workers in New York and LA.",
      "Footage circulated on social media shows the strippers banging their high-heeled platform pleaser shoes together over their heads, to show their appreciation at the end of the screenings.",
      "\"That is the most beautiful applause I've ever received, I don't know if that will ever happen again,\" Madison told us.",
      "Now, all eyes are on the Oscars.",
      "Miranda and Normington will both be attending. \"It's kind of silly to think that I'm going to the Oscars, but [at the same time] I'm at the club arguing with a stupid man over $20,\" said Miranda.",
      "\"I feel like I'm living two lives.\"",
      "She said that Madison is \"spot on\" to say the sex worker community doesn't get the respect it deserves, and said she hopes that Anora's success will change that.",
      "\"My hope is that if this film wins an Oscar, it marks the beginning of a shift in Hollywood, where sex workers are respected, as workers in their own fields, but also as entertainers,\" she said.",
      "\"If this film wins an Oscar, I want to see that.\"",

    "summary": "When was the last time two musicals were up for best picture? And could Adrien Brody break a record?",
    "story": [
      "Hollywood has had another eventful year: Deadpool faced off with Wolverine, Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni sued each other, Inside Out 2 conquered the box office and Joker's sequel emphatically did not.",
      "The Oscars race, meanwhile, played out against the grim backdrop of wildfires which devastated Los Angeles and left thousands of homes destroyed.",
      "Awards season had its fair share of scandal. While The Brutalist's use of AI and Anora's lack of an intimacy co-ordinator were storms in a Twitter teacup, there was one genuine controversy when some historic tweets nearly brought down Emilia P\u00e9rez.",
      "Ahead of the Academy Awards on Sunday (2 March), here are 17 of the quirks, trends, patterns, and record breakers from this year's batch of nominees.",
      "- - - - -",
      "1. This is the first time two musicals have been nominated for best picture in more than five decades.",
      "Wicked and Emilia P\u00e9rez are the first tuneful twosome to be up for the top prize since Funny Girl and Oliver! in 1969.",
      "The musical resurgence is partly down to it being twice as easy to score a best picture nomination nowadays, after the top category was expanded to 10 slots.",
      "The last musical to win best picture was Chicago in 2003.",
      "2. Adrien Brody already holds one Oscars record, and he could break another.",
      "The US star is currently the youngest ever winner of best actor - he was 29 when he won for his performance in 2002's The Pianist.",
      "But Brody wasn't nominated again until this year, with his nod for The Brutalist. If he wins again, he will become the first person to win the leading actor category with his first two nominations.",
      "Only seven other actors currently have a 100% win rate at the Oscars from two or more nominations - Vivien Leigh, Hilary Swank, Kevin Spacey, Luise Rainer, Christoph Waltz, Helen Hayes and Mahershala Ali.",
      "3. But Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is a major threat.",
      "The Dune and Wonka star is Brody's toughest competition in best actor, thanks to his acclaimed portrayal of Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown.",
      "If he won, not only would Chalamet halt Brody's winning streak, he would also take Brody's record as the youngest-ever winner. There isn't much in it - Chalamet would be just 10 months younger than Brody was when he won.",
      "4. Netflix's Emilia P\u00e9rez could follow a dubious pattern for streaming films.",
      "It might have the most nominations, but the Spanish-language musical could share the same fate as other recent streaming films which were heavily nominated, but failed to follow through with many wins.",
      "The Irishman (Netflix) won zero Oscars, from 10 nominationsMank (Netflix) won two out of 10The Power of the Dog (Netflix) won one out of 12Killers of the Flower Moon (Apple) won zero out of 10",
      "The Irishman (Netflix) won zero Oscars, from 10 nominations",
      "Mank (Netflix) won two out of 10",
      "The Power of the Dog (Netflix) won one out of 12",
      "Killers of the Flower Moon (Apple) won zero out of 10",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez is strong in a couple of categories, but it's similarly unlikely to sweep the board.",
      "Only one streaming film has ever won best picture - Apple's Coda - which only had three nominations overall.",
      "5. Two Succession stars share a disadvantage.",
      "Kieran Culkin and Jeremy Strong are both nominated for best supporting actor, for their performances in A Real Pain and The Apprentice respectively.",
      "But the pair are the only two nominees in the category who don't come from best picture-nominated films.",
      "A Real Pain's absence in best picture shouldn't stop frontrunner Culkin from winning. The last person to win the category without a best picture nomination was Christopher Plummer in 2012, for Beginners.",
      "Every actor in the category this year is Oscar-nominated for the first time, except Edward Norton, who has three previous nods.",
      "6. The Substance is the first body horror to be nominated for best picture, and only the seventh horror overall.",
      "The other six were The Exorcist, Get Out, The Silence of the Lambs, Jaws, The Sixth Sense and Black Swan.",
      "The Substance is a strong contender in best make-up and hairstyling, a category where the winner often overlaps with the acting winners. That could work in Demi Moore's favour in a tight best actress race.",
      "7. Isabella Rossellini is nominated for an eight-minute performance in Conclave, but that isn't the shortest in Oscars history.",
      "Beatrice Straight won the same category, best supporting actress, for her role in Network, which lasted 5min 02sec.",
      "Dame Judi Dench is only marginally ahead, winning for a performance in Shakespeare in Love which lasted 5min 52sec.",
      "Winners aside, the shortest nominee is thought to be Hermione Baddeley's performance in 1959's Room at the Top, lasting 2min 19sec.",
      "On the subject of durations, The Brutalist (3hrs 35mins including an intermission) would be the fourth-longest best picture winner of all time, after Gone With the Wind, Lawrence of Arabia and Ben-Hur.",
      "8. Sing Sing star Colman Domingo is nominated for best actor, just a year after his last nomination in the same category for Rustin.",
      "Quite an achievement, no doubt. But he has some way to go to catch up with Bette Davis and Greer Garson, who both managed five consecutive Oscar nominations in the 1930s and 40s.",
      "Just behind them are Al Pacino, Elizabeth Taylor, Marlon Brando, Thelma Ritter and Jennifer Jones, who each scored four back-to-back nods.",
      "Bradley Cooper, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, Russell Crowe, Glenn Close, Jane Fonda, Meryl Streep, Jack Nicholson, William Hurt, Richard Burton, Deborah Kerr, Gregory Peck, Ingrid Bergman, Gary Cooper and Spencer Tracy all managed three in a row.",
      "9. All five best actress nominees come from films which are also nominated for best picture.",
      "That might not sound like much, but it's the first time it's happened since 1977.",
      "The historic lack of overlap between the two categories has often been attributed to the Academy being less likely to give female-focused films the top prize.",
      "But that trend has shifted in recent years, with films featuring female leads such as Nomadland, Coda and Everything Everywhere All At Once scoring best picture.",
      "10. Before Sebastian Stan's nomination for The Apprentice, only seven other actors had been Oscar-nominated for playing a US president.",
      "Frank Langella was recognised for his portrayal of Richard Nixon, while Daniel Day-Lewis and Raymond Massey were both nominated for playing Abraham Lincoln.",
      "Sam Rockwell was nominated for playing George W Bush, Alexander Knox for Woodrow Wilson, and James Whitmore for Harry Truman.",
      "Perhaps most notably, Sir Anthony Hopkins has been nominated twice for portraying two different presidents in separate films - once as Nixon and another as John Quincy Adams.",
      "Stan is slightly different in that he portrays Trump in his younger years as a real estate tycoon, rather than during his tenure as president, but we're still chalking that up as worthy of induction into this exclusive club.",
      "11. Robbie Williams' biopic Better Man is nominated for best visual effects, but he also has a connection to two other films in the race.",
      "The British singer's track Swing Supreme features in a pivotal scene of Emilia P\u00e9rez, while his former Take That bandmates feature at the beginning of Anora as a remix of Greatest Day plays in a nightclub.",
      "Its prominence in the film led to the remaining members of Take That performing the song at this year's Bafta Film Awards.",
      "12. Ralph Fiennes could be a good omen for Conclave.",
      "The last two times the British star was nominated for acting, for Schindler's List and The English Patient, his film won best picture.",
      "If Conclave wins, Fiennes would set a record for having appeared in the most best picture winners, becoming the only actor with roles in four (the other being The Hurt Locker).",
      "However, Edward Berger's absence in the best director category significantly weakens Conclave's chances. Only six films have ever won best picture without a corresponding director nomination.",
      "On the plus side, three of those have been in the last 12 years (Argo, Coda and Green Book), suggesting this is less of an obstacle than it used to be.",
      "Why wasn't Berger nominated? One possible factor is that, unlike the five directors who were, he didn't write or co-write his film's screenplay. Conclave was adapted from Robert Harris's novel by British screenwriter Peter Straughan.",
      "13. Diane Warren really wants to win.",
      "The songwriter scored her 16th best original song nomination this year, for writing The Journey, from The Six Triple Eight.",
      "But Warren has never won. With Emilia P\u00e9rez's campaign damaged and potentially splitting votes with two songs in the category, could this finally be her year?",
      "She certainly hopes so. Earlier this month, when a film account on X asked followers: \"Which Oscar winner would make you happiest?\" Warren brilliantly replied: \"Me!\"",
      "14. Wicked has a tall hill to climb to win best picture, having missed both a directing and screenplay nomination.",
      "It did score several technical nods as well as acting nominations for Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, but neither are frontrunners in their category.",
      "The last film to win best picture without a corresponding win in a director, screenplay or acting category was Rebecca in 1942.",
      "15. Two nominees are following in their mothers' footsteps.",
      "I'm Still Here star Fernanda Torres is nominated for best actress - after her mother Fernanda Montenegro became the first Brazilian nominee in the same category in 1999 for Central Station.",
      "Meanwhile, Conclave star Isabella Rossellini's mother, Ingrid Bergman, was nominated for best actress six times in her career, winning twice, and won best supporting actress.",
      "16. Anora's director could become the first person to win four Oscars for the same film.",
      "As Sean Baker was involved in so many aspects of the film's production, he could personally win best picture, editing, director and screenplay.",
      "Nobody has ever done this before.",
      "Walt Disney did win four Oscars in the same night in 1953, but for four different films.",
      "And Parasite's Bong Joon-Ho came incredibly close in 2020, but as the best international film prize technically goes to the country that submitted it rather than the director, he only took home three for his own trophy cabinet.",
      "If Anora does win the top prize, it will be the second consecutive year the director of best picture co-wins with his wife. Baker and wife Samantha Quan would follow Oppenheimer's Christopher Nolan and Emma Thomas.",
      "Anora would also be the first 18-rated film to win best picture since The Departed in 2007.",
      "17. It's official: The cat in Flow is named Flow.",
      "The delightful movie about a cat who survives a flood is a dark horse in the animated film category, having beaten box office juggernauts Inside Out 2 and The Wild Robot to the prize at the Golden Globes.",
      "\"While we worked on Flow the cat didn't have a name,\" the film's director Gints Zilbalodis said earlier this month. \"We just called it the cat.",
      "\"I've heard from multiple people that they think that its name is Flow. People have even named their cats Flow now! So I think we can call the cat Flow.\"",

    "story": [
      "Ariana Grande, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Demi Moore were among the Oscar nominees who gathered in Los Angeles on Tuesday for the annual \"class photo\".",
      "Ahead of the Academy Awards on Sunday (2 March), the nominees from all categories were invited to mingle over dinner and cocktails, as an eventful awards race reaches its conclusion.",
      "17 facts you need to know before the Oscars",
      "17 facts you need to know before the Oscars",
      "The class photo, a highlight of the film calendar, is usually taken much earlier in awards season, at the nominees luncheon, but that event was cancelled this year due to the LA wildfires.",
      "Here are 12 things we spotted in this year's class photo:",
      "1. Ariana and Cynthia held space at the front",
      "Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande have spent the last few months crying, holding space and stroking each other's fingers as they promoted the screen adaptation of Wicked.",
      "The two actresses have redefined the film press tour in recent weeks thanks to their absolute adoration for each other - an energy they will have to recreate later this year when they do it all again for the release of part two.",
      "Before the photo was taken, instead of saying cheese, Erivo shouted: \"Everyone say 'Oscar nominee!'\"",
      "Last week, it was confirmed the pair will perform a medley of songs from the film during the Oscars ceremony which will last a reported 10 minutes long.",
      "Wicked is the closest thing the Oscars have this year to a box office smash in the shape of last year's Barbie, and they'll be hoping the medley will recreate the energy of Ryan Gosling's viral performance of I'm Just Ken last year.",
      "2. We absolutely need this woman's jumper",
      "We're aware the weather is getting warmer and the sun is rising earlier as we hurtle towards Spring, but we are nevertheless always on the lookout for a colourful cosy jumper and we need to investigate the origin of this one as an urgent priority.",
      "The woman with the impeccable sweater selection in the class photo is Maya Gnyp - a producer of I Am Ready, Warden - which is nominated for best documentary short.",
      "The film follows Texas death row inmate John Henry Ramire in his final days.",
      "3. A-listers packed out the front row",
      "Joining Ariana and Cynthia on the front row were fellow acting nominees Zoe Salda\u00f1a, Mikey Madison and Monica Barbaro.",
      "Salda\u00f1a is almost certain to win best supporting actress for Emilia P\u00e9rez, having taken the trophy at a string of precursor events including the Baftas, SAG Awards and Golden Globes.",
      "As a result, her fellow category nominees such as Barbaro, who plays Joan Baez in Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown, have had to practise their best \"I'm just happy to be nominated\" faces this year.",
      "Madison, however, is a co-frontrunner in a tight race for leading actress. The Anora star is up against Demi Moore for The Substance in a category seen as a dead heat.",
      "4. James Mangold turned up just in time",
      "James Mangold, nominated this year for A Complete Unknown, is one of Hollywood's most respected and loved directors.",
      "So why is he sitting on an aisle seat in the second-back row, away from all his pals, looking sheepish?",
      "It's probably because he only just made the class photo by the skin of his teeth, arriving late to the event to an affectionate collective groan followed by cheers from his fellow nominees.",
      "Despite a distinguished Hollywood career, Mangold is a first-time nominee in the best director category, as are his fellow nominees Coralie Fargeat, Sean Baker, Brady Corbet and Jacques Audiard.",
      "5. We'd like to be the fifth member of this gang",
      "In a year where disappointingly few of the stars pulled funny faces or made eye-catching hand gestures while the photo was being taken, we applaud the team from Black Box Diaries for joining hands and celebrating.",
      "They are the film's director Shiori Ito (second left), editor Ema Ryan Yamazaki (far right) and producers Hanna Aqvilin and Eric Nyari.",
      "The movie, nominated in the documentary feature category, examines a sexual assault investigation in Japan.",
      "6. The biggest stars were in the back row",
      "Sitting in the back row, so far from the photographer that their faces are somewhat blurry and out of focus, are three of the biggest stars in this year's awards race.",
      "In the centre is The Substance star Demi Moore, nominated for playing an ageing aerobics instructor who takes a black-market drug to create a younger, more beautiful version of herself.",
      "She is joined on either side by supporting actor nominees Guy Pearce (left), who is recognised for his role in The Brutalist, and Edward Norton, who is nominated for playing Pete Seeger in A Complete Unknown.",
      "7. Bernie and Brandi appeared without Elton",
      "Also hanging out in the front row were songwriter Bernie Taupin and singer-songwriter Brandi Carlile.",
      "The pair are nominated in the best original song category for writing Never Too Late, the title track from Sir Elton John's recent documentary.",
      "Sir Elton himself wasn't there, however, despite co-writing the song with the pair.",
      "It's likely he will attend the Oscars on Sunday, but he won't be singing his song as the Academy has done away with having the original song nominees perform during the ceremony this year.",
      "Instead, Doja Cat, Lisa from Blackpink, Queen Latifah and Raye will be among the other performers during the ceremony alongside the Wicked medley.",
      "8. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet looked a little lonely",
      "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet joined his fellow nominees just days after springing a surprise win at the SAG Awards for A Complete Unknown.",
      "In his speech, the actor talked about his desire to be \"one of the greats\" of Hollywood.",
      "However, the actor has not been campaigning as aggressively as frontrunner Adrien Brody, and for the class photo, Chalamet took an aisle seat, leaned out and put his fist to his chest.",
      "Seated just in front of him are Anora's director Sean Baker and his producer wife Samantha Quan.",
      "9. The leading actors led from behind",
      "Adding further star power to the blurry back row were best actor contenders Adrien Brody, Colman Domingo and Sebastian Stan.",
      "Brody is the frontrunner to win, for his role in the Brutalist as a Hungarian architect who moves to the US after World War Two and is taken under the wing of a wealthy businessman.",
      "Sing Sing star Domingo plays a prison inmate who joins a performing arts programme, while Stan is nominated for portraying a young Donald Trump.",
      "10. Ralph represented for the Brits",
      "The Brits nominated in the acting categories this year are The Brutalist's Felicity Jones, Wicked's Cynthia Erivo, and Conclave's Ralph Fiennes.",
      "The actor was on Fiennes form, sitting in the back row alongside Sing Sing's John \"Divine G\" Whitfield.",
      "Fiennes is unlikely to win best actor, but if Conclave wins the top Oscar, he'll become the first actor ever to have appeared in four best picture winners.",
      "11. Some nominees were conspicuous by their absence",
      "Understandably, not every nominee was available to attend the dinner - best supporting actor frontrunner Kieran Culkin was among the stars missing from the class photo.",
      "But others were conspicuous by their absence, most notably Emilia P\u00e9rez star Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n.",
      "The actress is persona non grata in Hollywood at the moment, after some historic tweets she posted resurfaced in recent weeks, severely damaging the film's awards chances in many categories.",
      "However, it's been confirmed she will attend the Oscars ceremony itself on Sunday - although it remains to be seen if she will walk the red carpet and sit with her co-stars.",
      "12. Clarence Maclin knows what time it is",
      "Sing Sing star Clarence Maclin was widely considered the most notable absence in the best supporting actor category this year.",
      "But he is still nominated at the Oscars thanks to his story credit on the film, which means he is recognised in the best adapted screenplay category.",
      "Maclin was one of the real-life inmates at the Sing Sing jail, after being sentenced to 17 years in jail for robbery, aged 29, and was a member of the prison's Rehabilitation Through the Arts (RTA) programme.",
      "In the class photo, Maclin, who plays a version of himself in Sing Sing, is either checking his watch or possibly about to sneeze.",

    "summary": "The Monster Hunter series exploded in popularity globally after years of success in Japan. How did they do it?",
    "story": [
      "The latest release in one of Japan's most popular video game series has had one of the most successful debuts of all time.",
      "More than one million players have logged on to the PC version of Monster Hunter Wilds within hours of its launch, according to figures from online store Steam.",
      "There have been complaints from the first wave of players on Steam about the game's performance on computers, but its critical response has been positive.",
      "BBC Newsbeat spoke to director Yuya Tokuda and producer Ryozo Tsujimoto prior to the release of Wilds about turning the game into a global hit.",
      "Monster Hunter first launched on the PlayStation 2 in 2004.",
      "As the title suggests, players spend the game navigating an area known as The Forbidden Lands capturing and battling a cast of increasingly fearsome beasts.",
      "Long-time fans of the series are drawn in by its challenging, complex systems and option to play co-operatively, teaming up with friends to take down massive foes.",
      "Breakout 2018 hit Monster Hunter World has has sold 21.3 million copies, according to publisher Capcom, rising to 28.1 million when sales of an upgraded 2019 edition are included.",
      "Producer Mr Tsujimoto told BBC Newsbeat the game was a culmination of all the work and lessons learned from previous titles on the series.",
      "\"Anything that we hadn't been doing we really tried to do with Monster Hunter World to get everything ready so that the game was ready to break through,\" he said.",
      "Games industry layoffs and studio closures in the West and Europe have led to fears of \"brain drain\" - a loss of knowledge as people leave companies or even look for work in different fields.",
      "Japan, where employment protections for workers are much stronger, has not been as badly affected and developers often stay with the same company for a long time.",
      "Monster Hunter director Mr Tokuda says he's worked on the series for 20 years and it's fed into his work on Wilds.",
      "\"It's the groundwork that you create with your previous titles that you hope can inform the success of later ones,\" he says.",
      "\"We have the ability to take data from past titles like Monster Hunter World and analyse that data in order to understand what players were enjoying and what we could improve.\"",
      "Other Japanese studios are known for taking this iterative approach and building on what has come before.",
      "Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, the makers of the popular Yakuza series and its Like a Dragon spin-offs, have put out a new game more or less every year since 2020.",
      "The company's boss Masayoshi Yokoyama has spoken openly about how the team is happy to revisit previous locations and reuse elements from earlier games rather doing a \"fresh reboot\" each time.",
      "This can help to lower development costs and reduce the time it takes to make new titles.",
      "'We're working in our own lanes'",
      "The Japanese games industry was a dominant force from the 1980s until the early 2000s, but a power shift saw Western developers begin to lead the way.",
      "More recently, the country has been behind some of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful titles released.",
      "At last year's Game Awards - described by some as the industry's answer to The Oscars - Japanese-made games occupied four of the six Game of the Year nominations.",
      "Mr Tsujimoto says he can't pinpoint a specific reason for this, but says the Monster Hunter team has learned there are certain things needed to make a \"triple-A success in today's market\".",
      "That includes translating games into various languages so they can be released simultaneously in different countries, and being mindful of growing your audience.",
      "\"We're always careful to design the experience so new players can get into the game,\" he adds.",

      "Player habits are changing, with PC gaming increasing in popularity, and as technology becomes more advanced making games becomes more expensive.",
      "Mr Tsujimoto says generational leaps \"push the industry forward\", bringing \"new opportunities and new complexities\".",
      "\"I don't think it's necessarily the most difficult it's ever been but there are always new challenges whenever technology leaps forward.\"",
      "The games industry is also more competitive than ever - more video games are being released, and players are tending to stick with the same ones for longer periods.",
      "It leaves publishers of new releases fighting over a much smaller share of players' free time and 2025 has already been packed with big new releases.",
      "Mr Tsujimoto insists they haven't paid too much attention to that while working on Monster Hunter Wilds.",
      "\"It looks like a big year for everyone but we're really all just working in our own lanes,\" he says.",
      "\"We happened to have this launch window that's on the verge of some other big releases but we don't have access to that information before the general public.\"",
      "For an established series that suddenly explodes in popularity, Mr Tokuda says a big challenge is pleasing old and new fans.",
      "\"You always have in your mind that there's people waiting for your next creation and they're the players you want to satisfy,\" he says.",
      "\"But you also have your own creative idea and want to follow that through.\"",

      "\u201cYou couldn't have told me I'd be here a decade ago, so this is very exciting for me, to even be in the conversation.\u201d",

      "The lifeguard drama became the most-watched television show in the world at the time, and it's still the role she's best known for.",
      "But in the three decades since she first ran along the California beaches, fans and critics have become acquainted with different parts of Anderson's life story including Playboy covers, a leaked sex tape and many marriages.",
      "In 2022, Hulu series Pam & Tommy told the story of how Anderson and now ex-husband Tommy Lee's sex tape was stolen and illegally distributed in the mid-90s.",

      "\u201cI think that\u2019s what drew me to the project, that it was so relatable on so many levels,\u201d Anderson said of the film.",
      "She added that its central theme, of struggling to make your career work as a woman in later middle age, was something \"many generations of women\" had faced.",

      "\u201cSo this movie is, I think, in a very vulnerable space.",
      "\u201cAnd it was an interesting role to play with all her imperfections and selfishness and selflessness. And it was a lot of layers and nuances to the character that I could really relate to.\u201d",
      "The Last Showgirl has received a mixed reception from critics, though most have praised Anderson's performance.",
      "The New York Times called it \"sensitive and beguiling\" and described Anderson as \"dazzling\". But the Guardian awarded it just one star, calling it \"a big disappointment\" (although a later review bumped that up to three stars).",
      "Many have also described the role as Anderson's \"comeback\". She doesn't reject the term, but says she prefers to see it as \"a new chapter\".",

      "With so many strong female protagonists in this year's films, I'm curious what Anderson now thinks of Baywatch.",
      "The show has long been criticised for its portrayal of its female characters, who, many argued, were sexualised and denied meaningful plot lines.",
      "\"I didn't see it like that at all. I thought it was quite innocent and wholesome and, and fun to watch,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Chloe Webb was explaining how she recently sold a Pok\u00e9mon card in her shop for \u00a340,000 when a young boy and his dad politely interrupted to ask for her autograph.",
      "Ever since the 31-year-old quit her office job and opened Collector's Cardhouse in the picturesque Hertfordshire village of Chorleywood in April, it has become a destination for fans around the world.",
      "\"Every week we have an international visitor - Japan, America, United Arab Emirates - I've made so many friends all over the world, which is crazy to me because I never used to leave my little bubble when I had a normal job,\" she says.",
      "\"I live, breathe, and eat Pok\u00e9mon.\"",
      "\"I've travelled everywhere around the world, made lifelong friends,\" she adds.",
      "\"It has completely transformed every part of my life and I've got a really successful business now because of it.\"",
      "The Japanese franchise started life in 1996 on the Nintendo Game Boy, with players having to catch, train and battle virtual monsters called Pok\u00e9mon.",
      "When it arrived on UK shores in 1999, it had evolved.",
      "There was an animated series and packets of trading cards were available at most newsagents across the country. That's when Mrs Webb, from Watford, became a fan.",
      "She began a business with her husband, Harry, selling the cards online just before the pandemic. During lockdown, it \"really blew up\".",
      "Mrs Webb started making YouTube videos under the name \"PokiChloe\" to reach new fans.",
      "The couple joined forces with another Youtuber, Dean Leander - AKA PokeDean - to open a physical business.",
      "Today her Youtube channel, which mostly shows daily life in her Chorleywood shop, has more than 118,000 subscribers.",
      "In recent years, Pok\u00e9mon cards have become valuable collectors' items and many shop visitors hope they too could be sitting on a gold mine.",
      "Last year, a Nottinghamshire man made \u00a355,000 when he sold a collection of cards from the 1990s and 2000s.",
      "But a collector from Suffolk failed to sell his fourth print Charizard card when it did not reach its reserve of \u00a38,000.",
      "Mrs Webb explained: \"It could be anything that makes a card collectable.",
      "\"It could be that they're rare... It could be that it's a really popular Pok\u00e9mon.",
      "\"Sometimes overnight prices change on cards and I can't tell you why that card is now valuable.\"",
      "Sometimes cards worth up to \u00a3100,000 have been brought into the shop, although PokiChloe admits the big sums no longer surprise her.",
      "\"It's going to sound really awful: I'm very used to it now,\" she says.",
      "\"It is very surreal to think that this little bit of cardboard is worth that sort of money because to some people that's a deposit for a house - that could buy them two or three cars.",
      "\"But with what we do now we're exposed to it. Often it's just another day and another Pok\u00e9mon card.\"",
      "Many of the visitors who arrive at Collector's Cardhouse come with large binders tucked under their arms filled with cards they stashed away in their childhood.",
      "Many of these collections are, unfortunately, not worth anything.",
      "If, however, PokiChloe does deem a card valuable, it then has to be \"graded\".",
      "The process involves sending the card to a grading company who analyse it for signs of wear and then award it a graded score, usually out of 10, which denotes its quality and potential value.",
      "PokiChloe compared those cards that get a 10 to \"gold dust\".",
      "\"It has to be completely clean,\" she says.",
      "\"There can't be scratches on the holographic part, there can't be any whitening or damage on the back, it can't be creased. It has to be perfect like it's never been touched before.",
      "\"We had a Charizard that was graded a 10. It was a special card that was given out to employees at Creatures, who own Pok\u00e9mon. I think there's only 300 of them and we had a 10 and we sold it for just under \u00a340,000.\"",
      "Mrs Webb said a common misunderstanding is that a card has to be old to be valuable.",
      "\"There are packs that you could open today from the shop that cost you about \u00a330,\" she says.",
      "\"If you got the best card in the set and it was graded a 10, you'd be looking at a couple of thousand.",
      "\"And they're cards that only came out a few years ago. So they're not even what we would call vintage. They're modern cards.\"",
      "A graded card, regardless of how damaged it is, is sealed in plastic to preserve its condition.",
      "Mrs Webb said: \"We get people that send off cards that aren't in good condition. They just want to encapsulate it and keep it as a memory. So that's quite nice to see.",
      "\"I know the money is a big part of it and obviously people are blown away by the prices, but for some people it's about the memories, the nostalgia and just having some memories from when they were kids.\"",
      "Next year Pok\u00e9mon is celebrating its 30th anniversary. PokiChloe has ambitious plans for the future of Collector's Cardhouse.",
      "\"I want to keep this growing,\" she says.",

      "Gene Hackman, who has died aged 95, started his acting career later in life but became one of Hollywood's most bankable stars.",
      "Hackman was found dead along with his wife Betsy Arakawa and their dog at his home in New Mexico, US. No cause of death was given, but police said the situation was \"suspicious enough\" to merit investigation.",
      "Hackman had an illustrious five-decade career as an actor.",
      "He won two Oscars and was nominated for another three, playing violent men, yet was equally at home in comedy.",
      "He was once described as having the face of a truck driver, and was suited to character as well as leading roles. Having shot to fame in Bonnie and Clyde at the end of the 60s, he was rarely out of work - in films like The French Connection, Mississippi Burning and Superman.",
      "But he retired from acting in 2004 on the advice of his heart doctor, and rarely gave an interview again - opting for a quiet life in New Mexico with his second wife, Betsy.",
      "Eugene Allen Hackman was born in San Bernardino, California, in 1930 and led a peripatetic childhood.",
      "His parents divorced, and he was palmed off on various relatives until settling with his maternal grandmother in Danville, Illinois.",
      "His father left the family when Hackman was still in his teens.",
      "\"When young Gene was 13, his father abandoned the family, driving away while his son was out playing in the street,\" reported The New York Times' late writer Robert Berkvist.",
      "He went on: \"As his father passed by, Mr Hackman recalled years later, he gave him a wave of the hand.",
      "\"'I hadn't realised how much one small gesture can mean,' he once said. 'Maybe that's why I became an actor.'\"",
      "Hackman's mother died in 1962 - she burned to death in 1962, after setting fire to her mattress with a cigarette while drunk.",
      "As a teenager, Hackman was keen to branch out and lied about his age to join the Marines at the age of 16, serving nearly five years.",
      "He was stationed in China where he worked as a radio operator, which led to later work as a disc jockey.",
      "\"I have trouble with direction,\" he once said of his short military career, \"because I have trouble with authority. I was not a good Marine.\"",
      "After briefly studying journalism and TV production at the University of Illinois, Hackman left to enrol at the Pasadena Playhouse in California in the 60s, where he and classmate Dustin Hoffman were voted the \"least likely to succeed\".",
      "Undeterred by this vote of no confidence, both actors decamped to New York where they shared a flat with another aspiring thespian, Robert Duvall.",
      "Hackman managed to pick up a few minor stage roles, supplementing his income by taking on a variety of odd jobs.",
      "He would often relate the story of how he was spotted by a former drill sergeant outside a New York hotel while he was working as a doorman.",
      "Recognising his former charge, the sergeant exclaimed that he knew Hackman would never amount to anything.",
      "There was also a stint as an overnight cleaner in New York's Chrysler Building, something Hackman later described as the worst job he ever had.",

      "His first movie role was in the 1964 film Lilith, starring Warren Beatty.",
      "Impressed by his performance, Beatty cast Hackman as his brother, Buck Barrow, in Bonnie and Clyde in 1967.",
      "Hackman received an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor and was nominated again for I Never Sang for My Father in 1970.",
      "But then came The French Connection.",
      "It was the part that made him.",
      "He played the part of the maverick narcotics agent Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle who pursues a French drugs dealer, most notably in a famous sequence on the New York subway.",
      "It brought him an Academy Award for best actor, and he reprised the role in The French Connection II in 1975.",
      "Gene Hackman never looked back.",
      "Whether it was for critically-acclaimed movies such as The Conversation and Night Moves, or popular blockbusters like The Poseidon Adventure, he became a reliable box-office draw.",
      "One of the great screen tough guys, he effortlessly switched to comedy in Young Frankenstein and played the sleazy supervillain Lex Luthor in Superman and Superman II.",
      "Hackman was so upset about the producers' treatment of the director, Richard Donner, that he refused to take a part in the next sequel, although he later appeared in Superman IV: The Quest for Peace.",
      "The 80s was another successful decade, notably for his appearance in Mississippi Burning, for which he was again nominated for a best actor Academy Award.",
      "It was a powerful performance as an FBI agent, tasked, along with a rookie colleague, with investigating the racist murder of black civil rights workers in the early 60s.",
      "Director Alan Parker referred to Hackman as \" a very intuitive and instinctive actor\".",
      "Another Oscar for best supporting actor came in 1993 for Unforgiven - a Clint Eastwood Western - in which he played a sadistic sheriff, Bill Daggett.",
      "The film also won best picture. The awards came three years after Hackman required bypass surgery following a heart attack.",
      "There was a leading role as Edward \"Brill\" Lyle, the computer genius in the 1998 film, Enemy of the State, where he starred alongside Will Smith in a frightening tale of government surveillance.",
      "Hackman's hard-edged screen persona made him ideal for the intelligent but ruthless characters in film adaptations of John Grisham novels - such as The Firm and Runaway Jury - in which, for the first time, he and former flatmate Dustin Hoffman appeared on screen together.",
      "His versatility, and the luxury of being able able to choose scripts, led in 2001 to another great performance, in the offbeat comedy The Royal Tenenbaums, which drew rave reviews.",
      "But he chose to bow out from acting in the political satire, Welcome to Mooseport in 2004.",
      "Explaining his decision, he told Reuters he didn't want to risk going out on a sour note.",
      "\"The business for me is very stressful. The compromises that you have to make in films are just part of the beast,\" he said, \"and it had gotten to a point where I just didn't feel like I wanted to do it any more.\"",
      "A decade later, he did briefly come out of retirement to narrate two documentaries about the history of the US Marine Corps - but otherwise stuck to his plan.",
      "After quitting acting, he gained a new reputation as a writer of historical fiction.",

      "He spoke about why he had taken to his new job.",
      "\"I like the loneliness of [writing], actually. It's similar in some ways to acting, but it's more private and I feel like I have more control over what I'm trying to say and do,\" he told Reuters.",
      "\"There's always a compromise in acting and in film, you work with so many people and everyone has an opinion (laughs).",
      "\"But with the books, it's just Dan and I and our opinions. I don't know that I like it better than acting, it's just different. I find it relaxing and comforting.\"",

    "summary": "Amanda Pritchard's exit comes as the government moves to assert more direct over healthcare.",
    "story": [
      "Amanda Pritchard, head of NHS England, would have regular Monday meetings with Health Secretary Wes Streeting to review performance and address challenges. But last Monday was different. After discussing the state of the health service, she announced she was stepping down - with just one month's notice.",
      "It came as a shock to many in the organisation, under which there are 1.4 million staff who deal with 1.7 million patients everyday. But those in the know had suspected something was happening - though not the timing.",
      "That meeting between Pritchard and Streeting was the natural conclusion of changes which had been rumbling on in the corridors of power for some time.",
      "NHS England was given autonomy by the then-Conservative Health Secretary Andrew Lansley in 2013. The aim was to free the organisation from interference by politicians.",
      "Under Sir Simon Stevens - now Lord Stevens - NHS England developed into what looked like a rival power base and led by an alternative health secretary. He was at the heart of work drawing up long-term NHS plans under David Cameron and Theresa May. Lord Stevens knew his way around Whitehall and knew how to win backroom battles with ministers.",
      "Amanda Pritchard had been deputy to Lord Stevens since 2019 and played a vital role in the NHS response to the pandemic, including the vaccine roll-out. It had seemed inevitable she would take over the top job in 2021. Understandably, she expected to continue in the same vein as her predecessor. But with the arrival of a Labour government last year that certainty began to weaken.",
      "The first clue that things would be going back to a more traditional management regime, with more direct government control, came when two health experts were appointed from previous Labour governments: Alan Milburn, Blair's health secretary, and Paul Corrigan, an adviser. It became clear that they would be involved in shaping policy with Wes Streeting.",
      "One well-placed health source said those two \"remembered the old days\", before the NHS's shift to autonomy, which they felt made the system \"too bureaucratic\".",
      "Another clue came when work began on a new NHS 10-year plan for England. With previous plans Lord Stevens had \"held the pen\", but this time the government brought in Sally Warren from the King's Fund think tank - outside NHS England management - to head up the work.",
      "At the same time, noises were being made about slimming down NHS England management - and instead devolving money to local health boards and patient services. Government sources deny that NHS England is being subsumed into the health department but say it will have a \"leaner\" role, cutting out duplication.",
      "Amanda Pritchard was well aware of the direction of travel. She could see that her job was going to change and had considered stepping down later this year. There has been no suggestion of any row or confrontation with Wes Streeting.",
      "NHS officials say that the decision to leave at the end of March was because it will be the end of a financial year - and there was no need to stay for the launch of the 10-year plan in the early summer.",
      "In January Ms Pritchard had a bruising experience at the hands of two parliamentary select committees. One suggested she and colleagues were \"complacent\" and another said they were disappointed with \"lengthy and diffuse answers\". In a BBC interview she admitted that \"we're not all brilliant performers at committee hearings\" but it was right to be scrutinised. Privately, according to sources, she found the process \"frustrating given how much time she had given to the role\" under some of the most difficult years in the history of the NHS.",
      "She will be replaced by Sir Jim Mackey, an experienced NHS trust boss, who is being titled the \"transition\" chief executive. Policy will be run by Wes Streeting's department with Sir Jim, we are told, focusing on delivery including cutting the hospital waiting list of nearly 7.5 million. He had recently helped draft a recovery plan for planned treatment and appointments.",

      "On one hand, Amanda Pritchard has provided consistent leadership in various roles under six different health secretaries. The autonomy of NHS England enabled its chief executive to bang the drum for the health service and pressure the government.",
      "But on the other hand, serious problems remain with patient outcomes and those closer to Streeting argue more direct government control means less bureaucracy, and the ability to free up resources to deploy where needed.",
      "One health source argued that the upcoming changes would end confusion over policy and strategy and encourage collaboration between ministers and NHS England - without being a formal takeover. But another suggested it was \"a bit of a mess\" and there could now be instability and distractions for NHS administrators when they need to focus on wider health challenges.",
      "Much will depend on how much money is allocated in the Treasury spending review.",
      "It's patients that matter - and it's not yet clear whether or not these changes will help them."

She says he was prescribed a high dose to enable him to regain weight after losing four stone in hospital, but it became increasingly difficult to get hold of the medicine.",
      "\"We started to have trouble getting them in the higher dosage, involving me traipsing round pharmacies to find one who could get them. Pharmacies cannot get hold of that dosage. He now has to take a lower dose doubling up on the number of tablets taken, one box now lasts less than a week.",

Her cancer is now in remission, but she is still reliant on the drug for her digestive system to work correctly.  She says there was no availability to get the medication within her county, and she had to get her mother-in-law to make a two-hour journey to a pharmacy in Crewe.",

      "The letter says that without the drug, people experience \"horrendous bowel symptoms, poor diabetes control, malnutrition, and reduced absorption of other medications, all of which can have a massive impact on their health and quality of life\".",
      "There are other forms of Pert, but the charities and medical experts say while other countries have many brands available, in the UK creon \"holds a very high market share\".

      "There have been wider problems with drug shortages. The National Pharmacy Association, representing community chemists in the UK, sought views on the issue.",
      "Of the 500 which responded, all said they were unable to dispense a prescription at least once a day because of supply problems, and a large majority said patients came in at least once a day to get medicines they had failed to get elsewhere.",

      "Listen to this article",
      "At the urology department of Burnley General Hospital, 26-year-old Ryan (not his real name) is having a drug solution inserted through a catheter - part of his treatment for a condition known as ketamine bladder. This procedure will not completely reverse the damage inflicted by Ryan's previous addiction to the Class B drug, but it will help him manage the symptoms.",
      "Ketamine, a powerful horse tranquiliser and anaesthetic, is a licensed drug and can be prescribed medically. However, when misused, it can cause serious and sometimes permanent damage to the bladder. The hospital is watching Ryan for signs of kidney failure, too. He worries about finding a girlfriend and having children. But he is stoical when he talks about passing blood and having to urinate numerous times a day.",
      "\"You could not be a ketamine addict for 30 years, 20 years,\" he says. \"You'd die.\"",
      "He is under the care of consultant urologist Haytham Elsakka, who says he has witnessed a rise in young patients whose bladders have been damaged by ketamine use. \"Some of them are in their 30s, but most of them are 16 to 24,\" says Dr Elsakka. Around half of young patients end up needing surgery, he adds. Other risks from recreational use include liver failure, damage to the urethra, incontinence and impotence.",
      "\"We have seen young people under the age of 25 who've completely lost control of their bladders, who have had to have surgery, including bladder removal,\" says Abigail Wilson, lead clinical pharmacist for national drug and alcohol charity WithYou.",
      "In and around the town of Burnley, Ryan is far from alone. Lancashire County Council says it is helping a growing number of families affected by ketamine addiction in the Burnley area. According to WithYou, which runs a ketamine support service for young people aged 11 to 24, the number seeking help across Lancashire increased from 32 in 2018-19 to 123 by the end of 2024.",
      "And the area is not unusual. In England, the number of under-18s entering drug treatment who describe ketamine as one of their problem substances rose from 335 to 917 between 2020-21 and 2023-24, according to the National Drug Treatment Monitoring System.",
      "An anonymised 2023 survey of more than 13,000 secondary schoolchildren from 185 schools across England reported 11% of 15-year-olds had been offered ketamine at some point. The same study, conducted for NHS England, suggested the use of ketamine among schoolchildren had more than doubled in the last decade from 0.4% in 2013 to 0.9% in 2023.",
      "The drug came into the spotlight following the death of Friends actor Matthew Perry aged 54, after which a coroner found ketamine had been the primary cause. Doctors and experts subsequently described how the market for the drug in the US has exploded as it has grown in popularity among Hollywood celebrities.",
      "And thousands of miles away, among ordinary young people in UK towns, ketamine \u2013 also known as special K, vitamin K, or kit kat - has also become fashionable. Although highly dangerous, it is often seen as a sociable way to get high, with users buying it in powder form and snorting it.",
      "Now, just 11 years after ketamine was reclassified from Class C to Class B, the UK government is seeking expert advice on whether to make ketamine a Class A drug. This would mean anyone supplying it could be handed a life sentence.",
      "'Ketamine addiction left me crying in pain'Hooked on ketamine - Gen Z's drug of choiceKetamine bladder: Special clinics as youth addiction 'explodes'",
      "'Ketamine addiction left me crying in pain'",
      "Hooked on ketamine - Gen Z's drug of choice",
      "Ketamine bladder: Special clinics as youth addiction 'explodes'",
      "But some experts are sceptical this would make much of a difference. While ketamine use appears to be on the rise among the young, there is a sharp divide in opinion around what can be done to halt that.",
      "'It's in the schools, it's in the parks'",
      "One Saturday afternoon in September 2023, the hottest day of the year, a 16-year-old called Preston McNally took ketamine with three friends in Burnley. High on the drug, he fell into the Leeds and Liverpool canal that flows through the town. Preston's friends had also taken the drug and did not call for help straight away, an inquest was later told.",
      "The coroner said Preston drowned due to ketamine intoxication. The inquest also heard that he had told his sister he was trying to quit just before he died.",
      "Those on the front line are well aware of the scale of the problem. \"The amount of mums that have said to me, 'It's everywhere',\" says Fr Alex Frost from St Matthews Church in the town. He runs a support group for parents of ketamine users. \"It's in the schools, it's in the parks.\"",
      "Across Lancashire, recorded offences for possession and supply of ketamine rose by nearly 70% from 54 in 2023 to 91 in 2024. \"What we have seen, probably within the last 12 months, is the upturn in the use, particularly around children,\" says Insp Matt Plummer of Lancashire Police. \"Sometimes the parents have no idea.\"",
      "Once ketamine was known as a party drug, associated with the club scene. But there's evidence to suggest that has changed. In a 2024 report into drug trends in Greater Manchester, school-aged children recounted how they used it with friends to \"chill\" in the local parks or at home.",
      "Those who go on to use it away from social settings are often doing so \"to self-medicate unmet mental health support needs such as anxiety and trauma\", says the author of the report, Robert Ralphs, a professor of criminology and social policy at Manchester Metropolitan University.",
      "'Everybody else is doing it'",
      "One mother, who we are calling Claire, told the BBC she was oblivious to the fact that her 14-year-old daughter Lexi (not her real name) was addicted to ketamine until the teenager ended up in hospital with severe stomach cramps.",
      "Lexi, who lives on a neat, well-cared-for street in Burnley, loved sport and dancing. But after she started secondary school, she says, a friend introduced her to ketamine.",
      "\"I knew it was illegal\u2026 and it was a horse tranquiliser,\" says Lexi. \"That's all I knew. I didn't really want to do it, but I just thought, well, everybody else is doing it and I didn't really want to be the odd one out.\"",
      "One reason that so many young people are gravitating towards ketamine is they can buy it for pocket-money prices, according to Lexi. \"It were easy to get \u2013 like, really easy,\" she says.",
      "In Burnley, friends will chip in for the \u00a315 to \u00a330 it costs for a gram and share it.",
      "To feed her habit, Lexi would ask her mum for a couple of pounds for the bus or some make-up - or sometimes she would steal a \u00a310 note. If Lexi had been coming home drunk or smelling of weed, her mother Claire would have twigged. Claire says: \"I was absolutely gobsmacked, just distraught, really, thinking: how did I not know?\"",
      "'You're doing stupid amounts'",
      "What makes ketamine especially dangerous is that lots of people, particularly young people, wrongly see it as a lower-risk drug, says Mrs Wilson of the WithYou charity.",
      "At lower doses, she says, it has a similar effect to alcohol. \"The effects can wear off from about 40 minutes to just over an hour after taking it,\" she adds. \"If you want to keep those effects, then repeat dosing is required to continue them.\"",
      "And this means users' habits can escalate rapidly, according to Aaron (not his real name), who lives in a small town outside Burnley and took his first snort of ketamine when he was just 16.",
      "\"Your tolerance goes up extremely quickly and within the first month you're doing stupid amounts,\" he says. Soon he was spending \u00a3200 month on the drug.",
      "Higher doses can lead to a state known as a K-hole, \"which is where you become completely detached from reality and also paralysed\", says Mrs Wilson.",
      "Then there is the psychological impact. The WithYou charity is helping Lexi recover from dependence on the drug, but also trauma and self-harm. Once, when she was high, she was the victim of a sexual assault. When kids are on ketamine, they are extremely vulnerable.",
      "'Extremely dangerous'",
      "Some of the families of ketamine addicts the BBC has spoken to want the drug reclassified as Class A. But this would also mean children caught in possession of ketamine could face up to seven years in jail rather than five. Putting ketamine in the same bracket as heroin and cocaine \"may increase the stigma and make young people less likely to discuss their use and seek help\", warns Prof Ralphs.",
      "The government is currently seeking expert advice from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) on whether the drug should be reclassified. \"Ketamine is an extremely dangerous substance and the recent rise in its use is deeply concerning,\" says Dame Diana Johnson, the policing minister. \"It is vital we are responding to all the latest evidence and advice to ensure people's safety and we will carefully consider the ACMD's recommendations before making any decision.\"",
      "Families in the Burnley area say the authorities also need to do more to help those suffering as a result of what Fr Frost calls an \"epidemic\" of ketamine use.",
      "In response, Lancashire County Council says it is \"dedicated to supporting children and young people affected by ketamine use in our community\" and that it \"will continue to work tirelessly to address the challenges posed by ketamine use and to provide the necessary support to those in need\".",
      "'The urge is always there'",
      "There is scepticism from those on the frontline that increased enforcement will solve the issue.",
      "\"It's not a case that we can just arrest our way out of the ketamine issue,\" says Insp Plummer. \"You could arrest 10, 15 people a day for the possession of ketamine if you found them, but it's not going to change the cycle, particularly with kids.\" He adds that generally children caught with ketamine are given informal words of advice and referred for support, not charged.",
      "And some experts query how effective reclassification would be.  These include Prof Ralphs, who observes that the 2014 shift from Class C to Class B has not prevented the recent rise in usage among young people. He also suggests that would have no impact on people's decisions to supply it either, as most ketamine dealers already supply Class A substances as well. He adds that reclassification \"will not deter young people from using it if their underlying mental health and wellbeing needs continue to be unmet\".",
      "In the meantime, no one yet knows what the long-term effects will be for children who start taking ketamine at 12, 13 or 14. Community leaders and the families the BBC spoke to say they cannot wait for change, and that urgent action is needed now to try to prevent more young people suffering.",
      "Lexi says she is trying to move forward with her life. Since the doctors at the hospital told Lexi where her life could be heading, she has not used ketamine.",
      "Getting the drug out of her head is still not easy. She insists she will never take another dose of ketamine. But, she says, \"the urge is always there for me to do it again\".",

      "But there was a cloud hanging over the summit amid the gilt-edged grandeur of the former royal townhouse in central London.",
      "It came in the form of a question - was it all worth it? Was this gathering of European powers enough to shift the diplomatic dial? Or had the United States made up its mind to go it alone on finding a ceasefire in Ukraine?",
      "The prime minister's answer was very much that Europe still had a role to play. He said the UK, France and others would work with Ukraine on a plan to stop the fighting and then discuss that plan with the US.",
      "He said Europe would keep military aid flowing now and, in the event of a peace deal, it would boost Ukraine's own defensive capabilities, building up the country's \"armed forces and border defences\" to ensure that \"Ukraine can draw on munitions, finance and equipment to defend itself,\" according to the official conclusions of the summit.",
      "And Sir Keir said there would be a \"coalition of the willing\" to defend Ukraine and guarantee peace.",
      "Who or what that would involve is not yet clear. The prime minister merely said that there would be \"a force consisting of European and other partners\".",
      "The UK and France have already said they would be willing to put boots on the ground in Ukraine to help deter Russian aggression.",
      "The European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said the purpose was to turn Ukraine into a \"steel porcupine that is indigestible for potential invaders\".",
      "The aim, it would appear, is to beef up the European offer for post-war security guarantees for Ukraine in an attempt to convince Donald Trump to promise a US military backstop.",
      "The president has thus far been reluctant to go down that route, suggesting the presence of US mining firms on the ground in Ukraine would be enough to keep the peace.",
      "Sir Keir does not share this view, saying explicitly \"to support peace on our continent and to succeed, this effort must have strong US backing\".",
      "This summit was in many ways an attempt by Europe to take some ownership of the diplomacy. In recent weeks, efforts to end fighting in Ukraine have been led by Trump speaking to Russian's President Vladimir Putin and at his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky.",

      "The summit in London was an attempt by the prime minister both to calm diplomatic brows and stiffen diplomatic sinews. Diplomats said there was clear resolve around the table to support Ukraine but also to build on Trump's desire to find a ceasefire.",

The US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said America was ready to engage with Ukraine, but the National Security Adviser Mike Waltz suggested Zelensky might have to resign as part of any ceasefire.",

      "Speaking to the BBC's Sunday Show, he said: \"I think the prime minister is absolutely right to try and find a way forward with the United States because the position that unfolded on Friday evening was... deeply troubling to watch.",
      "\"To see a courageous leader of a courageous country being berated in the fashion that President Zelensky was is completely unacceptable.\"",
      "But he added that he could not see how a state visit could go ahead if Trump was \"not a steadfast ally of ours in protecting the future of Ukraine\".",

      "International Development Minister Anneliese Dodds has resigned over the prime minister's cuts to the aid budget.",
      "In a letter to Sir Keir Starmer, Dodds said the cuts to international aid, announced earlier this week to fund an increase in defence spending, would \"remove food and healthcare from desperate people - deeply harming the UK's reputation\".",
      "She told the PM she had delayed her resignation until after his meeting with President Trump, saying it was \"imperative that you had a united cabinet behind you as you set off for Washington\".",
      "The Oxford East MP, who attended cabinet despite not being a cabinet minister, said it was with \"sadness\" that she was resigning.",
      "She said that while Sir Keir had been clear he was not \"ideologically opposed\" to international development, the cuts were \"being portrayed as following in President Trump's slipstream of cuts to USAID\".",
      "Ahead of his trip to meet the US president, Sir Keir announced aid funding would be reduced from 0.5% of gross national income to 0.3% in 2027 in order to fund an increase in defence spending.",
      "In his reply to Dodds's resignation letter, the prime minister thanked the departing minister for her \"hard work, deep commitment and friendship\".",
      "He said cutting aid was a \"difficult and painful decision and not one I take lightly\" adding: \"We will do everything we can...to rebuild a capability on development.\"",

      "Starmer cuts aid to fund increase in defence spending",
      "In her resignation letter, Dodds said she welcomed an increase to defence spending at a time when the post-war global order had \"come crashing down\".",
      "She added that she understood some of the increase might have to be paid for by cuts to ODA [overseas development assistance].",
      "However, she expressed disappointment that instead of discussing \"our fiscal rules and approach to taxation\", the prime minister had opted to allow the ODA to \"absorb the entire burden\".",
      "She said the cuts would \"likely lead to a UK pull-out from numerous African, Caribbean and Western Balkan nations - at a time when Russia has been aggressively increasing its global presence\".",
      "\"It will likely lead to withdrawal from regional banks and a reduced commitment to the World Bank; the UK being shut out of numerous multilateral bodies; and a reduced voice for the UK in the G7, G20 and in climate negotiations.\"",
      "The spending cuts mean \u00a36bn less will be spent on foreign aid each year. The aid budget is already used to pay for hotels for asylum seekers in the UK, meaning the actual amount spend on aid overseas will be around 0.15% of gross national income.",
      "The prime minister's decision to increase defence spending came ahead of his meeting in Washington - the US president has been critical of European countries for not spending enough on defence and instead relying on American military support.",
      "He welcomed the UK's commitment to spend more, but Sir Keir has been attacked by international development charities and some of his own MPs for the move.",
      "Dodds held off her announcement until the prime minister's return from Washington, in order not to overshadow the crucial visit, and it was clear she did not want to make things difficult for the prime minister.",
      "But other MPs have been uneasy about the decision, including Labour MP Sarah Champion, who chairs the international development committee, who said that cutting the aid budget to fund defence spending is a false economy that would \"only make the world less safe\".",
      "Labour MP Diane Abbott, who had been critical of the cuts earlier in the week, said it was \"shameful\" that other ministers had not resigned along with Dodds.",
      "Dodds's resignation also highlights that decisions the prime minister feels he has to take will be at odds with some of the views of Labour MPs, and those will add to tensions between the leadership and backbenchers.",

      "\"He may not be able to convince the ministers in his own cabinet, but on this subject, I will back him.\"",
      "However one of her backbenchers - and a former international development minister - Andrew Mitchell backed Dodds, accusing Labour of trying \"disgraceful and cynical actions\". \"Shame on them and kudos to a politician of decency and principle,\" he added.",
      "Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said Dodds had done \"the right thing\" and urged the government to find alternative ways to pay for increases to defence spending.",
      "He suggested raising money through increases to the digital services tax or setting up a European rearmament bank, which would lend money to governments to buy military equipment or the private sector to expand their manufacturing capacity.",
      "Sir Ed argued that if the UK cut back on overseas aid, China and Russia would \"fill the vacuum\".",
      "Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said she was \"sorry to hear\" of Dodds's resignation.",

      "Under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership of the Labour Party she served as a shadow Treasury minister and was promoted to shadow chancellor when Sir Keir took over.",

      "Speaking to BBC News following the hearing, Mohamed, who represents Dewsbury and Batley in West Yorkshire, said his desire to sit on a select committee was about equal opportunity.",

      "\"It does come across as slightly undemocratic, but the aim isn't to be the same or replace or kick out other people; it's just having that same opportunity to contribute to the governance of our country,\" he said.",
      "Under current parliamentary rules independent MPs are not automatically entitled to membership on select or bill committees.",
      "For select committees, political parties control the process and allocate seats in proportion to the size of each party's parliamentary intake.",
      "This means that the Labour Party gets the largest share of select committee seats, then the Conservatives, followed by the Liberal Democrats and so on.",
      "However, parties are able to voluntarily give up a seat for an independent MP or an MP from a different party, such as when the Green party's Caroline Lucas was given a spot on the Environmental Audit Committee from 2015 to 2024.",

      "This prompted the Procedure Committee to begin holding inquiries into the status of parliamentary groupings and independent MPs as a whole.",

      "The Labour government made manifesto promises to bring back \"family\" doctors and end the early morning phone \"scramble\" for appointments.",
      "The doctors' union, the British Medical Association (BMA), says the deal is an important first step in restoring general practices.",

      "GP surgeries are seen as the front door to the NHS but for years now, doctors have been warning about the pressure their service is under.",
      "Patients have felt it too, with some people facing long waits for appointments.",
      "Long waiting times for routine GP appointments have led to the now familiar \"8am scramble\" for a same-day appointment.",
      "Many GP surgeries open their telephone lines at 8am, meaning that if you want an on-the-day appointment, you have to phone on the dot at 8am.",
      "It is a frequent source of complaints from patients who often find themselves held in long queues, only to be told all the appointments have been booked up.",
      "Not all surgeries work like this though, with others operating telephone call-back services or online triage so that patients can be prioritised.",
      "The new contract\u00a0says patients should be able to arrange appointments online throughout working hours, freeing up the phones for those who need them most, and making it easier for practices to triage patients based on medical need.",
      "More money to cover rising costs",
      "The new agreement for the next 2025-26 financial year will see the total value of the contract grow by 7.2%.",
      "The total figure includes almost \u00a3800m to cover rising costs, such as staff wages, repairs and maintenance of buildings and more patients.",
      "Other measures include a greater flexibility for surgeries when it comes to employing different healthcare staff.",
      "GPs will get paid more to carry out routine childhood vaccinations.",
      "Through cutting what the government describes as \"box-ticking targets\", ministers say GPs will be freed up to take the first steps towards ending the \"8am scramble\" for an appointment.",
      "Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting says that these are the first steps in fixing what he describes as \"a broken NHS\".",
      "\"Over the past decade, funding for GPs has been cut relative to the rest of the NHS, while the number of targets for GPs has soared,\" he said.",
      "\"That's why patients are struggling to get an appointment.",

      "\"In return, more patients will be able to request appointments online and see their regular doctor for each appointment.\"",
      "Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, who chairs the BMA GPs' committee, says this contract is a good start, but more work is needed.",
      "\"We have shown that we want to work in good faith with this government and build on this new beginning \u2013 what we now need is certainty about our collective future.",
      "\"We know the Treasury will be announcing its funding plans for this Parliament this spring, and we need to see a new substantive GP practice contract for England in the upcoming comprehensive spending review.\"",
      "Dr Bramall-Stainer told BBC Breakfast general practice had been pushed to \"desperation point\" over the last 15 years - with \"thousands\" of GPs leaving.",
      "She explained the \"first signs of green shoots\" patients might see following the new agreed measures would include being able to get to know their doctor and local staff and surgeries advertising for more staff.",
      "She indicated patients would \"potentially\" begin to notice a difference in six to 12 months but insisted that, although a step in the right direction, these new measures are \"nowhere near a solution\".",
      "Dr Steve Taylor, a locum GP in Manchester and spokesperson from the lobbying group Doctors' Association UK, said he fears much of the extra money will have to go towards national insurance contributions, staff and running costs.",
      "Dr Taylor said: \"The new GP contract goes a small way to fix some of the significant issues for GP practices, in that it prevents further declines in funding with a small percentage increase.\"",
      "But  a much larger investment will be needed to build for the future, he added.",
      "Dr Dean Eggitt, a GP in Doncaster and ex-executive member of the doctors' union, the BMA, said he was disappointed with the new contract.",
      "\"There is little in this contract that is going to help patients access care quicker than they do already because it hasn't managed to address the underlying issue of national insurance contributions and the vast sums of money that will need to go towards that,\" he added.",
      "Meanwhile, Azeem Majeed, London GP and professor of primary care and public health at Imperial College London, said overall, the contract was a positive development.",
      "\"It is good that an agreement has been reached. But a lot of work still needs to be done to improve the lives of patients, GPs and other primary care staff.",
      "\"The priority should be recruiting more nurses and GPs to help increase appointments,\" he said.",
      "\"But it will take some time for people to see improvements from this investment.\""

    "story": [
      "The US-UK trade deal warmly suggested by President Donald Trump should help insulate the UK from the direct impact of global trade tensions.",
      "It signals that the White House has accepted the statistical logic that the US and UK have a balanced trade position.",
      "Essentially each country roughly exports the same amount of goods to one another. Indeed, rather helpfully, according to the US numbers it exports more.",
      "There is no general case that the UK is, in the words and logic of the president,  \"ripping off\" or \"screwing\" the US, as he has suggested of many other countries and the EU.",
      "So a deal to avoid the further trade barriers is very much on the cards.",
      "But this is not the wideranging US-UK free trade agreement to lower almost all existing tariffs, that was the subject of so much debate in the Brexit era.",
      "It is important to remember that the wider deal was never properly prioritised by Trump's own team, because, as they told me, they never truly believed that the UK would find it in its interest to make the necessary hard break from the EU.",
      "It is difficult to see that the UK government would want to further aggravate farmers, or its own base, by putting US farm imports or NHS pricing on the table.",
      "In addition, on goods trade, the government is already prioritising its \"Brexit reset\" - a food standards deal, and some customs arrangements to bring down newish trade barriers with the European Union. Tellingly, the top official on that negotiation was in the Oval Office.",
      "UK-US trade deal could mean tariffs 'not necessary', says Trump",
      "Key takeaways from Starmer's talks with Trump",
      "How could Trump's tariffs affect the UK?",
      "The narrower \"economic deal\", as it was termed by Sir Keir Starmer, centres around technology and what the UK has referred to as the \"further integration of our two countries' tech sectors\".",
      "Perhaps the best analogy is that the tech expertise held within the London-Oxford-Cambridge triangle could become for a booming AI-driven Silicon Valley what London's financial City became to New York's Wall Street. The fact that Vice President and big tech ally JD Vance will be leading some of the US negotiation is key here.",
      "This strategy will have consequences. Trump's team are already railing against digital services taxes.",
      "The UK's digital services tax was introduced in 2020 and imposes a 2% charge on revenues made by big tech firms running social media, internet search engines or online marketplaces.",
      "While the \u00a3700m-\u00a31bn a year it raises in the UK is smallish beer, since the UK and France introduced a hit to big tech's revenues, many other countries have followed suit.",
      "The White House wants to \"stop the contagion\", and that could mean persuading the UK to lower or abolish it. Chancellor Rachel Reeves advocated raising it from 2% to 12% just four years ago.",
      "Likewise the vice president in the Oval Office mentioned US tech firms being unfairly affected by what he called \"freedom of speech\" issues.",
      "This appears to be a reference to the Online Safety Act. This aims to make social media firms and search engines protect children and adults in the UK from illegal, harmful material, although some have argued it risks stifling free expression online. My understanding is that, right now, movement may be less likely here.",
      "The prize will be integration into the massive investments from the best capitalised tech companies in the world.",
      "Could the UK start to attract back some of the investments lost to Dublin, for example? Would the EU stand back and allow the UK to develop as an offshore hub for US tech companies to service the whole of Europe?",
      "There are two other significant issues. It is not unknown for warm words in the Oval Office to be somewhat contradicted by actions soon after. While sat next to the PM, President Trump described the EU's levying of VAT as a trade restriction, seemingly unaware that the UK does exactly the same thing.",
      "And even if it avoids direct new tariffs from President Trump, the open UK economy would be affected by any wide-ranging trade war involving most of the G7 and other countries.",
      "That is still on the cards. Not only would that collapse world growth and potentially spike up inflation again, but could upend entirely the workings of the World Trade Organization.",
      "The PM says the UK doesn't have to choose between the US and other allies, but it may appear like that to them.",
      "The strategy appears to be to become the Switzerland of global economics. Neutrality in a world of trade turmoil, not so much sat on a fence, but tiptoeing along a rather wobbly one."

    "story": [
      "UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has met US President Donald Trump during his first visit to the White House.",
      "Here are some of the key moments as the pair took questions from reporters before and after the talks.",
      "1. A surprise letter to Trump from King Charles",
      "Sir Keir did not turn up to the meeting empty-handed.",
      "Part-way through their opening remarks, the prime minister reached inside his jacket pocket and pulled out an official letter from King Charles III - an invitation for a second state visit.",
      "Trump appeared to be genuinely taken back for a few seconds, asking: \"Am I supposed to read it right now?\"",
      "After taking a minute to read the letter, Trump said he accepted the invitation and that it would be an \"honour\" to visit the \"fantastic\" country.",
      "He added that King Charles was a \"beautiful man, a wonderful man\".",
      "Follow updates on the Starmer-Trump meeting",
      "Trump's letter from the King: What does it say and what does it mean?",
      "During Trump's first term as president, he met King Charles's mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II, during a three-day state visit in 2019.",
      "Sir Keir said Thursday's invitation to host Trump once more for a second full state visit was \"unprecedented\".",
      "2. Trump wanted to take charge",
      "While cordial, the initial meeting in the Oval Office between Sir Keir and Trump left no doubt that the US president hoped to be firmly in charge.",
      "The meeting was a pattern we've now seen six times with foreign leaders at the Trump White House, including with French President Emmanuel Macron earlier this week: Trump taking control of the room and using the opportunity to get his own messages, both domestic and international, across to the reporters there.",
      "Analysis: Starmer charms Trump, but any deals will have to wait",
      "Analysis: Starmer charms Trump, but any deals will have to wait",
      "During their half-hour session, Trump leaned forward and slightly towards Sir Keir - wearing a nearly identical, but slightly different coloured tie to Trump's -  dominating the conversation and taking charge of calling on reporters.",
      "A joint afternoon news conference later began with a slightly more diplomatic and matter-of-fact tone, with both Trump and Sir Keir standing at their respective lecterns and going to considerable lengths to lavish praise on the other.",
      "Trump joked he would have been president 20 years ago with Sir Keir's \"beautiful\" accent.",
      "At one point, Sir Keir was asked about Trump's controversial call to make Canada \u2013 a member of the Commonwealth \u2013 the 51st state of the US.",
      "\"I think you're trying to find a divide that doesn't exist,\" Sir Keir replied.",
      "Trump interjected quickly with the words \"that's enough\" before moving on \u2013 again taking control of the room as he stood next to a visibly surprised Sir Keir.",
      "3. The similarities between Starmer and Trump",
      "To put it gently, Sir Keir and Trump are from different schools of politics - both in their style and substance.",
      "But asked to name their similarities Trump said: \"He loves his country, and so do I.\"",
      "What else do they share? Trump said: \"We like each other, frankly, and we like each other's country.\"",
      "But the \"common thread\" between the two men was that \"we love our country\", Trump said.",
      "4. Starmer a 'tough negotiator'",
      "Sir Keir had a number of tricky topics to raise with Trump - from trade to US security guarantees for Ukraine - and at the beginning of their news conference the president called his counterpart \"a very tough negotiator\".",
      "Asked if the prime minister had convinced him not to impose trade tariffs on the UK, Trump said \"he tried\", adding: \"He was working hard, I'll tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there.\"",
      "But he has said there was \"a very good chance\" of a trade deal \"where tariffs wouldn't be necessary\".",
      "Such a deal, Trump said, could be made \"pretty quickly\".",
      "Sir Keir spoke of a \"new economic deal with advanced technology at its core\".",
      "5. Trump 'minded' to accept UK's Chagos deal",
      "Trump said he was \"inclined to go along with\" the UK's Chagos Islands deal.",
      "The UK is in talks with Mauritius about handing over the territory but continuing to lease one of the islands, Diego Garcia, which contains a UK-US military airbase.",
      "The agreement has been mired in uncertainty after Trump's re-election as US president, given several US Republicans have argued it could deliver a potential security boost to China.",
      "But during the meeting, Trump said he had a \"feeling\" the deal was going to \"work out very well\".",
      "6. 'Did I say that?' Trump walks back comments on Zelensky",
      "Last week, Trump made headlines by calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a \"dictator\" in a social media post, echoing Russian claims about Kyiv's cancelled elections.",
      "An election was scheduled for May 2024, but it was suspended because Ukraine has been under martial law since Russia began its full-scale invasion.",
      "Asked by the BBC's Chris Mason about his use of the word \"dictator\", Trump replied: \"Did I say that? I can't believe I would say that.\"",
      "In the news conference later, Trump also appeared to have softened his attitude to Zelensky, praising him as \"very brave\" and saying the pair got on \"really well\".",
      "Talking about the potential for a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia, Trump said \"progress towards peace\" would continue when Zelensky visits the White House on Friday. The two are expected to sign a major minerals deal.",
      "7. Starmer hits back at free speech criticism",
      "At the Munich Security Conference last week, US Vice President JD Vance attacked the UK and other European democracies, warning that \"free speech is in retreat.\"",
      "Asked about the comments, Trump called on his deputy to defend himself. Vance argued \"there have been infringements on free speech that actually affect not just the British\" but also \"American technology companies and by extension, American citizens\".",
      "That led to Sir Keir cutting in, saying \"we've had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom - and it will last for a very, very long time\".",
      "He rejected Vance's claim, saying \"in relation to free speech in the UK, I'm very proud of our history there\".",

      "Andrew and Tristan Tate, the controversial British-American social media influencers accused of rape, human trafficking and money laundering, have been freed from travel restrictions in Romania after several high-level White House officials took an interest in their case.",
      "It's unclear what, if any, role Donald Trump's administration may have played in their release, but one of Trump's top envoys is said to have raised the case with Romania's Foreign Minister Emil Hurezeanu at a security conference in Munich earlier this month.",
      "Andrew Tate rose to fame after appearing on the UK reality show Big Brother, and later making a series of extreme and controversial statements about women and politics on social media.",
      "The pair ran a webcam business and were charged with human trafficking and rape along with two Romanian female suspects in June 2023.",
      "They also face separate, unrelated allegations of rape and human trafficking in the UK, and civil suits in the US and UK. They deny all the allegations, which their US lawyer calls \"defamatory and unequivocally false\".",
      "On Thursday the brothers arrived in Florida after previously being banned from leaving Romania while the case against them is pending.",
      "Lawyers for the pair say they will return to Bucharest for court hearings.",
      "What is the White House saying?",
      "When asked about the Tates at the White House on Thursday, President Trump said: \"I know nothing about that.\"",
      "But the brothers have been the subject of recent high-level discussions between the US and Romania.",
      "Romanian officials say US counterparts brought up the brothers' case with the Romanian government earlier this month, a story first reported by the Financial Times.",
      "And Trump special envoy Richard Grenell raised the issue again at a security conference in Munich.",

      "One of Tate's lawyers now works as White House liaison to the US justice department.",
      "Paul Ingrassia was part of a team representing the Tate brothers in a defamation lawsuit they filed in Florida against several of their alleged victims.",
      "Ingrassia also acted as Tate's publicist and says he got the influencer onto a show hosted by Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host.",
      "He has praised Tate in online posts. In one dating from July 2023, he called Tate \"an extraordinary human being\" who was offering \"a dying West some hope for renewal\".",
      "Ingrassia did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday.",
      "The Tates have also been talked about by several people in Trump's orbit, including Donald Trump Jr and Elon Musk.",
      "Trump Jr once called Tate's detention in Romania \"absolute insanity\".",
      "Musk reinstated Andrew Tate's account, which had been banned on X, and suggested, perhaps in jest, that Tate would make a good UK prime minister.",
      "Joseph McBride, a lawyer representing the Tates in a defamation case they have filed against several of their accusers in Florida, said in a statement: \"They feel secure in America for several reasons, the primary one being that Donald Trump is the president.\"",
      "The statement alleged that the Tates and others are victims of \"weaponised legal systems\" and \"politically motivated prosecutions\".",
      "McBride did not respond to questions on whether White House officials played any role in the removal of travel restrictions against the Tate brothers.",
      "The 'manosphere'",
      "Trump and his advisers know the political power of the manosphere \u2013 a popular and very online subculture that attracts fans of mixed martial arts fighting, video games, cryptocurrencies and other stereotypically male pursuits.",
      "It's a sprawling scene that includes men who reject the company of women entirely, a \"pick-up artist\" scene filled with tips on how to find casual hookups, and plenty of mainstream podcasts and YouTube channels filled with bro-type humour.",
      "The president's advisers targeted the same audiences during last year's election campaign, when Trump, JD Vance and others in his orbit went on podcasts and did interviews with new media outlets.",
      "The views of the Tate brothers lie at one of the manosphere's extreme edges. Andrew Tate himself has made no secret of his self-described misogynist \u2013 women-hating \u2013 and sexist views.",
      "On podcasts and online clips he talks about how women are property, how men shouldn't allow girlfriends to go out without them or talk to other men.",
      "In extremely graphic language, he's described violence against women and talked about how sexual assault victims bear responsibility for rape.",
      "Tate and his brother at the same time sell a glamorous lifestyle of expensive properties, cigars and luxury cars that includes self-improvement messages directed at young men - an image that garnered him a large audience before he was booted off most mainstream social media platforms.",
      "He told the BBC in a 2023 interview: \"I preach hard work, discipline. I'm an athlete, I preach anti-drugs, I preach religion, I preach no alcohol, I preach no knife crime. Every single problem with modern society I'm against.\"",
      "Like many other extreme influencers, in the face of criticism he often claims his posts are satire or jokes, mocking his detractors as his messages spread further, propelled by online outrage.",

      "'He's just a bro': Trump's attempts to woo the 'manosphere'",
      "Trump supporters split",
      "The pair's supporters were thrilled with his release and eager to proclaim their innocence, despite the outstanding charges against them.",
      "Four British women who have filed a civil lawsuit against Andrew Tate meanwhile issued a statement calling on UK authorities to \"take action\", saying they were \"in disbelief and feel re-traumatised by the news\".",
      "And support for the Tates is far from universal among Trump supporters and American conservatives, many of whom moved to immediately distance themselves from the brothers.",
      "Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, where Tates landed on Thursday, said of their activities: \"Florida is not a place where you're welcome with that type of conduct.\"",
      "The state's attorney general later said he would open a preliminary inquiry into the Tates and said Florida has \"zero tolerance for human trafficking and violence against women\".",
      "In the conservative Washington Examiner, podcaster Brady Leonard wrote: \"Tate's obnoxious, misogynistic brand is toxic to everyone besides electorally insignificant corners of social media.\"",
      "Matt Lewis, a US conservative political commentator who has been critical of Trump in the past, said advocating on behalf of Tate \"fits in with the ethos of the Maga world right now, which is: 'let's be tough guys'\".",
      "\"But I also think it speaks to a legitimate problem, which we have seen in the last couple decades, a problem with men...where there's an epidemic of loneliness, a sense the world is passing them by, a sense that modernity has made it harder to be successful as a husband and a father. I think that's had some real psychic effects,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "A pungent smell of detergent and rotten food hits me as we walk through this enormous high-security prison. Inmates press themselves up against the bars to look at us. There are no smiles, only expressionless stares.",
      "A man with a tattoo that swirls across his face shouts, \"Where you from, ma'am?\"",
      "\"England.\"",
      "\"Hope you enjoy Estelle,\" he says.",
      "\"Do you?\" I ask.",
      "\"A lot better than where I was before.\"",
      "Welcome to the Estelle Supermax Penitentiary in Huntsville, Texas.",
      "Concrete watchtowers punctuate the perimeter of this vast space - equivalent in size to almost 3,000 football pitches - and a sign with an image of a red-maned lion and the words Stay Hungry - Feast on Success greets staff and visitors as they enter.",
      "The UK government is looking to Estelle prison for ideas - for ways to reduce reoffending and to bring down prisoner numbers in our already overcrowded jails. There's a scheme here they'd like to emulate, which gives inmates the chance to shorten their sentences by having a job while they're inside.",
      "Looking to this prison for inspiration might seem a curious choice to many, given Texas executes more people than any other US state. But ministers say by implementing schemes similar to ones used here, UK prisoners will be incentivised to gain qualifications - giving them more chance of employment once released.",
      "Just one in five offenders in England and Wales has a job six weeks after being released from custody, the latest stats show. According to the Ministry of Justice, people who are still unemployed six weeks after being released are twice as likely to reoffend as those in employment.",
      "No prison in the UK has as many inmates as they do at Estelle. More than 3,000 men in white jail-suits are currently locked up here - from murderers and rapists, to those doing time for lesser crimes like shoplifting and fraud. Two inmates are on death row.",
      "Jimmy Delgado is 52 and serving three life sentences for first-degree murder. He's already been inside for 25 years - 13 spent in solitary confinement. He's a large man with muscular shoulders and smiles broadly when we meet in the prison chapel, softly shaking my hand. He tells me he first ended up in prison aged just 16, after carrying out a robbery.",
      "He's remorseful for his crimes and says this prison - together with his faith in Jesus - has helped turn his life around by giving him purpose. He now works as a counsellor, supporting offenders who are struggling to cope with life in prison.",
      "\"I'm here for taking a life - and I'm here to save multiple lives,\" he says. \"If I can change the dynamic of family life for all these guys that are here then I've done my job - even if I never get out of prison.\"",
      "Delgado may never be released, but inmates having jobs in prison is one of the reasons why Estelle Supermax Penitentiary is appealing to the UK government.",
      "The \"good time credit\" scheme used here gives inmates the opportunity to reduce their time behind bars by participating in courses and studying for qualifications, taking up jobs, and behaving well.",
      "Credits earned are then added to the number of days the prisoner has already spent in jail, allowing them to reach their parole eligibility date sooner - when a panel decides if they're suitable for early release. This process depends on the classification of their crime and an assessment by the parole board on their overall rehabilitation.",
      "Off the long corridor that runs through the main prison building, inmates are quietly working in a small barbers. Kevin Smith is inside for minor offences. He is meticulously cutting a member of staff's hair with a pair of clippers, and says the good time credit scheme has made him feel positive about his time in prison.",
      "\"They helped me see that if I do the right thing and make the right decisions, I can do better in life,\" he says. \"I receive good time by working here, and I can get out earlier with the good time that I received - it works.\"",
      "The rates of those returning to prison within three years of release have fallen to 20.3% in Texas - a fraction of those in the rest of the United States (68%).",
      "The BBC came to Estelle to see their credit scheme in action with UK justice secretary Shabana Mahmood.",
      "\"The Texans had a system similar to ours - on the point of collapse, running out of prison places in 2007,\" Ms Mahmood says. \"They've now got a sustainable prison population - but most importantly, they've been able to massively cut the rates of reoffending here. They've got a rate of crime now that they haven't seen since the 1960s.\"",
      "She believes the Texan credit system is effective - helping prisoners get out of prison early - and stay out. \"It does help prisoners turn their backs on a life of crime.\"",
      "The Texas prison population is the highest of any state in the US, with 134,668 people in custody in the autumn of 2024 - although over the last couple of decades, since reforms were implemented, that number has reduced by nearly 20%. However, some experts say the good time credit programme is not a magic bullet.",
      "\"The incentivisation scheme has little to do with the reforms that helped bring Texas's prison population down in 2007,\" says Michele Deitch, a criminal justice policy lecturer at the University of Texas. \"And by itself it will do little to address the UK's very serious overcrowding problem.\"",
      "What would make a real difference, she says, would be diverting more people from incarceration in the first place: \"To shorten sentences, to reduce the use of recalls to prison, and to invest more heavily in rehabilitative programs in prison and in programs and services in the community.\"",
      "As well as incentivisation, the UK government is also considering the use of \"diversion programmes\" - where offenders are sent on rehabilitation courses rather than to jail. This can apply to people with addiction issues or mental health problems. It's what they do here in Texas to reduce the burden on the courts and attempt to sort the root cause of the offence.",
      "Violence, overcrowding, self-harm: BBC goes inside one of Britain\u2019s most dangerous prisons",
      "Prison gangs: \u2018I've chopped people,  attacked staff, hidden drugs\u2019",
      "Prison officers deal drugs and ask inmates for sex, BBC told",
      "More people have been put to death in Texas than anywhere else in the US. Since the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976, 593 prisoners have been executed. There are 176 people currently on death row - so it might seem strange the UK government could take a leaf out of their book.",
      "Even so, the justice secretary believes there is still much the UK can learn from what happens at Estelle.",
      "\"I don't think that the fact that they have the death penalty here means that we shouldn't be learning lessons from strategies that they've introduced that really work,\" Ms Mahmood says.",
      "It's a plan with \"huge potential in the UK\" according to Nick Hardwick, a former chief inspector of prisons, who believes it will make prisons safer and more productive.",
      "\"It will help ensure prisoners are doing what is necessary to reduce the risk they will reoffend and create more victims,\" he says.",
      "But not everyone agrees with incentivising convicted criminals to work towards an early release from prison.",
      "Samantha Nicholls' son was murdered in 2018. Twenty-two year old Joe Pooley was thrown into a river in Ipswich and held under the water. Three people were jailed for his murder in 2021. Joe's mother believes inmates should never be released before their sentence is complete.",
      "\"Prison is a punishment - you should do your time,\" she says. \"It needs to be a deterrent - you're there because you did something wrong.\"",
      "It's clear the UK needs to find solutions to cut prison overcrowding \u2013 and find them fast. Even the recent prisoner early release scheme will barely keep pace with more offenders being jailed. New prison buildings will take years to come on stream. But does this Texan prison have the answers?",
      "The challenge for ministers and the criminal justice system is how to stop the revolving doors on the UK's prisons - the reoffending and lack of prospects facing those who are released which draws them back into crime.",

      "The party is now committing to doing the precise opposite \u2013 cutting development spending by the same amount by which it had promised to raise it.",
      "There is nothing like an outspoken American president and an imminent visit to the White House to sharpen the mind \u2013 and hey presto, along came this announcement just as the prime minister packs his shirts for his trip across the Atlantic.",
      "Along came the thumbs-up from the Trump administration not long later.",
      "But it is also true that there has been a growing recognition for some time and across several parties that more money had to be spent on defence.",
      "The prime minister has taken to recalling how the Berlin Wall coming down made him feel. \"It felt as if we were casting off the shackles of history, a continent united by freedom and democracy,\" as he puts it - contrasting that with the reality of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "A wider critique along these lines has been crystallising for some time: the sense that the 1990s were a holiday from history, as Jonathan Freedland called it, and that the end of the Cold War had created a peace dividend where defence budgets could atrophy and the money could be spent on hospitals and schools, for instance.",
      "Instead, not only is there war in Europe, there is an occupant of the White House with seemingly little regard for the American security umbrella this continent has relied upon since World War Two.",
      "Little wonder, then, that we have seen a blitz of the jitters in European capitals as presidents and prime ministers try to work out what it may or may not mean.",
      "The task facing Starmer - the second strand of the European tag team of leaders to visit Washington, after President Emmanuel Macron on Monday - is to attempt to mould President Donald Trump's position.",
      "Over the coming weeks and months, can a deal be done where the war stops, Ukraine does not feel defeated, Europe does not feel imperilled and transatlantic relations are as near to conventional as possible?",
      "It is not going to be easy.",
      "The prime minister's trip to the White House is but one building block in developing answers to these questions.",

    "story": [
      "The uncertain future of two killer whales is no closer to being resolved despite the closure of their marine zoo home two months ago.",
      "Wikie, 23, and her 11-year-old son Keijo are still being kept at Marineland Antibes, located in southern France, after it closed in January due to a forthcoming law banning the use of orcas in shows.",
      "For months managers at Marineland have tried to send the killer whales to other marine zoos but this has angered animal rights campaigners who want them housed in a sanctuary, where the orcas won't have to perform or be used for breeding.",
      "The orcas were expected to go to another marine zoo in Spain when the French government rejected a move to a proposed sanctuary in Canada a few weeks ago.",
      "But now Agne\u0300s Pannier-Runacher, the French ecology minister, said she would speak to colleagues in Spain, Italy and Greece about creating a different sanctuary together. However, her proposal has few other details and has been criticised.",
      "'Humans are all they know' - Fate of whales uncertain as marine zoo shuts",
      "France bans captive breeding of dolphins",
      "The ecology ministry, when asked by the BBC, had no further information on where a sanctuary might be located or who would fund its construction and running costs.",
      "Loro Parque, a marine zoo in Spain that wants to receive the killer whales from Marineland, told the BBC this week the current proposal was \"wholly unsuitable\" and that they were best positioned to care for them.",
      "Christoph Kiessling, vice-president of the facility in Tenerife, said whale sanctuaries were \"currently unable to meet the complex physiological, social and environmental needs\" of killer whales.",
      "Most designs involve cordoning off a bay and employing staff to ensure Wikie and Keijo - who were born in captivity and cannot be released into the wild - are properly fed and looked after.",
      "Kiessling did say such a solution might be possible if there was more extensive research and planning but \"such a process could take years, leaving the two Marineland [orcas] in a facility that is being wound down\".",
      "Campaigners point out that several orcas have died at Loro Parque in the last few years, including three between March 2021 and September 2022.",
      "Managers at the marine zoo said scientific examination of those orcas by the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria showed the deaths were unavoidable.",
      "They also fear Wikie might be used for breeding. Loro Parque announced in January that Morgan, the only female of the three orcas currently kept there, is pregnant.",
      "Katheryn Wise, from the charity World Animal Protection, said Loro Parque was ultimately an entertainment business that used orcas to make money.",
      "She added: \"Morgan's pregnancy underlines the fact that Loro Parque could never be a suitable option for Wikie and Keijo and should be removed as an option.\"",
      "Marineland, who are still paying to look after the orcas, said a move to Loro Parque as soon as possible was in the best interests of the animals' welfare. They have asked the ecology ministry to approve the transfer.",
      "'The water is too warm for orcas'",
      "The whale sanctuary in Canada applied to the French government to take in the orcas last year but their bid was rejected in January.",
      "They were told the site they had selected in Nova Scotia was too far away and that the water there was too cold for Wikie and Keijo, who have spent their whole lives in southern France.",
      "Following Pannier-Runacher's proposal for a sanctuary in Europe, which she announced a fortnight ago in a video on Instagram, the directors of the rejected Canadian project criticised the idea of one being built in the Mediterranean.",
      "They wrote a letter to her in which they cited Dr David Perpi\u00f1\u00e1n, a diplomate at the European College of Zoological Medicine, who said: \"Wikie and Keijo's origin is Iceland. These two orcas do not belong to the ecotypes seen in the Mediterranean.\"",
      "He added: \"The possibility of building a sanctuary for them in the Mediterranean is probably the worst of the possible options.\"",
      "The directors also said, unlike the European proposal, their sanctuary was ready to begin construction as the design had already been finalised.",
      "Other animal rights groups have been more welcoming of Pannier-Runacher's announcement, saying a European sanctuary would still be better for the orcas' welfare than life in another marine zoo.",
      "Sea Shepherd, a marine conservation society, replied to the minister on Instagram saying this was a chance to achieve what the zoo industry calls \"impossible\" - the building of an ocean sanctuary where captive orcas can enjoy the rest of their lives.",
      "Pannier-Runacher said in her video she was keenly aware of the strong feelings people had about where Wikie and Keijo should be rehomed.",
      "She did not rule out sending them to Loro Parque or other marine zoos, only that she would \"oppose any transfer to a site that is not suitable for accommodating\" orcas.",
      "Last November she blocked an application by Marineland to send the killer whales to a marine zoo in Japan, citing lower animal welfare regulations in the country.",
      "The 'Year of the Sea' is currently underway in France, a government initiative to raise awareness about the importance of the ocean, and Pannier-Runacher believes the creation of a European whale sanctuary would be a fitting testament to it.",
      "\"I'm not telling you that it will work,\" she told Instagram users. \"But nothing ventured, nothing gained.\"",

    "story": [
      "Beavers will be released into the wild in England after the government approved their reintroduction.",
      "The decision follows years of trials and will see beavers make an officially approved return to waterways.",
      "Hunted to extinction in Britain four hundred years ago, beavers have in the last two decades been making a comeback.",
      "But some farmers are concerned that without proper management the large rodents could have negative impacts on food production.",
      "It's thought that about five hundred beavers already live in England, some in the wild and others in enclosures. Many more are in Scotland, where wild releases are already permitted.",
      "Conservationists call beavers \"ecosystem engineers\" because of how they redesign where they live. The dams they build slow the flow of rivers and streams and create habitats where other creatures can thrive. They've also been credited with reducing flooding further downstream.",
      "\"This is an incredibly exciting moment, a real landmark for nature recovery in England,\" Tony Juniper, the head of Natural England, told me next to a beaver dam in Devon.",
      "\"We're bringing back a missing animal that's been absent for centuries, and an animal that we know will bring huge benefits for the rest of the wildlife that is already depleted across much of England,\" he says.",
      "The beavers will be released under a licensing system overseen by Natural England.",
      "It says long term plans will need to be in place to avoid impacts on farming, food production and infrastructure.",
      "That's something the National Farmers Union say is vital. It wants culling beavers  to be an option if they prove disruptive.",
      "NFU Deputy President David Exwood said that while beavers could provide certain benefits, \"we are concerned about the negative impacts beavers can have on productive farmland, as well as the management requirements, costs and risks involved\".",
      "\"Beavers can flood and waterlog fields, feed on agricultural crops like maize, as well as damage and fell trees such as cricket bat willow.\"",
      "We met up with Tony Juniper of Natural England at the site of the pilot project for wild beaver release in England, the River Otter catchment in Devon. Beavers first appeared here more than a decade ago - it's not clear where they came from. They may have escaped from enclosures or have been illegally released, so called \"beaver bombing\".",
      "Since then the wild beavers have been allowed to stay, with their impact on the landscape and the way they interact with local farmland closely monitored.",
      "\"All of this open water is down to the beavers,\" Peter Burgess of the Devon Wildlife Trust tells me as we splash our way through the boggy land.",
      "\"They want this water because it makes them feel safe and secure. It means that they can transport their food as well.\"",
      "Along the River Otter Mr Burgess tells me the beavers have created wetlands that now host species such as great white egrets and kingfishers. Dragonfly numbers have soared as have frogs and toads. Water voles now roam the network of channels, streams, and ponds the beavers use to navigate the flood plain.",
      "Not everyone in the area is delighted by the thought of beaver dams popping up everywhere.",
      "Clinton Devon Estates manage several farms in the Devon catchment area where the trial wild beaver project has been running. Though broadly supportive of the beavers' return there are concerns about whether enough thought has been given to managing their impacts.",
      "\"We've also seen farmland flooded, we've seen properties flooded. We've seen people's trees in their gardens felled,\" says John Varley, the chief executive of Clinton Devon Estates.",
      "\"There are positives with the beaver, huge positives, but there's also some quite significant negatives, particularly for small farmers.\"",
      "Scotland is several years ahead of England and has already approved the release of beavers and it's thought there are now more than 1,500 living wild. In some areas the beavers have been so successful at breeding that they have had to be relocated or as a last resort culled.",
      "The first wild release of beavers in England is now expected to take place in the next few days. Dr Roisin Campbell-Palmer from the Beaver Trust, which is managing the release, told the BBC the male and female had been taken from \"conflict sites\" in Scotland and were now undergoing medical checks ahead of being moved south.",

      "Nearly 2,000 years after a young man died in the Vesuvius volcanic eruption, scientists have discovered that his brain was preserved when it turned to glass in an extremely hot cloud of ash.",
      "Researchers found the glass in 2020 and speculated that it was a fossilised brain but did not know how it had formed.",
      "The pea-sized chunks of black glass were found inside the skull of the victim, aged about 20, who died when the volcano erupted in 79 AD near modern-day Naples.",
      "Scientists now believe a cloud of ash as hot as 510C enveloped the brain then very quickly cooled down, transforming the organ into glass.",
      "It is the only known case of human tissue - or any organic material - turning to glass naturally.",
      "\"We believe that the very specific conditions that we have reconstructed for the vitrification [the process of something turning into glass] of the brain make it very difficult for there to be other similar remains, although it is not impossible,\" Prof Guido Giordano from Universit\u00e0 Roma Tre told BBC News.",
      "\"This is a unique finding,\" he said.",
      "The brain belonged to a man killed in his bed inside a building called the Collegium on the main street of the Roman city Herculaneum.",
      "The fragments of glass found by the scientists range from 1-2 cm to just few millimetres in size.",
      "The massive eruption of Vesuvius engulfed Herculaneum and nearby Pompeii where up to 20,000 people lived. The remains of about 1,500 people have been found.",
      "Scientists now think the hot ash cloud descended from Vesuvius first, probably causing most of the deaths.",
      "A fast-moving current of hot gas and volcanic matter, also called a pyroclastic flow, followed, burying the area.",
      "Experts believe the ash cloud turned the man's brain into glass because the pyroclastic flow would not have reached high enough temperatures or cooled quickly enough.",
      "The process of glass formation requires very specific temperature conditions and rarely occurs naturally.",
      "For a substance to turn to glass, there must be a huge temperature difference between the substance and its surrounding.",
      "Its liquid form has to cool fast enough not to crystallise when it becomes solid, and it must be at a much higher temperature than its surroundings.",
      "The team used imaging with x-rays and electron microscopy to conclude that the brain must have been heated to at least 510C before cooling rapidly.",
      "No other parts of the man's body are believed to have turned to glass.",
      "Only material containing some liquid can turn to glass, meaning that the bones could not have vitrified.",
      "Other soft tissues, like organs, were likely destroyed by the heat before they could cool down enough to turn to glass.",
      "The scientists believe the skull gave some protection to the brain.",
      "The research is published in the scientific journal - a publication where researchers report their work to other experts - Scientific Reports.",

      "BP has announced it will cut its renewable energy investments and instead focus on increasing oil and gas production.",
      "The energy giant revealed the shift in strategy on Wednesday following pressure from some investors unhappy its profits and share price have been lower than its rivals.",
      "BP said it would increase its investments in oil and gas by about 20% to $10bn (\u00a37.9bn) a year, while decreasing previously planned funding for renewables by more than $5bn (\u00a33.9bn).",
      "The move comes as rivals Shell and Norwegian company Equinor have also scaled back plans to invest in green energy and US President Donald Trump's \"drill baby drill\" comments have encouraged investment in fossil fuels.",
      "Murray Auchincloss, BP's chief executive, said the energy giant had gone \"too far, too fast\" in the transition away from fossil fuels, and that its faith in green energy was \"misplaced\".",
      "He said BP would be \"very selective\" in investing in businesses working on the energy transition to renewables going forward, with funding reduced to between $1.5bn and $2bn per year.",
      "He said this was part of a strategy \"reset\" by the company to focus on boosting returns for shareholders.",
      "Helge Lund, chair of BP, added that the new direction of the firm had \"cash flow growth\" at its heart.",
      "Shares in the company climbed before Tuesday's announcement but fell shortly after.",
      "BP is one of several firms in the energy industry to return focus on oil and gas production, which has seen an increase in profits as prices have increased following lows seen during the Covid pandemic.",
      "The firm said it plans to increase its production to between 2.3 million and 2.5 million barrels of oil per day by 2030, with hopes of \"major\" oil and gas projects starting by the end of 2027.",

      "In 2024, BP's net income fell to $8.9bn (\u00a37.2bn), down from $13.8bn the previous year.",
      "However, some other shareholders, as well as environmental groups have voiced concerns over switching focus back to fossil fuel production.",
      "Last week, a group of 48 investors called on the company to allow them a vote on any potential plans to move away from commitments to renewables.",
      "The environmental group Greenpeace UK said the latest move was \"proof that fossil fuel companies can't or won't be part of climate crisis solutions\".",

      "\"The climate change issue has not gone away, the science hasn't changed,\" he said.",

      "Challenged on the reduced commitment to investing in renewable energy, Louise Kingham, BP's senior vice president for Europe and the UK, said none of the changes announced on Tuesday would alter the UK's green energy plans, which include three wind farms and carbon capture projects.",
      "She said the shift to renewable energy sources had slowed but that BP's ambition had \"not changed\" to become a net-zero company.",
      "According to the International Energy Agency, no new fossil fuel projects are compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5C compared to pre-industrial levels,",
      "\"We just have to do this transition more smartly and more efficiently and try to get those returns for our owners because they are helping us to do that. If we don't generate the returns, we can't invest and do more,\" Ms Kingham told the Scottish Affairs committee of MPs.",
      "\"It's going to take everybody to move in concert to make this happen. It's not just the decision of one company and what it chooses to do.\"",
      "The decrease in renewables will cover biogas, biofuels and electric vehicle charging projects, while BP will look to \"capital-light partnerships\" in other green energy such as wind and solar.",
      "BP has already placed its offshore wind business in a joint venture with Japanese company Jera and is looking to find a partner to do the same with its solar business.",
      "Five years ago, BP set some of the most ambitious targets among large oil companies to cut production of oil and gas by 40% by 2030, while significantly ramping up investment in renewables.",

      "Meeting these long-term goals will mean significant changes in the years ahead. One-third of emissions cuts between now and 2040 need to come from households making low-carbon choices, the CCC says.",
      "This will mainly be through switching from petrol and diesel cars to electric vehicles and from fossil fuel boilers to heat pumps, making use of growing supplies of clean electricity. Smaller contributions will come from other choices, such as eating less meat and dairy.",
      "As the graph below shows, these changes are ambitious. But they are deliverable, argues the CCC, without people having to scrap their existing boiler or car early.",
      "Other emerging technologies, like mobile phones and internet connections, have achieved similar rates of increases previously.",
      "\"For electric vehicles, the market is already pretty much at parity with internal combustion engine vehicles, so we think just naturally that will start to be a choice people make,\" Emma Pinchbeck, chief executive of the CCC, told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "\"For heat pumps, we're saying it's different, the costs are still higher than a fossil fuel boiler and the government will need to act to help people get those technologies.",
      "\"But the rollout rate that we've looked at is similar to what happened to our neighbours in Ireland but also to much colder countries in Europe.\"",
      "Emissions cuts will be needed in other areas too, such as farming and flying, two of the hardest sectors to decarbonise.",
      "The CCC no longer directly advises against net airport expansion, which it has previously. But it warns the costs of decarbonising aviation will need to be picked up by airlines, which will probably drive up ticket prices.",
      "It says we will need to eat less meat and dairy too. In the CCC's pathway, sheep and cattle numbers fall by 27% by 2040, and the area covered by woodland rises from 13% to 16%.",
      "Cost of net zero",
      "The costs of tackling climate change have become highly politicised in recent years.",
      "The CCC estimates most of the expense will be borne by the private sector and calculates the savings from moving to more efficient technologies should outweigh costs by the early 2040s.",
      "\"We are crystal clear in this analysis, in this carbon budget, for the first time we start to see the economy making savings from this investment, and they make savings over and above what we would do if we stay dependent on fossil fuels,\" Ms Pinchbeck told BBC News.",
      "This should improve energy security and filter down to lower bills in the long term, the CCC argues, provided the government acts to make electricity cheaper.",
      "It advises removing policy costs \u2013 funding for social and environmental schemes \u2013 from electricity bills. That would cut them by about 19% based on expected 2025 prices, the CCC says, making it more cost-effective for people to switch to electric vehicles or heat pumps.",
      "These costs could instead sit on gas bills or general taxation.",
      "\"Regardless of what you think about climate change, what we are laying out today is a massive industrial revolution,\" said Ms Pinchbeck.",
      "\"It will save the economy money by 2040, it saves people money on their energy bills, it saves people money on their driving costs, but all of that is underpinned by a cheaper electricity price.\"",

    "summary": "The energy giant has announced its strategy after rivals also rowed back on green energy plans.",
    "story": [
      "BP has announced it will cut its renewable energy investments and instead focus on increasing oil and gas production.",
      "The energy giant revealed the shift in strategy on Wednesday following pressure from some investors unhappy its profits and share price have been lower than its rivals.",
      "BP said it would increase its investments in oil and gas by about 20% to $10bn (\u00a37.9bn) a year, while decreasing previously planned funding for renewables by more than $5bn (\u00a33.9bn).",
      "The move comes as rivals Shell and Norwegian company Equinor have also scaled back plans to invest in green energy and US President Donald Trump's \"drill baby drill\" comments have encouraged investment in fossil fuels.",
      "Murray Auchincloss, BP's chief executive, said the energy giant had gone \"too far, too fast\" in the transition away from fossil fuels, and that its faith in green energy was \"misplaced\".",
      "He said BP would be \"very selective\" in investing in businesses working on the energy transition to renewables going forward, with funding reduced to between $1.5bn and $2bn per year.",
      "He said this was part of a strategy \"reset\" by the company to focus on boosting returns for shareholders.",
      "Helge Lund, chair of BP, added that the new direction of the firm had \"cash flow growth\" at its heart.",
      "Shares in the company climbed before Tuesday's announcement but fell shortly after.",
      "BP is one of several firms in the energy industry to return focus on oil and gas production, which has seen an increase in profits as prices have increased following lows seen during the Covid pandemic.",
      "The firm said it plans to increase its production to between 2.3 million and 2.5 million barrels of oil per day by 2030, with hopes of \"major\" oil and gas projects starting by the end of 2027.",
      "BP shareholders want it to make money, not climate policy",
      "BP set to scale back green investments as profits drop sharply",
      "BP to cut 4,700 jobs to reduce costs",
      "'Science hasn't changed'",
      "Mr Auchincloss is under pressure to boost profits from some shareholders, including the influential activist group Elliot Management, which took a near \u00a34bn stake in the \u00a370bn company to push for more investment in oil and gas.",
      "In 2024, BP's net income fell to $8.9bn (\u00a37.2bn), down from $13.8bn the previous year.",
      "However, some other shareholders, as well as environmental groups have voiced concerns over switching focus back to fossil fuel production.",
      "Last week, a group of 48 investors called on the company to allow them a vote on any potential plans to move away from commitments to renewables.",
      "The environmental group Greenpeace UK said the latest move was \"proof that fossil fuel companies can't or won't be part of climate crisis solutions\".",
      "Alexander Kirk from Global Witness added BP \"cannot be trusted to deliver the clean energy transition\", adding that it was \"focusing on short-term profits to shareholders while energy prices are high, with the rest of the world picking up the tab from its climate-wrecking products\".",
      "Global Witness drove a lorry around central London with messages criticising BP's decision.",
      "Sir Ian Cheshire, who has held many executive roles at companies such as B&Q owner Kingfisher and Barclays bank, questioned whether BP's latest move would work.",
      "\"I do wonder whether this sort of decision will look right in 10 years,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "\"The climate change issue has not gone away, the science hasn't changed,\" he said.",
      "'Not just down to one company'",
      "Challenged on the reduced commitment to investing in renewable energy, Louise Kingham, BP's senior vice president for Europe and the UK, said none of the changes announced on Tuesday would alter the UK's green energy plans, which include three wind farms and carbon capture projects.",
      "She said the shift to renewable energy sources had slowed but that BP's ambition had \"not changed\" to become a net-zero company.",
      "According to the International Energy Agency, no new fossil fuel projects are compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5C compared to pre-industrial levels,",
      "\"We just have to do this transition more smartly and more efficiently and try to get those returns for our owners because they are helping us to do that. If we don't generate the returns, we can't invest and do more,\" Ms Kingham told the Scottish Affairs committee of MPs.",
      "\"It's going to take everybody to move in concert to make this happen. It's not just the decision of one company and what it chooses to do.\"",
      "The decrease in renewables will cover biogas, biofuels and electric vehicle charging projects, while BP will look to \"capital-light partnerships\" in other green energy such as wind and solar.",
      "BP has already placed its offshore wind business in a joint venture with Japanese company Jera and is looking to find a partner to do the same with its solar business.",
      "Five years ago, BP set some of the most ambitious targets among large oil companies to cut production of oil and gas by 40% by 2030, while significantly ramping up investment in renewables.",
      "But in 2023, the company lowered this oil and gas reduction target to 25%.",
      "In the five years since former chief executive Bernard Looney first unveiled his strategy, shareholders have received total returns including dividends of 36%.",
      "In contrast, shareholders in rivals Shell and Exxon have seen returns of 82% and 160% respectively.",
      "BP's under performance has prompted speculation that it may be a takeover target or may consider moving its main stock market listing to the US where oil and gas companies command higher valuations.",

    "summary": "The Liberal Party of Canada will soon choose a leader that will replace Justin Trudeau and become Canada's next prime minister.",
    "story": [
      "After back-to-back debates in both English and French, the candidates to replace Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as leader of the Liberal Party in Canada have made their case to voters.",
      "Card-holding Liberals will now choose between former governor of the banks of Canada and England Mark Carney, former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, House government leader Karina Gould and businessman and former MP Frank Baylis.",
      "Whoever wins the vote on 9 March will become Canada's next prime minister and will lead the Liberals in the forthcoming general election, which must be held on or before 20 October of this year.",
      "A big focus of the debates has been how Canada should respond to US President Donald Trump, who has threatened steep tariffs on America's northern neighbour and has suggested that Canada become the \"51st state.\"",
      "Here are five big takeaways from the two Liberal leadership debates.",
      "The Trump Factor",
      "How Canada should respond to what many have dubbed an \"existential threat\" from US President Donald Trump has unsurprisingly dominated the agenda at both debates.",
      "Trump has said he plans to impose a 25% tariff on all Canadian exports, with the exception of energy that would be tariffed at a lower 10% - a move that economists say would be devastating for Canada while increasing prices for Americans.",
      "He has also repeatedly proposed that the US should annex Canada, which has been met with alarm and anger from large swathes of the Canadian population.",
      "Freeland, a former top minister who served during Trump's first term, positioned herself as an experienced negotiator who has fought - and won - against the US president and his previous tariffs.",
      "But Carney warned that the Trump of today was not the Trump of the past. \"He is more isolationist. He is more aggressive,\" Carney said. \"In the past he wanted our markets. Now he wants our country.\"",
      "Gould, the youngest candidate, suggested that Canada should \"put everything on the table\" to protect its sovereignty, and that the federal government should help businesses diversify their portfolios to depend less on the US.",
      "Baylis, meanwhile, said Canada needed to forge closer economic ties with the UK, New Zealand and Australia, saying all four were like-minded countries with shared values, culture, and government systems.",
      "How Canada can fix its economy",
      "Trump's threats are made more alarming by Canada's current economic situation.",
      "Canadians have voiced frustrations over the stubborn high cost of living.",
      "Carney - an economist by trade - promised a plan that would balance Canada's operational budget in three years and proposed that Canada rethink the way it spends its money.",
      "But he has also noted his support for key Liberal programmes, like affordable childcare and dental care.",
      "As the former finance minister, Freeland defended her track record, saying the country's finances were still \"very strong\". She added that Canada should capitalise on the surge of patriotism in the face of Trump's threats, using that momentum to support Canadian industries and promote job growth.",
      "Baylis drew on his expertise as a businessman to say that Canada should work on building its productivity.",
      "Gould, on the other hand, said the Liberal Party should be \"realistic with Canadians\" and that balancing the budget in three years was not possible without significant cuts, which she did not support. She said Canada should instead focus on \"modernising its social safety net\" to help those who are struggling.",
      "\"We are facing extreme threats from the US, so we have to be able to invest in our people and in our businesses to protect them,\" Gould said.",
      "Defeating Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre",
      "The four candidates were debating with each other but they often presented a united front against their shared opponent, Conservative party leader Pierre Poilievre, whose party is favoured in the polls as the most likely to form Canada's next government.",
      "Liberal leadership hopefuls threw several jabs at Poilievre throughout the debate. Gould called him \"our little version of Trump here at home\" while Freeland said Poilievre was looking to \"imitate\" Trump.",
      "Carney criticised Poilievre as \"irresponsible\" and added that Canada could \"not afford\" to have him as prime minister.",
      "Poilievre, who has enjoyed a sizable lead in the polls ahead of an unpopular Trudeau, has had to pivot his pitch to Canadians since Trudeau's resignation.",
      "His message changed from criticising the sitting prime minister for leading a \"broken\" Canada to putting \"Canada First\" in the face of threats from the US. He has also shifted his focus to attacking Carney, who is favoured to win the Liberal leadership race.",
      "Poilievre is still polling ahead nationally, but some polls suggest that the lead between him and the Liberals has shrunk since Trudeau's exit.",
      "Supporting Ukraine and Nato",
      "Responding to shifting US policy on the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, all four candidates affirmed their commitment to continuing Canada's support for Ukraine.",
      "All of them also backed the need for Canada to hit its 2% military spending target as set out in its commitments to the Nato alliance, though they disagreed on the timeline and how to get there.",
      "Freeland said Canada should hit the target by 2027, and should do so by investing in the \"next generation of warfare\". Baylis and Carney have said their plan would be for Canada to reach that target by 2030.",
      "Both Freeland and Carney said Canada needed to invest that money into Canadian military ventures instead of into the US.",
      "Freeland noted that Canada should reduce its reliance on the US, and should look to work with the EU and other Nato partners on security assurances.",
      "A rethink of the consumer tax on carbon",
      "A tax on carbon for consumers and businesses has been the cornerstone of the Trudeau government's policy on climate change.",
      "But that tax has proven to be unpopular with Canadians, forcing Carney and Freeland to promise that they would ditch the policy.",
      "Carney, a former UN special envoy on climate action and finance, has long been a proponent of the carbon tax. In the debates, however, he acknowledged the tax on consumers had become divisive, and said he would instead focus on taxing big polluters and growing clean energy projects in Canada.",
      "Freeland, who resigned from Trudeau's government because of disagreements with the prime minister on spending, said that history would judge his climate action favourably despite his policies' unpopularity. But she, too, vowed to scrap the carbon tax.",
      "\"Democracy is about listening to people, and Canadians were very clear with us that they did not think that policy worked for them,\" she said.",
      "Gould and Baylis, on the other hand, said they would keep some version of the consumer tax on carbon in place, saying that fighting climate change comes with a price.",

    "summary": "The prototype chip it dubs Ocelot follows similar announcements by Microsoft and Google",
    "story": [
      "Amazon has become the third tech giant in as many months to announce a breakthrough in quantum computing - a technology that promises vast processing power but is beset by technical difficulties.",
      "The firm has unveiled Ocelot a prototype chip built on \"cat qubit\" technology - an approach that derives its name from the famous \"Schr\u00f6dinger's cat\" thought experiment.",
      "The chip seeks to address one of the biggest stumbling blocks to the development of quantum computers - making them error free.",
      "Amazon says, taken alongside other recent breakthroughs in the industry, its work means useful quantum computers are likely to be with us sooner than previously thought.",
      "But how quickly these machines will be powerful enough to be practically useful for a range of commercial applications is a matter of debate among experts.",
      "Oskar Painter of Amazon Web Services (AWS) Center for Quantum Computing at the California Institute of Technology, where the work was carried out, told the BBC that recent progress meant an \"aggressive date\" of a decade was now \"looking more and more realistic\".",
      "\"Five years ago I would have said maybe 20 or 30 years\", he said but added \"this timeline's come in quite a bit.\"",
      "Ultimately AWS, which provides cloud computing services, would like to offer quantum computing services to its customers, but Mr Painter also said he believed the advanced machines could eventually help optimise the vast global logistics of Amazon's retail business.",
      "\"You know, a company like Amazon, you make a one percent improvement in that and you're talking large dollars right? Quantum computers could enable you to do that more effectively, more real time - and that's the real value there,\" he explained.",
      "What is a cat qubit?",
      "Quantum computers solve problems by exploiting the strange properties of matter and energy at very small scales, as described by the science of quantum physics.",
      "Quantum computers won't replace so-called \"classical\" computers, but promise to be able to solve problems even the most powerful modern computers cannot - yielding new discoveries such as better batteries and new medicines.",
      "But that potential is being held up by the problem of errors.",
      "Quantum computers are extremely sensitive to noise in their environment - vibrations, heat, electromagnetic interference from mobile phones and WIFI networks, or even cosmic rays and radiation from outer space can all cause them to make errors, which then need to be corrected.",
      "Cat qubits are one attempt at solving this problem by engineering error resistance into the design of the qubits it uses.",
      "Qubits are the fundamental elements of quantum computers, the equivalent of bits in the computers most of us use today.",
      "Cat qubits are named in honour of Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, whose cat-in-a-box question in 1935 helped illuminate some of the thinking behind quantum theory.",
      "Amazon believes the new chip, which has just five cat qubits out of a total of 14 key components, could reduce the costs of correcting quantum errors by up to 90%, compared to current approaches.",
      "The technology of cat qubits isn't exclusive to Amazon, a French company named Alice & Bob carried out pioneering work on the tech and continues to evolve the technology.",
      "Mazyar Mirrahimi director of research at the French national technology research institute, Inria said Ocelot was \"an important step forward towards hardware-efficient fault-tolerant quantum computation\".",
      "Amazon believes the new chip offers a path to scaling up to more powerful machines with this type of error proofing built in, but researchers admit there are many challenges ahead.",
      "Michael Cuthbert director of the UK's National Quantum Computing Centre welcomed the progress Amazon had made but told the BBC it remained to be seen the effect it would have on the speed with which the industry is able to develop really useful quantum computers:",
      "\"Error correction is a vital step necessary in the long-term development of quantum computing. It is the crucial step that turns quantum computing into a practical and commercial tool we can use to solve complex problems in chemistry, materials science, medicine, logistics and energy.\"",
      "\"Part of the challenge is how to scale the revolutionary technology efficiently \u2013 mechanisms that enable error correction without huge overheads in chip size, energy consumption and systems complexity are really welcome.\"",
      "Amazon researchers have published their findings in a research paper in the scientific journal Nature",
      "Pivot point",
      "Amazon joins Microsoft and Google in announcing a new experimental chip. But is this flurry of announcements the result of clever research or clever PR? Or is it  coincidence, the tech equivalent of the saying buses always come in threes?",
      "Heather West follows the quantum computing industry as a research manager for the International Data Corporation and was briefed on the new chip by Amazon in advance of publication.",
      "She describes Amazon's results as an \"advancement\" rather than a breakthrough.",
      "All three recent announcements have focused on reducing errors, and she tells me the industry is \"pivoting\" from a focus on the number of qubits to a focus the \"ability to use these these systems at scale to solve real world life problems. And by doing so we need to be able to solve the error correction within the quantum systems\".",
      "However Mr Painter agreed \"100%\" that it wouldn't be easy to scale up today's experimental systems.",

      "Tesla has been facing stiff competition in the European market from Chinese and other manufacturers.",
      "In addition, Tesla owner Elon Musk has been making controversial political waves on both sides of the Atlantic, an analyst said.",
      "Tesla sales in January bucked European electric car sale trends, which grew by more than a third in the month, according to trade body Acea.",
      "Instead, Tesla sales across the EU, EFTA and the UK fell more than 45%, and more than 50% in the EU alone.",
      "It comes after Tesla sales fell last year for the first time in more than a decade as demand faltered and rivals gained pace.",
      "The main factor in the January sales slump was likely to be increasing competition, AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said.",
      "Chinese manufacturer BYD has been making big strides, in part because it includes as standard some features which cost extra from other makers, Mould said.",
      "However, some car buyers may also be taking a \"principled stand\" on Musk's political interventions, he said.",
      "Musk has made waves in the US with his involvement in slashing US development funds and efforts to drastically reduce US federal funding.",
      "In the UK he supports jailed far-right activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson, and repeatedly criticised Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.",
      "Musk also supports the far-right AfD party in Germany, and congratulated its leader after the party's record second-place result in elections.",
      "Too toxic?",
      "Asked if the reason for Tesla's share price slump was down to Musk being too toxic, a former senior director of the car maker's Europe, Middle East and Asia division said it was \"definitely one of the reasons for the decline\", but added there was a \"cumulative number of things that are piling up a domino effect\".",
      "\"There's no doubt his flirting with the right in politics, running around on TV with a chainsaw is not exactly helping his image,\" Peter Bardenfleth-Hansen told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "\"He may be getting a bigger fanbase within a specific type of clientele, but they're not the ones that are buying the Teslas. They're not the ones putting money in to his company. So he has a problem.\"",
      "Tesla shares got a big boost after the US election due to Musk's closeness to Donald Trump - Musk has described himself as \"first buddy\" to the US president.",
      "Investors thought this would stand his businesses in good stead.",
      "However, Trump is not a supporter of electric vehicles, and has said he will cancel efforts to boost their ownership.",
      "\"How anybody thought this was going to be good for Tesla, I don't know,\" Mould said.",
      "There is also general market skittishness about the path of interest rate cuts and concerns about Trump tariff plans that could be contributing to the fall, he added."

    "summary": "Ireland is investing billions of euros to revamp its healthcare service - will AI help?",
    "story": [
      "For a country famous as Big Tech's European address, Ireland's hospitals often lag far behind in technology.",
      "They lack shared computerised patient records, or unique identifiers to track people when they move between clinics.",
      "In July 2024, a computer system failure made Dublin's Mater hospital push back surgeries and beg people not to come to its A&E.",
      "Three years before, Russian ransomware attackers shut down the Irish health system's entire computer network, and published 520 people's medical records online.",
      "But Ireland now has ambitious goals to modernise its healthcare.",
      "That includes a programme called Sl\u00e1intecare. Announced in 2017, the plan is to use some of its \u20ac22.9bn (\u00a320bn; $24bn) budget surplus to create a healthcare service that is free at the point of care, like the UK's or Canada's.",
      "To improve healthcare, pinch points like diagnostics will have to be improved.",
      "It's a problem being tackled at Dublin's Mater hospital, 164-years-old and the location of Ireland's busiest emergency department.",
      "That's especially so in winter, when one day early this January Irish A&E departments had 444 people on trolleys waiting to be seen.",
      "\"In Ireland, the big problem we have is waiting lists, and in particular waiting for diagnostics, for MRI [magnetic resonance imaging] or CT [computed tomography] scans,\" says Prof Peter McMahon, a consultant radiologist at the Mater.",
      "Because of Prof MacMahon, who as a medical student dabbled as a hobbyist programmer, the Mater is now among the first hospitals in Ireland to use artificial intelligence (AI) across its radiology department - the part of a hospital providing medical imaging to diagnose diseases and guide treatment.",
      "To make sure patients with the most urgent needs are seen first, Prof MacMahon says: \"We use AI to immediately analyse all head scans for bleeds, all chest scans for blood clots, and all bone x-rays for fractures.\"",
      "The AI is particularly helpful in assisting younger doctors, when they don't have experienced consultants to turn to.",
      "\"Now a nurse or junior doctor at 2am isn't alone, they've got a wing man,\" he says.",
      "Rural hospitals face different kinds of challenges.",
      "Letterkenny University Hospital in Donegal is without MRI facilities at evenings and weekends.",
      "Currently, a patient urgently needing an MRI scan at night can face an ambulance ride to Dublin.",
      "But now, Prof MacMahon and the Mater's AI research fellow Paul Banahan have trained a trial AI model to create a \"synthetic MRI\" from CT scans, to immediately triage patients with suspected spinal injuries.",
      "That was done by feeding a \"generative AI\" model around 9,500 pairs of CT and MRI images of the same area on the same person.",
      "Now the AI can predict what the MRI scan would look like from the CT scan, something available in all emergency departments.",
      "And since radiology scans also come with doctors' text reports, he is also exploring using large language models to identify important disease patterns and trends.",
      "Applying AI to medical images in Ireland is easier since the country has stored scans in a central, digital filing system since 2008.",
      "But a lot of other important information, like medical notes or electrocardiograms (ECGs), remains largely in paper format in most Irish hospitals, or in smaller databases that are not shared centrally.",
      "That will \"severely delay\" applying AI to spot potential diseases and improve clinical care, points out Prof MacMahon.",
      "Ageing IT systems in Irish healthcare are more broadly a challenge.",
      "\"Quite bluntly, a lot of hospitals are dealing with legacy IT systems where they're just trying to keep the show on the road,\" says Dr Robert Ross, a senior computer science lecturer at Technological University Dublin.",
      "\"Doing anything else like integrating AI is not easy to do,\" he says.",
      "Using AI in healthcare is not without problems.",
      "An example here is AI speech-recognition tools. Using them could let doctors spend less time on note-taking and report writing.",
      "But some have been found to make things up, including to invent non-existent medication.",
      "To prevent such AI from hallucinating, \"you need to make sure it's penalised in its training, if it gives you something that doesn't exist,\" says Prof MacMahon.",
      "AIs can have biases, but \"humans have biases too\", he points out.",
      "A tired doctor, expecting a young patient to be healthy, can overlook their blood clot.",
      "\"For whatever reason we're far more open to accept human error\", than in new health technology where \"the acceptable risk is zero\", says Prof Se\u00e1n Kennelly, a consultant at Tallaght University Hospital and professor at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "This means we \"continue with the illusion of 100% accuracy in humans\", and ignore areas where AI-supported technology can make better clinical decisions, he says.",
      "Healthcare regulators, who already have a \"weak enough\" understanding of software as a medical device, haven't at all caught up with rules for AI, says Dr Aidan Boran, founder of an Irish medical tech start-up called Digital Gait Labs, and a researcher at Dublin City University.",
      "For example, getting a CE mark, which shows that a medical device meets EU safety regulations, includes providing details about the factory where the product is manufactured.",
      "But in the case of software that is not relevant says Dr Boran. \"For us, manufacturing literally means copying software,\" he points out.",
      "AI can have a black box problem: we can see what goes in them and what comes out, but the deep learning systems that power these models are so complex that even their creators do not understand exactly what happens inside them.",
      "That can create difficulties for a doctor trying to explain treatment decisions that involve AI, says Dr Paul Gilligan, head of St Patrick's Mental Health Services, one of Ireland's largest mental health providers that runs St Patrick's Hospital in Dublin.",
      "When AI influences their decisions, doctors need to \"be able to articulate the reasoning behind those decisions in a manner that is accessible and understandable to those affected,\" he says.",

      "The verdict of the spreadsheet was clear: staying in Portugal would be financially ruinous.",

      "But his take home salary was much, much less.",
      "His income placed him in a tax bracket which meant up to 40% of this gross salary went to the state.",

      "Moving to Ireland meant an immediate hike in his salary prospects, almost doubling to \u20ac60,000.",
      "The money is even better in the US, where he now earns upwards of $160,000 before a 20% income tax rate, much lower than at home.",
      "Mr Dias intends to return to Lisbon in two years' time with \"with many more savings\".",
      "Keeping skilled workers like Mr Dias in Portugal has been a concern for recent governments.",
      "In 2020, the administration led by the Socialist Party's Antonio Costa launched IRS Jovem, a programme of tax reductions for workers less than 30 years old and tiered by level of education.",
      "In 2022, 73,684 taxpayers benefitted from this incentive, according to official data.",
      "After a snap election in March, the new centre-right Portuguese government led by Luis Montenegro doubled down on the idea and expanded it from five to 10 years, and to all workers under 35 independently of their educational levels.",
      "The proposal, passed by the Portuguese parliament in late November, is due to benefit up to 400,000 workers, according to the Portuguese Ministry of Finance.",
      "But specialists say it likely won't be enough to keep the young from going abroad.",
      "\"It is unlikely that, on its own, the tax regime will make young workers remain in the country, whether because professional opportunities are more abundant in foreign countries, or due to the fact this tax benefit applies only to yearly incomes under \u20ac28,000,\" says S\u00e9rgio Vasques, professor of tax law at the Cat\u00f3lica Lisbon School of Law.",
      "He points out that the Portuguese government still takes more of the average worker's salary than most richer nations.",
      "Known as the tax wedge, the ratio between the amount of taxes paid by an average single worker without children and the corresponding total labour cost for the employer, stands at 42.3% in Portugal.",
      "That's the 8th highest among the 38 member countries of the OECD.",
      "\"This is a tax regime that is an enemy of qualified work and professional success. This regime will not solve this problem,\" adds Mr Vasques.",
      "Mr Vasques, also a former secretary of state for tax affairs in the early 2010s, adds: \"I also cannot imagine a young professional deciding to move to Portugal just because of an extra couple hundred euros at the end of the year.",

    "story": [
      "For the third week in a row, Pope Francis has been unable to deliver his traditional Angelus prayer in person, with the Vatican publishing his written comments instead.",
      "Vatican officials said the text, sent from his hospital room in Rome, had been written \"in the past few days\". In it, the Pope thanked people for their prayers and thanked his medical team for their care.",
      "\"I feel in my heart the 'blessing' that is hidden within frailty, because it is precisely in these moments that we learn even more to trust in the Lord,\" he wrote.",
      "\"At the same time, I thank God for giving me the opportunity to share in body and spirit the condition of so many sick and suffering people.\"",
      "The Pope usually makes his address from a window of the official Vatican appartments, drawing a crowd below on St Peter's Square.",
      "Many Catholics come specially for the chance to see him but this is now the longest Pope Francis has been out of the public eye since he was elected.",
      "Each evening on the square, a group of cardinals lead people in prayers for his health.",
      "In his latest written address, the Pope told Catholics that he felt their \"affection and closeness\" and felt \"carried and supported by all God's people\".",
      "The Vatican said he remained stable on Sunday, although doctors still describe his overall condition - with pneumonia - as \"complex\" and the risk of another infection is high. After 16 days in hospital, they are still giving no prognosis.",
      "The medical team has not spoken directly to journalists for over a week, and all updates are coming via Vatican officials.",
      "On Sunday, they said the Pope no longer required \"non-invasive mechanical ventilation, only high-flow oxygen therapy\".",
      "He does not have a fever and was able to participate in mass in a chapel on the 10th floor of Rome's Gemelli hospital where he is being treated.",

      "The Pope also received two visitors - Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Parolin and his deputy Monsignor Pena Parra. They are the first to be mentioned by the Vatican in almost a week.",
      "There are no details about the length of time the men spent with him or what was discussed.",
      "The latest details do suggest that the Pope has rallied somewhat since Friday, when he suffered a second breathing \"crisis\" which doctors had worried might have a lasting impact. It was the second time the word \"crisis\" had been used since he was admitted to hospital on 14 February.",
      "By Sunday, though, Vatican sources were more reassuring.",
      "\"The Pope woke, had breakfast with coffee, continued his therapy and read the newspapers as he usually does,\" they told journalists.",
      "In his Sunday Angelus, the Pope prayed for peace, including in \"tormented Ukraine, Palestine, Israel\", adding: \"From here, war appears even more absurd.\"",
      "Always outspoken against war, some of the Pope's previous comments on Ukraine have nevertheless created controversy.",
      "He suggested that Russia's full-scale invasion was \"somehow provoked\" and on one occasion agreed that Kyiv should show \"the courage of the white flag\" and negotiate for peace."

    "story": [
      "\"He loved being an actor, and hated all the stuff that surrounds being an actor.\"",
      "That, for film director Barry Sonnenfeld, is how he'll remember Gene Hackman, who has died at the age of 95.",
      "The endless hours in hair and makeup, repeated takes, and studio notes all frustrated Hackman, Sonnenfeld told BBC News.",
      "So too did actors who showed up not knowing their lines - notably John Travolta, who Hackman clashed with on the set of 1995 film Get Shorty, which Sonnenfeld directed.",
      "In the days since the news of Hackman's death, I've been speaking to people here in Los Angeles and beyond, who, like Sonnenfeld, knew and worked with him.",
      "What's immediately clear is how seriously Hackman took acting, and how meticulously he dealt with scripts.",
      "But what's also clear is that he was wary of the trappings of Hollywood.",
      "What we know about the death of Gene Hackman",
      "What we know about the death of Gene Hackman",
      "Hackman, a two-time Oscar winner, died alongside his wife Betsy Arakawa, 65, and their dog at his home in New Mexico. No cause of death was given, but police said the situation was \"suspicious enough\" to merit investigation.",
      "Officials said on Friday that evidence points to Hackman having been dead since 17 February, 10 days before the couples' bodies were found.",
      "'He put the fear of God into me'",
      "In LA, Hackman's face is everywhere on television bulletins and on newspapers.",
      "His death was all anyone was talking about as stars gathered for pre-Oscars parties.",
      "I was at one of those events on Thursday night, where the American actor John C Reilly told me that he expected the Academy to commemorate Hackman on Sunday. \"I don't see how you could have the Oscars without mentioning a great like him who's passed.\"",
      "For Sonnenfeld and for the Irish director John Moore \u2013 who directed Hackman in 2001's Behind Enemy Lines \u2013 it was Hackman's way of dealing with scripts that demonstrated his brilliance. He would remove all of the scriptwriter's notes about how his character should deliver his lines.",
      "\"Because he didn't want any screenwriter to tell him how he was supposed to feel at that moment,\" Sonnenfeld said.",
      "\"So he had unique cut and pasted scripts that had no information from the writer about anything, because he wanted to make those choices, not the writer.\"",
      "Moore recalls a similar incident from the very first time he filmed with Hackman.",
      "\"He was just quietly sitting there, taking script pages out, cutting them up, removing extraneous stuff like scene descriptions, and then sticking them back onto blank pages,\" he said.",
      "He said Hackman told him: \"Acting is my job, you do the rest.\"",
      "\"It put the fear of God into me,\" Moore said, laughing.",
      "\"It was essentially him saying: 'I don't need anything, as I'm that good. You better bring your A-game, as I'm bringing mine.'\"",
      "It wasn't just superfluous studio notes that bothered Hackman.",
      "\"He had this conflict in that he was this brilliant actor but he hated the tropes of what it took to act in movies,\" said Sonnenfeld.",
      "\"[He] hated putting on makeup. The putting on of wardrobe. The wardrobe person after takes, taking their lip brush and rubbing down their wardrobe. The makeup person recombing his hair while he's talking to me,\" he said.",
      "\"All that sort of fussy hair and makeup and all that stuff, I think that drove him crazy.\"",
      "Nor did he often want to socialise after filming, said Moore.",
      "\"I'd try and have a drink with him after we'd shoot, and go up to the minibar,\" he said.",
      "\"He'd have one, that was it. [Betsy] would give him that look, and off it would be to bed. And he was in great shape in the morning as a result.\"",
      "\"For Gene, it was all about the acting,\" added Sonnenfeld. \"End of story. Get me out of here as fast as possible.\"",
      "Showdown with John Travolta",
      "Hackman could be \"a hard actor\" to work with, said Sonnenfeld. \"He suffered no fools.\"",
      "In Get Shorty, Hackman starred alongside Travolta, who plays a Miami mobster sent to collect a debt.",
      "\"Gene was a consummate actor, both technically and artistically. So he came to set every day knowing his lines,\" Sonnenfeld said.",
      "\"John came to set not knowing his lines, probably not having read the script the night before.\"",

      "Hackman responded: \"Nothing except learn the lines,\" to which Travolta replied, \"Well that's a waste of a weekend,\" according to Sonnenfeld.",
      "As filming went on, Hackman grew \"angrier and angrier\" at his co-star not knowing his lines.",
      "Sonnenfeld said he let Hackman take out his rage on him.",
      "\"For the next 12 weeks, he would yell at me whenever John didn't know his lines,\" he said.",
      "\"But he's great in a movie. And I knew he was never really mad at me.\"",
      "Travolta reportedly wasn't the only one to rub Hackman the wrong way.",
      "He reportedly clashed with others, including The Royal Tenenbaums' director Wes Anderson.",
      "Later, and possibly coincidentally, Hackman named one of his novels Escape from Andersonville.",
      "\"Gene was really rough on Wes,\" recalled Bill Murray, who co-starred with Hackman in the hit 2001 film, in an interview with the Associated Press.",
      "\"He was a tough nut, Gene Hackman. But he was really good.\"",
      "Moore, for his part, said he didn't ever feel Hackman was difficult to work with.",
      "\"He was patient and relentlessly, flawlessly professional,\" he said.",
      "\"My memories are of him laughing and smiling, and telling very funny jokes.\"",
      "Moore admitted Hackman might have become irritated with anyone on set who made their role bigger than it was.",
      "\"So I could see how he might be funny about actors who were peacocking themselves,\" he said.",
      "\"But again it goes back to the point - he just really wanted to make the films exceptional.\"",
      "Hackman retired from acting in 2004 and from then on lived a quiet life in New Mexico with his wife.",
      "\"I suspect that one of the reasons he moved to Santa Fe, again, great outdoors and as far away from Hollywood as you can get,\" said Sonnenfeld.",
      "In 2008, Hackman gave a rare interview with Reuters, in which he was asked if he missed acting.",
      "He responded by saying the business was, for him, \"very stressful\".",
      "\"The compromises that you have to make in films are just part of the beast, and it had gotten to a point where I just didn't feel like I wanted to do it anymore.\"",
      "But, he added: \"I miss the actual acting part of it, as it's what I did for almost 60 years.",
      "\"And I really loved that.\"",

      "A plane crash in South Korea last December left Park Geun-woo an orphan. The 22-year-old had barely found space to mourn his parents when he came across a torrent of online abuse, conspiracies and malicious jokes made about the victims.",
      "The Jeju Air plane, which was returning from Bangkok, Thailand, crash-landed at Muan International Airport on 29 December and exploded after slamming into a concrete barrier at the end of the runway, killing 179 of the 181 people on board.",
      "Police investigations have identified and apprehended eight people who have been accused of making derogatory and defamatory online posts. These included suggestions that families were \"thrilled\" to receive compensation from authorities, or that they were \"fake victims\" - to the extent that some felt compelled to prove they had lost their loved ones.",
      "Authorities have taken down at least 427 such posts.",
      "But this is not the first time that bereaved families in South Korea have found themselves the targets of online abuse. Speaking to the BBC, experts described a culture where economic struggles, financial envy and social issues such as toxic competitiveness are fuelling hate speech.",
      "Financial resentment",
      "Following Seoul's Halloween crowd crush in 2022, victims and bereaved families were similarly smeared. A man who lost his son in the incident had his photo doctored by hate groups - showing him laughing after receiving compensation.",
      "People whose loved ones died in the Sewol ferry sinking in 2014 - a maritime disaster that saw 304 people killed, mostly schoolchildren - have also for years been the targets of hate speech.",
      "The tragedy saw the government pay out an average of 420 million won ($292,840; \u00a3231,686) per victim - triggering comments that claimed this figure was unreasonably high.",
      "\"People who are living day by day feel the compensation is overrated and say the bereaved are getting 'unfair treatment' and that they are making a big deal when everyone's life is hard,\" Koo Jeong-woo, a sociology professor at Sungkyunkwan University, told news site The Korea Herald.",
      "In later comments to the BBC, Prof Koo suggested that economic stress and a competitive job market - particularly in the wake of Covid - has left many people feeling socially isolated, exacerbating the issue of hate speech.",
      "Many South Koreans, he says, now \"view others not as their peers, but as adversaries\", pointing to a widespread culture of comparison in South Korea.",
      "\"We tend to compare a lot... if you put someone else down, it's easier to feel superior yourself,\" he told the BBC. \"That's why there's a bit of tendency in Korea to engage in hate speech or make derogatory remarks, aiming to diminish others to elevate oneself.\"",
      "Mr Park says the families of the Jeju Air crash victims have been characterised as \"parasites squandering the nation's money\".",
      "By way of example, he refers to a recent article about an emergency relief fund of three million won ($2,055; \u00a31,632) that was raised for the bereaved through donations. That article was met with a flood of malicious comments, many referencing the erroneous suggestion that taxpayers' money was used for the fund.",
      "\"It seems like the families of the Muan Airport victims have hit the jackpot. They must be secretly delighted,\" said one such comment.",
      "Mr Park says these comments were \"overwhelming\".",
      "\"Even if compensation for the accident comes in, how could we possibly feel like recklessly spending it when it is the price of our loved ones' lives?\" he says. \"Every single one of those comments cuts us deeply. We're not here to make money.\"",

      "\"We feel hatred when we [think we] are getting the short end of the stick.\"",
      "'Taking advantage of others' pain'",
      "In the case of the Jeju Air crash, political dynamics only made things worse.",
      "The accident came amid a period of political turmoil in South Korea, with the country reeling from suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol's shock decision to enact martial law - an incident that politically divided the country.",
      "Many supporters of President Yoon's right-wing People Power Party have, without evidence, pinned blame for the crash on the main opposition Democratic Party (DP), pointing to the fact that Muan Airport was originally built as part of a political pledge by the DP.",
      "\"The Muan airport tragedy is a man-made disaster caused by the DP,\" read one comment on YouTube. Another described it as \"100% the fault\" of the party.",
      "Park Han-shin, whose brother died in the plane crash, says he has been accused of being a DP member and \"fake bereaved family member\". So extensive were these claims that his daughter took to social media to call them out.",
      "\"It pains me deeply to see my father, who lost his brother in such a tragedy, being labelled a 'scammer'. It also makes me worried that this misinformation might lead my father to make wrong choices out of despair,\" she wrote on Threads two days after the incident.",
      "Park Han-shin says he is stunned by how people seem to \"enjoy taking advantage of others' pain\".",
      "\"That's simply not something a human being should do,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"I am just an ordinary citizen. I am not here to enter politics. I came to find out the truth about my younger brother's death.\"",

      "The contrast with Trump's first VP, the much more mild-mannered Mike Pence, could not be greater.",
      "But Vance - who is widely seen as serving to articulate the rationale behind Trump's foreign policy gut instincts - has long been outspokenly sceptical of US aid to Ukraine.",
      "When he was running for the Ohio Senate in 2022, Vance told a podcast: \"I've got to be honest with you. I don't really care what happens to Ukraine one way or the other.\"",

      "It began at the Munich Security Conference last month, a regular port of call for a US vice-president. Kamala Harris would frequently make unmemorable speeches there.",
      "But Vance used the occasion to launch a blistering assault on the state of European democracy, accusing continental leaders of censoring free speech and failing to control immigration.",

      "The audience of politicians, generals and diplomats was horrified.",
      "This was not the usual - and now widely accepted - argument that Europe should do more to pay for its own defence and security.",
      "This was a full-blown ideological assault - a sign that the US under Mr Trump is not just pivoting away from Europe, shifting its security focus to China, but is also seeking to promote its own Trump-style populism on the European continent.",
      "Not for nothing did Vance have dinner after his speech with the leadership of Germany's far-right AfD party.",
      "His speech provoked a backlash from European leaders, writers and academics.",
      "Yet Vance chose to take them on online, engaging in detailed exchanges on X with several, including the historian, Niall Ferguson.",
      "Vance accused him of \"moralistic garbage\", \"historical illiteracy\" and - worst of all - of being a \"globalist\".",
      "And if that was not enough, Vance even chose to have a go at the UK prime minister in the Oval Office himself earlier this week.",

      "The prime minister pushed back firmly, saying \"in relation to free speech in the UK, I'm very proud of our history there\u2026 We've had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom and it will last for a very, very long time\".",
      "This was an echo of the criticism Vance made in Munich, railing against European regulations on artificial intelligence and social media platforms.",
      "The aim is to tackle disinformation and hate speech that can foment unrest and radicalise people. Vance sees it as a threat to political fellow travellers and US commercial interests, especially in big tech.",
      "Several questions present themselves. Was Vance's attack on Zelensky premeditated, as some diplomats believe?",

      "Is Vance's new role emerging at Trump's behest, sharing the load with Elon Musk to dish out punishment to the president's opponents?",
      "Or is Vance freelancing, already sketching out a role that will form the basis of an election campaign in three years' time when Trump will not be able to stand again?",
      "Whatever the answers to those questions, Vance is emerging as more than just Trump's number two."

    "summary": "Former surgeon Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec is accused of abusing hundreds of patients, most of them children, including Mauricette Vinet's grandson",
    "story": [
      "This story contains distressing details from the start",
      "When Mauricette Vinet speaks of her grandson, her voice grows warm with affection.",
      "\"He was a lovely little boy. He had a strong personality, for sure! But he always thought of others, always asked if he could help,\" says the French retiree, in her 80s.",
      "\"He loved to be out in the garden with his grandfather, picking green beans. He was a charming boy, Mathis,\" she adds.",
      "\"But, as you know, there was a 'before' - and there was an 'after'.\"",
      "Mauricette and her husband Roland are among the 267 plaintiffs who have pressed charges against Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec, the French former surgeon who is accused of abusing almost 300 people - mostly children, and almost all his patients - over the course of several decades. The trial started in Vannes, Brittany, on Monday.",
      "Le Scouarnec and Mathis only crossed paths once, when Mathis, aged 10, was hospitalised overnight at the clinic in the small French north-western town of Quimperl\u00e9. Le Scouarnec - a mild-mannered, respected gastroenterologist - told Mathis' parents the boy had to be kept overnight for checks.",
      "It turned out Mathis only had a stomach ache, and he was sent home the next day. But Mauricette is convinced the brief hospital stay changed Mathis forever.",
      "\"The unease set in, little by little. It happened gradually in the first year; then he stopped being happy and became aggressive with everyone,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "There is no way to establish conclusively whether Mathis' troubles were linked to the surgeon. What is certain is that in his teenage years Mathis distanced himself from his family and started using increasingly hard drugs; later, he spent time in detox and rehab centres.",
      "Then, in 2018, police knocked on his door.",
      "They told him a man named Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec had been arrested the year before for raping his six-year-old neighbour. During a search of the surgeon's home, police uncovered stacks of diaries and hard disks in which Le Scouarnec appeared to list hundreds more victims. Mathis' name was among them.",
      "Mauricette said Mathis told her police then read out an excerpt of the diary to him, which seemed to detail abuse Le Scouarnec's inflicted on him during his hospital stay.",
      "\"Then they left. Mathis shut the door and was left on his own, with no help. And that was the beginning of a descent into hell,\" Mauricette says.",
      "The police visit helped Mathis make sense of flashbacks that had long plagued him, Mauricette says: \"His malaise finally made sense; he traced it to the source.\"",
      "Mathis pressed charges against Le Scouarnec, but the revelations sent him down a spiral which came to an abrupt end on 14 April 2021, when Mathis overdosed and died. He was 24.",
      "Mauricette and her husband pressed charges the very next day, and they are now listed as \"indirect victims\" of Le Scouarnec. They have attended court in Vannes, north-western France, every day since the trial opened on Monday.",
      "It has not been an easy listen.",
      "The testimony of witnesses - mostly close relatives of Le Scouarnec, now 74 \u2013 painted a picture of an apparently ordinary middle-class family which, behind the scenes, has been ravaged by child abuse, incest and sexual violence.",
      "Annie, Le Scouarnec's sister, said she had been \"taught to keep quiet\".",
      "This week, it was all brought out in the open.",
      "All three sons of Le Scouarnec struck an almost apologetic tone as they told the court about their happy childhoods with a cultured, intellectual father who may not have been particularly present but who was kind, patient and supportive.",
      "\"We had holidays, nice houses - everything that constitutes a normal family,\" said one.",
      "The youngest son \u2013 who said he stopped contact with Le Scouarnec in 2017 \"to preserve the image of him I have from my childhood\" \u2013 said he now \"looked upon everyone with distrust\" and never left his own toddler alone with anybody.",
      "\"I am always worried that if my father could do this then my neighbour could, my partner, anyone,\" the 37-year-old said.",
      "Later the middle son \u2013 a tall man in his early 40s who admitted he was a \"not totally abstinent alcoholic\" \u2013 shared his memories of being abused at the hands of his paternal grandfather, Le Scouarnec's father.",
      "He was shocked as he was told for the first time in court that among his father's alleged victims were some of his childhood friends.",
      "And, on Friday, a stunned silence descended upon the courtroom as Le Scouarnec admitted he had abused his granddaughter - his eldest son's daughter when she was under five years old. Moments after the revelation, the 44-year-old and his partner left the room to be assisted by a psychologist.",
      "Other witnesses sparked consternation in the plaintiffs. Due to their sheer number, they sit in a separate room \u2013 a former university lecture hall \u2013 and follow proceedings via video link.",
      "Christian D., a friend of Le Scouarnec now aged 80, often answered questions from the court sarcastically and repeatedly minimised the events at the centre of the trial, declaring that he could not \"afford to cry over everything that happened in the world\".",
      "Later, he insisted that he \"never saw anything, therefore had nothing to say\" about the devastating allegations against his friend. When he stated that he would take in Le Scouarnec if he was ever to leave jail, many alleged victims in the lecture hall got up and left their seats.",
      "But most difficult for Mauricette and Roland was the much-awaited testimony of Marie-France L., Le Scouarnec's ex-wife.",
      "It has been alleged that she was at the centre of the omerta that reigned in the Le Scouarnec family, as she was repeatedly made aware of her husband's obsession with children but did nothing to stop it.",
      "Many lawyers and plaintiffs now believe she could have spared hundreds of children from being abused. Le Scouarnec's brother - who was also heard this week - openly wondered whether she had been too enamoured by the lifestyle provided by her husband's salary to speak out.",
      "Marie-France has always denied this and, at the stand, was frequently defiant in the face of the accusations levelled at her.",
      "\"Catastrophe has struck: she knows I am a paedophile,\" Le Scouarnec wrote as early as the mid-1990s in his diary. \"Perhaps he was talking about his conscience,\" Marie-France told the court.",
      "She also suggested her five-year-old niece \u2013 who Le Scouarnec has been convicted of raping \u2013 had most likely \"manipulated\" her husband.",
      "\"She's devious, that one. She loves the attention,\" she said. Later, she complained that she was being \"blamed\" for everything. Only when she was shown an indecent photo montage Le Scouarnec made of their son as a child did she look visibly shocked.",
      "\"That was absolute theatre,\" Mauricette told the BBC, adding that Christian D.'s testimony had been \"vile\" and that she thought Marie-France was living in \"pure denial\".",
      "As the gut-wrenching events played out, Le Scouarnec sat in his box \u2013 mostly reactionless, but at times noticeably agitated, his voice cracking as he asked his sons for forgiveness. He flinched when excerpts of his diary were read out, and averted his eyes as indecent photographs he took of his nieces were shown.",
      "His lawyers have said he admits to the \"majority\" of the charges against him, and that he will explain himself over the course of the trial, which is due to last until June.",
      "The alleged victims will take the stand from next week; Mauricette and Roland will do so in April. \"I will look at Le Scouarnec and tell him what is deep in my heart - he killed my grandson,\" Mauricette says.",
      "\"Not with a gun, but he killed him,\" she adds. \"He's going to get 20 years, but his victims... will have to live with this their whole lives.",
      "\"Their sentences will be longer than his.\"",
      "Throughout the week, over in the victims' hall, people came and went, but the majority stayed for hours on end each day.",
      "As descriptions of trauma and abuse poured in, one middle-aged woman covered her face with her hand and kept it there a long time.",
      "Next to her, a young man rubbed his eyes repeatedly, then stood up and left.",

    "summary": "Scandal surrounds King Misuzulu's attempts to take a third wife - and to divorce his first one.",
    "story": [
      "The love life of South Africa's Zulu king has the country agog - and has scandalised his socially conservative subjects as he messes with tradition by seeking a divorce.",
      "Polygamy is part of Zulu culture, but King Misuzulu kaZwelithini has taken the unusual step of going to court to divorce his first wife, Queen Ntokozo kaMayisela.",
      "\"Everyone was puzzled. People were not expecting the king to go so far as to file for divorce,\" Prof Gugu Mazibuko, a cultural expert at South Africa's University of Johannesburg, told the BBC.",
      "\"In Zulu culture, there is no divorce. You are not supposed to chase away your wife,\" she said.",
      "Regarded as the \"lion of the nation\", the Zulu king is the custodian of age-old traditions that place marriage and polygamy at the heart of royal success.",
      "His role within South Africa may only be ceremonial, but he remains hugely influential, with a yearly government-funded budget of several million dollars.",
      "The monarch - who grew up in neighbouring Eswatini, studied in the US and came to the throne in 2021 - seems to court controversy.",
      "His coronation was challenged in court by his elder half-brother, who has been trying to snatch the crown from him.",
      "His second marriage appears to be shaky, his attempt to take a third wife hit the buffers and there are also reports of another dalliance with a young princess.",
      "However, the 50-year-old's troubled personal life used to be discussed in hushed tones - that is until he filed divorce papers in December.",
      "Prof Mazibuko acknowledged that historical records appeared to suggest that a Zulu monarch in the 20th Century had divorced one of his queens, but it had been a \"top royal secret\", given royal divorce is not the norm.",
      "\"If a marriage does not work out, the wife will still live in the king's homestead. She will be given her own space. She will not have a relationship with the king, but she and her children will be well-cared for.\"",
      "It was just before his accession to the throne - following the sudden death of his father and mother four years ago - that the then-Prince Misuzulu married Ntokozo Mayisela.",
      "The two were already a couple and had two children together, but according to another cultural expert, Prof Musa Xulu of the University of Zululand, the decision to marry appeared be be hurried.",
      "\"It seems as though he felt he could not be a king without a wife,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Queen kaMayisela came from an \"ordinary family\" - as many of the wives of Zulu kings do - in a small mining town in KwaZulu-Natal province.",
      "It was as a cabaret singer performing at a restaurant in the coastal city of Durban that she caught the royal eye, the academic said.",
      "Her senior status in the family was made clear at the king's state coronation in December 2022 when she sat by his side.",
      "But her position is now under threat, with the monarch saying in court papers that they have not lived as husband and wife for at least year and their marriage has irretrievably broken down.",
      "The palace followed this by sending out invitations for the king's wedding to a new bride, Nomzamo Myeni, set to take place in late January. The bride-price, known as lobola, had already been paid in cattle - a prized asset in Zulu culture.",
      "Queen kaMayisela did not take any of this lying down, instituting separate court action to halt the wedding, which was postponed as a result.",
      "Her argument was that the king - known to his subjects as \"Ingonyama\", meaning Lion - would be committing the offence of \"bigamy\" without first \"converting\" his civil marriage to her into a traditional Zulu marriage.",
      "But the judge threw out her case, saying she had had a \"turnaround\" in attitude as she had already agreed her husband could take other wives.",
      "He noted the monarch had already done so - marrying Nozizwe kaMulela, the MD of Eswatini Bank, in 2022.",
      "Prof Mazibuko explained that polygamy was not initially part of Zulu culture, in fact the first two kings were bachelors.",
      "But it was embraced by their successors - King Misuzulu is the ninth monarch of the Zulu nation - and has become part of Zulu culture.",
      "\"That's how we build families, especially the royal family,\" Prof Mazibuko said.",
      "Queen kaMulela comes from an influential family in Eswatini and the marriage was apparently arranged to strengthen the ties between the royal families.",
      "Yet it is unclear whether the pair are still in a relationship, as the high-powered banker has not been spotted at Zulu cultural events for a while - with speculation   their final marriage rituals have not been completed.",
      "The current king's various marriage problems seem to stem from the fact that tradition has not been properly followed.",
      "In the case of the first wife, he opted for a modern-day marriage, without a traditional wedding.",
      "\"For a marriage to be perfected under Zulu custom, there has to be a public gathering, with song and dance,\" Prof Xulu said.",
      "\"You, as the bride, must lead with a solo song and the bride-maids dance with you, and you carry a spear which you give to the king - and then there is no going back.\"",
      "This has left Queen kaMayisela without the protection of tradition - and only the offer of monthly maintenance of $1,100 (\u00a3850) for a year, though she was likely to demand more before returning to the life of a commoner, Prof Xulu said.",
      "In the case of the second wife, the academic said lobola had been paid in January 2022, but royal insiders suggest the king felt \"those who went to pay didn't have the authority to do so\" - plus this union has not been marked with a public ceremony.",
      "The fortunes of the would-be third wife, Nomzamo Myeni, remain unclear as the king failed to marry her in January despite the court giving the go-ahead.",
      "Prof Xulu said that in Zulu culture a \"postponed\" marriage usually never takes place.",
      "Though Ms Myeni is still being seen with the king, accompanying him to a state event last week where she was referred to as a queen, suggesting their wedding may take place once the king's divorce goes through.",
      "Yet as a commoner she would bring no powerful connections with her, which may be why one of the monarch's aides recently confirmed to local media there was \"a new queen-to-be\" - Sihle Mdluli, who hails from the royal family of a small ethnic group in South Africa.",
      "The aide suggested she might be named \"the mother of the nation\" - a title that would make her the most senior queen with her children likely heirs.",
      "But Prof Xulu said he would not be surprised if that wedding also failed to take place, as the king's relationships all seemed to run into trouble.",
      "\"I am not sure whether he was ready to be king, and whether he has good advisers,\" the academic said.",
      "He pointed out that the monarch had also been behaving erratically in his public life, sacking several senior officials in his retinue.",
      "On top of this, he has installed himself as the chairman of the board of a financially lucrative land trust, of which he is the sole trustee.",
      "The trust was controversially established shortly before South Africa became a democracy in 1994, giving it control of about 2.8 million hectares (seven million acres) of land in KwaZulu-Natal.",
      "King Misuzulu has also suspended all members of the board, bar one, accusing them of being uncooperative.",
      "He did this against the advice of the government, which pointed out that as chairman he would be required to account to parliament about the trust's operations - something that would not be in keeping with his status as a constitutional monarch.",
      "The dispute remains unresolved, giving the government a major political headache as it tries to avoid going head-to-head with the king.",
      "Prof Xulu said he would not be surprised if at some point a powerful rival faction within the royal family launched a fresh bid to dethrone him by asking the courts to rule that he is not \"fit and proper\" to be king.",
      "The monarch's half-brother, Prince Simakade Zulu, who is the late king's eldest son, has long coveted the crown, but his backers were outmanoeuvred by Misuzulu's allies in succession discussions.",
      "President Ramaphosa later gave Misuzulu a \"certificate of recognition\", paving the way for him to be funded by the government.",
      "But Prince Simakade's supporters did not give up - going to the High Court to declare his state coronation \"unlawful\" - and won.",
      "The court ruled that President Ramaphosa had failed to comply with the law, which required him to order an investigation into objections to Misuzulu's accession.",
      "The status quo remains, pending the outcome of an appeal.",
      "The scandals have the potential to weaken the king's position should it come to another tussle for the crown.",
      "Though Prof Mazibuko noted there had always been fierce competition for the Zulu crown - except these days it takes place in court instead of a bloody battlefield.",
      "\"He is not the first king to go through a lot,\" she said. \"I hope he survives, and everything settles down.\"",

    "summary": "Donald Trump has promised to \"terminate\" diversity programmes. But a rebrand might yet save them.",
    "story": [
      "In Union County, South Carolina, the sprawling cotton mills that once put bread on the table for many are long gone. Union is also what is termed a \"food desert\", where many residents live far from the nearest supermarket. So in 2016, local non-profit director Elise Ashby began working with farmers to deliver discounted boxes of farm-fresh produce across the county, where 30% of the population is black and roughly 25% live in poverty.",
      "To fund this, Ms Ashby first relied on her own savings and then some small-scale grants. But in 2023, the Walmart Foundation - the philanthropic arm of one of America's largest corporations - awarded her over $100,000 (\u00a380,000), as part of a $1.5m programme to fund \"community-based non-profits led by people of colour\".",
      "\"I cried a little bit,\" she says. \"It was just one of those times where, like, somebody actually sees what you're doing.\"",
      "Two years ago, this was the kind of programme that attracted sponsorship from major companies across America, as the country grappled with racism past and present following the murder of George Floyd, a black man suffocated under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer during an arrest in 2020.",
      "But now, those same companies are pulling back. Walmart announced in November that it was ending some of its diversity initiatives, including plans to close its Center for Racial Equity, which supported Ms Ashby's grant.",
      "Corporations from Meta and Google to Goldman Sachs and McDonald's have all announced similar changes as part of a larger retreat from diversity, equity and inclusion programmes (DEI) across the corporate landscape.",
      "The moment represents a stark cultural shift, fuelled in part by fears of lawsuits, investigations, and social media backlash, as well as relentless pressure from the new president of the United States.",
      "Since assuming office in January, Donald Trump has aggressively sought to \"terminate DEI\" and \"restore merit-based opportunity\" in the US. He has directed the federal government to end its DEI programmes and investigate private companies and academic institutions thought to be engaged in \"illegal DEI\".",
      "In the early days of his second term, the Veterans Affairs department has closed its DEI offices, the Environmental Protection Agency has placed nearly 200 employees who worked in its civil rights office on paid leave and Trump has fired the top military general, a black man whom his defence secretary had previously said should be fired because of his involvement in \"woke\" DEI.",
      "At first sight, it may appear that the US's experiment with policies designed to improve outcomes for specific racial and identity-based groups is finished. But some experts suggest there's another possibility, that some such efforts will continue - but in a different guise, one more suited to the political mood of a country that has just elected a president who has pledged a war on \"woke\".",
      "The making of a backlash",
      "Programmes resembling DEI first emerged in earnest in the US in the 1960s, in the wake of the civil rights movement that fought to protect and expand the rights of black Americans.",
      "Under names like \"affirmative action\" and \"equal opportunity\", initially their aim was to reverse the damaging effects of centuries of enslavement of African Americans and decades of discrimination under \"Jim Crow\" laws that enforced racial segregation.",
      "As the movement evolved, promoting the rights of women, the LGBT community, and other racial and ethnic groups, use of the terms \"diversity\", \"equity\" and \"inclusion\" became more widespread.",
      "DEI programmes in the corporate world and government agencies have often focused on hiring practices and policies emphasising diversity as a commercial benefit. Their supporters say they aim to address disparities affecting people from a range of backgrounds, though a significant emphasis tends to be on race.",
      "The programmes saw a huge upswing in 2020 during the social unrest of the Black Lives Matter movement. For example, Walmart committed $100m over five years to its racial equity centre. Wells Fargo appointed its first chief diversity officer; Google and Nike already had theirs in place. After adjusting their hiring practices, companies listed on the S&P 100 added more than 300,000 jobs \u2013 94% of which went to people of colour, according to Bloomberg.",
      "But almost as quickly as the pendulum swung left, a conservative backlash began. For Stefan Padfield, executive director of conservative think-tank the National Center for Public Policy Research, DEI programmes are based on a premise that \"divides people on the basis of race and sex\".",
      "More recently, these arguments that programmes intended to combat discrimination were themselves discriminatory, particularly against white Americans, have been made with increasing force. Training sessions emphasising concepts like \"white privilege\" and racial bias have drawn particular scrutiny.",
      "The roots of this opposition took hold in conservative opposition to critical race theory (CRT), an academic concept which argues racism is endemic to American society. Over time, the campaign to remove books from classrooms that allegedly indoctrinated students into CRT thinking evolved into one focused on \"punishing woke corporations\".",
      "Social media accounts like End Wokeness and conservative activists such as Robby Starbuck seized the moment to target companies accused of being \"woke\". Mr Starbuck has taken credit for changes in policy at the likes of Ford, John Deere and Harley-Davidson after he publicised details of their DEI initiatives to his social media followers.",
      "One of the clearest signs of this movement's strength came in spring 2023, after a Bud Light partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney sparked right-wing outrage and calls for a boycott of the beer and its parent company Anheuser-Busch. In the aftermath of the campaign, Bud Light sales were 28% lower than usual, a Harvard Business Review analysis found.",
      "Another major victory for conservatives arrived in June 2023, when the Supreme Court ruled that race could no longer be considered as a factor in university admissions, reversing decades of affirmative action-based policy.",
      "The ruling also cast the legal standing of corporate DEI policies into uncertainty. When Meta made the internal announcement it was cancelling DEI programmes, the company told staff \"the legal and policy landscape\" surrounding DEI had changed.",
      "Business under pressure",
      "The speed at which some large corporations have shed their DEI policies raises the question of how genuine their commitment to diversifying their workforces was in the first place.",
      "Martin Whittaker, chief executive at JUST Capital, a non-profit that surveys Americans on workplace issues, says much of the backtracking comes from companies who were \"rushing to kind of look good\" at the height of the Black Lives Matter movement.",
      "But not all are yielding to political and legal pressure. Conservative think-tank the Heritage Foundation noted in a November report that although DEI programmes appear to be trending downwards, \"nearly all\" Fortune 500 companies still list DEI commitments somewhere on their websites. Apple shareholders recently voted to continue diversity programmes at the company.",
      "Surveys that measure Americans' support for DEI offer mixed results. JUST Capital's survey suggests support for DEI has declined, but support for issues closely linked to it - such as fair pay - have not. A 2023 survey from the Pew Research Center suggested most employed adults (56%) believed \"focusing on increasing DEI at work is a good thing\".",
      "So does it actually work?",
      "Much rests on the question of whether DEI is actually effective in the first place.",
      "Some research has suggested that DEI programmes like diversity training can in fact be harmful. According to one study by researchers from Harvard University and the University of Tel Aviv, trainers commonly report hostility and resistance from employees who feel forced to do the training and threatened by what they see as reverse discrimination; it also says the programmes can often leave trainees feeling more hostility towards other groups.",
      "This research has been seized on by DEI's opponents as part of the evidence that \"the best way to improve the lives of all our citizens, and all our neighbours, is to allow the free market to lift all the boats\", as Mr Padfield puts it.",

      "Google joins firms dropping diversity recruitment goals",
      "Meta and Amazon scale back diversity initiatives",
      "Apple boss says its DEI programmes may change",
      "The problem with this kind of thinking, according to Siri Chilazi, a researcher focused on gender equity at Harvard University, is that there is no historical precedent to suggest that racial and gender imbalances will correct themselves. Mrs Chilazi says racial and gender barriers still exist and believes DEI solutions focused on \"levelling the playing field for all\" are needed.",
      "She cites multiple experiments that show white men disproportionately receive more responses after applying for jobs than women or people of colour. A recent study by the National Bureau of Economic Research sent identical CVs to roughly 100 of the largest US companies and found that applicants presumed to be white were contacted by employers 9.5% more often than applicants presumed to be black - with one company contacting presumed white applicants 43% more often.",
      "But Mrs Chilazi also says there are genuine issues with many DEI programmes, adding that the most common programmes - including diversity and unconscious bias training and employee resource or affinity groups - are often the least effective. A recent study highlighting the ineffectiveness of some DEI practices said a common issue was treating them as an end goal in themselves, without measurable outcomes.",
      "And when it comes to large corporations donating money towards DEI initiatives \u2013 like Walmart's equity centre \u2013 Mrs Chilazi says the problem is that there is not much data to show how effective this is. \"This is an area where we actually don't have good research,\" she says.",
      "Where studies have shown DEI to be effective is when it comes to making \"small systemic changes\", she says. There is evidence to suggest replacing open-ended questions in performance evaluations with more specific ones, such as \"what's the one biggest accomplishment of this person last year?\", has shown significant reductions in gender and racial evaluation gaps that can affect pay, according to Mrs Chilazi.",
      "A mixed picture in education",
      "Supporters of DEI say the real-world impact of the shift from it can be seen at Harvard University, which was targeted in the landmark Supreme Court case.",
      "Last autumn, Harvard Law School reported having only 19 first-year black students among more than 500 students that enrolled, according to the American Bar Association.

      "\"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" had the most nominations this year with 13, including nods for best picture, best director, best writing and multiple acting nominations. Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n made Oscar history when she became the first transgender woman to be nominated in any acting category when she received a best actress nomination for playing the film's title role. Her Oscar campaign, however, has since become marred by controversy after offensive posts she made on social media surfaced.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n will be competing against Cynthia Erivo, who plays the wicked witch Elphaba in \"Wicked,\" Demi Moore, who took home the Golden Globe in this category for her role in \"The Substance,\" Mikey Madison and Fernanda Torres.

      "Barboro's co-star, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, was nominated for best actor for his performance as the iconic folk singer. He'll be competing against Adrian Brody, who at age 29 became the youngest person ever to win best actor. If Chalamet, currently 29, were to win Sunday night, he would break Brody's record by just a few months.

      "\"Anora\"",
      "Sean Baker's Cinderella story \"Anora\" was a surprise winner of the top prize at last year's Cannes Film Festival \u2014 a sly and at times uproarious comic-drama of a Brooklyn sex worker who marries the young, na\u00efve son of Russian oligarchs who decide the marriage must be broken up at all costs.",
      "The film brings a humanity to the strivings of Anora (who favors the name Ani), a young woman who realizes too late that virtually no one around her has her best interests at heart \u2014 not even her newly-hitched husband.",
      "In this scene, Ani takes a stand about the working conditions at her club \u2014 she will not countenance rudeness from the DJ! (Note: Graphic language):",
      "A former NYU film student, Sean Baker had not slipped into the Hollywood industry like some of his classmates, including Todd Phillips (\"Joker\"), instead making small independent features (\"The Florida Project,\" \"Tangerine,\" \"Red Rocket\") that focused on people living on the margins of mainstream society, cast with both professional actors and non-actors.",
      "After contemplating \"a bro movie with Russian gangsters,\" he switched to a story of a sex worker in Brooklyn's Brighton Beach. He and his wife, producer Samantha Quan, moved there to absorb the atmosphere. \"We don't like to go to a place and say we're just going to get a surface view,\" Baker told the Associated Press. \"We really embed ourselves in that place. We talk to people. We get to know everyone. The research is us being there and soaking things up.\"",
      "Baker, who won the Directors Guild of America Award for \"Anora,\" based the film on research he did into the lives of sex workers. \"I don't want to say in any way that I ever faced the hardships of an undocumented immigrant or a marginalized sex worker,\" he said. \"But being an independent filmmaker for 30 years, there was a hustle. Up until fairly recently, I was struggling to pay rent.\"",
      "Madison told \"CBS Mornings\" that she \"absolutely fell in love\" with Ani when she read the character. \"She's such a complicated woman. There's so much nuance to who she is. She's so vulnerable on the inside, but she presents herself as this very fierce, tough person. And she has such a fighting spirit, and I was excited to explore all the different parts of what that would be.\"",
      "Heavily influenced by 1970s New York films like \"The French Connection\" and \"The Taking of Pelham One Two Three,\" Baker shot \"Anora\" on 35mm. \"We're living in a day and age where the technology, analog meeting digital right now, actually opens up so many doors to the artists,\" Baker told Forbes. \"I mean, you can shoot on film and capture your images on this gorgeous medium, but then you have the digital tools to help clean up and perfect. We're living in a great time. I wish more filmmakers would appreciate the fact that using tools from both sides of years of technology is a wonderful thing.\"",
      "\"Anora,\" a Neon release, won best film at the Producers Guild of America Awards and at the Spirit Awards. It is now playing in theaters and is available via VOD.",

      "\"The Brutalist\"",
      "In director Brady Corbet's period drama \"The Brutalist,\" Hungarian architect L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u00f3th (best actor nominee Adrien Brody) emigrates from post-war Europe to the United States to revive his career, and finds both opportunity and friction as he tries to pursue his artistic inclinations.",
      "In the film's stirring opening scene, T\u00f3th arrives in New York Harbor, with a skewed view of the Statue of Liberty that portends an unequal assimilation into the promise of America. (Cinematography by Lol Crawley. Music by Daniel Blumberg.)",
      "Brody, who won an Oscar for his portrayal of a musician struggling to survive during the Nazi occupation of Poland in Roman Polanski's \"The Pianist,\" is nominated for his performance as T\u00f3th, who is hired by a wealthy Pennsylvania industrialist to build a massive community center in his \"brutalist\" style \u2014 a form of architecture that's light on decoration and heavy on concrete. But Toth's ambitions clash with his patron, who seeks in T\u00f3th a talent he wishes to dominate.",
      "In this extended interview with \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" Brody described his performance as T\u00f3th and the influence of his mother, the acclaimed photographer Sylvia Plachy: \"I've had a lifetime of influences and preparation so to speak to portray L\u00e1szl\u00f3 in this movie. It's a character that I relate to many things, and I see a lot of parallels in my own yearnings as an artist and in the yearnings of the people that I collaborate with. I can relate to how the struggles my mother has had to overcome in fleeing Hungary with her parents, my grandparents, in 1956 during the revolution and her journey coming to America and the sense of loss as a young girl and starting again. It's really shaped \u2014 I think she's an empathetic person by nature, but she has certain sensitivity and eye for others and those who are vulnerable, or outsiders, and captures that quite beautifully.\"",
      "Brody believes that empathy helped shape his own choices as an actor, \"trying to find films that have social relevance, or to represent people who don't have a voice and to give them that through me in some respect.\"",
      "Corbet's monumental post-war drama (which he co-wrote with his wife Mona Fastvold) is a challenging and invigorating epic, a three-and-a-half hour tale of an artist striving to create in the face of terrible external pressures \u2014 commercial, societal, marital. Though set for the most part in Pennsylvania, much of the picture was shot in Hungary, on a tiny budget (approximately $10 million), employing the rarely-used VistaVision process to blow up to 70mm. \"We cut every corner we could to make sure that every single cent was on screen,\" Corbet told Variety. \"It was a Herculean effort, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, because it was just years and years of essentially working for free.\"",
      "\"It helped that the film was set in an earlier period, because there were places in Hungary that looked sort of lost in the past,\" Oscar-nominated\u00a0production designer Judy Becker told Variety. \"For example, the industrial area in Budapest looked very similar to the industrial area of Philadelphia in the 1950s.\"",
      "But despite the tight budget, Corbet was not sorry he didn't have more money: \"I never thought, 'I wish I had $30 million more,'\" he told Variety. \"There's a lot of strings that come with that kind of money. It invites lots of opinions. You have all these executives who don't trust the director and bury them in notes. What you get is something antiseptic that lacks a signature. It's the difference between a bowl from Crate & Barrel and a wabi-sabi ceramic.\"",
      "At a press conference at the Venice Film Festival, where the film was hailed as a \"masterpiece,\" Corbet remarked on questions about its length: \"This film does everything that we are told we are not allowed to do. I think it's quite silly, actually, to have a conversation about run time, because that's like criticizing a book for being 700 pages versus 100 pages.\"",
      "At the end of \"The Brutalist,\" T\u00f3th is quoted as saying, \"No matter what the others try and sell you, it is the destination, not the journey.\" \"I don't think that that sentiment applies to my journey at all,\" Brody told \"Sunday Morning,\" \"but I do find it very beautiful and telling to the storytelling of the film. You have to be very present and embrace the journey, because that is all you've got while you're here. I mean, a part of me would love to be proud of the body of work that I leave behind, but I won't be around to look back at it, so hopefully I bring more good than bad and negativity into this world, and that's what I strive for.\"",
      "Brody won the New York Film Critics Circle Award, Golden Globe, and BAFTA awards for his performance, while \"The Brutalist\" won the Golden Globe for best motion picture drama and best director. The film received 10 Academy Award nominations, including best picture and best director.",

      "\"A Complete Unknown\"",
      "James Mangold's biopic expertly dramatizes the rise of Bob Dylan as a mythic figure in the folk music scene, and his transformation into a singer-songwriter who blurred genres and confounded commercial expectations. The film, nominated for 8 Academy Awards, is grounded by best actor nominee Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, who won the Screen Actors Guild Award for his acutely-attuned performance as Dylan.",
      "In this scene, Dylan visits an infirm Woody Guthrie (Scoot McNairy) in a New Jersey hospital, being tended to by friend Pete Seeger (best supporting actor nominee Edward Norton):",
      "That meeting leads to Dylan's first appearance at New York's Folk City, where he is introduced by Seeger. The club's audience, including Joan Baez (played by best supporting actress nominee Monica Barbaro), is enraptured by Dylan's \"I Was Young When I Left Home\":",
      "Jay Cocks, the screenwriter of \"The Age of Innocence\" and \"Gangs of New York,\" had penned a screenplay based on the 2015 Elijah Wald book \"Dylan Goes Electric.\" Mangold (whose films include \"Walk the Line,\" \"3:10 to Yuma\" and \"Logan\") worked on revising the script, which expanded the characters of Pete Seeger, Joan Baez, and Sylvie Russo (a fictionalization of Dylan's then-girlfriend, Suze Rotolo).",
      "Mangold described to the Hollywood Reporter his initial meeting with Dylan to discuss the film: \"He said: 'So what's this movie about?' And I thought very carefully, because I knew he didn't want a 20-minute answer. I said: 'It's about a young guy in Minnesota who's suffocating and feeling desperate and who leaves everything \u2014 friends, family \u2014 behind and, with just a few dollars in his pocket, makes his way across the country and creates a new identity and makes new friends, finds a new family and blossoms, becomes successful, then starts to suffocate again and runs away.' And he smiled and that was all. Like, he didn't have anything more to say, but I knew that meant, to me, that he didn't take issue.\"",
      "The film gets a lot right in terms of the period, the feel of Greenwich Village at its height in the folk music world, and the sense of shifting sands in commercial music. Production designer Fran\u00e7ois Audouy transformed downtown Jersey City into early 1960s MacDougal Street in Greenwich Village. He also recreated Dylan's apartment based on hundreds of previously-unpublished photographs \u2014 from the exact chair Dylan had, to his Decca record player, his 1954 Olivetti Lettera 22 typewriter, art on the walls, books and records. \"It was like stepping into a time machine,\" Audouy told Indiewire of the apartment set.",
      "Arianne Phillips, nominated for best costume design (she'd previously been nominated for \"Walk the Line,\" \"W.E.,\" and \"Once Upon a Time \u2026 in Hollywood\"), told The Art of Costume, \"Unlike typical biopics that span decades, this film focuses on just four years. That precision was both a challenge and an opportunity for the costumes. \u2026 The film moves through a variety of locations and scenarios, but the time period remains consistent. There's no dramatic shift in technology, architecture, or cars. Instead, the focus is on Bob's evolution \u2014 his character arc.\"",
      "The film's wardrobe was broken down into three styles: his arrival in New York in 1961, the time around the release of his 1963 album \"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan,\" and the more mod figure he cut in 1965. \"Chalamet had about 67 costume changes,\" Phillips said, \"and we had over 120 speaking roles with principal characters averaging anywhere from 8 to 30 changes each.\"",
      "Though much dramatized in the film did happen \u2014 including a fistfight that broke out when Dylan plugged in an electric guitar at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival \u2014 there were some liberties taken. \"Dylan Goes Electric\" author Elijah Wald told the Guardian, \"The movie is full of things that didn't happen, but the way they happen in those scenes feels right to me. If Pete Seeger had been at Woody Guthrie's bedside when Dylan arrived and sung him a song, then said he didn't have a place to sleep, Pete would have brought him home for the night. None of that happened, but it's all true to the characters.\"",
      "Because of COVID, Hollywood strikes, and other commitments, Chalamet ended up waiting five years before \"A Complete Unknown\" could go before the cameras. He used that time to further study Dylan (whom he had never met) and his music. In addition to learning how to play the guitar and the harmonica, Chalamet mastered about 40 Bob Dylan songs \u2014 far more than were originally called for in the script \u2014 determined, like the young Dylan, to make it great.",
      "\"I give 170% in everything I'm doing,\" the actor told \"60 Minutes.\" \"I'm giving it my all. Something like the Dylan project, these aren't watered-down experiences. I'm going Daniel Day-Lewis on all of them. I'm not saying in process, but I'm saying a level of commitment.\"",
      "He says he wasn't merely trying to imitate Dylan: \"No, totally that was the tension, for me, in doing a biopic on somebody so beloved and so well-known was \u2026 where does my heart and where does my soul fit into this? Can it fit into this, particularly with someone who was so masked?\"",

      "Edward Berger's filming of the Robert Harris thriller, about the political machinations within the Vatican as the College of Cardinals meets to elect a new pope, is an engrossing tale of intrigue in which Cardinal Thomas Lawrence (best actor nominee Ralph Fiennes) tries to get to the bottom of various mysteries, all while corralling the disparate cardinals, each with their own political and ideological predilections, towards naming a successor and guiding the Church into the future.",
      "In this scene, Lawrence and Cardinal Aldo Bellini (Stanley Tucci) discuss the discovery of a secret report about a papal candidate's activities:",
      "Berger last directed the 2022 remake of \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" (which itself was nominated for 9 Academy Awards, and won four). In \"Conclave,\" he blends the dynamics of a drawing room mystery with an examination of the purpose of faith.",
      "In this scene, Lawrence gives a sermon to the cardinals about the value of uncertainty, little knowing that, for much of the film, he will be on a quest for understanding \u2014 questioning his own doubt \u2014 to attain a kind of certainty that, for Lawrence, may represent truth.",
      "\"I like characters that have contradictions inside them,\" Fiennes told \"Sunday Morning.\" His reaction to reading the part of Lawrence was, \"Oh, I love this. This is a human. He's not a saint. He's a good man trying to find his way.",
      "\"I was brought up a Catholic and then rebelled when I was 13,\" Fiennes said. \"My mother was a committed Catholic. So, 'God questions' have been in my family since I was a child.\"",
      "And did he come away with any answers to his own questions? \"No, I came away with more questions,\" he said.",
      "Berger talked with the Hollywood Reporter about the film's themes: \"It is a wonderful topic for a political thriller, not [just] for a religious thriller,\" he said. \"This could take place anywhere. It could take place in Washington, D.C., or Downing Street, or a big corporation where the CEO job is vacant. So, I think that's interesting on the surface, but on a much deeper level, I really connected with what [Lawrence] is going through. He says, 'I have difficulty with prayer.' \u2026 To overcome that and go through this crisis and refine the belief in what you do, [to believe] it has some purpose, I think a lot of us go through it at some point or another in our life. To refine the purity of your job, and refine the purity of your purpose, is a constant struggle. It's an interesting path to keep recalibrating. And it's actually a very healthy path to keep recalibrating. \u2026",
      "\"What the film really deals with is doubt and certainty \u2026 It doesn't mean that every cardinal, every character in the movie, acts to the best of their conscience. But they are certain in their beliefs, or they believe that what they think is right. Bellini has a certainty that this guy is wrong and that is a certainty as well. And I always think that, in a way, certainty creates antagonism and that's just going to make the other side stronger.\"",

      "\"Dune: Part Two\"",
      "Part One of \"Dune,\" released in 2021, was a masterful evocation of Frank Herbert's classic sci-fi novels, in which the desert world of Arrakis becomes the focal point of a galactic war over a unique, invaluable commodity: spice, a psychoactive chemical necessary for interplanetary travel (and domination). Directed by Denis Villeneuve, the movie was nominated for 10 Academy Awards, and won six.",
      "The sequel follows the ascension of Paul Atreides (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) as a leader of the Indigenous Fremen tribes in combatting the forces of the ruling House Harkonnen.",
      "In this scene, Paul and Chani (Zendaya) engage in a Fremen attack on a Harkonnen spice harvester. The fast-moving action showcases how Villeneuve's staging, photography and pacing expertly define cinematic geography, as well as the limitations of technology \u2014 and the power of daredevil heroics:",
      "In this technical featurette from Variety, Academy Award-nominated cinematographer Greig Fraser (who won the Oscar for \"Part One\") discusses how camera movement, lenses, and shooting in natural light (as well as the combination of digital and film emulsions) mirror the emotions and journey of the characters, such as when Paul Atreides rides the giant sandworm.",
      "Fraser noted, \"The biggest challenge is, worms don't exist.\" Well, yeah, that is a problem! Thankfully, the film's visual effects team (also nominated) provided the solution. You can watch the sandworm sequence below \u2014 a scene of remarkable anticipation, drama, and visual and sonic splendor for which Imax was created, as Paul's feat appears to satisfy a Fremen prophecy of a messianic figure. It's not for nothing that director Steven Spielberg, in a Directors Guild of America podcast, told Villeneuve that this sequence was \"one of the greatest things I have ever seen. Ever!\"",
      "\"Dune: Part Two\" received five nominations in all, for best picture, cinematography, visual effects, production design and sound. (It was not nominated in the categories of direction, costumes, editing or makeup/hair styling; Hollywood can be weird.)",

      "\"Emilia P\u00e9rez\"",
      "A hard-hitting true crime story that is also a poignant love story and a journey of self-discovery, \"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" is also a musical. Written and directed by Jacques Audiard, the story involves a powerful Mexican drug lord who secretly transitions to a woman.",
      "What Juan \"Manitas\" Del Monte leaves behind when he transitions is a wife and children, who are relocated to Europe for their protection. Jessi (Selena Gomez) mourns the death of her husband, but after moving back to Mexico she meets up with a former lover \u2014 and is also introduced to a distant cousin, Emilia P\u00e9rez (best actress nominee Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n), not knowing Emilia is Jessi's former husband.",
      "In this scene Gomez performs the Oscar-nominated song \"Mi Camino\" (by Cl\u00e9ment Ducol and Camille Dalmais), in which Jessie evokes the vulnerability of her character. \"It was actually so therapeutic for me to sing,\" Gomez told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" in this extended interview. \"It's basically in English translated to, you know, 'If I fall off this hill it's my hill; if I decide to do this with my life it's my decision,' and embracing womanhood if you will. And I really appreciated that.\"",
      "In this profile for \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" Gomez said shooting \"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" left her \"a little sore from the dance numbers.\" So, why did she want to do it? \"I found it incredibly compelling,\" she said. \"To be honest, I've never really seen a movie like this before. I don't think I've ever been this proud of something in the acting field.\"",
      "In her extended interview, Gomez described the experience of shooting the film as transformative: \"The people I was around, I couldn't have been luckier with their support and their wisdom. It just felt so right,\" she said. \"The story is original, but it's also a story that a lot of people walk through. So, the way it was told was artistic and audacious and beautiful, but it is a true element where people crave and have a desire to live their life authentically, and whatever that looks like to them should never be judged. I thought that we did a good job encompassing that.\"",
      "\"Also, when I read the script, my character came across quite harsh in the beginning. Jacques was really wonderful with collaborating with me because I felt like adding a bit of softness to her would help. So, there are these moments in the movie where you can take a deep breath and enjoy the ride, and then it brings you right back up to where the stakes are high.\"",

      "\"I'm Still Here\"",
      "In 1971, Brazilian politician Rubens Paiva, who opposed his country's dictatorship, was kidnapped by the military, tortured and killed \u2014 one of thousands who suffered at the hands of the authoritarian government.",
      "In this scene, his wife, Eunice Paiva (best actress nominee Fernanda Torres), alerted to the death of the family dog in front of their home, confronts two suspicious men staking out her home:",
      "After Rubens' disappearance, Eunice, a mother of five, continued her husband's legacy by becoming a lawyer, and leading efforts to support civil rights and protect the Amazonian rain forest. Her tragic but inspiring story was recounted in her son Marcelo Rubens Palva's 2015 book, \"I'm Still Here.\"",
      "Brazilian filmmaker Walter Salles' previous films include 1998's \"Central Station\" (an Oscar-winner for best foreign language film), and \"The Motorcycle Diaries.\" At last year's New York Film Festival, Salles said that the story of \"I'm Still Here\" was very personal to him because of his own history. The son of a diplomat, Salles returned to Brazil in 1969 after living abroad for five years: \"The country I came back to was very different from the country I had left, because it was now under military dictatorship, and I was personally pretty much at loss, really at loss, until I met this family of five kids, and it was Marcelo's family. Became really good friends with his sister Nalu, and I got embraced by this family.",
      "\"I've been in that house, you know, for almost two years on a constant level,\" Salles said. \"We drifted to that house because in it you could hear the political discussions that didn't exist anymore in the exterior of that place. You could hear the music that was forbidden. \u2026 And there were no barriers between, you know, adults, adolescents, kids. This was completely different from my house. So, I was very informed by that. The moment where this was broken up was for all of us who were in that house at some moment kind of severed a line. It stipulated a before and an after, which obviously has to do with the moment when an authoritarian state invades the heart of a family. And that stayed with me for years and years and years.\"",
      "\"I'm Still Here\" has tapped into the public conscience in Brazil, where the collective memory about the nation's suffering under military rule across two decades is being revived through the story of Eunice and her family. It became the fifth highest-grossing film in Brazil last year (behind Hollywood fare like \"Inside Out 2,\" \"Deadpool & Wolverine,\" \"Moana 2\" and \"Despicable Me 4\"). The film won three awards at the Venice Film Festival, including for its director.",
      "Torres won the Golden Globe for best motion picture actress in a drama for her performance. She is the second Brazilian actress to be nominated for an Academy Award. The first? Her mother, Fernanda Montenegro, who was nominated for \"Central Station.\"",
      "\"I'm Still Here,\" released by Sony Pictures Classics, is nominated for three Academy Awards, including best international feature film, best actress, and best picture. It is currently screening in theaters.",
      "\"Nickel Boys\"",
      "Colson Whitehead, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 2017 for his novel \"The Underground Railroad,\" based his next novel, \"The Nickel Boys,\" on the tragedy of the Dozier School, a Florida reform school for boys in the Jim Crow South, which became notorious for its institutional abuse, torture and deaths of youth. Following an investigation, the school was closed in 2011; subsequent diggings unearthed unmarked graves, which revealed even greater evidence of the staff's cruelties.",
      "In this extended interview from 2019, Whitehead told \"Sunday Morning\" that his book's main characters, Elwood and Turner, represented different sides of himself: \"I have an optimistic part of me that thinks that things are getting better. We are making progress as a country, in terms of race and other things,\" Whitehead said. \"And then there's a pessimistic, or realistic, part of me that says, no, things never change, and we make some progress and then we slide back. And so, Elwood and Turner in their initial incarnation represented different sides of me.",
      "\"Elwood is 16, he's a straight-A student, he's been inspired by Martin Luther King, the civil rights marches. Every week, he reads Life magazine and sees the picture of his heroes. \u2026 And he sees himself as part of the new generation that can change the old order. And then there's Turner, who is an orphan. And he's been sent to [Nickel] 'cause there's nowhere else for him to go. And he lives by his wits. He's a survivor. And he sees the system as it actually is, unchanging, casually cruel, callous. And he doesn't believe in the same sort of enlightened goals of Elwood. [He believes in] making his way through the obstacle course, getting through a day without getting beaten, and then getting out of school where he can find some other survival tactic that works in the outside world. And so, they meet, and they have to survive but also consider each other's philosophies \u2014 what works, what doesn't, and how do you maybe perhaps integrate them.\"",
      "What makes the film adaptation of \"Nickel Boys\" unique is that director and co-writer RaMell Ross, a visual arts professor at Brown University who earned an Oscar nomination for the 2018 documentary \"Hale County This Morning, This Evening,\" employs a first-person perspective for most of the film; the camera serves as the eyes of Elwood, or Turner, throughout the story, so the audience directly experiences the sensations of the characters, which can be especially disturbing when they become victims of abuse.",
      "In this trailer for the film, we experience life from the perspective of the protagonists:",
      "In this scene, Hattie (Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor), unable to see her grandson Elwood, approaches Turner (voice of Brandon Wilson) for help:",
      "In a New York Film Festival panel discussion, Ross, who had always wanted to make a POV film, said reading Whitehead's book was profound for him: \"And in the process of reading, it was the process of being allowed to imagine in a way that I think a lot of American writers aren't focused on.",
      "\"The way that Coulson wrote was, like, concise and spare, [he] didn't over-describe, so it allowed me to imagine myself as Elwood and truly be visual in the world,\" Ross said. \"And so, that process led to the POV notion, and ideas around at what point in time did Elwood realize that he was raced, that he realized he was Black? Which is something that I would argue all people of color go through. It's a visual thing, it's a perceptual thing, and what a devastating thing in his life as you can see in the film juxtaposed against being a sentient-innocent child and being in awe of what it means to be embodied, and then to go out into the world and to be forced to adhere by this manufactured law. It's devastating.\"",
      "Shot with Sony's Venice (a full-frame digital camera not much larger than a DSLR still camera), to allow movement through tight spaces, the camera was worn on various rigs (chest mounts, helmets, SnorriCams), as well as handhelds. In many instances, the actors wore the cameras themselves.",
      "Cinematographer Jomo Fray, who won the American Society of Cinematographers' Spotlight Award, told the New York Film Festival audience that he did not think \"POV\" was adequate as shorthand to describe its effect: \"I don't think it was about being in the point of view, but it was actually creating an image that is at one point immersive \u2014 it brings us in as an audience into the world. At a second point, it is implicative \u2014 it implicates us in the world that the image itself is seeing. And as a third point, it's an image that has a physical danger to it, that the image itself is navigating, trying to go through spaces that are naturally hostile to it. So, we wanted to shoot these scenes not from outside but be inside of the scene. \u2026 It was fundamentally, totally different than anything I've ever shot before, conceptually and otherwise.\"",
      "Brandon Wilson, who plays Turner, told CBS station KCAL in Los Angeles, \"I think this movie offers a beautiful invitation for people to let go of their own subjective points of view and step into the shoes of another person, and step into their eyes. I just hope they accept that invitation and allow themselves to be pulled into this world and release their own conditional point of view for a moment.\"",

      "\"The Substance\"",
      "Coralie Fargeat's body horror film \"The Substance\" stars best actress nominee Demi Moore as Elisabeth Sparkle, an aging TV star who discovers a sinister-looking potion that can give her a younger, more perfect version of herself, but at a terrible price.",
      "In this early scene, following a devastating career downturn and a car accident, Elisabeth breaks down under the watch of an ER doctor (Tom Morton), but then finds herself the focus of a sinister male nurse (Robin Greer). Why does he refer to her as \"a good candidate\"? And what is that strange birthmark on his forearm?",
      "The upshot? Elisabeth is offered access to a radical potion, a.k.a. The Substance, that promises \"a better version of yourself.\" What that entails, once a yellow liquid is injected into one's veins, is the creation of a new, younger duplicate of the person, ready to take their place. [Warning: There is a regimented schedule for injections; don't deviate!]",
      "Fargeat, a French filmmaker whose credits include \"Revenge\" and the TV series \"The Sandman,\" told Vogue magazine that the stylized horror was purposefully made to look unreal: \"From the start I knew I wasn't interested in depicting the real Hollywood but rather what it's about. It's about beauty. It's about success. Taking it out of reality was a way to make it timeless and thus universal, like the story could happen today, yesterday, or tomorrow \u2014 as well as anywhere.\"",
      "In a Hollywood Reporter roundtable, Gargeat said that she would not call \"The Substance\" a horror film. \"I would call it more of a genre film, which is to me very wide \u2026 going from sci-fi to action to everything that is not grounded into reality. Basically that's how I grew up loving films, everything that [would] allow me to escape real life, which I hated, which I felt totally unadapted to, and very bored [with].",
      "\"So, especially for that film and the previous one, that's really where I found my freedom and where I felt powerful and where I felt fully capable to express myself in a way that there are no boundaries. Also, where I love to go very much into the excess and kind of touch my part of, yeah, craziness \u2026 it felt totally relevant for it to be as excessive as what I wanted to say, and make the audience feel that excess and feel that craziness.",
      "\"So, that's it's even not a question where that I choose; it's just what I do,\" she said.",
      "The film has been recognized as an indictment of sexism and ageism, in a popular culture that denigrates women who have the temerity to get older. In an extended interview with \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" Moore referred to a line by Dennis Quaid's character making reference to a woman's fertility being tied to their value, and to their desirability. \"There's an aspect that [and I would say up until now] kind of put women at a certain age or time in their life as, 'Well, you're now relegated to this corral because you can't be that.' And I just don't think it's the truth. I don't think that is the truth of who we are as women as we get older. And I think again, like the film, there's a part of that that we as women have bought into, and so if we want to change this, then we have to change how we're looking at it, how we're holding it, and how we see ourselves. We can't wait for it to change on the outside; we have to be that change.\"",
      "Fargeat told the Associated Press that her film was a response to the limits of female representation. \"Our society, you know, has been built on 2,000 years of being kind of one way. And to make a real sense, it's still too tiny to me. That's why I also wanted my movie to be so excessive, you know, because I think this is what we need. We can't be shy with those issue because the weight of everything is huge. The weight of all that still creates so much inequality and so much violence. So, that's why also I wanted to make the movie that way.\"",
      "Moore won both the Golden Globe and the Screen Actors Guild Award for her performance, and was nominated for a BAFTA. The film is up for a total of five Academy Awards, including best picture.

And as you're walking, smell the flowers and feel the air. And maybe you'll realize you're actually flying.\"",
      "The show \"Wicked,\" with music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz, and based on Gregory Maguire's novel about the backstory of the Wicked Witch of the West, opened on Broadway in 2003. It won three Tony Awards. For the film adaptation, the show has been split in half (Part Two opens this November). Far from the candy-colored vaudevillian Oz that the 1939 classic projected, \"Wicked\" has a darker subtext about tyranny and civil rights. A rebellion builds against the Wizard and the increasingly autocratic rule coming from the Emerald City, which draws Elphaba (best actress nominee Cynthia Erivo) to become a resistance figure; her empathy leads to her becoming an outcast.",
      "At the center of the narrative is the connection between Elphaba and Glinda (best supporting actress nominee Ariana Grande). Their frenemy relationship begins at Shiz University, but evolves as they compete for the attention of the dean of sorcery (Michelle Yeoh), and of a hunk (Jonathan Bailey), and then join as friends to meet the Wizard.",

While it's as impressive as Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet singing live on set for \"A Complete Unknown,\" Bob Dylan wasn't dangling in the air from a broomstick.",
      "Hayes told Playbill.com, \"There's something within the breath and the cadence of the way that the lips are moving, the breath that you're hearing as someone's walking and singing live, that just sounds real \u2014 because it is real. There's also something within the acoustic of the voice that matches the set we see, because it's a real acoustic. It's not synthetic rebuilt digital acoustic.\" Hayes is part of the sound recording and mixing team nominated for an Oscar.",

    "summary": "Has the rise of streaming services, and the ability to watch movies on mobile phones, changed what we expect, or want, movies to be? A leading filmmaker, critic, and movie executives discuss the evolution of Hollywood's \"Dream Factory.\"",
    "story": [
      "Hollywood has been re-inventing itself for more 100 years. Change is part of the culture. But a pocket-sized \"Sunset Boulevard\"? That's not a close-up!",
      "We visited the Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles. Built in 1922, it was home of the very first Hollywood premiere, when Douglas Fairbanks debuted \"Robin Hood\" there. It was a big, spectacular night in Tinsel Town. Today, the Egyptian is owned by the world's largest streaming service, Netflix, which spent $70 million to renovate the movie palace.",
      "Why? According to Ted Sarandos, the co-CEO of Netflix, seeing movies in a theater is inspiring. \"I could think back to my first time being in a movie theater watching 'Jaws' at 11 years old. And I remember like it was yesterday \u2013 popcorn went this way, and the soda went this way, and the audience screamed. And that's a very unique and different experience.\"",
      "And an increasingly distant one. Today, screens are smaller, and ticket prices higher. It all leads to a common refrain: \"They don't make 'em like they used to.\"",
      "\"It's probably like everything else; the thing we grew up on is what we want,\" said Sarandos. \"It's oftentimes the art forms move on, and advances in ways that we kind of miss the old version of it. But they do make movies like they used to. And I think they're better than ever.\"",
      "That, of course, is debatable. What's not in doubt is that the big movies are far more predictable than ever. In 2024, the top 15 films at the box office were all franchises, sequels, or reboots.",
      "Sarandos said, \"The business has become very stratified. Either movies are gigantic spectaculars built to make billions of dollars, or they're very small, independent films. And there's not much in the middle anymore.\"",
      "Tom Rothman, who runs Sony's motion picture group, said, \"Movies still do really well, and big movies are still really big, right? But what's missing at the moment, I believe, is a range and a breadth of originality.\"",
      "Rothman, like Sarandos, is among the most powerful people in this business. His films do stream on Netflix, but only after they play in theaters. \"You can have quality or you can have quantity; it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to have both quality and quantity together,\" said Rothman. \"What does streaming have? It has quantity. Okay, so that's a very broad, wide net. And \u2026 it's a very low bar.\"",
      "Nancy Meyers has made films that have earned more than $1.5 billion. She's the writer and director of hit romantic comedies like \"The Holiday,\" \"Something's Gotta Give,\" and \"It's Complicated.\" She believes the shift to, let's call it \"the super-hero formula\" has killed off the types of movies many of us have loved for generations.",
      "\"There is an enormous difference,\" Meyers said. \"I felt in the '90s a freedom to have ideas that people would want to make \u2013 I wasn't worried that they wouldn't be open to the kind of movies that I make.\"",
      "\"Creativity and originality, you saw as an asset?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, I did!\" she laughed. \"Character, wit, comedy, heart, big screen. I had no crystal ball. I couldn't see into the future of how movies were gonna change.\"",
      "The change, says Meyers, means films like \"Chinatown,\" \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" even \"Dirty Dancing\" might not get made today. \"Movies, it's always been a business to make money, always,\" she said. \"But they were less afraid, I think. They were less afraid. They took more chances.\"",
      "Michael Schulman, who writes about movies and culture for The New Yorker, and is author of the book \"Sscar Wars,\" said, \"I would love for the movies to be a little bit less like they used to. Every two seconds there's a new 'Superman,' 'Beetlejuice,' 'Lion King,' 'Alien,' 'Mission: Impossible,' 'Bridget Jones,' 'Indiana Jones.' The goal is to not come up with the next great idea, but to excite the shareholders about a sure bet for the next quarter.\"",
      "Schulman says the movies we grew up on are still out there, produced by the independent studios behind \"Anora\" (Neon), \"The Brutalist\" (A24), and other best picture nominees. Schulman said, \"I often hear people say when the list comes out for the Academy Awards, 'Well, I haven't heard of half of those movies.' \u00a0If you go to the movie theater and they have ten screens showing 'Captain America: Brave New World' and no 'Brutalist,' then there's your problem.\"",
      "Netflix's Sarandos said, \"Even now, the average American goes to the movie theaters twice a year. The average Netflix member watches seven movies a month. So, I feel like that's gotta be good for the business, and it's gotta be good for the art of storytelling to have a platform, and an audience of 700 million people who still watch movies, when they could watch TikTok videos, they could watch YouTube clips, they could be listening to podcasts. But they still watch movies.\"",
      "What Sarandos knows (and what many of us may be trying to avoid admitting) is this:\u00a0 If they don't make movies like they used to, it might be because we don't watch 'em like we used to. \"There's all this opportunity, I think, to get the history of this art form, the history of storytelling, the history of humans, on the screen,\" he said. \"If the screen is gigantic here, or a good-sized at home, or even small on your phone, I don't think it's sacrilege for someone to watch a great movie on their phone. I'd much rather them do that than not watch movies at all.\"",
      "Tom Rothman and Nancy Meyers concede there's value in streaming movies at home. But what they want \u2013 and what they believe the audience wants \u2013 is something cinematic.",
      "\"The movie experience is not on your phone,\" Rothman said. \"A movie experience is a collective, big-screen experience. You're there, you're in the dark.\"",
      "Hollywood, said Meyers, \"used to be called a dream factory, right? And somebody's dream is up on the screen \u2013 somebody's version of a world that you get pulled into and you get sucked into. The lights come up at the end and, you know, you've been somewhere. You've had an experience when we're in a movie theater. That's what a movie is.\"",

      "\"I love that question,\" said Rothman. \"The hill is steep, and the climb is hard. But it is not too steep, and it is not too hard, if you're tough and bold enough, right? And if it were easy, anybody could do it. And it's not easy. And you have to be willing to risk, and you have to be willing to fail.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-hidden-side-of-johnny-carson/",
    "published": "Sun, 02 Mar 2025 10:05:52 -0500",
    "summary": "As host of \"The Tonight Show\" for 30 years, Johnny Carson was the king of late-night TV. But the public rarely saw his private side. A new biography, \"Carson the Magnificent,\" examines the late-night host's enduring impact, and his difficulties off-camera.",
    "story": [
      "It may not look like much now, but once upon a time, Stage 1 at the Burbank Studios was where the king of comedy held court, addressing his subjects at the end of each day. Johnny Carson presided over not just late night, but American popular culture.",
      "\"Johnny Carson was the biggest star in America,\" said writer Mike Thomas. \"Movie stars, rock stars, I don't think anybody was bigger than Johnny, because he was on night after night after night.\"",
      "Thomas' new book is \"Carson the Magnificent,\" a biography of Carson his late friend Bill Zehme started.",
      "Everybody who was anybody appeared on \"The Tonight Show,\" and 17 million Americans tuned in \u2013 many from their beds. It was Johnny Carson vs. sleep, and sleep usually lost. \"It did!\" said Thomas. \"I think Johnny brought a lot of people peace at the end of the day. People love to laugh, but I think he gave them hope that the world would go on the next day no matter what was happening.\"",
      "His audience \u2013 more than triple the size of all three current network late-night shows combined \u2013 made him the national agenda setter of the 1960s, '70s, and '80s.\u00a0 \"Johnny would say things and do things that became water cooler conversation the next morning,\" said Thomas.",
      "It also made Johnny the pre-eminent Hollywood talent broker for several generations. Fifty-seven years after comedian Robert Klein made the first of his 97 appearances on \"The Tonight Show,\" he's still grateful for the rocket fuel career boost that Carson's imprimatur provided. \"He's one of the most important people in my life, and we were not personal friends,\" Klein said.",
      "For his career, Klein said Carson was the most important: \"Appearances on that show were everything. I am a creature of 'The Tonight Show.' That was the vertebra of my career.\"",
      "Comedian George Wallace knew what was on the line when he did Carson: an invitation to \"The Tonight Show\" was a necessary bullet point on his resume \u2013 and each appearance was a climb up comedy's Everest. And then, when the routine would end, comedians would look nervously at the desk, waiting to see if Carson gave then the OK. \"Always got that,\" said Wallace.",
      "I asked, \"Were you looking for it?\"",
      "\"Hell, yeah. I was looking for it!\" he said.",
      "But what he was also looking for was a gesture from Carson to come over to the couch. \"I didn't get that,\" he said.",
      "Forty years later, this big-time comedy headliner still feels he didn't make the \"Tonight Show\" summit. I asked, \"What did that mean to get called over?\"",
      "\"That meant that you're in,\" said Wallace. \"You got called over, you're in the club.\" He said the fact that he did get that \"kinda hurts today.\"",
      "All that power, rested in the hands of a complicated man: master connector at work, cold and aloof at home. \"I think there were two Johnnys to a certain degree,\" said Thomas. \"On screen, impossibly cool guy. But there was also the side of Johnny that was introverted off-screen. I think some of the aloofness may have been introversion.\"",
      "In Mike Wallace's classic \"60 minutes\" profile in 1979, Carson acknowledged the dichotomy. He said, \"If I pulled out my old high school annual book and read some of the things, people might say, 'Oh he's conceited, he's aloof.' Actually that was more shy. See, when I'm in front of an audience, it's a different thing.\"",
      "Life with no audience was challenging for Carson. He was married four times. \"Johnny needed to be married for some reason; he needed to be with someone,\" said Thomas. \"He didn't need to stay married. They would fall out. Johnny's behavior would pry them apart. They just never lasted.\"",
      "But actress Dyan Cannon has a different story to tell. \"Aloof and cold? Never.\" She described him as \"Warm, open, willing. I've never known anyone like him. I've never known anyone like Johnny.\"",
      "And this from a woman who was married to Cary Grant. \"Cary was more of an enigma,\" said Cannon. \"Much more of a, 'Can I approach him or can't I?'\u00a0 But people would approach Johnny as if he were family.\"",
      "\"So, it was a different kind of star?\" I asked.",
      "\"There was nobody as big a star as Johnny.\"",
      "In a \"Tonight Show\" episode from October 1985, where Cannon and Carson are chatting, she flustered the normally unflappable Carson as she held his hand. \"Hi, sweetheart,\" she said.",
      "\"We've gone out a couple of times, right?\" he said.",
      "Cannon erupted in laughter \u2013 as did Cannon today, re-watching the video. \"He still makes me laugh,\" she said.",
      "Asked what exactly was going on there, Cannon laughed again: \"Well, you will never know! You will never, never know!\"",
      "\"You gotta give me a little somethin' here.\"",
      "\"Oh, no, I don't!\" she laughed.",
      "To hear her tell it, this was not a man who had trouble understanding women. \"How do I describe a relationship where you're so intimate with somebody, and yet, you haven't been intimate physically? We were closer than that.\"",
      "I asked, \"Would you describe it as a love affair?\"",
      "\"Yes, absolutely, a love affair,\" Cannon said. \"Absolutely. Real love. Physically, we were never together. But spiritually, we were.\"",
      "\"In some ways, it sounds like you're describing the love of your life?\"",
      "\"Isn't that interesting?\" said Cannon. \"Wow. Hope you're hearing this, Johnny!\"",
      "Maybe Carson was just like so many of us, full of contradictions \u2026 only ours aren't examined by millions under the brightest lights our culture has to offer. Whoever Johnny Carson was, safe to say, in our deeply fragmented culture, there will never be another.",
      "As Mike Thomas put it, \"We're all siloed. We're all watching things that either confirm our own biases or that are attuned to our own specific sense of humor. There will never be that communal experience again where people watch the show at the same time and then talk about the show the next day. It was a communal experience. That was part of the magic of Carson: community.\"",

      "It might be known as winter elsewhere, but in Hollywood, they call it \"awards season\" \u2026 and just about everyone's in town for tonight's grand finale. One of the stars of \"Conclave,\" John Lithgow, is looking forward to it. \"Yes, I haven't been to the Oscars in years.\"",

      "Also in town: esteemed actor Geoffrey Rush. He might live Down Under, but he's picked up a few awards up here, including a Tony, an Oscar, and an Emmy, or as he puts it, \"a TOE.\"",
      "We got both Rush and Lithgow in the same room to talk about something they've done together. In \"The Rule of Jenny Pen,\" Rush plays a wheelchair-bound stroke patient recovering in a nursing home, and Lithgow is the merciless bully who terrorizes his fellow residents, often with a sinister doll puppet, named Jenny Pen.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"The Rule of Jenny Pen,\" click on the video player below:",
      "If it looks like a low-budget horror film, that's because it is!",
      "\"Lot of times, this is how people get their start in the business \u2013 they do a low-budget horror movie,\" I said.",
      "\"This is where we ended up!\" said Rush.",
      "\"Geoffrey's just one of the great actors,\" said Lithgow. \"And you just read the script and said, 'This is a hell of a double act.'\"",
      "\"I thought I was reading for the doll!\" said Rush.",
      "Lithgow's character starts out as merely sinister, and quickly graduates to terrifying. It's the classic horror film villain, and for Lithgow, a role with teeth.",
      "Rush said, \"Typical John, he said, 'I've had some teeth made.' And I thought, 'You're my kind of actor,' because really, the first time I saw the face, I just went, 'This guy is creepy.'\"",
      "\"Look, we're in the impact business,\" Lithgow said. \"You're after making people laugh, cry, or scream out in terror. And this was scream-out-in-terror time, with deep feeling sort of invested in it.\"",
      "Lithgow's been evoking deep feelings for more than half a century. But before he was the acclaimed movie star. He was the acclaimed stage actor, the guy in David Storey's play \"The Changing Room\" who made winning a Tony look easy, picking up the award just two weeks after making his first appearance on a Broadway stage. \"I think I must have the record for the quickest win sprint from Broadway debut to a Tony Award,\" he said.",
      "Rush has a similar story: He also won a Tony for his Broadway debut, 2009's \"Exit the King.\" And the movie \"Shine,\" about real-life pianist David Helfgott, was only his second feature film. He still can't believe he took home the Oscar for best actor. \"It still doesn't make sense,\" he said.",
      "But it was hardly beginner's luck. Both Rush and Lithgow have had once-in-a-lifetime roles \u2026. again and again.",
      "I asked, \"Has there ever been a role that the guy sitting next to you had that you looked at and said either, 'Wow. That was perfect,' or, 'Ooh, I wish I could have played that'?\"",
      "Lithgow said, \"I don't know. I defer to an actor who does a much better job than I could possibly do in that role. I was the second choice for Hannibal Lecter. If Tony Hopkins had turned it down, it was coming to me. And there's no way I could have played that part as well as he did.\"",
      "\"Wow, that's a bold statement,\" said Rush.",
      "\"It's true! And I feel that way about Geoffrey in 'Shine.' That was his role. It belonged to him. And there's no point being \u2026\"",
      "\"What John doesn't know is that I got offered most of the roles that he's got first!\" Rush laughed.",
      "Truth is, just about any role they play is iconic. And with director James Ashcroft's \"Jenny Pen,\" they get to do something extra-special: act their age.",
      "Rush recalled, \"I said to James Ashcroft, 'How old is this judge in the film?' He said, 'How old are you now?' I said, 'I'm 73.' He said, 'Let's make him 73.' And that's the first time I've played my own age.\"",
      "Lithgow said, \"Geoffrey and I have the great advantage of having grown to a certain age where we are each other's only competition. You get the great old man roles dealing with big issues like mortality and facing the loss of your own viability and the loss of your own cognition. It's been a blessing. I mean, my career has sort of aged along with me. And who would have believed I would still be going strong at this point?\"",

    "published": "Sat, 01 Mar 2025 13:58:11 -0500",
    "summary": "David Johansen, the gravelly-voiced singer, was last surviving member of the glam and protopunk band the New York Dolls.",
    "story": [
      "David Johansen, the wiry, gravelly-voiced singer and last surviving member of the glam and protopunk band the New York Dolls who later performed as his campy, pompadoured alter ego, Buster Poindexter, has died. He was 75.",
      "Johansen died Friday at his home in New York City, Jeff Kilgour, a family spokesperson told The Associated Press. It was revealed in early 2025 that he had stage 4 cancer and a brain tumor.",
      "The New York Dolls were forerunners of punk and the band's style - teased hair, women's clothes and lots of makeup - inspired the glam movement that took up residence in heavy metal a decade later in bands like Faster Pussycat and M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce.",
      "\"When you're an artist, the main thing you want to do is inspire people, so if you succeed in doing that, it's pretty gratifying,\" Johansen told The Knoxville News-Sentinel in 2011.",
      "Rolling Stone once called the Dolls \"the mutant children of the hydrogen age\" and Vogue called them the \"darlings of downtown style, tarted-up toughs in boas and heels.\"",
      "\"The New York Dolls were more than musicians; they were a phenomenon. They drew on old rock 'n' roll, big-city blues, show tunes, the Rolling Stones and girl groups, and that was just for starters,\" Bill Bentley wrote in \"Smithsonian Rock and Roll: Live and Unseen.\"",
      "The band never found commercial success and was torn by internal strife and drug addictions, breaking up after two albums by the middle of the decade. In 2004, former Smiths frontman and Dolls admirer Morrissey convinced Johansen and other surviving members to regroup for the Meltdown Festival in England, leading to three more studio albums.",
      "In the '80s, Johansen assumed the persona of Buster Poindexter, a pompadour-styled lounge lizard who had a hit with the kitschy party single \"Hot, Hot, Hot\" in 1987. He also appeared in such movies as \"Candy Mountain,\" \"Let It Ride,\" \"Married to the Mob\" and had a memorable turn as the Ghost of Christmas Past in Bill Murray-led hit \"Scrooged.\"",
      "Johansen was in 2023 the subject of Martin Scorsese and David Tedeschi's documentary \"Personality Crisis: One Night Only,\" which mixed footage of his two-night stand at the Caf\u00e9 Carlyle in January 2020 with flashbacks through his wildly varied career and intimate interviews.",
      "\"I used to think about my voice like: 'What's it gonna sound like? What's it going to be when I do this song?' And I'd get myself into a knot about it,\" Johansen told The Associated Press in 2023. \"At some point in my life, I decided: 'Just sing the (expletive) song. With whatever you got.' To me, I go on stage and whatever mood I'm in, I just claw my way out of it, essentially.\"",
      "David Roger Johansen was born to a large, working class Catholic family on Staten Island, his father an insurance salesman. He filled notebooks with poems and lyrics as a young man and liked a lot of different music - R&B, Cuban, Janis Joplin and Otis Redding.",
      "The Dolls - the final original lineup included guitarists Sylvain Sylvain and Johnny Thunders, bassist Arthur Kane and drummer Jerry Nolan - rubbed shoulders with Lou Reed and Andy Warhol in the Lower East Side of Manhattan the early 1970s.",
      "They took their name from a toy hospital in Manhattan and were expected to take over the throne vacated by the Velvet Underground in the early 1970s. But neither of their first two albums - 1973's \"New York Dolls,\" produced by Todd Rundgren, nor \"Too Much Too Soon\" a year later produced by Shadow Morton - charted.",
      "\"They're definitely a band to keep both eyes and ears on,\" read the review of their debut album in Rolling Stone, complementary of their \"strange combination of high pop-star drag and ruthless street arrogance.\"",
      "Their songs included \"Personality Crisis\" (\"You got it while it was hot/But now frustration and heartache is what you got\"), \"Looking for a Kiss\" (I need a fix and a kiss\") and a \"Frankenstein\" (Is it a crime/For you to fall in love with Frankenstein?\")",
      "Their glammed look was meant to embrace fans with a nonjudgmental, noncategorical space. \"I just wanted to be very welcoming,\" Johansen said in the documentary, \"'cause the way this society is, it was set up very strict - straight, gay, vegetarian, whatever... I just kind of wanted to kind of like bring those walls down, have a party kind of thing.\"",
      "Rolling Stone, reviewing their second album, called them \"the best hard-rock band in America right now\" and called Johansen a \"talented showman, with an amazing ability to bring characters to life as a lyricist.\"",
      "Decades later, the Dolls' influence would be cherished. Rolling Stone would list their self-titled debut album at No. 301 of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, writing \"it's hard to imagine the Ramones or the Replacements or a thousand other trash-junky bands without them.\"",
      "Blondie's Chris Stein in the Nolan biography \"Stranded in the Jungle\" wrote that the Dolls were \"opening a door for the rest of us to walk through.\" Tommy Lee of Motley Crue called them early inspirations.",
      "\"Johansen is one of those singers, to be a little paradoxical, who is technically better and more versatile than he sounds,\" said the Los Angeles Times in 2023. \"His voice has always been a bit of a foghorn - higher or lower according to age, habits and the song at hand - but it has a rare emotional urgency.",
      "The Dolls, representing rock at it's most debauched, were divisive. In 1973, they won the Creem magazine poll categories as the year's best and worst new group. They were nominated several times for The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame but never got in.",
      "\"Dirty angels with painted faces, the Dolls opened the box usually reserved for Pandora and unleashed the infant furies that would grow to become Punk,\" wrote Nina Antonia in the book \"Too Much, Too Soon.\" \"As if this legacy wasn't enough for one band, they also trashed sexual boundaries, savaged glitter and set new standards for rock 'n' roll excess.\"",
      "By the end of their first run, the Dolls were being managed by legendary promoter Malcolm McLaren, who would later introduce the Sex Pistols to the Dolls' music. Culture critic Greil Marcus in \"Lipstick Traces: A Secret History of the Twentieth Century\" writes the Dolls played him some of their music and he couldn't believe how bad they were.",
      "\"The fact that they were so bad suddenly hit me with such force that I began to realize, ''I'm laughing, I'm talking to these guys, I'm looking at them, and I'm laughing with them; and I was suddenly impressed by the fact that I was no longer concerned with whether you could play well,\" McLaren said. \"The Dolls really impressed upon me that there was something else. There was something wonderful. I thought how brilliant they were to be this bad.\"",
      "After the first demise of the Dolls, Johansen started his own group, the David Johansen band, before reinventing himself yet again in the 1980s as Buster Poindexter.",
      "Inspired by his passion for the blues and arcane American folk music Johansen also formed the group The Harry Smiths, and toured the world performing the songs of Howlin' Wolf with Hubert Sumlin and Levon Helm. He also hosted the weekly radio show \"The Mansion of Fun\" on Sirius XM and painted.",
      "He is survived by his wife, Mara Hennessey, and a stepdaughter, Leah Hennessey.",

What's the plan for flu vaccines this year,\" Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA advisory committee and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told CBS News.",

      "\"The FDA will make public its recommendations to manufacturers in time for updated vaccines to be available for the 2025-2026 influenza season,\" the spokesperson, Andrew Nixon, said in a statement.",
      "It is possible for the FDA to make the pick for flu shots without consulting the panel, a former federal health official said, though it would be unprecedented in recent history.",
      "The panel often largely adopts the WHO's recommendations without changes. However, the committee's input has also spurred major changes in recent years, like a push to abandon use of a now-extinct flu strain in the shots.",
      "The companies that manufacture influenza vaccines rely on the FDA each year to pick out the strains to use in shots made for the American market. The specific strains are chosen each year based on predictions of what flu variants will be circulating in the coming winter.",
      "That selection is usually done by the committee in early March, drawing in large part on recommendations from a meeting of the World Health Organization's advisers reviewing data on influenza from across the Northern Hemisphere.",

    "summary": "Recalled supplemental shakes were distributed to hospitals and long-term care facilities nationwide, federal officials say.",
    "story": [
      "A long-running listeria outbreak only recently linked to recalled frozen supplemental nutrition shakes has infected 38 people, killing 12, according to an update on Monday from federal and state health officials.",
      "The infections, which ranged across 21 states, were traced this month to products manufactured by Prairie Farms Dairy at a facility in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and subsequently recalled. Swabs collected from the plant's processing area tested positive for listeria, with the investigation ongoing, the Food and Drug Administration\u00a0stated\u00a0in an alert.",
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first investigated the outbreak in 2018, and then again in 2021 and 2023, each time identifying that sick people were in long-term care facilities and nursing homes but unable to identify a specific food. \"CDC reopened the investigation in October 2024 after six new illnesses were reported. In February 2025 after traceback identified a product of interest, the outbreak strain was found in environmental samples from Prairie Farm,\" according to the agency.",
      "The following states have reported cases of listeria tied to the recalled shakes: Alabama, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and West Virginia.",
      "The ongoing outbreak includes illnesses dating back to 2018, with a total 20 cases occurring this year and in 2024, according to the CDC.",
      "Of the 38 people for whom information is available, 37 have been hospitalized and 12 deaths have been reported as of Monday. The vast majority of those who were infected with listeria reported living in a long-term care facility or being hospitalized before becoming sick, the CDC said.",
      "The death toll linked to the Prairie Farms Dairy shakes is greater than one in 2024 connected to deli meats made by Boar's Head that resulted in 10 deaths and 57 illnesses in what was labeled the worst listeria outbreak since one in 2011 linked to cantaloupe.",
      "Listeria monocytogenes can cause serious, and sometimes fatal, infections in the young, frail or elderly, as well as in people with weakened immune systems. While healthy individuals may suffer from more minor symptoms, including fever, headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, the infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.",
      "Fresno, California-based food maker Lyons Magnus on Feb. 22\u00a0recalled four-ounce Lyons ReadyCare and Sysco Imperial Frozen Supplemental Shakes supplied by Prairie Farms and distributed mostly to nursing homes nationwide. The recalled products had best-by-dates of February 21, 2025, to February 21, 2026, and came in vanilla, chocolate, strawberry or strawberry banana.",
      "Lyons Magnus said any consumer with the recalled product should \"quarantine\" the item. For more information, visit the company's website or contact it at\u00a0frozenshakerecall@lyonsmagnus.com.",

The move by the Spartanburg, South Carolina-based brand comes weeks after fellow breakfast chain Waffle House added an egg surcharge. The 70-year-old Denny's brand involves 1,499 restaurants, most of them in the U.S. and run by franchisees, according to its website.",
      "The company\u00a0said it attempts to plan ahead \"to minimize the impact market volatility has on our costs and menu pricing,\" but still has to charge more given the nationwide egg shortage and increased cost of eggs, the company said in a statement.",
      "In adding its 50-cent per egg surcharge earlier this month, Waffle House expressed hope that the spikes in egg prices would be short-lived, but added \"we cannot predict how long this shortage will last.\"",
      "According to a forecast by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the price of eggs will rise 20% this year.",
      "Bird flu, also known as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), was confirmed in a commercial flock in the U.S. three years ago. The outbreak has worsened in recent months, with nearly 19 million birds in commercial and backyard flocks slaughtered in the last 30 days, according\u00a0to\u00a0the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.",
      "The average price of a dozen large, grade-A eggs came to $4.95 in January, up from $4.15 in December, according\u00a0to\u00a0the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "International House of Pancakes, or IHOP, \u00a0earlier this month signaled that the high cost of eggs has not affected menu prices at its 1,811 restaurants around the U.S. and in other countries. The restaurant chain did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Mar 2025 10:58:46 -0500",
    "summary": "Has the rise of streaming services, and the ability to watch movies on mobile phones, changed what we expect, or want, movies to be? A leading filmmaker, critic, and movie executives discuss the evolution of Hollywood's \"Dream Factory.\"",
    "story": [
      "Hollywood has been re-inventing itself for more 100 years. Change is part of the culture. But a pocket-sized \"Sunset Boulevard\"? That's not a close-up!",
      "We visited the Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles. Built in 1922, it was home of the very first Hollywood premiere, when Douglas Fairbanks debuted \"Robin Hood\" there. It was a big, spectacular night in Tinsel Town. Today, the Egyptian is owned by the world's largest streaming service, Netflix, which spent $70 million to renovate the movie palace.",
      "Why? According to Ted Sarandos, the co-CEO of Netflix, seeing movies in a theater is inspiring. \"I could think back to my first time being in a movie theater watching 'Jaws' at 11 years old. And I remember like it was yesterday \u2013 popcorn went this way, and the soda went this way, and the audience screamed. And that's a very unique and different experience.\"",
      "And an increasingly distant one. Today, screens are smaller, and ticket prices higher. It all leads to a common refrain: \"They don't make 'em like they used to.\"",
      "\"It's probably like everything else; the thing we grew up on is what we want,\" said Sarandos. \"It's oftentimes the art forms move on, and advances in ways that we kind of miss the old version of it. But they do make movies like they used to. And I think they're better than ever.\"",
      "That, of course, is debatable. What's not in doubt is that the big movies are far more predictable than ever. In 2024, the top 15 films at the box office were all franchises, sequels, or reboots.",
      "Sarandos said, \"The business has become very stratified. Either movies are gigantic spectaculars built to make billions of dollars, or they're very small, independent films. And there's not much in the middle anymore.\"",
      "Tom Rothman, who runs Sony's motion picture group, said, \"Movies still do really well, and big movies are still really big, right? But what's missing at the moment, I believe, is a range and a breadth of originality.\"",
      "Rothman, like Sarandos, is among the most powerful people in this business. His films do stream on Netflix, but only after they play in theaters. \"You can have quality or you can have quantity; it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to have both quality and quantity together,\" said Rothman. \"What does streaming have? It has quantity. Okay, so that's a very broad, wide net. And \u2026 it's a very low bar.\"",
      "Nancy Meyers has made films that have earned more than $1.5 billion. She's the writer and director of hit romantic comedies like \"The Holiday,\" \"Something's Gotta Give,\" and \"It's Complicated.\" She believes the shift to, let's call it \"the super-hero formula\" has killed off the types of movies many of us have loved for generations.",
      "\"There is an enormous difference,\" Meyers said. \"I felt in the '90s a freedom to have ideas that people would want to make \u2013 I wasn't worried that they wouldn't be open to the kind of movies that I make.\"",
      "\"Creativity and originality, you saw as an asset?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, I did!\" she laughed. \"Character, wit, comedy, heart, big screen. I had no crystal ball. I couldn't see into the future of how movies were gonna change.\"",
      "The change, says Meyers, means films like \"Chinatown,\" \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" even \"Dirty Dancing\" might not get made today. \"Movies, it's always been a business to make money, always,\" she said. \"But they were less afraid, I think. They were less afraid. They took more chances.\"",
      "Michael Schulman, who writes about movies and culture for The New Yorker, and is author of the book \"Sscar Wars,\" said, \"I would love for the movies to be a little bit less like they used to. Every two seconds there's a new 'Superman,' 'Beetlejuice,' 'Lion King,' 'Alien,' 'Mission: Impossible,' 'Bridget Jones,' 'Indiana Jones.' The goal is to not come up with the next great idea, but to excite the shareholders about a sure bet for the next quarter.\"",
      "Schulman says the movies we grew up on are still out there, produced by the independent studios behind \"Anora\" (Neon), \"The Brutalist\" (A24), and other best picture nominees. Schulman said, \"I often hear people say when the list comes out for the Academy Awards, 'Well, I haven't heard of half of those movies.' \u00a0If you go to the movie theater and they have ten screens showing 'Captain America: Brave New World' and no 'Brutalist,' then there's your problem.\"",
      "Netflix's Sarandos said, \"Even now, the average American goes to the movie theaters twice a year. The average Netflix member watches seven movies a month. So, I feel like that's gotta be good for the business, and it's gotta be good for the art of storytelling to have a platform, and an audience of 700 million people who still watch movies, when they could watch TikTok videos, they could watch YouTube clips, they could be listening to podcasts. But they still watch movies.\"",
      "What Sarandos knows (and what many of us may be trying to avoid admitting) is this:\u00a0 If they don't make movies like they used to, it might be because we don't watch 'em like we used to. \"There's all this opportunity, I think, to get the history of this art form, the history of storytelling, the history of humans, on the screen,\" he said. \"If the screen is gigantic here, or a good-sized at home, or even small on your phone, I don't think it's sacrilege for someone to watch a great movie on their phone. I'd much rather them do that than not watch movies at all.\"",
      "Tom Rothman and Nancy Meyers concede there's value in streaming movies at home. But what they want \u2013 and what they believe the audience wants \u2013 is something cinematic.",
      "\"The movie experience is not on your phone,\" Rothman said. \"A movie experience is a collective, big-screen experience. You're there, you're in the dark.\"",
      "Hollywood, said Meyers, \"used to be called a dream factory, right? And somebody's dream is up on the screen \u2013 somebody's version of a world that you get pulled into and you get sucked into. The lights come up at the end and, you know, you've been somewhere. You've had an experience when we're in a movie theater. That's what a movie is.\"",
      "Watch an extended interview with Nancy Meyers:",
      "I said, \"There are movies being made that meet the standard of bold originality. But there aren't many. And it feels \u2013 and maybe it always felt this at all moments where there was a sea change in Hollywood \u2013 but it feels like the hill is too steep to climb.\"",
      "\"I love that question,\" said Rothman. \"The hill is steep, and the climb is hard. But it is not too steep, and it is not too hard, if you're tough and bold enough, right? And if it were easy, anybody could do it. And it's not easy. And you have to be willing to risk, and you have to be willing to fail.\"",

      "While inflation has plunged from its recent peak of about 9% in June 2022, it still remains higher than the Fed's goal of driving it to an annual rate of 2%. Today's PCE data follows on the heels of the most recent CPI report, which showed that inflation accelerated in January to 3% on an annual basis.",
      "What economists say",
      "The PCE report shows that inflation \"rose at a mild pace in January, which offers some relief after a string of economic reports suggesting that inflation is heating up again,\" said Key Wealth managing director of fixed income investments Rajeev Sharma in an email.",
      "The recent sticky CPI report had reinforced the Fed's decision in January to\u00a0pause\u00a0on additional rate cuts, but today's data suggests that the central bank could still introduce more reductions this year. That said, \"thoughts of multiple rate cuts for 2025 may be overly optimistic based on today's data,\" Sharma added.",

    "summary": "Trump officials remain on course to hit Canada and Mexico with 25% tariffs on March 4, with a wave of other levies ready to roll.",
    "story": [
      "Experts are expressing concern that steep new U.S. tariffs primed to take effect on March 4, along with planned levies on other trading partners, could fan inflation and slow the nation's growth \u2014 an economic malaise known as \"stagflation.\"",
      "President Trump on Thursday said on social media that 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which had been delayed for a month while the sides negotiated, will now roll out\u00a0next week as scheduled. He also this week announced an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, on top of those already in place, set to kick in next week, while\u00a025% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are lined up for March 12. Sweeping reciprocal tariffs and levies on\u00a0automobile imports\u00a0may be deployed as soon as early April, while Mr. Trump has threatened to hit imports from the European Union with 25% duties.",
      "Mounting uncertainty about the scale and potential impact of such tariffs, including the \"somewhat abrupt and arbitrary way\" in which they've been announced, risks throttling spending by consumers and businesses, said Marcus Noland, director of studies at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan research firm.",
      "\"Normally I'd say tariffs alone would damage the economy, but won't send the U.S. into recession,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"What gives me pause about that now is the unsettling way that that the administration is going about its business and general confusion about tariffs. It's not so much the actual tariffs but confusion about them that's causing an increase in uncertainty and is really pushing down investment.\"",
      "EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said the Trump tariffs, \"if pushed to their extreme,\" could even trigger a recession. U.S. businesses would bear the added costs from taxes on imports and mostly pass them along to American consumers, which would weigh on spending.",
      "A recent survey from EY-Parthenon found that 50% of business executives said they would pass on two-thirds or more of any increased costs they incur from tariffs to consumers.",
      "\"In a world where your imports cost 25% more, or even 10% more, there is going to be a notable impact on prices and inflation,\" Daco told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That will lead to demand destruction, so if the administration presses too hard on the tariff front there is a negative effect on our import prices and on inflation.\"",
      "Fears of a trade war are raising concerns among businesses and consumers, he added. U.S. consumer confidence plunged in February in what was the biggest monthly decline in more than four years, a sign that growing uncertainty over Trump's policies is taking a toll, the Conference Board said this week.",
      "\"They are fearful of incoming inflation so if anything, the policies put in place have the tendency to be inflationary, and there is not only a risk of a recession, but stagnation,\" Daco said, referring to the periods intense economic distress in the 1970s marked by stagnant economic growth and high inflation.",
      "U.S. consumer spending fell in January compared to the previous month, dropping for the first time in nearly two years, according to data from the Commerce Department. The 0.5% slump was partly attributed to weather, but was also \"another illustration that President Trump's tariff threats are not sitting well with households,\" analysts with Capital Economics said in a report.",

    "summary": "\"We are already short-staffed as it is,\"one Social Security Administration employee said of the agency's plans to slash its workforce.",
    "story": [
      "Social Security Administration workers are warning that the Trump administration's plan to significantly shrink the agency could cause chaos and hinder their ability to provide service to the millions of retirees, disabled people and other Americans who rely on the program.",
      "The SSA's restructuring comes after President Trump vowed on the campaign trail not to touch the old-age and disability insurance program, which provides monthly financial payments to almost 70 million people, or about 1 in 5 Americans. At the same time, Mr. Trump and Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla who is serving as a close adviser to the president, are vowing to cut what they say is fraud and abuse across federal agencies through the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "But current Social Security employees caution that cutting the already strained Social Security workforce could impact beneficiaries in numerous ways, such as longer waits to qualify for disability benefits and for assistance on customer service issues.",
      "\"We are already short-staffed as it is,\" said one current Social Security Administration employee, an attorney who works on disability applications and who spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern that speaking publicly could jeopardize his job at the agency.",
      "\"Right now we are working on applications generally from 2023-ish,\" he noted. But, he added, a significant workforce reduction could mean that \"easily the wait times will be extended by one year.\"",
      "Each year, thousands of people awaiting disability decisions die before they receive their benefits, with former Social Security Administration Commissioner Martin O'Malley telling Nextgov/FCW in 2024 that about 30,000 people died while awaiting their determinations during fiscal 2023.",
      "Most workers qualify for Social Security disability coverage through their payroll taxes, which provides a backstop in case you get injured and aren't able to continue working, the Social Security worker noted. But cutting agency staff likely means it could become even more difficult for many disabled workers to get their benefits approved, he added.",
      "The Social Security Administration didn't immediately return a request for comment.",
      "Cuts come amid boomers turning \"peak 65\"",
      "The SSA on Thursday sent an email to all employees stating that the agency would soon undergo a restructuring, including \"significant workforce reductions.\" On Friday, the agency said it plans to trim staffing to 50,000 workers, down from its current level of about 57,000 workers.",
      "The agency is also offering financial incentives ranging as high as $25,000 to some employees who choose to voluntarily resign.",
      "The agency's workforce cuts come as the ranks of Americans receiving Social Security benefits have swelled to an all-time high, largely due to the aging baby boomer population. An average of about 11,000 boomers are set to turn 65 each day this year through 2027, according to a\u00a0report\u00a0from the Alliance for Lifetime Income.",
      "That demographic change, called \"peak 65,\" is causing major economic and societal changes, with Social Security on the receiving end. Since 2014, the number of retired workers and their dependents receiving Social Security payments has surged by almost 30%, reaching 54 million people as of last year, according to agency data.",
      "At the same time, the number of full-time workers at the Social Security Administration has declined almost 10% from about 63,000 employees in 2014 to about 57,000 workers in 2022, agency data\u00a0shows.",
      "Even before these pending cuts, some recipients were struggling with service issues at the Social Security Administration, Nancy Altman, the president of the advocacy group Social Security Works, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You've got wait times, you have phone calls that get dropped, you get put on hold for hours \u2014 and this will make it so much worse,\" she said.",
      "Long wait times for callers seeking help from the Social Security Administration's workforce was identified as a trouble spot in the agency's most recent\u00a0annual performance report. Its goal: To shave an average 34-minute on-hold wait time to 12 minutes, although the agency said it was evaluating that \"aspirational goal\" as it was unable to hire additional workers last year.",
      "Workers taking buyouts",
      "Some Social Security employees are already opting for the buyouts, which could lead to a brain drain at the administration, another agency employee told CBS MoneyWatch. The employee, who also spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns for his job safety, noted that several people in his group told him they planned to accept buyout offers.",
      "Because Social Security workers with 25 years of experience are eligible for the buyouts, the agency will lose some of its most experienced workers, he added.",
      "\"You are going to see a slowdown in everything,\" he said.",
      "Morale at the agency is at \"an all-time low,\" a third Social Security employee said, who spoke on condition of anonymity as she is still employed at the agency.",
      "Employees were also distressed by Acting Social Security Commissioner Lee Dudek's response to Elon Musk's demand that workers detail five recent work accomplishments. In an email sent to staff, Dudek singled out firing probationary workers as one of his personal achievements. \"It left a very bad taste in our mouths,\" the employee said.",
      "Many agency workers receive modest salaries, the third Social Security worker added. All the Social Security employees who spoke with CBS MoneyWatch said they were drawn to the agency because they wanted to help people.",
      "About 80% of Social Security workers earn somewhere between Grades 5 to 12 on the federal general schedule pay scale, which includes a starting pay range between about $33,000 to $74,000 a year, agency data shows.",
      "Americans fund the Social Security Administration's services through their payroll taxes, or FICA contributions, noted Rich Couture, the spokesman for the Social Security General Committee of the American Federation of Government Employees.",
      "\"The public paid for access to services with their FICA contributions,\" Couture said. \"We're at a 50-year staffing low in the midst of a customer service crisis \u2014 now is the time for us to invest in Social Security with proper staffing to make further improvements.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 15:45:27 -0500",
    "summary": "The man who launched the Economic Blackout said he is \"trying to cause economic resistance, against the corporations and politicians,  to stand for the people.\"",
    "story": [
      "After years of railing against corporate greed on social media, John Schwarz had an idea that suddenly caught fire: an \"economic blackout\" aimed at resisting what he maintains is an alliance between corporations and politicians to rig the system against ordinary Americans.",
      "The 57-year-old Chicago resident, founder of the People's Union USA, the fledgling advocacy group leading the campaign, expresses surprise at suddenly finding himself and his movement in the spotlight. Yet while he initially found the attention overwhelming, Schwarz said that in other ways it's a moment he's been preparing for all of his life.",
      "\"I've been online for 10 years trying to do this in kind of a nice way, not really speaking as bluntly on specific topics,\" Schwarz told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And then after that, I said, no, this is great because this is exactly what I wanted to do. And I just dove in head first and we're not stopping.\"",
      "Schwartz, a father of three and meditation teacher, said the idea for a blackout came to him while recording the latest in a series of videos posted on social media in which he presents himself as a common man who is also president of the United States.",
      "\"When I was into about the third or fourth one of those, I said even a president should be calling for an economic blackout and to unionize citizens. And when I kind of said that, it sparked that idea in me. And I said, you know what, as a matter of fact let's do this. Let's do an economic blackout \u2014 get a bunch of people together for one day, if they want to take part and start something, and try to work on unionizing the people.\"",
      "Over the past month, word has spread quickly of the Feb. 28 Economic Blackout, which urges Americans to refrain from spending any money at any major retailer for 24 hours. The People's Union says it is apolitical and that its call for a boycott \u2014 communicated by punchy posts on Instagram and TikTok set to music, as well by text an email \u2014 is meant to fire a shot across the bow of corporate giants from Amazon to McDonald's.",
      "\"Mega corporations have driven up prices, underpaid their workers and outsourced jobs while raking in record profits,\" the group said on its website. \"Banks and financial institutions have trapped generations in debt, inflating interest rates and making homeownership nearly impossible. Politicians 'both left and right' have accepted corporate bribes, passed laws that serve billionaires and ignored the needs of the people they claim to represent.\"",
      "Schwarz said he grew up in the 1970s and '80s \"in the projects,\" referring to the subsidized housing where he was raised in Queens, New York. He describes that neighborhood as a melting pot of Jewish, Black, Polish, Russian and other families.",
      "\"We didn't walk around going, 'Oh, you're white, you're black, you're Russian.' It was just, we were all from the neighborhood,\" he said. \"I think there's a way to kind of get to that feeling with everyone in this country, because we're so divided today. We're more divided today on more subjects than any other time in history.\"",
      "Schwarz underlines that the goal of reunifying Americans is fundamental to him and the People's Union. His idols include Muhammad Ali, Martin Luther King Jr., social activist Abbie Hoffman, and politician and civil rights leader Harvey Milk, individuals he said he admires for dedicating their lives to speaking out 'for the people.' \"",
      "What does the People's Union USA stand for?",
      "Schwarz founded the People's Union USA only in February, and as a grassroots organization the group is still in the process of setting up its structure and registering as a legal entity. To cover the costs, Schwarz has set up a GoFundMe page with the goal of raising $100,000, and as of Friday has raised more than $90,000.",
      "Schwarz sees the blackout as a way for Americans to use their economic might in the form of their purchasing power to fight corporate greed and corrupt politicians.",
      "\"What we're doing here is trying to cause economic resistance, against the corporations and politicians, to stand for the people. I think people may be able to at some point begin to kind of realize those things they're letting divide us don't really exist,\" he said.",
      "Another goal for The People's Union is abolishing federal income\u00a0taxes for average Americans, which Schwarz said can be achieved by requiring large businesses to pay \"their fair share.\"",
      "Added Schwarz, \"And even, you know, the administration is just putting their foot in their mouth with wanting to do, you know, gold card visas for $5 million. So they're talking about bringing in more money, all the more reason we shouldn't have to pay federal taxes.\"",
      "Schwarz also favors imposing a government cap on corporate profits. \"Companies need to prove what their expenses are in comparison to their profits. And there has to be a reasonable cap.\"",
      "More broadly, Schwarz underlines the importance of Americans gaining a measure of freedom from an economic system that he believes normalizes financial struggle and traps people in a perpetual cycle of debt.",
      "What's the point of the boycotts?",
      "Schwarz doesn't expect the Economic Blackout to change things for the better overnight but he does think it will send corporations a message.",
      "\"We want companies to bend the knee \u2014 we've been kissing the ring our entire lives. It's time to turn that around,\" he said, adding \"We're the consumers. We are the economy. Without us, they're nothing.\"",
      "Schwarz said messages of support for the Economic Blackout have also been pouring in from people outside of the U.S. \"It's gone international, from Australia to Spain. Every country has messaged me, people from all over the world commenting on the videos. 'How can we stand in solidarity?'\"",
      "\"I just started telling them, you too, in your country, don't buy anything that day,\" he added.",
      "The Feb. 28 blackout began at 12 a.m. EST Friday and is scheduled to go on until 11:59 p.m. the same day. For the boycott, the People's Union is asking participants to refrain from making purchases, which includes avoiding fast food or filling their gas tanks. It adds that shoppers with emergencies or in need of essentials should support local small businesses and try not to use a credit or debit card.",
      "The group plans to hold a second broad-based economic blackout on March 28, but it's also organizing targeted boycotts against specific retailers \u2014 Walmart and Amazon \u2014 as well as global food giants Nestle and General Mills. For the boycott against Amazon, the organization is encouraging people to refrain from buying anything from Whole Foods, which the e-commerce company owns.",

      "Microsoft is pulling the plug on Skype, the pioneering Internet telecommunications and video call platform it bought\u00a0nearly 14 years ago for $8.5 billion.",
      "\"We will be retiring Skype in May 2025 to focus on Microsoft Teams (free), our modern communications and collaboration hub,\" already used by hundreds of millions of people at work, school and home,\" Jeff Teper, president of collaborative apps and platforms at the Redmond, Washington-based software company,\u00a0said on Friday in a statement.",
      "Microsoft in late 2012\u00a0scrapped its own instant-messaging\u00a0tool, Messenger, after buying Skype the prior year. But in the more than decade since, services including FaceTime, Messenger and WhatsApp have let people connect in ways that made it difficult for Skype to compete.",
      "The difficulties were illustrated in particular during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic that saw people\u00a0stuck at home flocking to Zoom. Microsoft launched Teams for consumers in 2020, while saying at the time it remained committed to Skype.",
      "Skype was launched in 2003 by entrepreneurs Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis, with the company's name combining \"Sky\" with a reference to peer-to-peer networks, the technology that during the dotcom boom became an important new way for sharing online files and data.",
      "The company's founders first sold Skype to eBay in 2005 for $2.6 billion. Microsoft's acquisition in May of 2011, at the time the biggest ever purchase for the software maker, gave it access to a user base of about 170 million people who logged in to Skype each month. That count morphed to more than 300 million monthly users by 2016, but had shriveled to 36 million in 2023, Microsoft said.",
      "Those now using Skype will have time to log in to the Microsoft Teams app and have their message history, group chats and contacts available without having to create an additional account, according to Microsoft. Users can also opt to export their data to another app.",

    "story": [
      "It's not only the surging cost of eggs that is making breakfast pricier these days \u2014 the price of coffee is also spiking because of a confluence of factors.",
      "The cost of wholesale arabica beans \u2014 the most popular on the planet \u2014 surpassed $4 a pound for the first time this month and have doubled over the past year, running up from less than two bucks a pound in January 2024 to a record $4.30 a pound on February 13, 2025, according\u00a0to\u00a0futures contracts traded in New York.",
      "For consumers still grappling with high food costs, that means soaring prices in the grocery aisle. The retail price of ground coffee hit an all-time high of $7 a pound in January, up 75% from $4 in January 2020, government data\u00a0shows.",
      "Coffee drinkers are likely to see even steeper prices over the next three or four months, with Andrea Illy, chairman of Italian roaster and global retailer Illycaff\u00e8, recently\u00a0predicting\u00a0that bean prices could climb 25% this year.",
      "Unlike some products, coffee is viewed as essential by many consumers, making them more willing to pay up for their java fixes. Without a direct substitute for coffee, retailers and suppliers generally have greater room to raise their prices.",
      "\"Coffee, as we all know, it's a pass-through category,\" J.M. Smucker CEO Mark Smucker said in an earnings\u00a0call in November. \"We've been very pleased with our performance in the quarter, despite the fact that we continue to see significant inflation,\" said the executive, whose company's brands include Folgers and Cafe Bustelo.",
      "Cost of climate change",
      "As with the cost of other global commodities, supply and demand are a large part of the equation. Getting caffeinated is likely to become an ever-costlier proposition because of rising temperatures, droughts and excessive rains striking Brazil and Vietnam, the world's two biggest producers.",
      "The 2024 coffee growing season saw a drought followed by August frost in Brazil, and flooding in October came in the wake of a drought in Vietnam. Brazil's coffee exports during the month were down 7.4% year-over-year and Vietnam's December export fell nearly 40%, according to a January\u00a0report\u00a0from the International Coffee Organization.",
      "\"When the crop in Brazil does not produce as much coffee as expected in the year, that causes the prices to shoot up,\" Gregory Zomfotis, founder and CEO of Gregorys Coffee, told CBS News.",
      "\"Some of the major producers have really not seen the production levels that were expected and quite far from it, so that's caused a severe spike in the price of coffee,\" added Zomfotis, whose company operates more than 50 stores nationwide and expect to purchase up to 700,000 pounds of coffee this year.",
      "Amid those supply constraints, global demand for coffee in growing. For example, consumption is up 150% over 10 years in China \u2014 the world's most populous country, according\u00a0to\u00a0the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Other factors also are contributing to the pricing pressures, including politics. President Trump on Tuesday vowed to proceed next week with his previous threats of 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. A levy on Mexico, whose largest coffee export market is the U.S., would likely push prices up further.",
      "Separately, a new European Union law that is now set to take effect in December prohibits the sale of products, including coffee, if companies can't show they are not linked to deforestation\u00a0 \u2014 a bid to lessen greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity loss. That effort to address the climate crisis could further tighten supplies of coffee beans.",
      "Geopolitical conflicts are also a factor in rising coffee costs. Fighting between Israel and Hamas has caused havoc in the Red Sea, which carries 30% of the world's container traffic, including coffee from Vietnam. Slowdowns in the Red Sea and the Suez Canal meant as many as 5 billion bags of coffee had not yet arrived in Europe, the International Coffee Organization reported in December.",

      "The FAA has faced a longstanding shortage of air traffic controllers, while the agency's oversight of the skies has recently faced heightened scrutiny following a\u00a0string of recent aviation incidents. Currently, more than 90% of U.S. airport towers are understaffed, and do not meet standards set by a working group that includes the FAA and the controllers' union, according to a CBS News analysis of FAA data.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy on Thursday announced an effort to \"supercharge\" the hiring of air traffic controllers following a visit to an FAA training institute in Oklahoma, according to a release from the U.S. Department of Transportation.",
      "\"I witnessed firsthand the dedication, skill and rigor that our future air traffic controllers bring to their training and the urgent need to do all that we can to recruit more people to join in our shared mission of safety in our skies,\" Duffy said in a statement. \"This staffing shortage has been a known challenge for over a decade, and this administration is committed to solving it.\"",
      "The FAA announced an air traffic controller hiring window between Feb. 27 and Mar. 17. It said the hiring process will be more efficient by becoming a five-step, rather than an eight-step process. Starting salaries for candidates are also being by 30%; the average certified professional controller makes over $160,000 per year, the FAA noted.",
      "There are approximately 10,800 air traffic controllers working across U.S. airports, which the NATCA says is about 3,600 fewer than \"what is needed to fully staff the National Airspace System.\"",
      "While several hundred probationary workers at the FAA were\u00a0recently fired by the Trump administration through late night emails sent on Feb. 14, \"Zero air traffic controllers and critical safety personnel\" were among those let go according to Duffy in a Feb. 17\u00a0post on X.",

    "summary": "President Trump is floating the idea of a new \"gold card\" visa that would be sold to wealthy foreigners for $5 million.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday unveiled a new pathway to residency: a \"gold card\" aimed at wealthy foreigners willing to pay millions for the right to live in the U.S.",
      "That term is a play on the green card, more officially known as a permanent residency card, which allows non-citizens to live and work permanently in the U.S. Green cards are most frequently awarded to foreigners who marry U.S. citizens or to those who receive one through their employer, with the latter process taking an average of three years to complete, according to the Cato Institute.",
      "The new program comes as the Trump administration moves to change the country's rules for who can legally live, work and gain citizenship in the U.S. That includes tightening restrictions on many types of immigration in the U.S. and pushing to\u00a0end birthright citizenship, the constitutionally protected right to citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil.",
      "The U.S. already opens the door to wealthy non-U.S. citizens who want residency through what is known as an EB-5 visa. But that program, launched in 1990, has long been cited for potential\u00a0abuses, including one prominent case from almost a decade ago that involved owners of a Vermont ski resort embezzling millions from foreign investors who hoped to score visas through the program.",
      "Yet both the new gold card and the EB-5 program have a common goal: Attracting foreign capital by allowing rich non-citizens to ante up in exchange for a U.S. residency visa.",
      "\"It's going to be a route to citizenship, and wealthy people will be coming into our country by buying this card, they'll be wealthy, and they'll be successful and they'll be spending a lot of money and paying a lot of taxes and employing a lot of people,\" Mr. Trump said on Tuesday.",
      "Here's what to know about the gold card plan.",
      "What is Trump's gold card?",
      "The gold card will offer a new route for rich non-U.S. citizens to gain a valid visa to live and work in the U.S., according to Mr. Trump, who spoke Tuesday about the new visa with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick from the Oval Office.",
      "The cost of each new visa will be $5 million, Mr. Trump said.",
      "\"We're going to be putting a price on that card of about $5 million, and that's going to give you green card privileges, plus,\" the president added.",
      "Green cards allow recipients to live permanently in the U.S. and work for whomever they choose. By comparison, some immigrants, such as those on H-1B visas, are locked into working for the employer that sponsored their visa.",
      "Green card holders can also travel in and out of the U.S. without restriction, and are able to start the process to become a U.S. citizen.",
      "When will the gold card be available?",
      "Lutnick said the gold cards would be available starting in about two weeks.",
      "Will the gold card replace the EB-5 visa?",
      "Yes, with Lutnick on Tuesday describing the EB-5 program as \"full of nonsense, make believe and fraud.\"",
      "\"So the President said, rather than having this sort of ridiculous EB-5 program, we're going to end the EB-5 program,\" Lutnick said in joining Mr. Trump to outline the gold card program from the Oval Office. \"We're going to replace it with the Trump Gold Card, which is really a Green Card Gold.\"",
      "One major difference between the gold card and the EB-5 visa \u2014 the cost, with the latter requiring applicants to invest about $1 million in the U.S., typically by putting the money into a business. But the EB-5 visa also comes with a host of other requirements, such as documenting that the investment will create or preserve 10 permanent full-time jobs for U.S. workers.",
      "How much money could the gold card raise for the U.S.?",
      "Mr. Trump suggested that the the U.S. could \"sell maybe a million of these cards, maybe more than that.\"",
      "At $5 million each, selling 1 million gold cards could raise $5 trillion, he said.",
      "\"And if you sell 10 million of the cards, that's a total of $50 trillion,\" Mr. Trump added. \"We have $35 trillion in debt. That'll be nice, so we'll see.\"",
      "Typically, the number of annual applicants for EB-5 visas is far lower than what Mr. Trump projects for the gold card. About 8,000 people obtained investor visas in the 12-month period ending Sept. 30, 2022, according to the Homeland Security Department's most recent Yearbook of Immigration Statistics.",
      "If roughly 8,000 people received gold cards each year, the U.S. would raise about $40 billion annually through the program.",
      "The U.S. is a top immigration destination for rich investors, according to Henley & Partners, a company that provides immigration advisory services. The group estimated\u00a0that the U.S. had the second-biggest net influx of millionaires in 2024, following the United Arab Emirates, at about 3,800 foreign millionaires moving stateside last year.",
      "Who could qualify for a gold card?",
      "Aside from having $5 million to pay the U.S. government, gold card applicants would also have to meet other criteria, Lutnick said.",
      "\"They'll have to go through vetting, of course, we're going to make sure they're wonderful world class global citizens,\" he said, without providing details.",
      "Asked by reporters if Russian oligarchs could qualify for the visa, Mr. Trump responded, \"Possibly.\"",
      "He added, \"Hey, I know some Russian oligarchs that are very nice people. It's possible. They're not as wealthy as they used to be. I think they could afford \u2014 I think they could afford $5 million.\"",
      "Do other nations offer gold cards?",
      "Yes, investor visas are common around the world. More than 100 countries offer \"golden visas\" to wealthy individuals, including the U.S., United Kingdom, Spain, Greece, Malta, Australia, Canada and Italy, according to Henley & Partners.",
      "Does the gold card need congressional approval?",
      "Congress determines qualifications for citizenship, but Mr. Trump said gold cards would not require congressional approval.",
      "\"We have it all worked out from the legal standpoint. It's totally legal to do,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's somewhat like a green card, but at a higher level of sophistication \u2014 it's a road to citizenship for people, and essentially people of wealth or people of great talent, where people of wealth pay for those people of talent to get in, meaning companies will pay for people to get in and to have long, long term status in the country.\"",

      "A large majority of Americans say their incomes aren't keeping pace with inflation, as they report prices around them either rising or staying the same. There's wide concern about the ability to save or buy extras.",
      "As has been the case for years, prices drive so much of Americans' larger views: they say this factors the most into their assessment of the overall economy \u2014 which most continue to say is bad. And then among those who say their own finances aren't good, prices are the top reason why.",
      "This comes amid other economic indicators out lately, including that unemployment claims recently rose, the consumer confidence index dropped; and the S&P slid in recent days toward the end of February.",
      "Americans say their outlook for the next year is also mixed. Right now, people are more likely to say the economy is getting worse than better. Current circumstances play into this too: those most concerned about affording food today are also more apt to think things are getting worse.",
      "Evaluations, as is typical, show splits by financial circumstances though, and may speak to broader divides in the U.S. economy and in the impact of inflation.",
      "Americans who report higher incomes are far more likely to say their financial situation is good and are much more confident about their ability to save \u2013 though the majority of them, too, say income isn't keeping up with inflation.",
      "The outlook going forward remains mixed at best and is also tied to current circumstances:",
      "Just over half expect things to at least hold steady, though only a third expect growth or a boom coming. The rest expect either a slowing or a recession.",
      "At least half the country reports concern about paying for food and groceries, and housing.",
      "Most continue to call the U.S. economy bad \u2014 even more so than last month \u2014 and views have been net-negative among Americans for five years going back to the start of the COVID pandemic.",

    "title": "Tax refunds in 2025 are about $1,000 less than in 2024. Here's why.",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tax-refund-status-2025-irs/",
    "published": "Thu, 27 Feb 2025 17:40:40 -0500",
    "summary": "IRS data shows that the average refund check so far is about $2,200, or $1,000 less than a year earlier. Here's what experts say.",
    "story": [
      "With tax season well underway, early data on the average tax refund shows that Americans are receiving about one-third less than they did a year earlier.",
      "The average refund check in 2025 stood at $2,169 as of Feb. 14, about 32% below the average $3,207 refund issued at the same time last year, the IRS said in its most recent tax update. The agency began accepting tax returns on Jan. 27 and will continue to do so until April 15 except for taxpayers who request an extension.",
      "Those numbers don't necessarily mean that individual taxpayers will get a smaller refund, experts note. Refunds are typically smaller at the start of the tax season because low- and middle-income workers with simpler tax returns are often the first to file, while higher-income Americans or people with more complicated taxes tend to wait until closer to the April 15 deadline to file their returns.",
      "\"Many employees, all they have is a W2 \u2014 they have smaller refunds or smaller amounts to pay because they have withholding through their jobs,\" Keith Hall, CEO of the National Association for the Self-Employed (NASE) and a certified CPA, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "At the same time, Hall said some small business owners are reporting receiving financial tax forms, such as dividend or brokerage account statements, later than in past years. That often leads businesses to hold off on filing with the IRS until they've gathered all their tax documents.",
      "So far, fewer Americans have filed their taxes in the season's opening weeks when compared with 2024, the IRS data shows. About 33 million returns had been submitted through through Feb. 14, a 5% decline from the same period a year ago.",
      "The IRS also noted that tax data tends to \"even out as more tax returns come in.\" In its most recent data release, the agency said it expects tax return filings to \"level out in future weeks as the April filing deadline approaches.\"",
      "When will I get my tax refund?",
      "Taxpayers should file as soon as possible because that will enable them to get their refund faster, Hall said. Other tax experts are also urging consumers to file quickly because of concerns that IRS job cuts ordered by the Trump administration could add to challenges in getting tax returns processed this year.",
      "Most refunds are issued in fewer than 21 calendar days if you file your taxes electronically, according to the IRS. Taxes filed on paper require more time because human IRS agents must process those returns, which can add weeks to getting a refund.",
      "Taxpayers can monitor the status of their 2025 refund using the IRS'\u00a0Where's My Refund?\u00a0tool, with e-filers able to check on their return 24 hours after filing. People who file on paper won't be able to see their refund status for four weeks after they mail their return to the IRS, the agency says.",
      "About half of Americans intend to file their taxes by the end of February, with the other half planning to finish their returns in March and April, according to the National Retail Federation's annual tax return survey. About half of taxpayers say they expect a refund this year, it found.",

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk's Starlink satellite internet service could be part of the Federal Aviation Administration's plan to upgrade the nation's aging air traffic control systems.",
      "Starlink's internet equipment is being tested in least two different FAA facilities.\u00a0Starlink is also preparing to take over a $2 billion contract currently held by telecom provider Verizon, the Associated Press\u00a0reported.",
      "Starlink, which is owned by Musk's SpaceX, provides satellite internet access for residential and business customers. It bills itself as the most \"advanced internet system,\" providing access to users in remote locations. The FAA does not currently rely on Starlink to power its air traffic control system, which monitors more than 45,000 flights and 2.9 million airline passengers per day.",
      "Musk this week criticized the FAA's air traffic control network, writing on X that the \"Verizon system is not working and so is putting air travelers at serious risk.\"",
      "Verizon spokesperson Kevin Israel told CBS News that the technology Musk is referring to are the legacy systems run by defense contractor company L3Harris, not by Verizon.",
      "\"Our company is working on building the next generation system for the FAA which will support the agency's mission for safe and secure air travel,\" he said. \"We are at the beginning of a multiyear contract to replace antiquated, legacy systems. Our teams have been working with the FAA's technology teams and our solution stands ready to be deployed. We continue to partner with the FAA on achieving its modernization objectives.\"",
      "Musk on Thursday acknowledged his mistake in criticizing Verizon. \"Correction: the ancient system that is rapidly declining in capability was made L3Harris. The new system that is not yet operational is from Verizon,\" he said Thursday afternoon on X.",
      "L3Harris didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Broad overhaul",
      "The Department of Transportation is reviewing a range of federal contracts, including with Verizon, as the agency moves to overhaul the air traffic control infrastructure used to direct flights around the U.S.",
      "A source familiar with the matter said it's not clear if Starlink can meet the needs specified in the FAA's contract with Verizon. But the satellite telecom provider could be one of several technologies under consideration as part of a broad overhaul of the nation's air control system.",
      "On Monday, the FAA\u00a0said\u00a0on X that it \"has been considering the use of Starlink since the prior administration to increase reliability at remote sites, including in Alaska.\" The agency also said it is testing one Starlink terminal at the FAA's facility in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and at two terminals at \"non-safety critical sites\" in Alaska.",
      "Bloomberg News\u00a0reported on Monday that Musk last week approved 4,000 Starlink terminals to be shipped to the FAA for testing, citing a person familiar with the matter.",
      "The FAA told CBS News that \"no decisions have been made\" about a long-term contract to upgrade its air traffic control systems.",
      "Representatives for Musk didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Potential conflict",
      "Lawmakers and experts on government contracts have expressed concern about potential conflicts of interest for Musk, who is spearheading the Trump administration's effort to slash federal funding even as companies like SpaceX do business with the government.",
      "Asked by CBS News whether Musk's involvement could pose a conflict of interest given that the FAA regulates SpaceX and his companies are a major user of the airspace, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said earlier this month that the entrepreneur isn't involved in setting agency policy.",
      "\"I was very conscious of anyone who comes in \u2014 I don't want to see conflicts of interest,\" Duffy said on Feb. 19 from the FAA's ATC Command Center in Warrenton, Virginia. \"So [Musk] was talking to air traffic controllers, didn't plug into the system, but looked at the terminals that they use... They had a back and forth about what works well for you, what doesn't work well.\"",
      "\"[T]hey spoke freely about these are the problems that we have. And so it was nothing about the way that SpaceX uses the airspace. It was about how do controllers do their job,\" Duffy added.",
      "Jessica Tillipman, associate dean for government procurement law studies at The George Washington University Law School, noted that federal regulations prohibit government contractors from having conflicts of interest, and warn even against the mere appearance of such conflicts.",
      "Scott Amey, general counsel for the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan watchdog focused on reducing government corruption, told CBS MoneyWatch that Musk's close relationship with President Trump could amount to a conflict of interest.",
      "\"You do worry if there is pressure from the top, even from the president himself, to favor his system over the existing system,\" Amey said. \"People could be afraid to lose their jobs and will do whatever they can to please Elon Musk.\"",
      "Such contracting decisions should be made \"by career civil servants doing what is in the best interest of taxpayers,\" he added.",
      "Some Democratic lawmakers said the FAA moving to adopt Starlink's technology raises potential ethical concerns.",

    "summary": "Figures do not include layoffs ordered by the Department of Government Efficiency. Analysts expect those to show up in coming weeks.",
    "story": [
      "Applications for U.S. jobless benefits rose to a three-month high last week but remained within the same healthy range of the past three years.",
      "The number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the first time rose by 22,000 to 242,000 for the week ending Feb. 22, the Labor Department said Thursday. Analysts had projected that 220,000 new applications would be filed.",
      "Weekly applications for jobless benefits are considered a proxy for layoffs.",
      "The four-week average, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, climbed by 8,500 to 224,000.",
      "Some analysts say they expect layoffs ordered by the Department of Government Efficiency to show up in the report in the coming weeks or months.",
      "\"While still far below recession level, this is the highest number of weekly claims yet this year, and that's a yellow caution light for the economy,\" Andrew Stettner, unemployment insurance (UI) expert at The Century Foundation and former Biden administration UI modernization director, said in a report. \"What's more, these worrying indicators don't include hundreds of thousands of layoffs announced by the federal government.\"",
      "On Wednesday, senior U.S. officials set the government downsizing in motion via a memo dramatically expanding President Donald Trump's efforts to scale back a workforce. Thousands of probationary employees have already been fired, and now the Republican administration is turning its attention to career officials with civil service protection.",
      "Government agencies have been directed to submit by March 13 their plans for what is known as a reduction in force, which would not only lay off employees but eliminate positions altogether.",
      "Despite showing signs of weakening during the past year, the labor market remains healthy.",
      "Earlier this month, the Labor Department reported that U.S. employers added 143,000 jobs in January, significantly fewer than December's 256,000 job gains. However, the unemployment rate ticked down to an even 4%, signaling a still very healthy labor market.",
      "Even so, some economists in their review of the latest jobless data see signs of a potential downturn.",
      "\"Today's figure is a big departure from the previous downtrend. It brings the level of claims back to where they were at the end of last summer, but going the other way this time,\" analysts with High Frequency Economics said in a report.",
      "\"HFE is already forecasting a sharp slowdown in GDP in the first quarter from the fourth to under 1%. We will mark that down further if [President Trump] goes ahead with 25% tariff barriers on the Northern and Southern borders,\" they added.",
      "Continuing claims also rise",
      "Continuing claims in the week ending Feb. 15 were also up, noted Samuel Tombs, chief U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, in a note on the latest jobless claims data.",
      "\"Our final chart shows that continuing claims are closely correlated with the number of people unemployed for less than 26 weeks, said Tombs, adding that \"the number of people who are unemployed but who have exhausted their 26-week entitlement to jobless benefits likely has continued to rise.\"",
      "Late in January, the Federal Reserve left its benchmark lending rate alone after issuing three cuts late in 2024. Fed officials are closely monitoring inflation and the labor market for signs of a potentially weakening economy. They expect only two rate cuts this year, down from previous projections of four.",
      "The most recent government consumer prices report that showed that inflation accelerated last month, creating some doubt about whether the Fed will be moved to cut rates at all this year.",
      "The new jobless benefits claims data shows that inflation has remained stubbornly above the Fed's 2% target for roughly the past six months after it fell steadily for about a year and a half.",
      "The consumer price index increased 3% in January from a year ago, up from a 3 1/2 year low of 2.4% in September. According to the CPI report, egg prices, which\u00a0continue to soar, jumped more than 15% in January from a year ago, to approximately $4.95 a dozen. In 2019, consumers could pick up a dozen eggs for around $1.54, but by last year the price had soared to $4.15 \u2014 a 170% increase, according to\u00a0CBS News' price tracker\u00a0of everyday goods.",
      "Overall, while layoffs remain low by historical standards, some high-profile companies have announced job cuts already this year.",
      "Workday, Dow, CNN, Starbucks, Southwest Airlines and Facebook parent company Meta have all trimmed their workforces already in 2025. Late in 2024, GM, Boeing, Cargill and Stellantis announced layoffs.",
      "The total number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits for the week of Feb. 15 fell by 5,000 to 1.86 million.",

      "Millions of retired teachers, firefighters, police officers and others with public pensions will be reaping the benefits of the recently passed Social Security Fairness Act sooner than first projected, federal officials announced on Tuesday.",
      "The Social Security Administration (SSA) said it was immediately beginning to pay retroactive benefits and will increase monthly payments starting in April to the more than 3.2 million people affected by a law signed in January by\u00a0former President Biden, who said it would mean an average monthly increase of $360 for more than 2.5 million Social Security recipients.",
      "Decades in the making, the Social Security Fairness Act expanded benefits for millions by eliminating two federal\u00a0policies\u00a0that barred employees with a public pension from collecting their full benefits under the federal retirement program. Those same policies also\u00a0reduced\u00a0benefits for such workers' surviving spouses and family members.",
      "How much will Social Security payments increase?",
      "Depending on the type of benefit and pension, the change in payment amount will vary from person to person. \"Some people's benefits will increase very little, while others may be eligible for over $1,000 more each month,\" the Social Security Administration stated.",
      "As Social Security benefits are paid a month behind, most of the affected beneficiaries will start receiving their updated payments in April for their March benefit, the agency noted.",
      "The benefits hike under the law would be retroactive to December 2023. As a result, eligible recipients who previously only received partial benefits will get a full payment retroactive to a year ago.",
      "\"Social Security's aggressive schedule to start issuing retroactive payments in February and increase monthly benefit payments beginning in April supports President Trump's priority to implement the Social Security Fairness Act as quickly as possible,\" Lee Dudek, acting commissioner of Social Security, said in a statement.",
      "SSA in late January cautioned that those impacted might have to wait up to a year or longer to reap the benefits of the Social Security Fairness Act of 2023, which\u00a0became law on January 5, 2025. At the time, the agency noted that the legislation had not provided additional financing or staff to help implement the law or deal with the increased workload.",
      "\"The agency's original estimate of taking a year or more now will only apply to complex cases that cannot be processed by automation,\" Dudek added.",
      "Most eligible Social Security recipients will get their one-time retroactive payment by the end of March, which will be deposited into their bank account on record with the Social Security Administration.",
      "The agency is asking beneficiaries to wait until April to ask about the status of their retroactive payment.",
      "To learn more about the expanded Social Security benefits, including who is eligible and when recipients will see an increase in their payments, visit the Social Security Fairness Act website.",
      "The push to enhance Social Security payments for public pension recipients has been in the works for decades, with the Senate holding its first hearings into the policies in 2003.",
      "The Senior Citizens League said it was pleased that the timeline for implementing the new law had been moved up, given the high cost of living that affects so many of its members, according to Shannon Benton, executive director of the group.",
      "Still, the advocacy group is concerned that the law's passage could speed up the depletion of the Social Security trust fund.",
      "\"Addressing the pending shortfall through comprehensive Social Security reform should happen sooner rather than later,\" Benton told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The new law had bipartisan support but faced last-minute objections from some Republicans due to its cost. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the law would add an estimated\u00a0$195 billion\u00a0to the federal deficit over a decade.",

      "\"DEI poses litigation, reputational and financial risks to companies, and therefore financial risks to their shareholders, and therefore further risks to companies for not abiding by their fiduciary duties,\" according to the\u00a0proposal offered by the group. It offered a similar proposal at Costco's annual meeting in January that shareholders also\u00a0rejected.",
      "\"The risks to Apple stemming from continuing to push these divisive and value-destroying agendas is only increasing in light of President Trump's recent executive order focusing the Department of Justice on rooting out illegal discrimination being carried out in the name of DEI,\" Stephen Padfield, executive director of the National Center for Public Policy Research's Free Enterprise Project, said in a prerecorded statement played to Apple shareholders on Tuesday.",
      "\"The vibe shift is clear, DEI is out and annual merit is in,\" Padfield said.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. consumer confidence plummeted in February, the biggest monthly decline in more than four years, a business research group said Tuesday, with inflation seemingly stuck and a trade war under President Donald Trump seen by a growing number of Americans as inevitable.",
      "The Conference Board reported that its consumer confidence index sank this month to 98.3 from 105.3 in January. That's far below the expectations of economists, who projected a reading of 103, according to a survey by FactSet.",
      "\"The Conference Board survey is the 3rd data point in less than a week (after Fri's flash PMIs and Michigan sentiment report) making it abundantly clear that Trump-linked policy uncertainty is eroding confidence and tipping the economy (at least) into a slowdown (if not something worse),\" Adam Crisafulli, president of investment advisory firm Vital Knowledge, said in a note.",
      "The seven-point drop was the biggest month-to-month decline since August 2021.",
      "Markets on Wall Street immediately dropped. The S&P 500 fell 0.8% in morning trading, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 1.7%. The Nasdaq declined 1.6%.",
      "Tariff concerns",
      "Respondents to the board's survey expressed concern over inflation with a significant increase in mentions of trade and tariffs, the board said.",
      "Since taking office in January, President Trump has threatened sweeping tariffs which he says will bolster the U.S. economy over the long term. While it's not clear that Mr. Trump will enact all the tariffs he's outlined \u2014 he recently gave a 30-day reprieve to Mexico and Canada in his plan to enact 25% import duties on those countries \u2014 the president is also signaling plans to move forward with additional tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump's plans to lean on new tariffs to enact his trade and other policy objectives has prompted some economists to forecast higher inflation in 2025.",
      "\"The Conference Board's survey mirrors the Michigan survey in showing that consumers' confidence has deteriorated sharply in the face of threats to impose large tariffs and to slash federal spending and employment,\" Samuel Tombs, chief U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a research note.",
      "\"The weakness of confidence strongly suggests that recent rapid growth in spending on durable goods mostly reflects households pre-empting tariffs,\" he added.",
      "The Conference Board's report Tuesday said that the measure of Americans' short-term expectations for income, business and the job market fell 9.3 points to 72.9. The Conference Board says a reading under 80 can signal a potential recession in the near future.",
      "The proportion of consumers expecting a recession over the next year jumped to a nine-month high, the board said.",
      "\"This index says that consumers are rattled. Their current situation is not so bad, but a growing do not feel so good about the future,\" analysts with High-Frequency Economics said in report. \"The decline in consumer sentiment since the November election might not be a coincidence,\" they added.",
      "Growing pessimism",
      "Consumers' view of current conditions tumbled 3.4 points to a reading of 136.5 this month and views on current labor market conditions fell again.",
      "\"Views of current labor market conditions weakened,\" the group said Tuesday. \"Consumers became pessimistic about future business conditions and less optimistic about future income. Pessimism about future employment prospects worsened and reached a ten-month high.\"",
      "Consumers appeared increasingly confident heading into the end of 2024 and spent generously during the holiday season. However, U.S. retail sales dropped sharply in January, with cold weather taking some of the blame for a dent in vehicle sales and at retail stores.",
      "Retail sales fell 0.9% last month from December, the Commerce Department reported last week. The decline, the biggest in a year, came after two months of healthy gains.",
      "Inflation has also remained sticky. So much so that the Federal Reserve has taken a more cautious approach to interest rates, leaving its benchmark borrowing rate alone at its last meeting after cutting it at the previous three. Fed officials have also expressed uncertainty over the new administration's policies.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration is apparently nearing a deal with Ukraine that could grant the U.S. access to mineral resources in exchange for security guarantees.",
    "story": [
      "Exactly three years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion and under pressure from President Trump, a senior Ukrainian official said negotiations over a deal that would give Washington access to Ukraine's vast mineral reserves were \"in the final stages.\"",
      "Ukraine's leaders have voiced hope that such an agreement might serve as the foundation of a long-term security guarantee for the country against any future Russian aggression, but the Trump administration has thus far remained non-committal, framing access to the resources as a way for Ukraine to pay the U.S. back for its support over the last three years.",
      "\"The negotiations have been very constructive, with nearly all key details finalized,\" Olga Stefanishka, Ukraine's Vice President for European and Euro-Atlantic integration, said in a Monday\u00a0social media post, written in English. \"We are committed to completing this swiftly to proceed with its signature. We hope both US and UA leaders might sign and endorse it in Washington the soonest to showcase our commitment for decades to come.\"",
      "Often called Europe's \"breadbasket\" thanks to its massive agriculture sector, Ukraine is also one of the continent's most resource-rich nations. Much of Ukraine's mineral reserves remain untapped, however, due to difficult access, old and undeveloped infrastructure and a lack of investment \u2014 all exacerbated by Russia's ongoing offensive military campaign, which initially started in 2014 with its invasion and annexation of the Crimean Peninsula.",

The occupied territory includes a significant portion of Ukraine's mineral reserves, including highly sought-after rare earth elements used in defense, aerospace, technology and energy production.",
      "The ground beneath Ukraine is believed to hold about 5% of the world's total reserves of rare earth elements. The U.S., which covers about 12 times as much ground, is estimated to have only 1-2% of the world's rare earths, by comparison.",

The strong, lightweight metal is a vital component in modern aircraft, missiles and countless other civilian and military hardware, from satellites to bicycles. Ukraine's reserves are largely found in the northwest and central regions of the country, which have remained firmly under Kyiv's control.",

      "\"We must have an agreement with Ukraine on critical minerals and rare earths and various other things as security. And I think that that's happening. I think we've made a lot of progress,\" Mr. Trump said during a joint news conference at the White House on Monday with visiting French President Emmanuel Macron.",
      "\"I think this discussion (a potential mineral deal) is a very important one,\" said Macron. \"First, because it's important for the U.S. and it will be a good occasion for a first very important meeting between President Trump and President Zelenskyy. Second, I think it's \u2014 there is a lot of economic upside on both sides.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has characterized U.S. access to Ukraine's minerals as a way for the country to pay back Washington for the military assistance provided over the past three years.",
      "U.S. industry currently relies largely on China, which is the world's biggest source of rare earths and other minerals, for its raw materials. An increase in the supply of those materials from Ukraine could eventually mean a decrease in minerals purchased from China \u2014 and less concern from a national security standpoint.",
      "While the details of the deal said to be taking shape have not been shared, Zelenskyy earlier refused to sign an agreement that reportedly would have given the U.S. access to about $500 billion worth of his nation's mineral wealth \u2014 about half of its estimated future value.",
      "\"I won't sign a document that 10 generations of Ukrainians will pay for,\" Zelenskyy said over the weekend. He has stressed that any agreement to grant U.S. access to Ukraine's minerals must come with security guarantees\u2014\u00a0 including, he suggested Tuesday, the possibility of American forces deploying to protect American investments.",
      "Zelenkyy's chief of staff, Andrii Yermak, said Monday that Kyiv was considering investment opportunities with both the U.S and European countries, \"which includes minerals, their development and extraction,\" calling his country's natural resources \"a very important element that can work in the general structure of security guarantees \u2014 military guarantees and others.\"",

They see reductions in the workforce as eliminating essential workers and as having the effect of consolidating Mr. Trump's power.",
      "Most Americans see a wide range of potential impacts from the federal workforce reductions.",
      "For most Republicans, these reductions will lead to efficiencies and savings.",
      "For Democrats, it'll remove essential workers, and they also see political impacts: removing workers who don't support him and conferring more power on Mr. Trump.",
      "The public is on balance wary of Musk and DOGE's access to government agency data records. Democrats and independents think he has too much access, but Republicans either say he has the right amount or would give him more.",
      "That said, most do think there is at least some waste in the federal government, and that view crosses party lines. But they differ on how much and what causes it: Republicans think there is a lot, mostly caused by fraud in the system, while Democrats think there is only some, mostly caused by poor spending decisions.",
      "Is Trump prioritizing what people want?",
      "Mr. Trump gets narrowly positive ratings for handling the economy, but not inflation specifically.",
      "There's a big difference between what Americans think Mr. Trump ought to give high priority and what they think he is prioritizing.",
      "They overwhelmingly want Mr. Trump focused on the economy and inflation. That cuts across partisan lines. (Perhaps no surprise there, as they've been among Americans' top issues for years.)",
      "The percent who think he is giving a lot of priority to the economy and inflation, though, is far lower.",
      "Most think he is prioritizing the border, the federal workforce and tariffs, more so than inflation. And his policies aren't seen as driving down food and grocery prices.",
      "The focus on the border does help him politically: he gets approval on his handling of immigration, and most continue to back his deportation policy. Most say his policies are reducing the number of migrants crossing the border.",
      "That all leaves Mr. Trump's approval rating in positive territory, but more closely divided than a couple of weeks ago.",
      "In all, Republicans now overwhelmingly think things in the country are going at least somewhat well, which has driven up the overall percentage of Americans who are saying that since Mr. Trump took office.",
      "Changes in international relations",
      "Americans also think there are major changes happening with U.S. international relations. And again here, a split on whether that is better or worse.",
      "Interviewing for the poll was almost entirely conducted prior to the Oval Office meeting between Mr. Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "Americans overall want to remain engaged on the world stage. Though few think the U.S. should take the leading role in the world, most do think it should work alongside its allies.",
      "And most see the nations of Western Europe collectively (Great Britain, France, Germany and Italy) as allies of the U.S.",
      "Half of Americans say they back Ukraine in the conflict with Russia, almost half are neutral.",
      "In interviews largely conducted prior to the Trump-Zelenskyy meeting, few Americans thought Mr. Trump favored Ukraine in the Ukraine-Russia conflict.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Rep. John James, Republican of Michigan, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on March 2, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to turn now to Michigan Congressman John James. Good morning to you, Congressman.",
      "REP. JOHN JAMES: Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about what's happening in your state with the economy and tariffs, but just staying on the theme for a moment, I know you have a lot of Ukrainian-Americans in your district. You voted in support of last year's Ukraine supplemental. Are you comfortable with the Trump administration's decision to stop recognizing that Russia started the war in Ukraine?",
      "REP. JOHN JAMES: Russia is the aggressor. Putin is a war criminal, and Volodymyr Zelensky also fumbled the bag pretty hard. All those things can be true at the exact same time. We absolutely must stand by our allies with the exact same time. We also need to make sure that we are giving transparency and accountability to the American people. Under the Biden administration, billions of dollars were given away with very little accountability and no mission, no end state. I'm a combat veteran, and my soldiers expected from me that I would be able to articulate objectives, a mission and an end state. And the commander-in-chief, last time, couldn't do that. President Trump is doing everything that he can to get a lasting peace, an enduring peace in Eastern Europe and throughout the world. He's already ended one war in the Middle East. I think we should give him a chance to end one in Europe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I think there's developments on the Mideast front that throw that into question, but we'll keep tracking that. Let me ask you about tariffs and Michigan, because you are really in a unique spot in the middle of the auto state. This Tuesday, expect tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China. That's what the President said. On March 12, 25% tariffs on all imported steel and aluminum. No exceptions for trading partners. Auto tariffs in April. What is your district bracing for?",
      "REP. JOHN JAMES: Look, America is open for business, but we are not for sale. Michigan remembers what NAFTA did to us. And over the past 30 years, Mexico has built 11 major automotive plants to only one in the United States. Michigan remembers 900,000 automotive jobs over back in the 90s to 600,000 now. That's over 30- 300,000 lost manufacturing jobs in the automotive sector. Michigan remembers the Great Recession, where 50% of all the jobs lost in all of America were lost in Michigan alone. And Michigan remembers the harmful EV mandates that have forced compliance rather than actually allowing a regulatory environment that permits innovation. We've lost jobs to Mexico and China. Right now, in my district, as you mentioned, the number one manufacturing district in all the nation, overflow production is not going to Sterling Heights. It's going to Saltillo, Mexico. When you look at the opportunities that are missing us, when you look at the fact that Michigan is seeing as opportunities pass by, enough is enough. Margaret the status quo is not good enough for Americans, which is why Donald Trump got elected--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Understood.\u2014",
      "REP. JOHN JAMES: -- he's putting Americans first. And frankly, even our allies have not been playing a fair game. Look free trade is the objective--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Okay, I'm asking about the specifics\u2026.",
      "REP. JAMES: -- but fair trade- right- okay, go ahead--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- The specific tactic here, because you brought up Sterling Heights. The Republican mayor of Sterling Heights, Michael Taylor, your district, says the President's tariffs are the, \"single biggest threat to our local economy.\" He's expecting it to be devastating and staggering. This is a Republican saying this about the impact on your district. What's he missing?",
      "REP. JOHN JAMES: The- what's devastating and staggering is the fact of the matter that we have been taken advantage of for decades. The president's, under his original tax plan, lowered corporate tax rates from 35 to 21%. He's offering lower tax rates to 15% for those who build in the United States of America. We're also looking at energy independence. We're also looking at lowering the regulatory burdens for folks to succeed and excel. But what Democrats are doing is they're going to actually make it more difficult when they vote against this- these tax reforms for small businesses to excel, for entrepreneurs to get their feet under them. And so regardless of what it is, when you take a look at the EV policies that Joe Biden put in place that actually exacerbated the inflation. Just look at work trucks. Work trucks, five years ago, where- are- were $15,000 less expensive than they are right now. SUVs, $8,000 less expensive than they are right now--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Did you tell the mayor he's wrong?--",
      "REP. JOHN JAMES:-- That inflation was caused by terrible Democrat policies and that- and that- What's that?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're telling the mayor, he's wrong? I mean, the Ford- Ford CEO said at an investor conference last month, a 25% tariff would blow a hole in the US industry that we have never seen.",
      "REP. JOHN JAMES: Well, you know what- the memory is kind of short, because when you look at the OECD nations, they're already talking about leveling 15% tax on anything in businesses that are making $750 million or more. Everybody should be looking at the impact that makes on top of the tariffs that are already imposed on goods that are made in the United States of America. No one is talking about this, Margaret. And all these economists, we expect that these are going--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- This is the CEO of Ford- the automaker--",
      "REP. JOHN JAMES: -- We are not operating- You know, you can go talk to the CEO of Ford but what I'm dealing with is people I'm talking with when I visit factory floors each and every single day. I am an automotive supplier in the United States of America, and I feel this pain. We've seen it for too long, and like I've said, we've been taken advantage of for years, and we need to level the playing field. When you're not playing fair with America, then we have to do what we can to make sure that we can compete on a fair playing field. And Margaret, I think that fairness is what we should be pursuing, and I don't think that's wrong to ask for out of our allies and our partners.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The global supply chain, I know you know it well, is complicated here, and the production goes back and forth--",
      "REP. JOHN JAMES: -- Yes, I have a masters in it, Margaret. I understand it, and I'm also in the automotive industry. Yes, go ahead--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right- well, what I'm trying to say is that the cars go back and forth across the border multiple times. So, what is the construction of the tariffs that you think is actually going to be beneficial here?",
      "REP. JOHN JAMES: You know what also comes across the border, fentanyl coming in from Mexico, when China is sending in precursors, and as a result of these negotiation tactics, Mexico surged 10,000 of their own National Guard troops to the border. And just as you were mentioning the- in the last segment, I think it was great that border apprehensions on the southern border have plunged to the lowest levels this century. You know, if this is working, Mexico is paying for the border security. They're extraditing drug lords to be prosecuted in the United States of America. And these are the types of things that we're looking for. 84% of those in the terror watch list and the FBI terror watch list are apprehended on the northern border. And we're getting Canadian cooperation, which would have never happened under the previous administration and only started when President Trump started playing hard ball and talking about these things. We have a number of levers, diplomatic, economic and military and diplomatic levers haven't worked. We're using economic levers to secure our borders and to make sure that we have fairness across our economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Thank you, Congressman James, we got to leave it there.",

    "summary": "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said an economic deal with Ukraine is not currently on the table after a contentious Oval Office meeting.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday that an economic deal with Ukraine is not currently on the table after the contentious Oval Office meeting between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "\"All President Zelensky had to do was come in and sign this economic agreement, and again show no daylight \u2014 no daylight \u2014 between Ukrainian people and the American people, and he chose to blow that up,\" Bessent said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "The signing of a key economic agreement was abruptly canceled Friday and Zelenskyy's visit was cut short after the meeting devolved into a feud between the Ukrainian president on one side and Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance on the other. Zelenskyy was ultimately asked to leave the White House, and the multibillion-dollar critical minerals deal went unsigned.",
      "Friday's heated exchange came after Zelenskyy expressed doubt over whether Russian President Vladimir Putin would honor a potential peace agreement, following repeated violation of previous ceasefire deals. Meanwhile, peace negotiations to end the war between Russia and Ukraine are not yet underway, though Mr. Trump repeatedly pledged to bring an end to the war promptly after taking office.",
      "Still, Zelenskyy\u00a0said\u00a0on social media Saturday that Ukraine is ready to sign the minerals agreement, calling it \"the first step toward security guarantees,\" while noting that the country needs more assurances.",
      "\"A ceasefire without security guarantees is dangerous for Ukraine,\" Zelenskyy said. \"We've been fighting for three years, and Ukrainian people need to know that America is on our side.\"",
      "Bessent, who crafted the economic agreement, said Sunday that it's \"impossible to have an economic deal without a peace deal,\" while acknowledging that the economic deal was initially supposed to be a building block toward securing a peace deal in Ukraine.",
      "\"President Zelenskyy has thrown off the sequencing,\" Bessent said, noting that the administration was set up for the deal signing on Friday.",
      "The treasury secretary said the \"most tragic part\" of Friday's breakdown is that Mr. Trump's plan was to use the economic arrangement to \"further intertwine the American people and Ukrainian people\" and to \"show the Russian leadership that there was no daylight\" between them.",
      "\"And President Zelenskyy came into the Oval Office and tried to relitigate in front of the world the deal,\" Bessent said, arguing that he should have done so behind closed doors.",
      "Bessent said the administration now has to see how Zelenskyy wants to proceed, saying an economic agreement would be \"rendered moot if he wants the fighting to continue\" while noting that \"President Trump wants a peace deal.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's Republican allies have also defended the unprecedented Oval Office meeting.",
      "Rep. Mike Turner, an Ohio Republican, said on \"Face the Nation\" that Zelenskyy's behavior at the meeting \"inappropriate,\" and the meeting \"should have been a win.\"",
      "\"Instead of taking that win, he turned it into a debate on American security guarantees on the peace negotiations instead of taking that win and then from that going forward,\" Turner said.",
      "Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat who also appeared on \"Face the Nation,\" acknowledged that \"that kind of negotiation should not be done in public in front of cameras,\" while arguing that Zelenskyy \"was cornered and he was bullied in the Oval Office.\"",
      "Kelly said he thinks Mr. Trump and Vance were \"trying to look tough,\" but he argued the confrontation made the U.S. look weak, claiming that Russian President Vladimir Putin was \"the only winner in that exchange.\"",
      "\"So it was a sad day for our country,\" Kelly said. \"It was a dumpster fire of diplomacy.\"",

      "Our polling also shows at least half the country reports concern about paying for food and groceries and housing. They continue to call the economy bad, even more so than last month, and 49 percent told us the economy is getting worse.",
      "When can Americans expect to experience the benefits that President Trump said would be coming in day one?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Yes, what \u2013 you know, Margaret, what I find interesting is, for the past year-and-a-half and during the campaign, most of the media said, oh, the economy is great, it's just a vibe session.",
      "Now that President Trump's in office, there's an economic problem. And I will tell you what the problem was. This is\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We were pretty straightforward on this program.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, I haven't seen this program, but the \u2013 in general, this idea that working-class Americans didn't know what they were talking about, they didn't know their lived experience, they didn't know what their pocketbooks were feeling.",
      "And I will tell you, President Trump was elected, one of the reasons was the affordability crisis, and we are setting about doing that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Number one.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: So, after four years, four years of disastrous policies, they were running these gigantic deficits that the \u2013 that led to the affordability problem, massive government regulations, so what we had was a demand shock from the government spending that was met by supply constraints with overregulation.",
      "So we are in the process of deregulating, which will free the supply side, and we are cutting back the government spending. It took four years to get us here. President Trump has been in office five weeks.",
      "And I can tell you, we're working every day. What I will point out, interest rates, the 10-year bond, which I am focused on, have been down every week since President Trump was president. Mortgage rates have been down every week. So that's a pretty good start.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I hear you that sometimes the data lags reality, but when we are talking about people's perceptions of the economy, it's just how they're feeling right now, we see in our polling, 52 percent of Americans say Trump's policies are making grocery prices go up.",
      "They explicitly said that on this bar chart you see there. So it's an experience and a perception issue. When does that shift? When do we see the benefits of the planning you say is under way?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Look, I think President Trump said that he'll own the economy in six or 12 months. But I can tell you that we are working to get these prices down every day.",
      "But it took four years to get us here, and we've had five weeks. So interest rates are down. That's a very good start toward housing affordability, toward auto affordability, and we are tackling this.",
      "At Treasury, we are going to appoint an affordability czar. We are going to have an affordability council. We are laser focused on this. We\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What does that mean? What's an affordability czar?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Someone who picks the five or eight areas where this administration can make a big difference for working-class Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "Well, one of the things that we hear the president talk about a lot is the plan to use tariffs. I know this falls under the purview of Commerce and the trade rep, but you have spoken a bit about it before.",
      "If the president does roll out the 10 percent tariffs that he says are coming on China this week, the 25 percent on Canada and Mexico, how much do you think they will impact what Americans experience? The Peterson Institute says it will cost households an additional $1,200 a year.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Look, a couple of things.",
      "I respect my friends at the Peterson Institute. I think they're a bit alarmist. I think a lot of their supporters are anti-tariff, so they take an anti-tariff position.",
      "And, look, we have the experience of President Trump's first term, where the tariffs did not affect prices. And it's a holistic approach, that there will be tariffs, there will be cuts in regulation, there will be cheaper energy. So I would expect that very quickly we will be down to the Fed's 2 percent target.",
      "So I'm expecting inflation to continue dropping over the year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So should we expect these tariffs to come March 4?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, there's a series of tariffs. There's March 4, and then there are the big \u2013 the \u2013 there's the big tariff program that's going to be outlined on April 2 by commerce and USTR, and that's the president's notion of reciprocal tariffs.",
      "And that's going to be very path-dependent. It's \u2013 we are going to show, what are other countries' tariffs on specific goods, what are non-tariff barriers, what are the currency manipulation, what is manipulation of financing or labor manipulation, and what are these horrendous fines that the European Union is putting on our tech companies, and we are going to evaluate that and give them an opportunity to remedy that.",
      "So we could either see a ratcheting up in tariffs, or, if our trading partners want to remedy what has been unfair trade, then we could see the tariffs come off. So it's going to be path-dependent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that's Europe in April, mainly?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, that's across the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "So when you say the Peterson Institute is too alarmist with $1,200 a year on the average household, what's the cost of the household? You think it's zero?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, we \u2013 we don't know yet, because it's path- dependent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: But what I can tell you is that I'm not worried about China. China is going to \u2013 China will pay for the China tariffs, because their business model is exporting their way out of this inflation.",
      "They are the most imbalanced, unbalanced economy in modern times. And the idea that, because of a tariff, that they would lower their production is wrong. They are going to continue flooding the market. They will eat this price decrease. They will eat any tariffs that go on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I saw you say on Bloomberg recently that Mexico has offered to match the U.S. tariffs on China, and that you would like for the Canadians to do so as well. You described it as a fortress in North America. Is that in the works?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: I \u2013 I \u2013 I don't know yet. We'll see. The Mexican leadership has offered to do that. We haven't heard from the Canadians, but I think that would be a very good start, because\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: By Tuesday, potentially, to offset the potential punishment on them?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: By Tuesday, or maybe the tariff wall goes up, and then we see what happens from there.",
      "But I can tell you that, under the cover of COVID, China dramatically increased their export capacity, and they are trying to export their way to prosperity. They are in an economic crisis. They have gigantic deflation. And it's unacceptable for them to export that to the rest of the world. And I think North America would be a very good start for pushing back against this unfair trade policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that would be a significant development.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Very significant.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Which would avoid tariffs that are supposed to go out on Tuesday.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: We'll see.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, we'll be watching that space.",
      "I want to ask you about Ukraine. You were in that Oval Office meeting that went sideways on Friday. He \u2013 President Zelenskyy was told to leave the White House before he signed the minerals agreement that I know you have been working on. He said yesterday, though, he is ready to sign it.",
      "He called it \"the first step towards security guarantees. It's not enough. We need more than just that. A cease-fire without security guarantees is dangerous for Ukraine.\"",
      "Is the deal still on the table, or has President Trump instructed you to drop the project?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Margaret, it is impossible to have an economic deal without a peace deal. The sine qua non for an economic deal is that Ukrainian leadership wants a peace deal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I thought this was a building block towards getting to a peace deal.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, it was supposed to be, but President Zelenskyy came into the Oval on Friday. There were \u2013 there were three things that were going to be done. There was going to be a press conference.",
      "There was going to be a private lunch with 16 of us. And as you can see from Dan Scavino's \u2013 the post on his X account, we were all ready set up to sign \u2013 to sign the deal. So it's unclear now. President Zelenskyy has thrown off the sequencing.",
      "And, Margaret, let me tell you the most tragic part of this. The \u2013 President Trump's idea for this economic arrangement was to further intertwine the American people and Ukrainian people and show no daylight\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But\u2026",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: \u2026 to show the Russian leadership that there was no daylight. And President Zelenskyy came into the Oval Office and tried to relitigate in front of the world the deal.",
      "And we were going \u2013 the place to have done it would have been in the private lunch.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, well, it's news to me that this was \u2013 that the sequencing is shifting, that you are saying you have to agree to a peace deal before the minerals agreement? There aren't even negotiations for a peace deal under way.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, first of all, it's not a minerals agreement. It's a general economic agreement. So, calling it a minerals agreement is incorrect.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: And I think we have to see if President Zelenskyy wants to proceed.",
      "What's \u2013 what's the use in having an economic agreement that's going to be rendered moot if he wants the fighting to continue? President Trump wants a peace deal.",

The Institute for the Study of War says that this would leave Ukraine helpless in the face of future Russia \u2013 Russian threats or aggression.",
      "If \u2013 if that's described as the future of U.S. diplomacy and the framework, why isn't Mr. Zelenskyy asking the right question when he says, how can I agree to a cease-fire with no security guarantees or even a minerals agreement or investment agreement without security guarantees?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, look, I think the plan is for the European Union to provide this security, not NATO, the European Union.",

The \u2013 we had Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday, fantastic meeting. They were all on board the arc of the peace agreement.",

So, as we're watching this fight, we have to be concerned about what's crumbling here and what needs to be put back together.",
      "I think that's what we all felt in our \u2013 in our stomachs as \u2013 in our anxiety as we watched what was at risk here. The second thing is, is really how inappropriate this was for Zelenskyy. I mean, the context is, this was a signing agreement. Zelenskyy had been negotiating with the United States on a minerals deal, an economic deal, as the Treasury secretary said.",

      "Do you really think that this was all to blow it up, or was it just people are talking past each other? What do you actually think happened?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, I think, fundamentally, here, again, the \u2013 you don't fly a quarter across the world for a signing ceremony for a deal with the president of the United States and turn it into a debate on American security guarantees on peace negotiations that are unrelated to the mineral deal that you came \u2013 the economic deal that you came to sign.",

      "He has made a precondition of going forward with peace negotiations American security guarantees. And what you saw was him enter into a very public debate with the president of the United States in the Oval Office of, I want \u2013 and you heard it, you actually yourself said it to the secretary of the Treasury \u2013 I want an American security guarantee as a precondition for peace negotiations.",

      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: I think he was cornered and then he was bullied in the Oval Office. And, Margaret, that just makes us look weak. You know, I think Donald Trump was trying to look tough. J.D. Vance was trying to look tough. The only winner in that exchange is Putin, who's a criminal, who's killing, you know, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians.",

And the chairman of the Armed Services Committee kicked the cameras out of the room before we started to talk. That's the way this should be handled, not what - not what Donald Trump did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the treasury secretary, who was just with us, said you can't get an economic deal without a peace deal first. So, it seems the dynamic is changing in terms of what the Trump administration is putting forward here.",

      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Well, I mean, his concern is that he doesn't have a security guarantee and he's being asked to give up minerals, that this is a business deal.",
      "Margaret, we're about to celebrate our 250th birthday as a country. And I didn't think we were just in it for - for the money. I mean we are a country of values and principles. We stand with our allies. He needs security guarantees.",
      "Yes, I understand this concept of an economic deal and a ceasefire, but the economic deal comes after the ceasefire. None of that makes sense. They need to get in a room, including with the Russians. I mean have the Russians given any indication that they want peace?",

      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Obviously, negotiating this in public. By the way, I mean his English is not the best. So, this is hard for him. To corner him in the Oval Office on that kind of stage was wrong. And it makes us look weaker as a nation and it makes us less safe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've been to Ukraine a number of times. Our last guest, Mike Turner, has been in Ukraine a number of times as well. Neither the president nor the vice president have at all. J.D. Vance, the vice president, said to Zelenskyy, those are propaganda tours. Is that what you did? Did you go on propaganda tours?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: No, I mean, I - I went into patriot batteries and, you know, talked to the troops that every night are defending themselves from incoming ballistic missiles, and cruise missiles, trying to keep their population alive. I met with soldiers, you know, some of which are, you know, amputees at this point who just - and soldiers that just came from the frontlines to talk to me in person about what the situation on the ground is. I met with pilots there who were about to get their F-16s. And we talked specifically about, you know, how can you use this airplane in combat?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: I think J.D. Vance, the vice president, with all due respect, it sounds like he's watching videos on the internet. And to say to Zelenskyy, you're not being thankful enough. I mean Zelenskyy thanks the American people all the time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: But it has to end in a way that the Russians are going to respect. And what was in the Oval Office yesterday was a demonstration of weakness. And I can tell you, Putin does not respect weakness.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the U.S. border. The number of migrants crossing the southern border illegally in President Trump's first full term - first full month in office plunged to a level we haven't seen in 25 years. This is according to data reviewed by CBS. This seems like this is good for your state. Do these numbers prove President Trump's theory is right?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Well, I think the numbers being down, that's a good thing. What we need long-term is a negotiation with the Republicans on longstanding border policy. What the administration is doing, especially with ICE raids in schools, with flying - repatriating people who often aren't only criminals, in military airplanes, for intimidation, talking about housing people on Guantanamo, that's intimidation.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary of Defense Hegseth is sending another 3,000 troops to the border, including an aviation battalion and striker vehicles, CBS has confirmed. Now these soldiers aren't allowed to intercept migrants. Do you understand the mission, the intent? You have oversight over armed services, so I wonder how you feel about this.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Well, I don't feel good about it. The way this should be handled is, if we could work together within the United States Senate, Democrats and Republicans, get the Border Patrol more money, hire more Border Patrol agents, give them more resources to do the job they're supposed to do. When you do it with troops, that affects their readiness. This isn't what they're trained to do. Then they don't get to train to do - that striker battalion doesn't get to train to do the job that they need - may need to do one day.",
      "I don't want to see us in a conflict around the world anywhere. But what prevents that is for our allies to realize that they're not going to win in a fight. And when they see us doing things like this, police actions with the military, that also is showing the rest of the world that our military is less capable and we are weaker. And that affects everybody's safety.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Lastly, because you sit on the Intelligence Committee, I want to ask you about something President Zelenskyy said. He said in Munich, \"Ukraine has intel the Russians are sending troops to Belarus to use it as a launch pad militarily into perhaps not just Ukraine but other European countries.\"",
      "Are you concerned about that?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Well, I am very concerned about what Putin will do next. If he - if he comes out of this and thinks he got a good deal and this was worth his time and effort and loss of life.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: He doesn't care about Russian soldiers. He obviously doesn't care about the Ukrainians. Yes, that would be very concerning for me.",
      "I was in the Baltic nations, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania earlier this year. They are very concerned. That would be a staging ground for them to attack the Baltics.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about what's happening in your state with the economy and tariffs, but just staying on the theme for a moment. I know you have a lot of Ukrainian Americans in your district. You voted in support of last year's Ukraine supplemental. Are you comfortable with the Trump administration's decision to stop recognizing that Russia started the war in Ukraine?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: Russia is the aggressor. Putin is a war criminal. And Volodymyr Zelenskyy also fumbled the bag pretty hard. All those things can be true at the exact same time. We absolutely must stand by our allies at the exact same time. We also need to make sure that we are giving transparency and accountability to the American people.",
      "Under the Biden administration, billions of dollars were given away with very little accountability and no mission - no end state. I'm a combat veteran, and my soldiers expected from me that I would be able to articulate objectives, a mission and an end state. And the commander in chief, last time, couldn't do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: President Trump is doing everything that he can to get a lasting peace, and enduring peace in eastern Europe and throughout the world. He's already ended one war in the Middle East. I think we should give him a chance to end one in Europe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I think there's developments on the Mid-East front that - that throw that into question, but we'll keep tracking that.",
      "Let me ask you about tariffs and Michigan because you are really in a unique spot in the middle of the auto state.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: This Tuesday, expect tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China. That's what the president said. On March 12th, 25 percent tariffs on all imported steel and aluminum. Non-exceptions for trading partners. Auto tariffs in April. What is your district bracing for?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: Look, America is open for business but we are not for sale. Michigan remembers what NAFTA did to us. And over the past 30 years, Mexico has built 11 major automotive plants to only one in the United States.",
      "Michigan remembers 900,000 automotive jobs over - back in the '90s to 600,000 now. That's over 300,000 lost manufacturing jobs in the automotive sector. Michigan remembers the great recession where 50 percent of all the jobs lost in all of America were lost in Michigan alone. And Michigan remembers the harmful EV mandates that have forced compliance rather than actually allowing a regulatory environment that permits innovation. We've lost jobs to Mexico and China.",
      "Right now in my district, as you mentioned, the number one manufacturing district in all the nation, overflow production is not going to Sterling Heights, it's going to Saltillo, Mexico.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: When you look at the opportunities that are missing us, when you look at the fact that - that - that Michigan is seeing its opportunities pass by, enough is enough.",
      "Margaret, the status quo is not good enough for Americans, which is why Donald Trump got elected.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: He's putting Americans first. And, frankly, even our allies have not been playing a fair game.",
      "Look, fair - free trade is the objective but fair trade -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, but I'm asking you about the specific - the -",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: Fair -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, the specific -",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: Right. Yes, OK, go ahead.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Tactic here because you - you brought up Sterling Heights. The Republican mayor of Sterling Heights, Michael Taylor, your district, says the president's tariffs are the, quote, \"single biggest threat to our local economy.\" He's expecting it to be devastating and staggering. This is a Republican saying this about the impact on your district. What's he missing?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: The - what's devastating and staggering is the fact of the matter that we have been taken advantage of for decades. The president, under his original tax plan, lowered corporate tax rates from 35 to 21 percent, and he's offering lower tax rates to 15 percent for those who build in the United States of America. We're also looking at energy independence. We're also looking at lowering the regulatory burdens for folks to succeed and excel.",
      "But what Democrats are doing is they're going to actually make it more difficult when they vote against this - these tax reforms for small businesses to excel -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Republicans -",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: And for entrepreneurs to get their feet under them. And so, regardless of what it is, when you take a look at the EV policies that Joe Biden put in place, that actually exacerbated the inflation, just look at work trucks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Well -",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: Work trucks five years ago were - are - were $15,000 less expensive than they are right now. SUVs, $8,000 less expensive than they are right now. That inflation was caused by terrible Democrat policies. And that - and that is - that -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you tell the mayor he's wrong?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: What's that?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The - so you're telling the mayor he's wrong? I mean the Ford - Ford's CEO said at an investor conference last month, a 25 percent tariff would blow a hole in the U.S. industry that we have never seen.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: Well, you know what, memory is kind of short because when you look at the OECD nations, they're already talking about leveling 15 percent tax on anything in businesses that are making $750 million or more. Everybody should look at the impact that that makes on top of the tariffs that are already imposed on goods that are made in the United States of America. No one is talking about this, Margaret. And all these economists - we - we expect that these are going to be on (INAUDIBLE) but they're not. We are not operating at - you know -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's the CEO of Ford, the automaker.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: You can go talk to the CEO of Ford, but what I'm dealing with is people I'm talking with when I visit factory floors each and every single day. I am an automotive supplier in the United States of America and I feel this pain. We've seen it for too long.",
      "And like I've said, we've been taken advantage of for years and we need to level the playing field. When you're not playing fair with America, then we have to do what we can to make sure that we can compete on a fair playing field.",
      "And, Margaret, I think that fairness is what we should be pursuing. And I don't think that's wrong to ask for out of our allies and our partners.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The global supply chain, I know you know it well, is complicated here. And the production goes back and forth across -",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: Yes, I have a masters in it, Margaret. I understand it. And I'm also in the automotive industry.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: Yes, go ahead.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And - well, what I'm trying to say is that the cars go back and forth across the border multiple times. So, what is the construction of the tariffs that you think is actually going to be beneficial here?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: You know what also comes across the border? Fentanyl coming in from Mexico, and China sending in precursors. And as a result of these negotiation tactics, Mexico surged 10,000 of their own National Guard troops to the border. And just as you were mentioning in the - in the last segment, I think it was great that border apprehensions on the southern border have plunged to the lowest levels this century.",
      "You know, this is working. Mexico is paying for the border security. They're extraditing drug lords to be prosecuted in the United States of America. And these are the types of things that we're - that we're looking for. Eighty-four percent of those on the terror watch list, on the FBI terror watch list, are apprehended on the northern border. And we're getting Canadian cooperation, which would have never happened under the previous administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: And only started when President Trump started playing hardball and talking about these things. We have a number of levers, diplomatic, economic and military.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: And diplomatic levers haven't works. We're using economic levels to secure our borders -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Congressman.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: And to make sure that we have fairness across our economy.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: President Trump's approval rating in our poll is 51 percent, still in positive territory, but by a smaller margin than he had a month ago. And on his approval on the issues, it's a mixed bag. A slim majority of voters approve of his handling of the border and the economy, while a slim majority disapprove of his handling of inflation.",
      "And we're joined now by our elections and surveys director, Anthony Salvanto.",
      "You asked about a host of issues, Anthony, before this explosive Oval Office exchange. You did ask Americans how they're assessing the conflict between Ukraine and Russia. What did you learn?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yes, good morning, Margaret.",
      "You know, you can look at Ukraine and Russia and the conflict, and then see a wider worldview that Americans have. So, let me start with this.",
      "Aid to Ukraine specifically divides the country. It divides it along partisan lines. And it has for a while. Democrats more in favor, Republicans more opposed.",
      "But then you ask people, OK, who do you support in the conflict? Just over half say they support Ukraine and the rest say they're neutral, that the U.S. should stay out.",
      "Now, where this comes back to the administration is, the people who say they're neutral are more approving of how Donald Trump is handling all this. The people who say they back Ukraine, in addition to supporting aid, feel that Trump's actions have favored Russia in this conflict.",
      "Now, let's take a look at views on Russia. And the big majority calls Russia either an enemy or unfriendly. It's a little less so among Republicans. But then widen out to how the U.S. should act on the world stage. Views of our European allies. By and large, Americans call them allies or at the least friendlies, Great Britain, France, Germany, et cetera.",
      "Now, what should the U.S. actually do? The big majority is, cooperate with allies on the world stage. Those folks tend to be less approving of the changes that they see Donald Trump making to U.S. foreign policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, back to the - the key issue, the economy, how are Americans perceiving what the president is doing on that, as well as his cuts to the federal workforce?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, on the point about cuts, let's start with this sort of central premise about, is there waste in the federal government? By and large Americans agree that there is. The difference is, where does it come from? If I ask people, is it poor spending choices? Is it fraud? Well, you get more Democrats saying, it probably comes from poor spending choices. Republicans saying it comes from fraud.",
      "And then that goes into a split on the changes you're making in the federal workforce. That divides the country. And you start to see people looking at and wondering about what the implications of this might be.",
      "So, I ask, is this going to have an effect? There's a lot of people who say, yes, it will have an effect on cutting services that they like, an effect on their local area. But there's also just as many who say it's going to save taxpayer money, it's going to eliminate waste. And when I see that wide span of answers, what my sense is, is, people are anticipating a lot of things. They're unsure at this point. But they are definitely looking and waiting to see what they believe will be an impact.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony Salvanto, thank you very much.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Thank you.",

      "REPORTER: What's your message to the U.S. president?",
      "IMTIAZ TYAB (voice over): He and U.K. Prime Minister Kier Starmer later signed $2.8 billion worth of loans to Ukraine, ahead of today's summit of presidents and prime ministers from across Europe, convened by Starmer.",
      "KIER STARMER (U.K. Prime Minister): European countries have to do more and provide a security guarantee. But I've always been clear that that is going to need a U.S. backstop.",

      "IMTIAZ TYAB (voice over): This spectacle of an American president and vice president berating the leader of a war-torn ally has left Ukrainians reeling and European leaders scrambling to respond. It has also triggered delight from the Kremlin.",
      "OLEKSANDER MEREZHKO: And I thought that Mr. Trump can play the role of new FDR. Yes. But now we can see that we need to think about European role and Europe as a leader of the free world.",
      "IMTIAZ TYAB: There's obviously another player here. And that's Russia. What do you think the mood in Moscow is right now?",
      "OLEKSANDER MEREZHKO: I'm sure that they rejoice. Putin counted. He couldn't imagine that something like that, that such a gift can happen. But now things have changed. And it emboldens him. He thinks that he's right and he can destroy Ukraine. That's why it's so dangerous.",

      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "KAJA KALLAS (VP, European Commission): We are coordinating. And - and, of course, the message is, there are several layers. One is that the fight that Ukraine is having is not only about Ukraine's sovereignty, but it's much, much broader. It's about freedom of the free world really. It is about the world where international law applies. And - and the world where might does not make right. It is clear that Russia attacked Ukraine. There's one aggressor and one victim.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the Trump administration has decided now not to say that explicitly, arguing that the president needs negotiating room. Do you think that that's persuasive to Vladimir Putin?",
      "KAJA KALLAS: Well, it is certainly, you know, a very strong Russian narrative that they want to run to really push - saying that, you know, oh, it's a conflict between two equal parties. It is very clear, one country attacked another country very brutally with force and is - is bombing Ukraine every day. I mean President Trump says that he wants the killing to stop. I don't think that anybody wants the killing to stop more than the Ukrainians.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, why do you think acknowledging who is responsible does matter?",
      "KAJA KALLAS: We have the United Nations charter where we have agreed how countries are, you know, interacting with each other. And it says very clearly that you can't attack sovereign territorial integrity of another country. And if you do, there are consequences. And why is it important? It is important for small countries in the world, for whom this is the only thing that protects them. If we don't really defend this principle, then we're going to see all these developments that we don't want to see because all the countries who are afraid of their neighbors will want to go for nuclear weapons because this is the only thing that protects them. It's not the international law anymore.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Senator Mark Kelly in Tucson, Arizona. Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SEN. KELLY: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were one of the lawmakers who met with President Zelensky prior to that Oval Office meltdown. Senator Lindsey Graham later told reporters he had warned Zelensky, \"don't take the bait.\" Do you think Zelensky took the bait? Is that how you understand what happened?",
      "SEN. MARK KELLY: He was cornered and he was bullied in the Oval Office. And Margaret, that just makes us look weak. You know, I think Donald Trump was trying to look tough. JD Vance was trying to look tough. The only winner in that exchange is Putin- who's a criminal, who's killing, you know, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians. So, it was a sad day for our country. It was a dumpster fire of diplomacy. It should not have been done that kind of negotiation should not be done in public, in front of cameras. When we had our meeting earlier in the day with Zelensky. He- he, you know, he has this like habitual gratitude. He was very thankful, and the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee kicked the cameras out of the room before we started to talk. That's the way this should be handled, not what- not what Donald Trump did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Treasury Secretary, who was just with us, said, you can't get an economic deal without a peace deal first. So it seems the dynamic is changing in terms of what the Trump administration is putting forward here. What was your understanding of what Volodymyr Zelensky's concerns were?",
      "SEN. KELLY: Well, I mean, his concern is that he doesn't have a security guarantee, and he's being asked to give up minerals- that this is a business deal. Margaret, we're about to celebrate our 250th birthday as a country, and I didn't think we were just in it for- for the money. I mean, we are a country of values and principles. We stand with our allies. He needs security guarantees. Yeah, I understand this concept of economic deal and a ceasefire, but the economic deal comes after the ceasefire. None of that makes sense. They need to get in a room- including with the Russians. I mean, have the Russians given any indication that they want peace? Our Treasury Secretary questioned whether Zelensky wants peace. Of course he does. He has his population being murdered, raped- children are kidnapped. He wants out of this situation, but he- he is having a hard time, obviously, negotiating this in public, by the way. I mean, his English is not the best, so this is hard for him. To corner him in the Oval Office on that kind of stage was wrong and it makes us look weaker as a nation- and it makes us less safe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've been to Ukraine a number of times. Our last guest, Mike Turner, has been to Ukraine a number of times as well. Neither the president nor the Vice President have at all. JD Vance, the Vice President, said to Zelensky, those are propaganda tours. Is that what you did? Did- did you go on propaganda tours?",
      "SEN. KELLY: No, I mean, I went into Patriot batteries and- you know, talked to the troops that every night are defending themselves from incoming ballistic missiles and cruise missiles trying to keep their population alive. I met with soldiers, you know, some of which are, you know, amputees at this point, who just- and soldiers that just came from the front lines to talk to me in person about what the situation on the ground is. I met with pilots there who were about to get their F-16s and we talked specifically about, you know, how can you use this airplane in combat?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.",
      "SEN. KELLY: I think JD Vance, the Vice President, with all due respect. It sounds like he's watching videos on the internet. And to say to Zelensky, you're not being thankful enough, I mean- Zelensky, thanks the American people all the time-",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Yeah--",
      "SEN. KELLY: -- And I got to say, Margaret, if- if we can end this, and I want this to end as much as anybody, but it has to end in a way that the Russians are going to respect. And what was in the Oval Office yesterday was a demonstration of weakness. And I could tell you, Putin does not respect weakness.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the US border, the number of migrants crossing the southern border illegally in President Trump's first full term and first full month in office, plunged to a level we haven't seen in 25 years. This is according to data reviewed by CBS. This seems like this is good for your state. Do these numbers prove President Trump's theory is right?",
      "SEN. KELLY: Well, I think the numbers being down, that's a good thing. What we need long term is a negotiation with the Republicans on long standing border policy. What the administration is doing- especially with ICE raids in schools, with flying- repatriating people who often aren't only criminals in military airplanes for intimidation, talking about housing people on Guantanamo. That's for intimidation. I am- it's good the numbers are down. That's a positive thing-",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.",
      "SEN. KELLY: We need- we need a border security agreement. We need legislation. We also need immigration reform. Talk about my state for a second. We've got a lot of Dreamers. They deserve a pathway to citizenship. We need some- we need a plan for farm workers as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary of Defense Hegseth is sending another 3,000 troops to the border, including an aviation battalion and Stryker vehicle, CBS has confirmed. Now, these soldiers aren't allowed to intercept migrants. Do you understand the mission, the intent? You have oversight over armed services, so I wonder how you feel about this.",
      "SEN. KELLY: Well, I don't feel good about it. The way this should be handled is- if we could work together within the United States Senate, Democrats and Republicans, get the Border Patrol more money, hire more Border Patrol agents, give them more resources to do the job they're supposed to do. When you do it with troops, that affects their readiness. This isn't what they're trained to do. Then they don't get to train to do- that Stryker battalion doesn't get to train to do the job that they need- may need to do one day. I don't want to see us in a conflict around the world anywhere. But what prevents that is for our allies to realize that they're not going to win in a fight and when they see us doing things like this, police actions with the military, that also is showing the rest of the world that our military is less capable and we are weaker. And that affects everybody's safety.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Lastly, because you sit on the Intelligence Committee, I want to ask you about something President Zelensky said. He said in Munich, Ukraine has intel the Russians are sending troops to Belarus to use it as a launch pad militarily into, perhaps not just Ukraine, but other European countries. Are you concerned about that?",
      "SEN. KELLY: Well, I am very concerned about what Putin will do next, if he- if he comes out of this and thinks he got a good deal and this was worth his time and effort and loss of life. He doesn't care about Russian soldiers. He obviously doesn't care about the Ukrainians. Yeah, that would be very concerning for me. I was in the Baltic nations, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, earlier this year. They are very concerned that would be a staging ground for them to attack the Baltics.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. That's why we're watching it so carefully. Senator Kelly, I appreciate your insight.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning to you, Mr. Treasury Secretary.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Good morning Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So let's dig on- in on this, because it seems there's a bit of a perception gap there. Our polling also shows at least half the country reports concern about paying for food and groceries and housing. They continue to call the economy bad, even more so than last month, and 49% told us the economy is getting worse. When can Americans expect to experience the benefits that President Trump said would be coming in day one?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: You know, Margaret, what I find interesting is, for the past year and a half, and during the campaign, most of the media said, Oh, the economy is great. It's just a vibe session. Now that President Trump's in office, there's an economic problem. And I'll tell you what the problem was\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We were pretty straightforward on this program.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, I haven't seen this program, but the- in general, this idea that working class Americans didn't know what they were talking about, they didn't know their lived experience, they didn't know what their pocketbooks were feeling. And I tell you, President Trump was elected, one of the reasons was the affordability crisis, and we are setting about doing that. So after four years, four years of disastrous policies, they were running these gigantic deficits that the- that led to the affordability problem, massive government regulations. So what we had was a demand shock from the government spending that was met by supply constraints with over regulation. So we are in the process of deregulating, which will free the supply side, and we are cutting back the government spending. It took four years to get us here. President Trump has been in office five weeks, and I can tell you, we're working every day. What I will point out, interest rates- a 10 year bond, which I am focused on, have been down every week since President Trump was president. Mortgage rates have been down every week. So that's a pretty good start.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I hear you that sometimes the data lags reality, but when we are talking about people's perceptions of the economy, it's just how they're feeling right now, we see in our polling, 52% of Americans say Trump's policies are making grocery prices go up. They explicitly said that on this bar chart you see there. So it's an experience and a perception issue. When does that shift? When we see the benefits of the planning you say is underway?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Look, I think President Trump said that he'll own the economy in six or 12 months, but I can tell you that we are working to get these prices down every day, but it took four years to get us here, and we've had five weeks so interest rates are down. That's a very good start toward housing affordability, toward auto affordability, and we are tackling this. At Treasury we are going to appoint an affordability czar. We are going to have an affordability Council. We are laser focused on this\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What does that mean? What's an affordability czar?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Someone who picks the five or eight areas where this administration can make a big difference for working class Americans?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Well, one of the things that we hear the President talk about a lot is the plan to use tariffs. I know this falls under the purview of Commerce and the trade rep, but you have spoken a bit about it before. If the President does roll out the 10% tariffs that he says are coming on China this week, the 25% on Canada and Mexico, how much do you think they will impact what Americans experience? The Peterson Institute says it will cost households an additional $1,200 a year.",
      "Speaker 1\u00a0 SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Look, a couple of things I respect my friends at the Peterson Institute, I think they're a bit alarmist. I think a lot of their supporters are anti-tariffs, so they take an anti-tariff position. And look, we have the experience of President Trump's first term, where the tariffs did not affect prices. And it's a holistic approach, that there will be tariffs, there will be cuts in regulation, there will be cheaper energy. So I would expect that very quickly we will be down to the Fed's 2% target. So I'm expecting inflation to continue dropping over the year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So should we expect these tariffs to come March 4?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, there's a series of tariffs. There's March 4, and then there are the big the there's the big tariff program that's going to be outlined on April 2 by commerce and USTR, and that's the President's notion of reciprocal tariffs. And that's going to be very path dependent. It's- we are going to show what are other countries tariffs on specific goods? What are non tariff barriers? What are the currency manipulation, what is manipulation of financing or labor manipulation, and what are these horrendous fines that the European Union is putting on our tech companies, and we are going to evaluate that and give them an opportunity to remedy that, so we could either see a ratcheting up in tariffs, or if our trading partners want to remedy what has been unfair trade, then we could see the tariffs come off. So it's going to be path dependent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that's Europe in April, mainly?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, that's across the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. So when you say the Peterson Institute is too alarmist, with $1,200 a year on the average household, what's the cost of the household? You think it's zero?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, we don't know yet, because it's path dependent, but what I can tell you is that I'm not worried about China. China is going to- China will pay for the China tariffs, because their business model is exporting their way out of this inflation. They are the most imbalanced, unbalanced economy in modern times, and the idea that because of a tariff, that they would lower their production is wrong. They are going to continue flooding the market. They will eat this price decrease. They will eat any tariffs that go on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I saw you say on Bloomberg recently that Mexico has offered to match the US tariffs on China, and that you would like for the Canadians to do so as well. You described it as a fortress in North America. Is that in the works?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: I don't know yet. We'll see the Mexican leadership has offered to do that. We haven't heard from the Canadians, but I think that would be a very good start, because-",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: By Tuesday, potentially to offset the potential punishment on them?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: By Tuesday, or maybe the tariff wall goes up, and then we see what happens from there. But I can tell you that under the cover of COVID, China dramatically increased their export capacity, and they are trying to export their way to prosperity. They are in an economic crisis. They have gigantic deflation, and it's unacceptable for them to export that to the rest of the world. And I think North America would be a very good start for pushing back against this unfair trade policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that would be a significant development.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Very significant.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Which would avoid tariffs that are supposed to go out on Tuesday.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: We'll see.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, we'll be watching that space. I want to ask you about Ukraine. You were in that Oval Office meeting that went sideways on Friday. He- President Zelensky, was told to leave the White House before he signed the minerals agreement that I know you have been working on, he said yesterday, though he is ready to sign it, he called it the first step towards security guarantees. It's not enough. We need more than just that. A cease fire without security guarantees is dangerous for Ukraine. Is the deal still on the table, or has President Trump instructed you to drop the project?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Margaret, it is impossible to have an economic deal without a peace deal. The sine qua non for an economic deal, is that Ukrainian leadership wants a peace deal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I thought this was a building block towards getting to",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, it was supposed to be, but President Zelensky came into the Oval on Friday. There were, there were three things that were going to be done. There was going to be a press conference, there's going to be a private lunch with 16 of us, and as you can see from Dan Scavino's, the post on his X account, we were all ready set up to sign, to sign the deal. So it's unclear now, President Zelensky has thrown off the sequencing, and Margaret, let me tell you the most tragic part of this the President Trump's idea for this economic arrangement was to further intertwine the American people and Ukrainian people and show no daylight. To show the Russian leadership that there was no daylight, and President Zelensky came into the Oval Office and tried to relitigate in front of the world the deal. And we were going- the place to have done it would have been in the private lunch.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, well, it's news to me that this was that the sequencing is shifting, that you were saying you have to agree to a peace deal before the minerals agreement? There aren't even negotiations for a peace deal anyway.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well first of all, it's not a minerals agreement. It's a general economic agreement. So calling it a minerals agreement is incorrect, and I think we have to see if President Zelensky wants to proceed, what's- what's the use in having an economic agreement that's going to be rendered moot if he wants the fighting to continue. President Trump wants a peace deal. .",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Vladimir Putin, it's unclear if he wants a peace deal, though there are no negotiations underway. The Secretary of State said that on another network this morning.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Yeah, and President Trump- President Trump has said that President Trump is trying to move towards peace. He said repeatedly during- during that episode in the Oval we don't know if we'll get a peace deal, but we got to try.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Last Sunday, President Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff, said on another network that the plan for negotiations was the so-called draft Istanbul protocol. The Institute for the Study of War, says that this would leave Ukraine helpless in the face of future Russia\u2013 Russian threats or aggression, if, if that's described as the Future of Us diplomacy and the framework. Why isn't Mr. Zelensky asking the right question when he says, How can I agree to a ceasefire with no security guarantees or even a minerals agreement or investment agreement without security guarantees?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT:\u00a0 Well, look, I think the plan is for the European Union to provide this security, not NATO, the European Union. And again, the tragedy of Friday, and I don't know what President Zelensky was thinking. We had President of France, Emmanuel Macron, in on Monday, great meeting. Then- we had Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday. Fantastic meeting. They were all on board the arc of the peace agreement. All President Zelensky had to do was come in and sign this economic agreement and again show no daylight, no daylight between Ukrainian people and the American people, and he chose to",
      "blow that up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the deal is no longer on the table, just to be abundantly clear.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Not at present.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Treasury Secretary Bessent thank you for coming in today.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Thank you Margaret.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Rep. Mike Turner, Republican of Ohio, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on March 2, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we are back now with Republican Congressman Mike Turner. Good to have you back.",
      "REP. MIKE TURNER: Thank you. Appreciate you having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So what were you thinking when you saw that Oval Office meltdown?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, I mean, the first thing, obviously, is, you know, we have to realize why- why this is important and really what was at stake here. I mean, this is important because Ukraine is important. This is about the- the fight between, you know, authoritarianism and freedom and democracy. This is the Ronald Reagan, you know, evil empire against democracy. So as we're- we're watching this fight, we have to be concerned about what's crumbling here and what needs to be put back together. I think that's what we all felt in our- in our stomachs as- and our- our anxiety as we watched what was at risk here. The second thing is, is really how inappropriate this was for Zelenskyy. I mean, the context is, this was a signing agreement. Zelenskyy had been negotiating with the United States on a minerals deal, an economic deal, as the treasury secretary said. He'd been doing so for weeks. I'd met with him with members of Congress in Munich. He had told us some of the terms that he wanted. He had a successful deal. The United States had conceded. He was flying here under the pretext that he was going to sign this deal. This should have been a win. As he's sitting in the Oval Office, he said, you know, I want, you know, the president to stand with Ukraine. In moments, he was going to be standing with the president of the United States with a win that he had negotiated, and instead of taking that win, he turned it into a debate on American security guarantees during peace negotiation- on the peace negotiations, instead of taking that win and then from that going forward.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it all went sideways after a Polish reporter in the room asked President Trump about his perceived alignment with Vladimir Putin. That's what the President reacted to. And then the vice president jumped in, praising Trump's diplomacy. And that's when Zelenskyy said, what he said about, well, what kind of- of cease-fire and diplomacy are you talking about? I brokered deals with Vladimir Putin in the past. Do you really think that this was all to blow it up, or was it just people are talking past each other? What do you actually think happened?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, I think fundamentally here, you know again, the- you don't fly, you know, a quarter across the world for a signing ceremony for a deal with the president of the United States, and turn it into a debate on American security guarantees, on peace negotiations that- that are unrelated to the mineral deal, that you came- the economic deal, that you- you came to sign.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you can't take things out of the context and the- like treat them in a vacuum. Earlier in the week, President Trump had referred to Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a dictator. He had instructed--",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "REP. TURNER: Which he had- which he had retracted because the negotiations have--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well then he said 'did I really do that?' And then he's told people at the U.N.--",
      "(END CROSSTALK)",
      "REP. TURNER: In- in Trump's way he had taken back- because the negotiations had gone- gone forward in a way that was- that was positive.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But- but- there- this isn't happening in a vacuum. It is within question, in fact, where America's alliances are. French President Emmanuel Macron told a newspaper overnight, there need to be- a there needs to be a strategic dialogue with European countries that don't have nuclear weapons, because they can no longer depend on the American nuclear deterrent. That's an incredible statement from a NATO ally. This is- this is how this is heard around the world.",
      "REP. TURNER: Right. And again, I- all of these things are really hysterics and way over statements, but they're all coming from the crux here of that- that Zelenskyy has made, and I truly believe this is Zelenskyy, he has made a precondition of going forward with peace negotiations American security guarantees. And what you saw was him enter into a very public debate with the president of the United States in the Oval Office of I want- and you heard it. You actually yourself said it to the Secretary of the Treasury. I want an American security guarantee as a precondition for peace negotiations, no one is going to- no president is going to give him a- as a precondition to peace negotiations. You do the peace negotiations, then you determine what security guarantees, what arrangements--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. But he also referred back to failed peace negotiations and failed diplomatic agreements brokered by Europe that had no American guarantee that failed. So it's a what's- what's different this time?",
      "REP. TURNER: But you don't continue a war for it. I mean, you got to hear President Trump. I mean, he- he engaged by saying, you know, people are dying. We need to stop the dying. We can't have- we can't go into World War Two and- and, you know, imploring him to, let's go forward with the peace negotiations, and then we'll determine what security arrangements need to be made around the peace negotiations. The fact that Zelenskyy has it backwards, the cart before the horse. I want a security guarantee to go into peace negotiations is really what has- has- has caused the impediment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you comfortable with the U.S. diplomatic outreach and the decision to no longer isolate Vladimir Putin, because he has not said anything about making any kind of concession. Volodymyr Zelenskyy is being asked to do that publicly.",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, actually, no, he has not, but the Russians showed up. I mean, I'm very comfortable that Marco Rubio, as our secretary of state, in the lead with these negotiations, is- is very competent--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is he in the lead with the negotiations? Or is it Steve Witkoff?",
      "REP. TURNER: I think- He is in the lead with the negotiations. I'm very- I'm very confident of his strength. He has- has, you know, commenced the negotiations. I believe that Zelenskyy needs to trust him, and he needs to- to not have this precondition of American security guarantees, which are not coming. Remember, you know, Ukraine has been before every president, since, since Clinton- Clinton, you know, in the issue of the Budapest, when they were giving up the nuclear weapons, Obama, Bush. Everybody has had Ukraine before them. Every American president has declined to give American security guarantees as a precondition to any negotiations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Which is why Zelenskyy saying give them to me now, because nothing stopped them before. So--",
      "REP. TURNER: The peace negotiations need to occur, and then we need to look at the- what are the construct of what security guarantees need to be and what is that construct that needs to be put in place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you something, because of the position you have on Armed Services. CBS has confirmed these reports that Defense Secretary Hegseth has ordered U.S. Cyber Command to temporarily halt cyber operations and planning against Russia. The Washington Post reports that that's as long as the negotiations continue, there are no negotiations underway. Does this concern you? Have you been briefed on this?",
      "REP. TURNER: I can't- I don't- no, I'm unaware of that and I don't believe that that would be- there are too many, I'm certain, considerations there for that to be an accurate statement, so blanket.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But they have ordered Cyber Command to halt cyber operations.",
      "REP. TURNER: I- considering what I know that- that--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is the linkage to the negotiations, is that your question?",
      "REP. TURNER: Considering what I know, what- what Russia is currently doing against the United States, that would, I'm certain not be an accurate statement of the current status of the United States operations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are confident that the United States--",
      "REP. TURNER: I am confident considering what Russia is currently doing against the United States, the United States status against Russia would not be that- considering what we are facing from Russia operations, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Thank you very much, Congressman Turner.",

    "story": [
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced Sunday that his department will be creating an \"affordability czar\" to address high prices in the U.S. \u2014 a continuing concern for Americans which\u00a0 Bessent says he is \"laser focused on.\"",
      "Bessent described the new role at the Treasury Department as \"someone who picks the five or eight areas where this administration can make a big difference for working class Americans.\" He also previewed the creation of an \"affordability council.\"",
      "\"I think President Trump said that he'll own the economy in six or 12 months, but I can tell you that we are working to get these prices down every day, but it took four years to get us here, and we've had five weeks so interest rates are down,\" Bessent said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"That's a very good start toward housing affordability, toward auto affordability, and we are tackling this.\"",
      "U.S. consumer confidence plummeted in February, marking the steepest monthly decline in over four years, a business research group said Tuesday, with inflation seemingly stuck and a trade war under President Trump seen by a growing number of Americans as inevitable. The report comes after U.S. consumers cut their spending in January by the most in nearly four years, according to Commerce Department data.",
      "\"The Conference Board survey is the 3rd data point in less than a week (after Fri's flash PMIs and Michigan sentiment report) making it abundantly clear that Trump-linked policy uncertainty is eroding confidence and tipping the economy (at least) into a slowdown (if not something worse),\" said Adam Crisafulli, president of investment advisory firm Vital Knowledge, in a note.",
      "A CBS News poll released Sunday showed that 49% of Americans disapprove of Mr. Trump's handling of the economy, and that 52% of Americans say the president\u00a0 policies are causing grocery prices to go up.",
      "Bessent said on \"Face the Nation\" that the perception of inflation by U.S. consumers is rooted in government overregulation during the Biden administration, and that consumers will feel the benefits of the current administration's deregulation efforts moving forward.",
      "\"President Trump was elected, one of the reasons was the affordability crisis, and we are setting about doing that. So after four years, four years of disastrous policies, they were running these gigantic deficits that the- that led to the affordability problem, massive government regulations,\" Bessent said. \"So we are in the process of deregulating, which will free the supply side, and we are cutting back the government spending.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you for making time. So you are the EU's top diplomat, which means you have to help represent 27 different countries. President Trump said the EU was formed in order to screw the United States, that's the purpose of it. What was your reaction to that remark?",
      "HIGH REPRESENTATIVE VICE PRESIDENT KAJA KALLAS:\u00a0 Europe is a peace project. You know, it was created so that we wouldn't have wars between the members of European Union, and we haven't had. And, of course, also to do things together, cooperate more. You know, coming from a country that joined the European Union 20, 20 years ago. Then, we were actually, you know, pushed by the Americans, you know, you will not get into NATO, but, but Europe, the European Union, is something that you should join because it's, it's a good project also for the transatlantic relations. So I was quite surprised to hear a comment like that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Do you know what the President meant by it?",
      "HRVP KALLAS: Well, you have to ask the President, so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Well, it seems to reflect that there is some fairly high tension with the US at this point.",
      "HRVP KALLAS: Yes. The question is why? We have always been good allies. I mean, we have been working together and we have been friends and allies, what comes to the world in different parts of the world, what is happening. We have been cooperating, whether it comes to Ukraine, whether it comes to, also, Middle East. And we see- in the world, we see powers like Russia, North Korea, Iran, more covertly China, working together. And I think this is the moment where we have to work together as transatlantic partners.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Secretary of State Rubio, you had announced you intended to meet with him while you were here, and then that meeting was canceled. Why?",
      "HRVP KALLAS: Oh, well, it was said that it's a calendar issues. But I'm sure we are going to meet again, because we had very good meetings in Munich, and there are a lot of topics that we need to discuss. So we are going to meet in G7 in two weeks time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So you don't think this was a slight?",
      "HRVP KALLAS: Well, you have to ask Secretary of State, but, I mean, we have had such good encounters before, so I don't really read into you know- I know that we are not on top of our calendars. So, so you know things might happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Well, you're here now, France's President Emmanuel Macron was just here, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, President Zelenskyy is flying here. Are all of the European leaders coordinating? And if so, what's the message?",
      "HRVP KALLAS: We are coordinating. And of course, the message is there are several layers. One is that the fight that Ukraine is having is not only about Ukraine sovereignty, but it's much, much broader. It's about freedom of the free world, really. It is about the world where international law applies and the world where might does not make right. It is clear that Russia attacked Ukraine. There is one aggressor and one victim. And we need to really make sure that Russia doesn't attack again. And for that, we need to concentrate our efforts. I mean putting politically and economically pressure on Russia to stop this war, but at the same time also help Ukraine to defend itself.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 But what you just said, is factually accurate, Russia invaded Ukraine. But the Trump administration has decided now not to say that explicitly, arguing that the President needs negotiating room. Do you think that that's persuasive to Vladimir Putin?",
      "HRVP KALLAS: Well, it is certainly, you know, a very strong Russian narrative that they want to- want to really push saying that, you know, oh, it's a conflict between two equal parties, you know. And to clear- I mean, create this chaos where it's very clear. It is very clear. One country attacked another country, very brutally with force, and is bombing Ukraine every day. I mean, President Trump says that he wants the killing to stop. I don't think that anybody wants the killing to stop more than the Ukrainians. And in order to achieve that, we should all put the pressure on Putin, because he can stop the killing by not bombing Ukraine and the Ukrainians so that they don't have to defend themselves. And that's why our plan, our policies, to really put the pressure on Russia. We shouldn't overestimate the power of Russia and underestimate our own power. We know that their economy is not doing well. I mean, their inflation is over 20%, their National Fund is almost completely depleted. They don't have the same revenues from gas and oil that they used to to fund the war machine. So actually, if we concentrate our efforts, we can put the pressure so that they would stop the war, not to offer them anything, you know, on a plate, in addition what they have already done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So why do you think acknowledging who is responsible does matter?",
      "HRVP KALLAS: Well, it does matter who is responsible, so who is accountable for this as well. And why it also matters is that we have the United Nations Charter where we have agreed how countries are, you know, interacting with each other. And it says very clearly that you can't attack sovereignty, territorial integrity of another country, and if you do, there are consequences. And why is it important? It is important for small countries in the world for whom this is the only thing that protects them. If we don't really defend this principle, then we're going to see all these developments that we don't want to see. Because all the countries who are afraid of their neighbors will want to go for nuclear weapons, because this is the only thing that protects them. It's not the international law anymore. And all the countries who have appetite for the neighbors' territory will want to have a nuclear weapon, because it is the only thing by- you know, threatening to use this weapon, you can have what you- what you want, because this is what Russia is doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And yet, at the United Nations this week, you pointed out the U.S. aligned with \"new friends,\" Russia, Belarus, Sudan, North Korea, at the UN. The U.S. voted with them and against a European backed resolution about Ukraine that demanded the withdrawal of Russian troops. The Trump administration would say, it's a UN resolution. It doesn't have a practical impact. Does it?",
      "HRVP KALLAS: Well, yes, not so directly. It doesn't have a practical impact, but it- clearly, I mean, it is saying what kind of principles in the world we are supporting. And of course, we were co-sponsoring, together with the United States, the resolution to support Ukraine. And it was a surprise to us that U.S. suddenly changed the position. I must, you know, really point out that we had the resolution drafted together with the new administration, regarding the support for Ukraine. But when they met the Russians, something happened after that, because the behavior changed. So- so the question is, where do we go from here? Our will and- and wish is to work together with our transatlantic partners for the principles that United States has always stood for. I mean, I'm coming from the country that regained our independence in 1991. It was the time when, you know, Ronald Reagan was really pushing hard for, you know, fight for freedom, and- and we are so grateful for America for doing this. Because we got our independence and freedom back, and therefore also the prosperity and the well being of our people. So we are very grateful. And I'm not- and I don't want to- I don't want to see this- I don't want to let this go. I mean, that, America, you know, is- is not fighting for- for freedom and independence, and, you know, the principles, the basic principles, of the international law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, President Zelenskyy said Ukraine has intelligence that Russia plans to send troops to Belarus, and from there stage forces, either to attack Ukraine or another European country. Do you share that assessment that Russia will continue its march through Europe?",
      "HRVP KALLAS: Russia has been investing more than 9% of its GDP on military. In comparison, European countries are spending 2%. I think my own country is spending over 3%, but- but I think America is spending something around 3 or 4% of its GDP. So if you're investing so much on the military, you will want to use it again. And that's why it is very important how we- how we act here. In 2008, they attacked Georgia. Nothing happened. There was not the strong reaction from the West. In 2014, they annexed Crimea and attacked Ukraine. There was not the strong reaction. So, you know, there was a ceasefire, but ceasefire only gave them possibility to regroup and rearm. That's why it is extremely important that we don't make the same mistake again. If there is a pause, so they are able to get their forces to gather again, we will just see more wars. Everybody wants peace, but the peace has to be a lasting peace. And for lasting peace, it has to put- the pressure has to be put on Russia so that they don't do this again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the- President Zelenskyy and President Macron of France have both talked about creating Europe's own army separate from NATO. Do you see that as likely?",
      "HRVP KALLAS: I mean, NATO is a defense alliance, and- and it is comprised of 32 different armies of, of the NATO member states. So, NATO structure is the military structure, and in terms of war, very important is, who gives orders to whom? So if you have, you know, those through- 32 armies that cooperate together, and you have one structure, then it's clear who gives orders to whom. If you have--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And right now, it's the United States to the Supreme Allied Commander.",
      "HRVP KALLAS: Yes, it is true. But the- but the structure- structure is there. I mean, command structure, but also communication, everything that is necessary, how we work together. So if we say that we create a parallel structure, then, you know, when, in terms of crisis, then who gives orders to whom? Because the armies are just the 32. So that's why I haven't supported a special European army. I'm just saying that all the armies that are there in Europe, but also in NATO, need to work together.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the EU right now does have sanctions on Russia, and Secretary Rubio has pointed to that, saying, Look, Europe has a say in this. They're going to have to make their own decisions on sanctions. Do you think you can keep all 27 countries in line and can keep that pressure on Russia?",

      "KAJA KALLAS: -- That is true, but at the same time, I mean, we are also thinking of different plans. Because, you know, for example, the sanctions, the frozen assets, for example. I mean, we see Russia causing damage to Ukraine every day. We know what this costs. So when we have the frozen assets, then it is, you know, the proceeds can be used for, really, the damages that Russia has caused to Ukraine. And there are--",

      "KAJA KALLAS: There are several arguments, and some- some countries are not in favor because of the different risks. But I think, you know, in the end, everybody will come to the same conclusion. It shouldn't be our taxpayers that pay for the damages caused by Russia in Ukraine. It should be Russia who pays.",

Do you plan to bring a complaint to the World Trade Organization?",
      "KAJA KALLAS: We don't want the trade war with United States. I think there are no winners in trade wars. And I mean, yesterday, I was here and watching the news as well, and you hear the news that consumer confidence in United States is dropping. And you know, if you have trade wars, it increases the prices, and in the end, the consumers will pay for this.

I don't know their relationship with President Trump, but I have seen the strong will that there is. Maybe this critical raw materials deal that President Trump is doing with President Zelenskyy will increase the economic interest of United States in Ukraine. That will, in turn, also give, I mean, the interest- security interest, to protect those economic interests that you have in Ukraine. So, so maybe that is one of the tools.",

And when, you know, our American counterparts are talking about China, but at the same time saying that, you know, we can't step up to Russia. I mean, China is much bigger economy than Russia is, and much bigger army than Russia is. If you're saying that we can't step up to Russia, how can we, you know, really be able to step up to China then.",

      "KAJA KALLAS: We are going to have next Foreign Affairs meeting, Foreign Affairs ministers meeting, and we're going to discuss Iran. Our common position, how we approach Iran. It is clear the way Iran operates, I mean helping Russia in the war against Ukraine, but also their activities in the Middle East, that we have to have a much stronger stance when it comes to Iran. Because developing a nuclear weapon, it's extremely dangerous. And there is one of the points where we need to cooperate with the United States as well.",

      "Andrew Cuomo is running for mayor of New York City, he announced Saturday afternoon, joining a crowded field that includes incumbent Mayor Eric Adams.",
      "Cuomo, who resigned as governor of New York in 2021 after being accused of sexual harassment, began to\u00a0seriously consider entering the mayor's race\u00a0last week, CBS News New York reported.",
      "He is expected to make a public appearance Sunday in Manhattan and rack up some important endorsements.",
      "Cuomo's supporters had\u00a0filed paperwork to form a super PAC\u00a0called \"Fix the City,\" designed to raise $15 million to boost his anticipated campaign.",
      "Cuomo releases video launching mayoral campaign",
      "Cuomo entered the race with an under-the-radar appearance at the Caridad Restaurant in the Bronx and\u00a0a video released on his website and social media platforms.",
      "\"I want New York to not only survive, but for New York to thrive,\" he said in the video.",
      "In a direct address to New Yorkers, he reeled off a litany of problems facing the city \u2013 people dealing with mental illness and homelessness, empty storefronts, graffiti, the influx of migrants and random violence.",
      "\"These conditions exist not as an act of God, but rather as an act of our political leaders, or more precisely, the lack of intelligent action by many of our political leaders,\" Cuomo said.",
      "He reminded voters of his long history of public service that started when he worked for his father,\u00a0former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, and included serving as attorney general.",
      "\"I know what needs to be done and I know how to do it. Experience matters. Leading New York City in the midst of a crisis is not the time or the place for on-the-job training,\" Cuomo said.",
      "The former governor, who racked up a number of accomplishments while in office, from rebuilding LaGuardia Airport and the Moynihan Train Station to legalizing same sex marriage, was also candid about the fact that during his time in public service, he made mistakes.",
      "\"Did I always do everything right in my years of government service?  Of course not. Would I do some things differently knowing what I know now? Certainly. Did I make mistakes, some painfully? Definitely, and I believe I learned from them and that I am a better person for it and I hope to show you that every day,\" Cuomo said.",
      "Why did Andrew Cuomo resign as governor?",
      "Cuomo was first elected governor of New York in 2010. He was reelected twice, serving three terms\u00a0before stepping down in August 2021\u00a0over allegations involving sexual misconduct and his response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Cuomo was accused of sexually harassing nearly a dozen women, including some on his staff. An\u00a0investigation from state Attorney General Letitia James' office\u00a0found he created a hostile work environment with offensive, suggestive comments and unwelcome, nonconsensual touching. The investigation centered around claims from 11 different women.",
      "He has\u00a0denied the allegations\u00a0-- at one point attributing his behavior to his Italian heritage -- but he\u00a0ultimately stepped down\u00a0in the face of\u00a0an impeachment investigation. His legal team later\u00a0sued the attorney general's office\u00a0and\u00a0several of his accusers.",
      "Cuomo's administration was also accused of\u00a0lying about the number of people who died in state nursing homes\u00a0during the\u00a0early days of the COVID pandemic.",
      "Cuomo drew national attention with his\u00a0daily news conferences during the pandemic. While many\u00a0credited him with taking charge of the situation, he was accused of directing his staff to\u00a0underreport the number of nursing home deaths\u00a0by nearly half.",
      "He\u00a0testified before the Republican-led House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic\u00a0as recently as last fall, where lawmakers\u00a0referred him to the Department of Justice for possible prosecution.",

      "It's a\u00a0crowded field in the race against Adams, who is running for reelection\u00a0despite calls for him to resign or be removed from office\u00a0over allegations he\u00a0agreed to cooperate with President Trump's immigration agenda\u00a0in exchange for\u00a0the Department of Justice ordering his criminal charges to be dropped\u00a0-- a claim\u00a0the mayor and his attorney deny.",
      "A recent poll conducted by Tusk Strategies showed Cuomo leading the pack of potential Democratic candidates with 38%, followed by\u00a0Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani\u00a0with 12%, Adams with 10% and six others in single digits.",
      "Congressman Ritchie Torres, who represents a good portion of the Bronx,\u00a0endorsed Cuomo, saying, \"When it comes to confronting the crisis of crime, we need not a nice guy, but a tough guy like Andrew Cuomo.\"",
      "Experts say Cuomo will upend the mayoral race.",
      "\"You know, you're going to see a lot of people now scrambling, either, are they going to get in the race? Are they going to be the anti-Cuomo candidate? And other candidates are going to see their money dry up,\" political analyst JC Polanco said. \"What do you do when the man at the top of the polls is leading by double digits?\"",
      "Expecting his entry, several of Cuomo's opponents were already on the attack Saturday.",
      "New York City Comptroller Brad Lander issued a video saying, \"Andrew Cuomo is not the answer to Eric Adams. We can't trade one corrupt chaos agent for another.\"",

    "summary": "Hampton Dellinger, who leads the Office of Special Counsel, sued President Trump last month after he was fired.",
    "story": [
      "The head of a federal watchdog agency must remain in his job, a judge in Washington ruled on Saturday, saying President Trump's bid to remove the special counsel was unlawful.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson sided with Hampton Dellinger, who leads the Office of Special Counsel, in a legal battle over the president's authority to oust the head of the independent agency that's likely headed back to the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Dellinger sued Trump last month after he was fired, even though the law says special counsels can be removed by the president \"only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\" Jackson, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic president Barack Obama, quickly reinstated Dellinger in the job while he pursued his case.",
      "Jackson rejected the Trump administration's claims that the special counsel's removal protections are unconstitutional because they prevent the president from rightfully installing his preferred agency head.",
      "The judge said allowing the president to remove the special counsel at will would have a chilling effect on his crucial duties, which include guarding the federal workforce from illegal personnel actions, such as retaliation for whistleblowing.",
      "\"The Special Counsel is supposed to withstand the winds of political change and help ensure that no government servant of either party becomes the subject of prohibited employment practices or faces reprisals for calling out wrongdoing \u2014 by holdovers from a previous administration or by officials of the new one,\" Jackson wrote in her decision.",
      "The Justice Department quickly filed court papers indicating it will challenge the ruling to Washington's federal appeals court. The case has already gone up once to the Supreme Court, which previously temporarily allowed Dellinger to remain in his job.",
      "The ruling comes as Dellinger is challenging the removal of probationary workers who were fired as part of the Trump administration's massive overhaul of the government. A federal board on Tuesday halted the terminations of several probationary workers after Dellinger said their firings may have been unlawful.",
      "\"I'm glad and grateful to see the court confirm the importance and legality of the job protections Congress afforded my position,\" Dellinger said in a statement on Saturday. \"My efforts to protect federal employees generally, and whistleblowers in particular, from unlawful treatment will continue.\"",
      "The judge said the special counsel has a \"unique status and mission,\" which requires independence from the president to ensure he can carry out his responsibilities. The office investigates whistleblower claims of reprisal, can pursue disciplinary action against employees who punish whistleblowers and provides a channel for employees to disclose government wrongdoing.",
      "\"If I don't have independence, if I can be removed for no good reason, federal employees are going to have no good reason to come to me,\" Dellinger told reporters outside Washington's federal courthouse after a recent hearing.",
      "The Office of Special Counsel is also responsible for enforcing the Hatch Act, which restricts the partisan political activities of government workers. Dellinger's firing came as Trump administration employees have touted their support on social media for his policies even though the Hatch Act is meant to restrict political advocacy while on duty.",
      "The Justice Department employed sweeping language in urging the Supreme Court last month to allow the termination of the head of an obscure federal agency with limited power. Acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote in court papers that the lower court had crossed \"a constitutional red line\" by blocking Dellinger's firing and stopping Trump \"from shaping the agenda of an executive-branch agency in the new administration's critical first days.\"",
      "Dellinger was appointed by Democratic President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate to a five-year term in February 2024.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's advisers on Saturday morning were still uncertain how to salvage a mining deal with Ukraine, which had been intended as a key first step in a Trump strategy to eventually secure a ceasefire and peace deal between Moscow and Kyiv.",
      "What began as a formal meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy Friday \u2014 a confidence-building step in a path toward peace between Russia and Ukraine \u2014 devolved into a feud, with finger-pointing and accusations.",
      "The president's closest advisers \u2014 stunned after the debacle in the Oval Office \u2014 huddled around the Cabinet Room's oblong table for lunch, sources familiar with the events told CBS News.",
      "Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, retired Gen. Keith Kellogg, and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles were joined by Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina as the group rehashed what had just transpired.",
      "They shared disbelief over what one source characterized as Zelenskyy badgering the president. Another official said that, had Zelenskyy kept his disagreements behind closed doors, the blowup wouldn't have happened.",
      "During the contentious meeting, Mr. Trump and Vance took an aggressive and sometimes belittling tone with Zelenskyy after he expressed doubt over whether Russian President Vladimir Putin would honor a potential peace agreement given that he had repeatedly violated ceasefire deals, including the Minsk agreements, leading up to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.",
      "In the hours after Zelenskyy was asked to leave the White House at the behest of Rubio and Waltz \u2014 with a joint press conference scrapped \u2014 there was discussion about whether the Ukrainian leader should fire whoever may have advised him on Friday's strategy. CBS News has reached out to Ukrainian officials for comment.",
      "Some of the Trump team's frustration targeted Zelenskyy's chief adviser, Andriy Yermak, whom they believed had undermined negotiations in recent days. Others said they weren't so sure it was an adviser problem.",
      "It wasn't the first time Zelenskyy had clashed with his American counterpart. President Biden once hung up on Zelenskyy because of the Ukrainian president's perceived combativeness, sources familiar with the call told CBS News. The friction was kept private and officials insist the dispute was over policy \u2014 not basic facts like which country had started the war.",
      "In recent days, there were signs the multibillion-dollar critical minerals deal might not come to fruition. Neither side had signed preliminary paperwork that typically precedes an economic agreement of this scale.",
      "On Friday morning, Graham, Republican Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, Democratic Sen. Amy Klobochar of Minnesota, and others met privately with Zelenskyy at the Hay-Adams Hotel in Washington, D.C. They recommended that Zelenskyy avoid being contentious, say thank you and sign the deal without changes, according to people in the room.",
      "Some Trump advisers were nervous the deal might go south before the ceremonial signing, but felt confident by the time Mr. Trump greeted Zelenskyy. They viewed it as an economic security guarantee, a shared investment binding the U.S. and Ukraine for a generation, sources said.",
      "Zelenskyy had appealed to the West for ceasefire and post-war security guarantees, which were not explicitly included in the minerals deal. In Kyiv last month, Treasury Secretary Bessent had described the agreement as the foundation for a larger peace deal, and an economic partnership that would provide once the conflict is over a 'long term security shield for all Ukrainians.' However, the deal itself was not a ceasefire or peace agreement. Bessent described it as a very strong signal to Russian leadership of American commitment.",
      "Kyiv had hoped for security guarantees up front that would secure a pledge by the U.S. to help keep the long term peace and prevent Russia from invading again.",
      "The White House expected to finalize a version of the deal Friday that was essentially the same as one Bessent presented to Kyiv in mid-February. One modification: a provision was removed that would have placed a $500 billion cap on the value of minerals Ukraine would provide. The change was made at Ukraine's request because Zelenskyy disliked the narrative that Ukraine owed a certain repayment for past aid, people familiar with the deal said.",
      "\"We were trying to make it reasonable for them,\" one Trump adviser said. Trump's team privately discussed how they liked the new version better because it meant a deal could be worth more than initially conceived.",
      "The minerals deal was a concept Graham had circulated as an avenue to create a new, mutually beneficial relationship for the two countries. Zelenskyy had presented it to Mr. Trump, at Graham's urging, at a meeting at Trump Tower in September.",
      "But on Friday, staff quietly removed the formal ceremonial set-up from the East Room \u2014 a conference table and two podiums, and two sets of binders with unsigned documents.",
      "Zelenskyy on Saturday arrived in London to meet with sympathetic European allies. No plans had been made for Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy to speak again.",
      "In the meantime, America remains the most significant military and financial backer of Ukraine in its war against Russian aggression. There is $3.85 billion in military equipment already designated for delivery to Ukraine, and it is not clear if Mr. Trump will still clear it for delivery.",
      "\"They are fortunate it's not off already,\" a senior U.S. official told CBS News.",

    "story": [
      "Israel's government said early Sunday it supports a proposal to extend the first phase of the ceasefire in Gaza through Ramadan and Passover, though Hamas has insisted on negotiating the truce's second phase instead.",
      "The statement by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office came minutes after the first phase ended, and as talks have begun on starting the second phase that's aimed at ending the war and seeing all remaining living hostages in Gaza returned home.",
      "The statement gives new details on what Israel described as a U.S. proposal: A ceasefire extension through Passover, or April 20. On the first day of the framework, half the hostages, alive and dead, would be released. The rest would be released if an agreement is reached on a permanent ceasefire.",
      "The statement said it was proposed after U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff got \"the impression that at this stage there was no possibility of bridging the positions of the parties to end the war, and that more time was needed for talks on a permanent ceasefire.\"",
      "There was no immediate comment from Hamas, which earlier rejected an Israeli proposal to extend the ceasefire's first phase by 42 days \u2014 doubling its length \u2014 saying it goes against the truce agreement, according to a member of the group who requested anonymity to discuss the closed-door negotiations.",
      "Officials from Israel and mediators Qatar, Egypt and the United States have been involved in negotiations on starting the ceasefire's second phase in Cairo. But Basem Naim, a member of Hamas' political bureau, told The Associated Press there had been \"no progress\" before Israeli negotiators returned home on Friday. Hamas did not attend, but its position has been represented through Egyptian and Qatari mediators.",
      "Under the ceasefire deal's terms, fighting should not resume while negotiations are underway on phase two.",
      "Israel's new statement says it can return to fighting \"if it believes that the negotiations are ineffective,\" and it noted Hamas' refusal to accept the proposal for an extension of the first phase.",
      "However, \"if Hamas changes its position, Israel will immediately enter into negotiations on all the details of the Witkoff plan,\" the statement says.",
      "Before Israel's new statement, an Egyptian official involved in the talks spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the negotiations. The official said Hamas, Qatar and Egypt wanted to continue with the existing ceasefire deal, and they rejected Israel's proposal to extend the ceasefire for four weeks with a release of hostages every Saturday without officially entering negotiations on the second phase.",
      "The Egyptian official said the U.S. wants to start negotiations on the second phase but called for hostage releases during the negotiations. Hamas insisted on a full implementation of the ceasefire terms.",
      "The first phase, which paused 15 months of fighting in Gaza, saw the release of 33 hostages, including eight bodies, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Hundreds of thousands of people returned home to northern Gaza, aid into the territory increased and Israeli forces withdrew to buffer zones.",
      "Hamas started the war with its Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack that left about 1,200 dead in Israel, mostly civilians, and took some 250 hostage. Since then, Israel's military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, who do not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths but say more than half the dead have been women and children.",
      "According to Israel, 32 of the 59 hostages still in Gaza are dead.",
      "The two sides agreed to the three-phase ceasefire deal in January. Talks on the second phase were meant to start the first week of February. Israelis rallied Saturday night to urge their government to continue the deal.",
      "Hamas has reaffirmed its \"full commitment to implementing all terms of the agreement in all its stages and details\" and called on the international community to pressure Israel to immediately proceed to the second phase.",
      "Other challenges complicate the ceasefire's future. Israel has said Hamas cannot be involved in governing Gaza after the war. Netanyahu has also ruled out any role in Gaza for the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, dominated by Hamas' main rival, Fatah.",
      "Hamas leader Mohamed Darwish on Saturday reiterated the group is willing to hand over power to a Palestinian national consensus government or an Egypt-proposed body of technocrats not aligned with Hamas or Fatah. His comments came in an open letter to next week's summit of Arab leaders in Cairo. Hamas has dismissed Israel's suggestion that its leadership go into exile.",
      "Witkoff, speaking on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" last weekend, said that securing the release of the last U.S. national believed to be among the surviving hostages,\u00a0Edan Alexander\u00a0was \"front and center for us.\" Alexander was serving with the Israel Defense Forces when he was abducted during the Oct. 7 terrorist attack,",
      "\"I know his parents,\" Witkoff told CBS News. \"We talk all the time. He's critical. It's one of President Trump's most important objectives is to get all Americans home, and we're going to be successful in getting Edan home, I believe.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington, D.C. \u2014 The number of migrants crossing the U.S. southern border illegally in President Trump's first full month in office plunged to a level not seen in at least 25 years, according to preliminary government data obtained by CBS News.",
      "Last month, Border Patrol recorded about 8,450 apprehensions of migrants who crossed into the country unlawfully between official entry points along the U.S.-Mexico border, the statistics show.",
      "On some days during a record spike in illegal crossings under the Biden administration, Border Patrol recorded more than 8,000 apprehensions in a single day.",
      "February's total, which could be adjusted when the government officially publishes the statistics, would be the lowest monthly apprehensions tally recorded by Border Patrol since at least fiscal year 2000, the last period with public monthly data. The final tallies usually don't deviate much from the preliminary figures.",
      "Over the past 25 years, the only time monthly apprehensions came close to the level recorded in February was in April 2017, when Border Patrol apprehended 11,000 migrants at the southwest border, agency data show.",
      "While monthly data before fiscal year 2000 is not publicly available, the last time Border Patrol averaged roughly 8,000 apprehensions per month over a year was in fiscal year 1968, according to historical statistics.",
      "Illegal crossings along the U.S. southern border have been trending downward over the past year, including under the Biden administration, after spiking to an all-time high in late 2023.",
      "They first dropped in early 2024 after Mexican officials expanded efforts to stop migrants from reaching the U.S. border and then fell further in the summer following former President Biden's move to sharply restrict access to the asylum system.",
      "But the reduction in illegal immigration has been precipitous since Mr. Trump's inauguration.",
      "In January, Border Patrol agents at the Mexican border recorded 29,000 apprehensions, down 38% from 47,000 in December. The drop from January to February was even more pronounced, amounting to a roughly 70% decrease.",
      "Trump administration officials have credited their sweeping, government-wide immigration crackdown for the dramatic decrease in unlawful crossings.",
      "At the U.S.-Mexico border, the Trump administration has empowered federal officials to swiftly deport migrants without hearing their asylum claims, under the premise that the country is facing an \"invasion.\"",
      "U.S. law says migrants on American soil generally have the right to claim asylum to delay or halt their deportation. Trump administration officials have argued the system has been systematically abused by smugglers and economic migrants, who don't qualify for asylum.",
      "Mr. Trump has also directed the American military to help with immigration enforcement, deploying thousands of additional troops to the southern border and tasking military planes with deporting migrants.",
      "While Biden also moved to curtail asylum during his last year in office, Mr. Trump's unprecedented actions are far more restrictive.",
      "Unlike the Biden administration, for example, the Trump administration is not processing, in any significant capacity, asylum-seekers at official border entry points. In fact, a Biden-era system that facilitated that processing through a government app was quickly terminated.",
      "The Trump administration is also considering adding another layer to its restrictions at the border, making plans to invoke a public health law known as Title 42 to summarily expel migrants on the grounds that they could spread diseases like tuberculosis.",
      "Whether migrant flows continue dropping, plateau or increase in the coming weeks and months remains unclear. Historically, migrant arrivals at the southern border have increased in the springtime.",
      "While its border strategy has yielded quick results, the Trump administration's efforts in the U.S. interior, where the president has promised to conduct the largest deportation operation in American history, have encountered significant obstacles.",
      "Top Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have been reassigned in recent weeks amid frustrations that the agency is not carrying out sufficient arrests and deportations.",
      "ICE's detention capacity has also been stretched thin. As of Friday, ICE detention centers were at 117% capacity, with the agency detaining more than 45,000 migrants, 20,000 of whom were first apprehended at the southern border, according to internal government data.",

    "summary": "The Blue Ghost touchdown kicks off two weeks of around-the-clock research by NASA science and technology payloads.",
    "story": [
      "Firefly Aerospace's \"Blue Ghost\" lander dropped out of lunar orbit and swooped to a rocket-powered touchdown early Sunday, pulling off the first fully successful moon landing by a commercially-built and operated robotic spacecraft.",
      "Flying above the far side of the moon in a circular 62-mile-high orbit, the squat lander fired its main engine at 2:31 a.m. EST, kicking off a white-knuckle 63-minute descent to the landing site in Mare Crisium -- the Sea of Crises -- in the northeast quadrant of the moon as viewed from Earth.",
      "The 6.6-foot-tall lander coasted for the next 52 minutes before using its main engine and eight smaller reaction control system, or RCS, thrusters to reduce its velocity from about 3,800 mph to just 90 mph as it moved into position above the landing site.",
      "After autonomously analyzing the terrain below for boulders, slopes, and other hazards, Blue Ghost descended using the power of its eight reaction control system jets. The jets pulsed as needed to control velocity and orientation before slowing the craft to just 2.2 mph for the last 30 feet or so of the descent.",
      "Firefly Aerospace employees and family members, known collectively as \"Fireflies,\" watched telemetry stream in on a large monitor near the company's Austin, Texas, headquarters and mission control center, no doubt on the edges of their seats as the 11.5-foot-wide spacecraft neared the surface.",
      "\"Eleven meters up,\" a flight controller said on the Firefly mission control audio loop. A moment later, the thrusters shut down and surface contact sensors on Blue Ghost's shock-absorbing landing legs indicated they were on the lunar surface.",
      "\"Engine shutdown confirmed,\" a flight controller verified.",
      "\"Power is nominal, vehicle is charging (with its solar cells),\" someone else chimed in.",
      "\"IMU (inertial measurement unit) reports lunar gravity, and it is stable,\" another controller reported, prompting the start of applause from onlookers.",
      "Will Coogan, the chief engineer, then came on the line with the official results: \"You all stuck the landing! We're on the moon!\"",
      "The assembled Fireflies instantly burst into cheers, hugs and raucous applause. A few minutes later, \"Make Space Great Again\" hats were handed out.",
      "\"Firefly successfully touched down on the moon in an upright, stable condition, becoming the first commercial company to complete a fully successful moon landing,\" said Brigette Oakes, Firefly vice president of engineering.",
      "Apollo 11 moonwalker Buzz Aldrin said in a post on the social media platform X: \"'Contact light, engine stop!' Congratulations FireFly Aerospace for Blue Ghost's Mission 1 successful Moon landing today! It also marks a new milestone in the collaborations between NASA and private Space companies.\"",
      "Launched on Jan. 15, the landing was timed to coincide with the start of a two-week-long lunar day. The solar-powered Blue Ghost will operate 10 NASA-sponsored experiments while sunlight is available and, if all goes well, for a few hours into the lunar night using stored battery power. After that, it will fall silent.",
      "\"Once in a blue-moon long-time ago, these type of lunar landers took billions of dollars and countries behind (them) to land on the moon,\" Firefly CEO Jason Kim told CBS News in a pre-launch interview.",
      "\"This is Firefly Aerospace that's gonna land on the moon at fractions of the cost on a fixed-price contract, and doing it with the latest commercial technology,\" he said. \"Just like Simone Biles stuck the landing in the Olympics, we're gonna do the same thing for the state of Texas, for America and for the world.\"",
      "For Ray Allensworth, spacecraft program director at Firefly, the moon will never look the same.",
      "\"We were all dreaming up until now that you look up at the (moon) and you just imagine, like, that's where it's gonna be,\" she said. \"But now, you know it's there, and that's a totally different feeling. So, yeah, the next full moon, I just won't sleep. I'll just stare at it all night.\"",
      "NASA agreed to pay Firefly Aerospace $101 million to carry 10 agency-sponsored science instruments and technology demonstrations, built for $44 million, to the moon as part of the agency's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative.",
      "The CLPS program aims to encourage private industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the surface near the lunar south pole later this decade.",
      "\"Before we can send our humans back to the moon, we are sending a lot of science and a lot of technology ahead of time to prepare for that,\" said Nicky Fox, director of space science at NASA Headquarters.",
      "\"We learned so many lessons during the Apollo era, and the technological and science demonstrations on board Firefly's Blue Ghost will be critical in our ability to not only discover more science, but also to ensure the safety of our spacecraft instruments, and, most importantly, the safety of our astronauts.\"",
      "Firefly's instruments include three designed to study how landing thrusters disturb the lunar soil, how fine-grained dust particles adhere to spacecraft surfaces and whether electrodynamic techniques for removing accumulated contamination will work in the lunar environment.",
      "A drill will bore into the surface below the Blue Ghost to measure soil temperatures at different depths while a novel sample collection system will attempt to literally blow surface particles into a capture device, foregoing the need for robot arm-type retrieval systems.",
      "A radiation-tolerant computer will be tested, another instrument will attempt to pull in and process GPS navigation satellite data from Earth, a retroreflector will serve as a positioning target for Earth-based lasers and another instrument will take X-ray images showing interactions between the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field.",
      "Along with its initial Blue Ghost mission, Firefly holds a $130 million CLPS contract for a second flight in 2026, this one to the moon's far side featuring a Blue Ghost lander and an orbital spacecraft called Elytra. Another CLPS contract valued at $179 million is helping pay for a Blue Ghost lander, a rover and another orbiter.",
      "\"One of these days, we're going to get there in terms of the commercial aspects of the moon,\" Kim said. \"There's going to be a lot of business plans that are going to be self-sustaining and growing. It's a great location to frequently go and test out new missions to sustain life in space, and it's a stepping stone for Mars as well.\"",
      "Blue Ghost is the first of three commercially-developed landers, all launched within the last month and a half, to reach the lunar surface.",
      "Sharing a ride to space with Blue Ghost aboard the same Falcon 9 rocket last January was another moon lander, a spacecraft called \"Resilience\" that was built by Tokyo-based ispace. The company sent its first lander to the moon last year, but it crashed to the surface after running out of fuel due to a software glitch.",
      "The appropriately-named Resilience took a different route to the moon than Blue Ghost, a low-energy trajectory utilizing lunar gravity to help reach the desired descent orbit for a landing attempt in May.",
      "Yet another lunar lander, built by Houston-based Intuitive Machines and known as Athena, was launched last Wednesday by another Falcon 9 and is expected to touch down on the moon March 6. The company's first lander, Odysseus, successfully landed on the moon last year, but it tipped over on touchdown and was unable to complete all its planned research.",
      "Athena also was funded in large part by NASA's CLPS program, which agreed to pay the company $62.5 million to carry a sophisticated drill and mass spectrometer to the moon.",
      "NASA awarded a $15 million technology \"tipping point\" contract to Nokia to test cellular communications on the moon and another $41 million to Intuitive Machines for a small rocket-powered \"hopper\" that will jump into a permanently shadowed crater in search of ice deposits.",

      "Arcing to the east through a crystal-clear early evening sky, the rocket quickly disappeared from view as it consumed propellant and lost weight. Two-and-a-half minutes after liftoff, the first stage fell away and the Falcon 9 continued toward space on the power of its single second stage engine.",
      "A little less than six minutes after that, the upper stage engine shut down, putting the rocket on the planned trajectory. A second one-minute firing was carried out 36 minutes after launch to put the upper stage and its payloads on course for the moon.",
      "Given the on-time launch and assuming no major problems, the Athena lander is expected to descend to touchdown on a flat mesa-like structure known as Mons Mouton on March 6, setting down just 100 miles from the moon's south pole \u2014 closer than any other spacecraft has attempted.",
      "Another privately-built moon lander, Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost, was launched by a Falcon 9 SpaceX rocket on Jan. 15 and is on course to land on the moon early Sunday. Touching down near the center of Mare Crisium, it is equipped with 10 NASA-sponsored instruments to collect data needed for planned astronaut landings in the agency's Artemis program.",
      "Blue Ghost shared its Falcon 9 with yet another moon lander, this one built by the Japanese company ispace. It is on a longer, low-energy trajectory to the moon and is expected to land in May.",
      "What's different about the Athena lander",
      "The Athena lander represents a more complex mission with broader science goals. Intuitive Machines managers say they incorporated dozens of upgrades and improvements to insure a safe, upright landing after the company's first lander, Odysseus, tipped over during touchdown last February.",
      "\"Every time you go, it's ... a roll-the-dice thing,\" said CEO Steve Altemus. \"I think we have higher confidence, but we're also have a much more complicated mission this time.",
      "\"This time we're flying with a deployable drill. We're flying with a deployable rover, we're flying with a drone, (a) rocket-powered drone that hops, flies off the lander and hops along the surface and down into a permanently shadowed (crater).",
      "\"All those deployments and surface operations are new, and we're going to learn when we do those,\" he said.",
      "The Athena lander's Trident drill and a mass spectrometer will analyze the ultra-cold soil beneath the spacecraft. The lander also will deploy a small commercially-built rover and a rocket-powered hopper that will jump up to 300 feet high before bounding into a nearby, permanently shadowed crater in search of ice deposits.",
      "Ice would be a critical resource for future astronauts, if it can be extracted, because it can be turned into drinking water, air and even rocket fuel, providing in situ resources that otherwise would have to be carried up from Earth.",
      "Data collected by orbiting satellites indicate reservoirs of ice may be present in the cold, dark interiors of polar craters that never see the light of the sun. Athena's mission is the first to actually search for the suspected ice from the surface.",
      "The hopper, named Grace after software pioneer Grace Hopper, and the Mobile Autonomous Prospecting Platform rover built by a company called Lunar Outpost, will communicate with the Athena lander via cellular networking equipment provided by Nokia in a first-of-its-kind demonstration.",
      "Other spacecrafts tagging along",
      "A tiny microrover known as Yaoki, provided by Tokyo-based Dymon Co., will be dropped to the surface from the Athena lander. It will provide close-up images of the lunar soil, or regolith, and beam them back to Earth through Athena.",
      "In case all that is not enough, hitching a ride aboard the Falcon 9 are three more independent spacecraft, one provided by NASA and two from private companies.",
      "AstroForge's commercially developed Odin asteroid prospector was released four minutes after Athena, NASA's Lunar Trailblazer satellite was deployed about 20 seconds after that followed a few seconds later by Epic Aerospace's Chimera GEO-1 space tug.",
      "Odin is headed for deep space on an asteroid prospecting mission. It will be the first commercially-built probe to fly beyond the moon, heading for an asteroid flyby to look for potentially valuable mineral deposits.",
      "During the Lunar Trailblazer's two-year mission, two instruments will study the nature of any ice that might be present in the lunar soil below while measuring surface temperatures on a global scale.",
      "The third satellite, known as Chimera GEO, was provided by Epic Aerospace. It's a compact space tug built to move small satellites to different locations in Earth orbit.",
      "The Grace hopper may end up the star of the show. Five hops are planned with the first carrying it to an altitude of about 65 feet to a landing another 65 feet from Athena.",
      "\"On the second hop, we expect to go around 50 meters (164 feet) altitude. And on the third hop we'll go about 100 meters (328 feet) altitude,\" said Trent Martin, a senior vice president at Intuitive Machines.",
      "The fourth hop will carry Grace into a permanently shadowed crater some 1,500 from the lander. It's fifth and final hop, either commanded through the Nokia network or triggered by a backup timer, will carry Gracie back up and out of the crater.",
      "\"The purpose of the demo is to show that we can reach extreme environments with technologies other than rovers,\" Martin said. \"The idea is that if you have a really deep crater and you want to get down into that crater, why not do it with something like a drone?\"",
      "The costs of the mission",
      "NASA paid Intuitive Machines $62 million to deliver the Trident drill and mass spectrometer, known collectively as Prime-1, to the moon. NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million to help fund Nokia's cellular communications integration and another $41 million helps finance Intuitive's Grace hopper.",
      "Finally, NASA spent another $89 million on the Lunar Trailblazer satellite and mission operations. Total cost to NASA: $207 million.",
      "The mission was funded in large part by the agency's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative.",
      "The CLPS program is aimed at encouraging private industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the surface near the lunar south pole later this decade.",
      "\"NASA is investing in commercial delivery services to the moon to enable industry growth and to support long-term lunar exploration, helping the United States stay ahead in space innovation,\" said Nicola Fox, head of NASA's space science mission directorate.",
      "Athena is Intuitive Machines' second CLPS-sponsored lunar lander. The company's first lander, Odysseus, touched down on the moon on Feb. 22, 2024. But the spacecraft came down harder than expected and it was moving slightly to one side at the moment of touchdown. It apparently caught a footpad on the surface and tipped over on its side.",
      "The spacecraft still had power, however, and it sent back data for several days. This time around, multiple upgrades were put in place to insure a safe landing for Athena.",
      "\"If you can routinely land on the moon, all the smart people, the scientists, and the engineers that want to fly things to the moon will now be willing to invest money, to build and engineer the systems that will help us live and work on the moon,\" Altemus said.",
      "\"These are the initial highways or trails that open up a whole new region of exploration of the moon. Like the United States when it was very young, go west, right? This is like that. Just like that.\"",

    "story": [
      "Microsoft is pulling the plug on Skype, the pioneering Internet telecommunications and video call platform it bought\u00a0nearly 14 years ago for $8.5 billion.",
      "\"We will be retiring Skype in May 2025 to focus on Microsoft Teams (free), our modern communications and collaboration hub,\" already used by hundreds of millions of people at work, school and home,\" Jeff Teper, president of collaborative apps and platforms at the Redmond, Washington-based software company,\u00a0said on Friday in a statement.",
      "Microsoft in late 2012\u00a0scrapped its own instant-messaging\u00a0tool, Messenger, after buying Skype the prior year. But in the more than decade since, services including FaceTime, Messenger and WhatsApp have let people connect in ways that made it difficult for Skype to compete.",
      "The difficulties were illustrated in particular during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic that saw people\u00a0stuck at home flocking to Zoom. Microsoft launched Teams for consumers in 2020, while saying at the time it remained committed to Skype.",
      "Skype was launched in 2003 by entrepreneurs Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis, with the company's name combining \"Sky\" with a reference to peer-to-peer networks, the technology that during the dotcom boom became an important new way for sharing online files and data.",
      "The company's founders first sold Skype to eBay in 2005 for $2.6 billion. Microsoft's acquisition in May of 2011, at the time the biggest ever purchase for the software maker, gave it access to a user base of about 170 million people who logged in to Skype each month. That count morphed to more than 300 million monthly users by 2016, but had shriveled to 36 million in 2023, Microsoft said.",
      "Those now using Skype will have time to log in to the Microsoft Teams app and have their message history, group chats and contacts available without having to create an additional account, according to Microsoft. Users can also opt to export their data to another app.",
      "Skype will be available until May 5, giving users about two months to decide which option they want to take.",

    "summary": "Law enforcement agencies from Australia to Canada helped detain dozens of suspects linked to a Denmark-based AI child sex abuse platform, Europol says.",
    "story": [
      "The Hague\u00a0\u2014 A global campaign has led to at least 25 arrests over child sexual abuse content generated by artificial intelligence and distributed online, Europol said Friday.",
      "\"Operation Cumberland has been one of the first cases involving AI-generated child sexual abuse material, making it exceptionally challenging for investigators due to the lack of national legislation addressing these crimes,\" the Hague-based European police agency said in a statement.",
      "The majority of the arrests were made Wednesday during the world-wide operation led by the Danish police, and which also involved law enforcement agencies from the EU, Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand. U.S. law enforcement agencies did not take part in the operation, according to Europol.",
      "It followed the arrest last November of the main suspect in the case, a Danish national who ran an online platform where he distributed the AI material he produced.",
      "After a \"symbolic online payment, users from around the world were able to obtain a password to access the platform and watch children being abused,\" Europol said.",
      "Online child sexual exploitation remains one of the most threatening manifestations of cybercrime in the European Union, the agency warned.",
      "It \"continues to be one of the top priorities for law enforcement agencies, which are dealing with an ever-growing volume of illegal content,\" it said, adding that more arrests were expected as the investigation continued.",
      "While Europol said Operation Cumberland targeted a platform and people sharing content fully created using AI, there has also been a worrying proliferation of AI-manipulated \"deepfake\" imagery online, which often uses images of real people, including children, and can have devastating impacts on their lives.",
      "According to a report by CBS News' Jim Axelrod in December that focused on one girl who had been targeted for such abuse by a classmate, there were more than 21,000 deepfake pornographic pictures or videos online during 2023, an increase of more than 460% over the year prior. The manipulated content has proliferated on the internet as lawmakers in the U.S. and elsewhere race to catch up with new legislation to address the problem.",
      "Just weeks ago the Senate passed a bipartisan bill called the \"TAKE IT DOWN Act\" that, if signed into law, would criminalize the \"publication of non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII), including AI-generated NCII (or \"deepfake revenge pornography\"), and requires social media and similar websites to implement procedures to remove such content within 48 hours of notice from a victim,\" according to a description on the U.S. Senate website.",
      "As it stands, some social media platforms have appeared unable or unwilling to crackdown on the spread of sexualized, AI-generated deepfake content, including fake images depicting celebrities. In mid-February, Facebook and Instagram owner Meta said it had removed over a dozen fraudulent sexualized images of famous female actors and athletes after a CBS News investigation found a high prevalence of AI-manipulated deepfake images on Facebook.",

    "story": [
      "Apple shareholders on Tuesday rejected a proposal to end the iPhone maker's diversity, equity and inclusion program.",
      "The National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank, had called on Apple to follow other major companies in backing off from DEI, which has come under fire from Republicans and from President Donald Trump.",
      "\"DEI poses litigation, reputational and financial risks to companies, and therefore financial risks to their shareholders, and therefore further risks to companies for not abiding by their fiduciary duties,\" according to the\u00a0proposal offered by the group. It offered a similar proposal at Costco's annual meeting in January that shareholders also\u00a0rejected.",
      "\"The risks to Apple stemming from continuing to push these divisive and value-destroying agendas is only increasing in light of President Trump's recent executive order focusing the Department of Justice on rooting out illegal discrimination being carried out in the name of DEI,\" Stephen Padfield, executive director of the National Center for Public Policy Research's Free Enterprise Project, said in a prerecorded statement played to Apple shareholders on Tuesday.",
      "\"The vibe shift is clear, DEI is out and annual merit is in,\" Padfield said.",
      "In responding to the anti-DEI proposal, Apple defended its diversity program as an integral part of its corporate culture, crediting the policies in part for making the technology giant the most valuable company in the world.",
      "\"We've never had quotas or targets for Apple. Our strength has always come from hiring the very best people and then providing a culture of collaboration,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said during a question-and-answer period at the meeting, while conceding the company may need to revise aspects of its diversity policies \"as the legal landscape\" around DEI evolves.",
      "\"But our North Star of dignity and respect for everyone, and our work to that end, will never waver,\" he said.",
      "Apple disclosed in 2022 that nearly three-fourths of its global workforce consisted of white and Asian employees; early two-thirds of its employees were men.",
      "Mr. Trump slammed the decision by Apple shareholders to reject the proposal to end the company's DEI initiatives.",
      "\"Apple should get rid of DEI rules, not just make adjustments to them. DEI was a hoax that has been very bad for our country. DEI is gone!!!\" he wrote in a social media post on Wednesday.",

      "Shifting DEI landscape",
      "Certain forms of DEI have become more legally risky than just a few years ago, yet practices such as employers posing standardized questions in recruitment to mitigate implicit bias are legally sound, according to David Glasgow, an adjunct professor at the New York University School of Law and executive director of its Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging.",
      "\"DEI is a really broad umbrella term covering things like disabilities, parental leave and flexible work. The anti-DEI folks have done a good job of driving the narrative that it's all about racial quotas and preferences,\" which in reality is just a narrow slice of such initiatives, Glasgow told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Some companies' response to the current legal and political climate is a matter of rebranding, Glasgow said. Businesses may ditch the terms diversity, equity and inclusion, while substituting references to \"welcoming\" and \"belonging.\"",
      "\"[I]t's more about getting anti-DEI activists off their back,\" Glasgow said.",
      "Critics of DEI say employer hiring and promotion decisions should be based on merit alone without regard to race, color, gender and other categories. By contrast, advocates of these policies say that supporting inclusivity doesn't inhibit companies from rewarding top-performing employees, while also helping organizations create a respectful workplace culture.",
      "Despite the pushback on diversity, roughly half of corporate leaders who were surveyed after Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration said they weren't considering rolling back their DEI programs, according to a new\u00a0survey\u00a0of 350 C-suite executives from Littler, a law firm focused on labor and employment issues.

    "story": [
      "Over the last month, the U.S. government has worked quickly to pause, disband and dismantle the U.S. effort to fight foreign meddling in elections, raising concern among federal lawmakers and election officials across the country who rely on the federal cybersecurity agency and its counterparts to warn them about attacks on election systems.",
      "First came a flurry of notices forcing out Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency personnel who are tasked with stopping foreign interference in U.S. elections \u2014 at least a dozen have been put on leave or fired over the past month. Then, on Attorney General Pam Bondi's first day in office on Feb. 5, she disbanded the FBI task force targeting foreign influence operations originating from places like Russia, China and Iran.",
      "The focus on election security has been turned toward the past, rather than the future. In an internal memo earlier this month, CISA's acting director announced an internal investigation to assess every position and program that touches election security \u2014 including election misinformation and disinformation \u2014 dating back to President Trump's first term in office, with findings to be delivered in a final report on March 6.",
      "The message, penned by Acting Director Bridget Bean and first reported by Wired, also revealed the defunding of a nationwide program to train state and local government officials and offer threat monitoring services through a center known as the \"Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center.\"",
      "\"It is necessary to rescope the agency's election security activities to ensure CISA is focused exclusively on executing its cyber and physical security mission,\" Bean wrote in the message, echoing Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's assertion during her confirmation hearing that the agency had strayed \"far off mission.\"",
      "The memo landed in the mailboxes of CISA's roughly 3,400 personnel on Valentine's Day, hours before more than 130 probationary workers \u2013 roughly 4% of the nation's cyberdefense agency \u2014 were summarily fired with form-letter terminations.",
      "Top Democrats on the Senate and House committees overseeing election legislation expressed \"grave concern\" over the changes in a letter to CISA's top leaders, noting the agency's \"establishing legislation clearly directs it to work on elections.\"",
      "\"We're here because in 2016 a foreign government \u2014 Russia \u2014 tried to tamper with our stuff,\" Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon told CBS News. \"They tried to physically hack into election systems,\" he added, noting Minnesota was just one of 21 states targeted, setting into motion a January 2017 designation of elections as critical infrastructure.",
      "In a letter to President Trump, Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes likened the cuts to shutting down the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ahead of hurricane season. \"This decision undermines Arizona's election security at a time when our enemies around the world are using online tools to push their agendas and ideologies into our very homes,\" he wrote.",
      "The moves come months after CISA and the FBI aided states responding to a slew of Election Day bomb threats and white powder mailings. Officials debunked phony Russian-linked videos\u00a0purporting to depict election workers destroying ballots during nationwide voting, and an FBI investigation outed a hack-and-leak operation that stole documents from Mr. Trump's campaign, leading to the indictment of three Iranian cyber operatives.",
      "CISA and the FBI possess a broader view of the threat landscape that election officials find to be helpful in sizing up the threats facing them. \"You know it would be difficult to comprehend 50 states doing this on their own,\" Pennsylvania Secretary of State Al Schmidt told CBS News. \"Each state runs elections in accordance with federal and state law\u2026 but no state has a national or global perspective on the nature of threats and the capabilities of bad faith actors seeking to disrupt our electoral process.\"",
      "While state and local governments run elections nationwide, federal agencies like CISA and the FBI coordinate with election offices to help safeguard against rising cyber and physical threats, while uncovering foreign influence campaigns designed to sow division among Americans and uproot voter confidence.",
      "\"States can often see only the effects of the attacks \u2014 disinformation directed at them and their voters and threats, but they have no insight into where those attacks are coming from, and therefore, have a limited ability to respond,\" said David Becker, CBS News election law expert and political contributor. \"CISA, the FBI Foreign Influence Task Force, and others, have that 'birds-eye view' insight, both detecting the source of the attacks \u2014 domestic or foreign, nations or criminal actors \u2014 as well as how they all fit into the big picture.\"",
      "In a letter to the DHS secretary on Friday, nearly 40 chief election officials wrote to try to persuade Noem to maintain cybersecurity and physical security services provided to states. \"Information technology systems related to election administration have long been targeted by sophisticated cyber threat actors including nation-state and cybercriminal groups,\" leaders of the National Association of Secretaries of State wrote. \"CISA's prioritized services help election entities defend against these national security threats.\"",
      "DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that \"CISA needs to refocus on its mission\" and is \"undertaking an evaluation of how it has executed its election security mission with a particular focus on any work related to mis-, dis-, and malinformation.\"",
      "But the cuts across CISA and the FBI targeted teams may not only affect their ability to identify false content online but could also affect safeguards protecting election infrastructure from being undermined, according to multiple current and former U.S. officials. The teams have rooted out covert operations from Russia, China and Iran in the last year alone. Among the cyber agency employees targeted are members of CISA's Election Security Resilience Team, the Cybersecurity Advisory Committee and Regional Election Security Advisors, multiple current and former federal and state officials told CBS News.",
      "The new administration has not yet nominated a new CISA director, with the agency's highest-ranking political appointee, Karen Evans, now serving as a senior adviser.",
      "Earlier this month, Mr. Trump\u00a0attempted to fire the chair of the Federal Election Commission, a move that coincides with the adjudication of campaign finance complaints from the 2024 election, including those against tech billionaire and presidential ally Elon Musk.",
      "Mr. Trump and some conservatives on Capitol Hill have accused CISA of policing speech by coordinating with social media companies to identify online misinformation and disinformation ahead of the 2020 election. They accused the agency of \"censorship,\" which CISA officials have repeatedly denied. Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court threw out a lawsuit over the government's work, but the blowback prompted CISA to curb those conversations with tech platforms in 2021, according to three former U.S. officials.",
      "\"That is not our role, that's not what we do,\" former CISA Director Jen Easterly told reporters last year, ahead of the 2024 election. \"We're looking to work with our partners on overall threats to election infrastructure.\"",
      "CISA's ongoing internal probe appears to follow a Jan. 20-related directive instructing the attorney general and agency leaders to investigate Biden administration activities that are \"inconsistent\" with Trump's vow to end \"online censorship.\"",
      "DHS and CISA did not immediately respond to CBS News' questions about who directed the audit and would not say whether the report would be publicly released. The Justice Department did not respond to questions about whether the attorney general would be consulted on the investigation.",
      "\"I'm concerned and alarmed at what looks like a retreat from the anti-disinformation mission,\" Simon said. \"If a foreign adversary is spinning up a false narrative about our election system that could impact physical security, all it takes is one person who believes this disinformation to act out in a violent or threatening, harassing or intimidating way. All it takes is one.\"",

      "The 2025 Oscars are underway as \"Conclave,\" \"Emilia P\u00e9rez,\" \"A Complete Unknown,\" \"Wicked\" and \"The Brutalist\" are each looking to turn their multiple nominations into big wins, including for best picture, at the 97th Academy Awards.",
      "\"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" had the most nominations this year with 13, including nods for best picture, best director, best writing and multiple acting nominations. Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n made Oscar history when she became the first transgender woman to be nominated in any acting category when she received a best actress nomination for playing the film's title role. Her Oscar campaign, however, has since become marred by controversy after offensive posts she made on social media surfaced.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n will be competing against Cynthia Erivo, who plays the wicked witch Elphaba in \"Wicked,\" Demi Moore, who took home the Golden Globe in this category for her role in \"The Substance,\" Mikey Madison and Fernanda Torres. Should Erivo win, she would achieve EGOT status, meaning she will have won an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony award.",
      "\"Wicked,\" based on the hit Broadway musical, and \"The Brutalist\" both came in second with 10 nominations each, also competing for best picture, best director and a slew of acting nominations.",
      "Ariana Grande is up for best supporting actress for her role as Galinda, the good witch, in \"Wicked.\" She'll be taking on Felicity Jones, nominated for her role in \"The Brutalist,\" Zoe Salda\u00f1a, Isabella Rossellini and Monica Barboro, who played singer Joan Baez in the Bob Dylan biopic \"A Complete Unknown.\"",
      "Barboro's co-star, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, was nominated for best actor for his performance as the iconic folk singer. He'll be competing against Adrian Brody, who at age 29 became the youngest person ever to win best actor. If Chalamet, currently 29, were to win Sunday night, he would break Brody's record by just a few months. But they both face stiff competition in the category from Ralph Fiennes, who starred in \"Conclave,\" Colman Domingo and Sebastian Stan, who could become the first person to ever win best actor for playing the sitting U.S. president.",
      "Rounding out the best picture category are \"Dune: Part Two,\" \"Anora,\" \"I'm Still Here,\" \"Nickel Boys\" and \"The Substance.\"",
      "Former \"Late Night\" and \"The Tonight Show\" host Conan O'Brien is helming this year's ceremony. A two-time host of the Emmys, this is O'Brien's first time as master of ceremonies for the Academy Awards.",

      "The duration of the pause is unclear, and the reasoning behind it is unknown at this time.

      "The directive was first reported by The Record, a cybersecurity news publication.",
      "Asked for comment, a senior U.S. defense official said, \"Due to operational security concerns, we do not comment nor discuss cyber intelligence, plans, or operations. There is no greater priority to Secretary Hegseth than the safety of the Warfighter in all operations, to include the cyber domain.\"",
      "Asked about the pause on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday morning, Republican Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio said, \"I'm unaware of that. I don't believe \u2014  there are too many, I'm certain, considerations there for that to be an accurate statement so blanket.\"",
      "When pressed, Turner, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee and is the former chair of the House Intelligence Committee, said, \"Considering what I know, what Russia is currently doing against the United States, that would I'm certain not be an accurate statement of the current status of the Unites States operations.\"",
      "On CNN State of the Union, national security adviser Mike Waltz said he was also unaware of the directive. Asked whether there were talks about pausing offensive cyber operations against Russia, Waltz said, \"That has not been part of our discussions. There will be all kinds of carrots and sticks to get this war to an end.\"",

      "But they're more split on whether that's for the better or worse.",
      "His approach to immigration and deportation continues to receive positive marks, and his border policies are seen as effective. A large majority agree there is some waste in the federal government.",
      "DOGE and Elon Musk's efforts divide the nation, though, as Americans foresee an impact from dismissing federal workers. Half the country thinks this will cut their services and remove essential people. Half think it'll save money.",
      "Either way, it isn't the main issue they want Mr. Trump focused on. They overwhelmingly say he should prioritize inflation and the economy, and far fewer think he actually is.",
      "The people who think Mr. Trump is changing the government for the better \u2014 who include a lot of Republicans and people who voted for him \u2014 overwhelmingly approve of things like his policies on deportation and his efforts to reduce the federal workforce. They would specifically give Elon Musk and DOGE a lot of influence.",
      "Those who see major changes for the worse \u2014 most Democrats and those who didn't back him \u2014 go the other way on all of this. Most of them don't think Musk and DOGE ought to have any influence. They see reductions in the workforce as eliminating essential workers and as having the effect of consolidating Mr. Trump's power.",

      "For most Republicans, these reductions will lead to efficiencies and savings.",
      "For Democrats, it'll remove essential workers, and they also see political impacts: removing workers who don't support him and conferring more power on Mr. Trump.",
      "The public is on balance wary of Musk and DOGE's access to government agency data records. Democrats and independents think he has too much access, but Republicans either say he has the right amount or would give him more.",
      "That said, most do think there is at least some waste in the federal government, and that view crosses party lines. But they differ on how much and what causes it: Republicans think there is a lot, mostly caused by fraud in the system, while Democrats think there is only some, mostly caused by poor spending decisions.",
      "Is Trump prioritizing what people want?",
      "Mr. Trump gets narrowly positive ratings for handling the economy, but not inflation specifically.",
      "There's a big difference between what Americans think Mr. Trump ought to give high priority and what they think he is prioritizing.",
      "They overwhelmingly want Mr. Trump focused on the economy and inflation. That cuts across partisan lines. (Perhaps no surprise there, as they've been among Americans' top issues for years.)",
      "The percent who think he is giving a lot of priority to the economy and inflation, though, is far lower.",
      "Most think he is prioritizing the border, the federal workforce and tariffs, more so than inflation. And his policies aren't seen as driving down food and grocery prices.",
      "The focus on the border does help him politically: he gets approval on his handling of immigration, and most continue to back his deportation policy. Most say his policies are reducing the number of migrants crossing the border.",
      "That all leaves Mr. Trump's approval rating in positive territory, but more closely divided than a couple of weeks ago.",
      "In all, Republicans now overwhelmingly think things in the country are going at least somewhat well, which has driven up the overall percentage of Americans who are saying that since Mr. Trump took office.",

      "Interviewing for the poll was almost entirely conducted prior to the Oval Office meeting between Mr. Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "Americans overall want to remain engaged on the world stage. Though few think the U.S. should take the leading role in the world, most do think it should work alongside its allies.",
      "And most see the nations of Western Europe collectively (Great Britain, France, Germany and Italy) as allies of the U.S.",
      "Half of Americans say they back Ukraine in the conflict with Russia, almost half are neutral.",
      "In interviews largely conducted prior to the Trump-Zelenskyy meeting, few Americans thought Mr. Trump favored Ukraine in the Ukraine-Russia conflict.",
      "Those who personally support Ukraine overwhelmingly say Mr. Trump favored Russia, while those who don't pick a side overwhelmingly say he's treated them equally.",
      "His handling of the conflict is largely split along party lines.",

      "Washington \u2014 Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday that an economic deal with Ukraine is not currently on the table after the contentious Oval Office meeting between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "\"All President Zelensky had to do was come in and sign this economic agreement, and again show no daylight \u2014 no daylight \u2014 between Ukrainian people and the American people, and he chose to blow that up,\" Bessent said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "The signing of a key economic agreement was abruptly canceled Friday and Zelenskyy's visit was cut short after the meeting devolved into a feud between the Ukrainian president on one side and Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance on the other. Zelenskyy was ultimately asked to leave the White House, and the multibillion-dollar critical minerals deal went unsigned.",
      "Friday's heated exchange came after Zelenskyy expressed doubt over whether Russian President Vladimir Putin would honor a potential peace agreement, following repeated violation of previous ceasefire deals. Meanwhile, peace negotiations to end the war between Russia and Ukraine are not yet underway, though Mr. Trump repeatedly pledged to bring an end to the war promptly after taking office.",
      "Still, Zelenskyy\u00a0said\u00a0on social media Saturday that Ukraine is ready to sign the minerals agreement, calling it \"the first step toward security guarantees,\" while noting that the country needs more assurances.",
      "\"A ceasefire without security guarantees is dangerous for Ukraine,\" Zelenskyy said. \"We've been fighting for three years, and Ukrainian people need to know that America is on our side.\"",
      "Bessent, who crafted the economic agreement, said Sunday that it's \"impossible to have an economic deal without a peace deal,\" while acknowledging that the economic deal was initially supposed to be a building block toward securing a peace deal in Ukraine.",
      "\"President Zelenskyy has thrown off the sequencing,\" Bessent said, noting that the administration was set up for the deal signing on Friday.",
      "The treasury secretary said the \"most tragic part\" of Friday's breakdown is that Mr. Trump's plan was to use the economic arrangement to \"further intertwine the American people and Ukrainian people\" and to \"show the Russian leadership that there was no daylight\" between them.",

      "Rep. Mike Turner, an Ohio Republican, said on \"Face the Nation\" that Zelenskyy's behavior at the meeting \"inappropriate,\" and the meeting \"should have been a win.\"",
      "\"Instead of taking that win, he turned it into a debate on American security guarantees on the peace negotiations instead of taking that win and then from that going forward,\" Turner said.",
      "Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat who also appeared on \"Face the Nation,\" acknowledged that \"that kind of negotiation should not be done in public in front of cameras,\" while arguing that Zelenskyy \"was cornered and he was bullied in the Oval Office.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington.",
      "And this week on Face the Nation: the latest on the fallout following Friday's Oval Office brawl. And Americans say they want more action from the Trump administration when it comes to fighting inflation.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): You don't have the cards right now. With us, you start having cards, but right now, you don't\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY (Ukrainian President): We are not playing cards.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It was a debacle seen and heard around the world, as the meeting meant to solidify an alliance between the U.S. and Ukraine melted down into a shouting match featuring President Trump and Vice President Vance versus Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "U.S. and Ukrainian officials are now in full damage control mode, with European leaders racing to bring both sides back together and move towards a resolution to the war in Ukraine.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent crafted the agreement with Ukraine that fell apart during that meeting. We will talk to him about that, as well as the administration's plans to help the economy.",
      "We will also talk with Arizona Democratic Senator Mark Kelly and two Republican members of Congress, Ohio's Mike Turner and Michigan's John James.",
      "And just before President Trump's first formal address to Congress, how do Americans think he's doing when it comes to tackling their priorities?",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "We will get to the ramifications of that meeting in the Oval Office in a moment, but we want to begin with the issues that are top of mind for most Americans, inflation and the economy.",
      "They may be at the top of their priority list for the new administration, but we are seeing a disconnect. When asked what they think the administration is prioritizing, Americans see inflation and the economy taking a back seat to the border, the federal work force, tariffs, and more.",
      "In fact, according to our CBS News poll, although people do approve of him on some of those other issues, there is a 50-point gap between people who say the president should make inflation a priority and those who say he is.",
      "We want to welcome to the program Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.",
      "Good morning to you, Mr. Treasury Secretary.",
      "SCOTT BESSENT (U.S. Treasury Secretary): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, let's dig on \u2013 in on this, because it seems there's a bit of a perception gap there.",
      "Our polling also shows at least half the country reports concern about paying for food and groceries and housing. They continue to call the economy bad, even more so than last month, and 49 percent told us the economy is getting worse.",
      "When can Americans expect to experience the benefits that President Trump said would be coming in day one?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Yes, what \u2013 you know, Margaret, what I find interesting is, for the past year-and-a-half and during the campaign, most of the media said, oh, the economy is great, it's just a vibe session.",
      "Now that President Trump's in office, there's an economic problem. And I will tell you what the problem was. This is\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We were pretty straightforward on this program.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, I haven't seen this program, but the \u2013 in general, this idea that working-class Americans didn't know what they were talking about, they didn't know their lived experience, they didn't know what their pocketbooks were feeling.",
      "And I will tell you, President Trump was elected, one of the reasons was the affordability crisis, and we are setting about doing that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Number one.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: So, after four years, four years of disastrous policies, they were running these gigantic deficits that the \u2013 that led to the affordability problem, massive government regulations, so what we had was a demand shock from the government spending that was met by supply constraints with overregulation.",
      "So we are in the process of deregulating, which will free the supply side, and we are cutting back the government spending. It took four years to get us here. President Trump has been in office five weeks.",
      "And I can tell you, we're working every day. What I will point out, interest rates, the 10-year bond, which I am focused on, have been down every week since President Trump was president. Mortgage rates have been down every week. So that's a pretty good start.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I hear you that sometimes the data lags reality, but when we are talking about people's perceptions of the economy, it's just how they're feeling right now, we see in our polling, 52 percent of Americans say Trump's policies are making grocery prices go up.",
      "They explicitly said that on this bar chart you see there. So it's an experience and a perception issue. When does that shift? When do we see the benefits of the planning you say is under way?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Look, I think President Trump said that he'll own the economy in six or 12 months. But I can tell you that we are working to get these prices down every day.",
      "But it took four years to get us here, and we've had five weeks. So interest rates are down. That's a very good start toward housing affordability, toward auto affordability, and we are tackling this.",
      "At Treasury, we are going to appoint an affordability czar. We are going to have an affordability council. We are laser focused on this. We\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What does that mean? What's an affordability czar?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Someone who picks the five or eight areas where this administration can make a big difference for working-class Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "Well, one of the things that we hear the president talk about a lot is the plan to use tariffs. I know this falls under the purview of Commerce and the trade rep, but you have spoken a bit about it before.",
      "If the president does roll out the 10 percent tariffs that he says are coming on China this week, the 25 percent on Canada and Mexico, how much do you think they will impact what Americans experience? The Peterson Institute says it will cost households an additional $1,200 a year.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Look, a couple of things.",
      "I respect my friends at the Peterson Institute. I think they're a bit alarmist. I think a lot of their supporters are anti-tariff, so they take an anti-tariff position.",
      "And, look, we have the experience of President Trump's first term, where the tariffs did not affect prices. And it's a holistic approach, that there will be tariffs, there will be cuts in regulation, there will be cheaper energy. So I would expect that very quickly we will be down to the Fed's 2 percent target.",
      "So I'm expecting inflation to continue dropping over the year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So should we expect these tariffs to come March 4?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, there's a series of tariffs. There's March 4, and then there are the big \u2013 the \u2013 there's the big tariff program that's going to be outlined on April 2 by commerce and USTR, and that's the president's notion of reciprocal tariffs.",
      "And that's going to be very path-dependent. It's \u2013 we are going to show, what are other countries' tariffs on specific goods, what are non-tariff barriers, what are the currency manipulation, what is manipulation of financing or labor manipulation, and what are these horrendous fines that the European Union is putting on our tech companies, and we are going to evaluate that and give them an opportunity to remedy that.",
      "So we could either see a ratcheting up in tariffs, or, if our trading partners want to remedy what has been unfair trade, then we could see the tariffs come off. So it's going to be path-dependent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that's Europe in April, mainly?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, that's across the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "So when you say the Peterson Institute is too alarmist with $1,200 a year on the average household, what's the cost of the household? You think it's zero?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, we \u2013 we don't know yet, because it's path- dependent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: But what I can tell you is that I'm not worried about China. China is going to \u2013 China will pay for the China tariffs, because their business model is exporting their way out of this inflation.",
      "They are the most imbalanced, unbalanced economy in modern times. And the idea that, because of a tariff, that they would lower their production is wrong. They are going to continue flooding the market. They will eat this price decrease. They will eat any tariffs that go on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I saw you say on Bloomberg recently that Mexico has offered to match the U.S. tariffs on China, and that you would like for the Canadians to do so as well. You described it as a fortress in North America. Is that in the works?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: I \u2013 I \u2013 I don't know yet. We'll see. The Mexican leadership has offered to do that. We haven't heard from the Canadians, but I think that would be a very good start, because\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: By Tuesday, potentially, to offset the potential punishment on them?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: By Tuesday, or maybe the tariff wall goes up, and then we see what happens from there.",
      "But I can tell you that, under the cover of COVID, China dramatically increased their export capacity, and they are trying to export their way to prosperity. They are in an economic crisis. They have gigantic deflation. And it's unacceptable for them to export that to the rest of the world. And I think North America would be a very good start for pushing back against this unfair trade policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that would be a significant development.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Very significant.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Which would avoid tariffs that are supposed to go out on Tuesday.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: We'll see.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, we'll be watching that space.",
      "I want to ask you about Ukraine. You were in that Oval Office meeting that went sideways on Friday. He \u2013 President Zelenskyy was told to leave the White House before he signed the minerals agreement that I know you have been working on. He said yesterday, though, he is ready to sign it.",
      "He called it \"the first step towards security guarantees. It's not enough. We need more than just that. A cease-fire without security guarantees is dangerous for Ukraine.\"",
      "Is the deal still on the table, or has President Trump instructed you to drop the project?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Margaret, it is impossible to have an economic deal without a peace deal. The sine qua non for an economic deal is that Ukrainian leadership wants a peace deal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I thought this was a building block towards getting to a peace deal.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, it was supposed to be, but President Zelenskyy came into the Oval on Friday. There were \u2013 there were three things that were going to be done. There was going to be a press conference.",
      "There was going to be a private lunch with 16 of us. And as you can see from Dan Scavino's \u2013 the post on his X account, we were all ready set up to sign \u2013 to sign the deal. So it's unclear now. President Zelenskyy has thrown off the sequencing.",
      "And, Margaret, let me tell you the most tragic part of this. The \u2013 President Trump's idea for this economic arrangement was to further intertwine the American people and Ukrainian people and show no daylight\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But\u2026",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: \u2026 to show the Russian leadership that there was no daylight. And President Zelenskyy came into the Oval Office and tried to relitigate in front of the world the deal.",
      "And we were going \u2013 the place to have done it would have been in the private lunch.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, well, it's news to me that this was \u2013 that the sequencing is shifting, that you are saying you have to agree to a peace deal before the minerals agreement? There aren't even negotiations for a peace deal under way.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, first of all, it's not a minerals agreement. It's a general economic agreement. So, calling it a minerals agreement is incorrect.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: And I think we have to see if President Zelenskyy wants to proceed.",
      "What's \u2013 what's the use in having an economic agreement that's going to be rendered moot if he wants the fighting to continue? President Trump wants a peace deal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Vladimir Putin, it's unclear if he wants a peace deal, though. There are no negotiations underway. The secretary of state said that on another network this morning.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: And President Trump \u2013 President Trump has said that. President Trump is trying to move towards peace. He said repeatedly during \u2013 during that episode in the Oval\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: \u2026 we don't know if we'll get a peace deal, but we got to try.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "Last Sunday, President Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff said on another network that the plan for negotiations was the so-called draft Istanbul protocol. The Institute for the Study of War says that this would leave Ukraine helpless in the face of future Russia \u2013 Russian threats or aggression.",
      "If \u2013 if that's described as the future of U.S. diplomacy and the framework, why isn't Mr. Zelenskyy asking the right question when he says, how can I agree to a cease-fire with no security guarantees or even a minerals agreement or investment agreement without security guarantees?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, look, I think the plan is for the European Union to provide this security, not NATO, the European Union.",
      "And, again, the tragedy of Friday \u2013 and I don't know what President Zelenskyy was thinking. We had President of France Emmanuel Macron in on Monday. Great meeting. The \u2013 we had Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday, fantastic meeting. They were all on board the arc of the peace agreement.",
      "All President Zelenskyy had to do was come in and sign this economic agreement and, again, show no daylight, no daylight, between Ukrainian people and the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: And he chose to blow that up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the deal is no longer on the table, just to be abundantly clear?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Not at present.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Treasury Secretary Bessent, thank you for coming in today.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Good. Thank you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Our social media producers tell us that, as of this morning, we have had more than 100 million views on posts related to the meeting across our CBS News social media platforms.",
      "There is no shortage of Trump viral videos, but this one has spread around the world.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "J.D. VANCE (Vice President of the United States): Mr. President \u2013 Mr. President, with respect, I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media.",
      "Right now, you guys are going around and forcing conscripts to the front lines because you have manpower problems. You should be thanking the president for trying to bring an end to this conflict.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY (Ukrainian President): Have you ever been to Ukraine, that you say what problems we have?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: I have been to\u2026",
      "PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY: Then come once.",
      "First of all, during the war, everybody has problems, even you. But you have nice ocean and don't feel now, but you will feel it in the future.",
      "God bless\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY: God bless\u2026",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): You don't \u2013 you don't know that. You don't know that.",
      "PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY: God bless you do not have a war.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Don't tell us what we're going to feel. We're trying to solve a problem. Don't tell us what we're going to feel.",
      "PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY: I'm not telling you, I'm answering\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Because you're in no position to dictate that. Remember that.",
      "You don't have the cards right now. With us, you start having cards, but right now, you don't\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY: We are not playing cards. I am very serious, Mr. President. I'm very serious.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You're playing cards. You're gambling with the lives of millions of people.",
      "PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY: You think\u2026",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You're gambling with World War III.",
      "PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY: What do you think\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You're gambling with World War III. And what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country\u2026",
      "PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY: I'm with all respect to your country.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: \u2026 that's backed you, far more than a lot of people said they should have.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Have you said \"Thank you\" once this entire meeting?",
      "PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY: A lot of times.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: No, in this entire meeting, have you said \"thank you\"?",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in one minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we are back now with Republican Congressman Mike Turner.",
      "Good to have you back.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER (R-Ohio): Thank you. Appreciate you having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, what were you thinking when you saw that Oval Office meltdown?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, I mean, the first thing, obviously, is, we have to realize why this is important and really what was at stake here.",
      "I mean, this is important because Ukraine is important. This is about the fight between authoritarianism and freedom and democracy. This is the Ronald Reagan evil empire against democracy. So, as we're watching this fight, we have to be concerned about what's crumbling here and what needs to be put back together.",
      "I think that's what we all felt in our \u2013 in our stomachs as \u2013 in our anxiety as we watched what was at risk here. The second thing is, is really how inappropriate this was for Zelenskyy. I mean, the context is, this was a signing agreement. Zelenskyy had been negotiating with the United States on a minerals deal, an economic deal, as the Treasury secretary said.",
      "He'd been doing so for weeks. I'd met with him with members of Congress in Munich.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: He had told us some of the terms that he wanted. He had a successful deal. The United States had conceded. He was flying here under the pretext that he was going to sign this deal.",
      "This should have been a win. As he's sitting in the Oval Office, he said, I want the president to stand with Ukraine. In moments, he was going to be standing with the president of the United States with a win that he had negotiated.",
      "And instead of taking that win, he turned it into a debate on American security guarantees on \u2013 during peace negotiations \u2013 on the peace negotiations, instead of taking that win and then from that going forward.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "Well, it all went sideways after a Polish reporter in the room asked President Trump about his perceived alignment with Vladimir Putin. That's what the president reacted to. And then the vice president jumped in praising Trump's diplomacy.",
      "And that's when Zelenskyy said what he said about, well, what kind of cease-fire and diplomacy are you talking about? I have brokered deals with Vladimir Putin in the past.",
      "Do you really think that this was all to blow it up, or was it just people are talking past each other? What do you actually think happened?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, I think, fundamentally, here, again, the \u2013 you don't fly a quarter across the world for a signing ceremony for a deal with the president of the United States and turn it into a debate on American security guarantees on peace negotiations that are unrelated to the mineral deal that you came \u2013 the economic deal that you came to sign.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you can't take things out of the context in the vac \u2013 like, treat them in a vacuum.",
      "Earlier in the week, President Trump had referred to Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a dictator. He had instructed diplomats\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Which he had retracted because the negotiations had\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he then said, did I really do that?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Because the\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And then he told people at the U.N\u2026.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: In Trump's way, he had taken back because the negotiations had gone forward in a way that was positive.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But there \u2013 this isn't happening in a vacuum.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It is within question, in fact, where America's alliances are.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron told a newspaper overnight: \"There need to be \u2013 there needs to be a strategic dialogue with European countries that don't have nuclear weapons because they can no longer depend on the American nuclear deterrent.\"",
      "That's an incredible statement from a NATO ally.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Right. And, again\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is \u2013 this is how this is heard around the world.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Right. And I \u2013 again, all of these things are really hysterics and way overstatements, but they're all coming from the crux here of the \u2013 that Zelenskyy has made \u2013 and I truly believe this is Zelenskyy.",
      "He has made a precondition of going forward with peace negotiations American security guarantees. And what you saw was him enter into a very public debate with the president of the United States in the Oval Office of, I want \u2013 and you heard it, you actually yourself said it to the secretary of the Treasury \u2013 I want an American security guarantee as a precondition for peace negotiations.",
      "No one is going to \u2013 no president is going to give him a \u2013 as a precondition to peace negotiations. You do the peace negotiations. Then you determine what security guarantees, what arrangements\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but he also referred back to failed peace negotiations and failed diplomatic agreements brokered by Europe that had no American guarantee that failed. So it's \u2013 what's different this time? That's the question.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: But you don't continue to work for it.",
      "You got to hear President Trump \u2013 I mean, he engaged by saying, people are dying. We need to stop the dying. We can't have \u2013 we can't go into World War II and \u2013 and imploring him to let's go forward with the peace negotiations, and then we will determine what security arrangements need to be made around the peace negotiations.",
      "The fact that Zelenskyy has it backwards, the cart before the horse. I want a security guarantee to go into peace negotiations\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: \u2026 is really what has caused the impediment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you comfortable with the U.S. diplomatic outreach and the decision to no longer isolate Vladimir Putin?",
      "Because he has not said anything about making any kind of concession. Volodymyr Zelenskyy is being asked to do that publicly.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, actually, no, he has not.",
      "But the Russians showed up. I mean, I'm very comfortable that Marco Rubio, as our secretary of state, in the lead with these negotiations, is very confident in\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is he in the lead with the negotiations?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: I think\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Or is it Steve Witkoff?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: I think he is in the lead with the negotiations. I'm very \u2013 I'm very confident of his strength. He has \u2013 has commenced the negotiations.",
      "I believe that Zelenskyy needs to trust him and he needs to not have this precondition of American security guarantees, which are not coming.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Remember, Ukraine has been before every president since Clinton, Clinton in the issue of the Budapest, when they were giving up their nuclear weapons.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Obama, Bush, everybody has had Ukraine before them. Every American president has declined to give American security guarantees as a precondition to any negotiations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Which is why Zelenskyy is saying, give them to me now, because nothing stopped them before. So\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: The peace negotiations need to occur.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: And then we need to look at the \u2013 what are the construct of what security guarantees needs to be and what is that construct that needs to be put in place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you something because of the position you have on Armed Services.",
      "CBS has confirmed these reports that Defense Secretary Hegseth has ordered U.S. Cyber Command to temporarily halt cyber operations and planning against Russia. \"The Washington Post\" reports that that's as long as the negotiations continue. There are no negotiations under way.",
      "Does this concern you? Have you been briefed on this?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: I can't \u2013 I don't \u2013 no, I'm not \u2013 unaware of that. And I don't believe that that would be \u2013 there are too many, I'm certain, considerations there for that to be an accurate statement, so blanket.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But they have ordered Cyber Command to halt cyber operations.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Senator Mark Kelly in Tucson, Arizona.",
      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY (D-AZ): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were one of the lawmakers who met with President Zelenskyy prior to the Oval Office meltdown. Senator Lindsey Graham later told reporters he had warned Zelenskyy, quote, \"don't take the bait.\" Do you think Zelenskyy took the bait? Is that how you understand what happened?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: I think he was cornered and then he was bullied in the Oval Office. And, Margaret, that just makes us look weak. You know, I think Donald Trump was trying to look tough. J.D. Vance was trying to look tough. The only winner in that exchange is Putin, who's a criminal, who's killing, you know, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians.",
      "So, it was a sad day for our country. It was a dumpster fire of diplomacy. It should not have been done. That kind of negotiation should not be done in public in front of cameras.",
      "When we had our meeting earlier in the day with Zelenskyy, he - he - he has this like habitual gratitude. He was very thankful. And the chairman of the Armed Services Committee kicked the cameras out of the room before we started to talk. That's the way this should be handled, not what - not what Donald Trump did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the treasury secretary, who was just with us, said you can't get an economic deal without a peace deal first. So, it seems the dynamic is changing in terms of what the Trump administration is putting forward here.",
      "What was your understanding of what Volodymyr Zelenskyy's concerns were?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Well, I mean, his concern is that he doesn't have a security guarantee and he's being asked to give up minerals, that this is a business deal.",
      "Margaret, we're about to celebrate our 250th birthday as a country. And I didn't think we were just in it for - for the money. I mean we are a country of values and principles. We stand with our allies. He needs security guarantees.",
      "Yes, I understand this concept of an economic deal and a ceasefire, but the economic deal comes after the ceasefire. None of that makes sense. They need to get in a room, including with the Russians. I mean have the Russians given any indication that they want peace?",
      "Our Treasury secretary questioned whether Zelenskyy wants peace. Of course he does. He has his population being murdered, raped, children are kidnapped. He wants out of this situation. But he - he - he - he's having a hard time -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Obviously, negotiating this in public. By the way, I mean his English is not the best. So, this is hard for him. To corner him in the Oval Office on that kind of stage was wrong. And it makes us look weaker as a nation and it makes us less safe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've been to Ukraine a number of times. Our last guest, Mike Turner, has been in Ukraine a number of times as well. Neither the president nor the vice president have at all. J.D. Vance, the vice president, said to Zelenskyy, those are propaganda tours. Is that what you did? Did you go on propaganda tours?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: No, I mean, I - I went into patriot batteries and, you know, talked to the troops that every night are defending themselves from incoming ballistic missiles, and cruise missiles, trying to keep their population alive. I met with soldiers, you know, some of which are, you know, amputees at this point who just - and soldiers that just came from the frontlines to talk to me in person about what the situation on the ground is. I met with pilots there who were about to get their F-16s. And we talked specifically about, you know, how can you use this airplane in combat?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: I think J.D. Vance, the vice president, with all due respect, it sounds like he's watching videos on the internet. And to say to Zelenskyy, you're not being thankful enough. I mean Zelenskyy thanks the American people all the time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: And I've got to say, Margaret, if - if - if we can end this - and I want this to end as much as anybody -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: But it has to end in a way that the Russians are going to respect. And what was in the Oval Office yesterday was a demonstration of weakness. And I can tell you, Putin does not respect weakness.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the U.S. border. The number of migrants crossing the southern border illegally in President Trump's first full term - first full month in office plunged to a level we haven't seen in 25 years. This is according to data reviewed by CBS. This seems like this is good for your state. Do these numbers prove President Trump's theory is right?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Well, I think the numbers being down, that's a good thing. What we need long-term is a negotiation with the Republicans on longstanding border policy. What the administration is doing, especially with ICE raids in schools, with flying - repatriating people who often aren't only criminals, in military airplanes, for intimidation, talking about housing people on Guantanamo, that's intimidation.",
      "I am - it's good the numbers are down. That's a positive thing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: We need - we need a border security agreement. We need legislation. We also need immigration reform.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Talk about my state for a second. We've got a lot of dreamers. They deserve a pathway to citizenship. We need some - we need a plan for farm workers as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary of Defense Hegseth is sending another 3,000 troops to the border, including an aviation battalion and striker vehicles, CBS has confirmed. Now these soldiers aren't allowed to intercept migrants. Do you understand the mission, the intent? You have oversight over armed services, so I wonder how you feel about this.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Well, I don't feel good about it. The way this should be handled is, if we could work together within the United States Senate, Democrats and Republicans, get the Border Patrol more money, hire more Border Patrol agents, give them more resources to do the job they're supposed to do. When you do it with troops, that affects their readiness. This isn't what they're trained to do. Then they don't get to train to do - that striker battalion doesn't get to train to do the job that they need - may need to do one day.",
      "I don't want to see us in a conflict around the world anywhere. But what prevents that is for our allies to realize that they're not going to win in a fight. And when they see us doing things like this, police actions with the military, that also is showing the rest of the world that our military is less capable and we are weaker. And that affects everybody's safety.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Lastly, because you sit on the Intelligence Committee, I want to ask you about something President Zelenskyy said. He said in Munich, \"Ukraine has intel the Russians are sending troops to Belarus to use it as a launch pad militarily into perhaps not just Ukraine but other European countries.\"",
      "Are you concerned about that?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Well, I am very concerned about what Putin will do next. If he - if he comes out of this and thinks he got a good deal and this was worth his time and effort and loss of life.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: He doesn't care about Russian soldiers. He obviously doesn't care about the Ukrainians. Yes, that would be very concerning for me.",
      "I was in the Baltic nations, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania earlier this year. They are very concerned. That would be a staging ground for them to attack the Baltics.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. That's why we're watching it so carefully.",
      "Senator Kelly, I appreciate your insight.",
      "We're going to turn now to Michigan Congressman John James.",
      "Good morning to you, Congressman.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES (R-MI): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about what's happening in your state with the economy and tariffs, but just staying on the theme for a moment. I know you have a lot of Ukrainian Americans in your district. You voted in support of last year's Ukraine supplemental. Are you comfortable with the Trump administration's decision to stop recognizing that Russia started the war in Ukraine?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: Russia is the aggressor. Putin is a war criminal. And Volodymyr Zelenskyy also fumbled the bag pretty hard. All those things can be true at the exact same time. We absolutely must stand by our allies at the exact same time. We also need to make sure that we are giving transparency and accountability to the American people.",
      "Under the Biden administration, billions of dollars were given away with very little accountability and no mission - no end state. I'm a combat veteran, and my soldiers expected from me that I would be able to articulate objectives, a mission and an end state. And the commander in chief, last time, couldn't do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: President Trump is doing everything that he can to get a lasting peace, and enduring peace in eastern Europe and throughout the world. He's already ended one war in the Middle East. I think we should give him a chance to end one in Europe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I think there's developments on the Mid-East front that - that throw that into question, but we'll keep tracking that.",
      "Let me ask you about tariffs and Michigan because you are really in a unique spot in the middle of the auto state.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: This Tuesday, expect tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China. That's what the president said. On March 12th, 25 percent tariffs on all imported steel and aluminum. Non-exceptions for trading partners. Auto tariffs in April. What is your district bracing for?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: Look, America is open for business but we are not for sale. Michigan remembers what NAFTA did to us. And over the past 30 years, Mexico has built 11 major automotive plants to only one in the United States.",
      "Michigan remembers 900,000 automotive jobs over - back in the '90s to 600,000 now. That's over 300,000 lost manufacturing jobs in the automotive sector. Michigan remembers the great recession where 50 percent of all the jobs lost in all of America were lost in Michigan alone. And Michigan remembers the harmful EV mandates that have forced compliance rather than actually allowing a regulatory environment that permits innovation. We've lost jobs to Mexico and China.",
      "Right now in my district, as you mentioned, the number one manufacturing district in all the nation, overflow production is not going to Sterling Heights, it's going to Saltillo, Mexico.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: When you look at the opportunities that are missing us, when you look at the fact that - that - that Michigan is seeing its opportunities pass by, enough is enough.",
      "Margaret, the status quo is not good enough for Americans, which is why Donald Trump got elected.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: He's putting Americans first. And, frankly, even our allies have not been playing a fair game.",
      "Look, fair - free trade is the objective but fair trade -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, but I'm asking you about the specific - the -",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: Fair -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, the specific -",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: Right. Yes, OK, go ahead.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Tactic here because you - you brought up Sterling Heights. The Republican mayor of Sterling Heights, Michael Taylor, your district, says the president's tariffs are the, quote, \"single biggest threat to our local economy.\" He's expecting it to be devastating and staggering. This is a Republican saying this about the impact on your district. What's he missing?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: The - what's devastating and staggering is the fact of the matter that we have been taken advantage of for decades. The president, under his original tax plan, lowered corporate tax rates from 35 to 21 percent, and he's offering lower tax rates to 15 percent for those who build in the United States of America. We're also looking at energy independence. We're also looking at lowering the regulatory burdens for folks to succeed and excel.",
      "But what Democrats are doing is they're going to actually make it more difficult when they vote against this - these tax reforms for small businesses to excel -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Republicans -",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: And for entrepreneurs to get their feet under them. And so, regardless of what it is, when you take a look at the EV policies that Joe Biden put in place, that actually exacerbated the inflation, just look at work trucks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Well -",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: Work trucks five years ago were - are - were $15,000 less expensive than they are right now. SUVs, $8,000 less expensive than they are right now. That inflation was caused by terrible Democrat policies. And that - and that is - that -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you tell the mayor he's wrong?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: What's that?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The - so you're telling the mayor he's wrong? I mean the Ford - Ford's CEO said at an investor conference last month, a 25 percent tariff would blow a hole in the U.S. industry that we have never seen.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: Well, you know what, memory is kind of short because when you look at the OECD nations, they're already talking about leveling 15 percent tax on anything in businesses that are making $750 million or more. Everybody should look at the impact that that makes on top of the tariffs that are already imposed on goods that are made in the United States of America. No one is talking about this, Margaret. And all these economists - we - we expect that these are going to be on (INAUDIBLE) but they're not. We are not operating at - you know -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's the CEO of Ford, the automaker.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: You can go talk to the CEO of Ford, but what I'm dealing with is people I'm talking with when I visit factory floors each and every single day. I am an automotive supplier in the United States of America and I feel this pain. We've seen it for too long.",
      "And like I've said, we've been taken advantage of for years and we need to level the playing field. When you're not playing fair with America, then we have to do what we can to make sure that we can compete on a fair playing field.",
      "And, Margaret, I think that fairness is what we should be pursuing. And I don't think that's wrong to ask for out of our allies and our partners.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The global supply chain, I know you know it well, is complicated here. And the production goes back and forth across -",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: Yes, I have a masters in it, Margaret. I understand it. And I'm also in the automotive industry.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: Yes, go ahead.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And - well, what I'm trying to say is that the cars go back and forth across the border multiple times. So, what is the construction of the tariffs that you think is actually going to be beneficial here?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: You know what also comes across the border? Fentanyl coming in from Mexico, and China sending in precursors. And as a result of these negotiation tactics, Mexico surged 10,000 of their own National Guard troops to the border. And just as you were mentioning in the - in the last segment, I think it was great that border apprehensions on the southern border have plunged to the lowest levels this century.",
      "You know, this is working. Mexico is paying for the border security. They're extraditing drug lords to be prosecuted in the United States of America. And these are the types of things that we're - that we're looking for. Eighty-four percent of those on the terror watch list, on the FBI terror watch list, are apprehended on the northern border. And we're getting Canadian cooperation, which would have never happened under the previous administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: And only started when President Trump started playing hardball and talking about these things. We have a number of levers, diplomatic, economic and military.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: And diplomatic levers haven't works. We're using economic levels to secure our borders -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Congressman.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: And to make sure that we have fairness across our economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, thank you. Congressman James, we've got to leave it there.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: President Trump's approval rating in our poll is 51 percent, still in positive territory, but by a smaller margin than he had a month ago. And on his approval on the issues, it's a mixed bag. A slim majority of voters approve of his handling of the border and the economy, while a slim majority disapprove of his handling of inflation.",
      "And we're joined now by our elections and surveys director, Anthony Salvanto.",
      "You asked about a host of issues, Anthony, before this explosive Oval Office exchange. You did ask Americans how they're assessing the conflict between Ukraine and Russia. What did you learn?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yes, good morning, Margaret.",
      "You know, you can look at Ukraine and Russia and the conflict, and then see a wider worldview that Americans have. So, let me start with this.",
      "Aid to Ukraine specifically divides the country. It divides it along partisan lines. And it has for a while. Democrats more in favor, Republicans more opposed.",
      "But then you ask people, OK, who do you support in the conflict? Just over half say they support Ukraine and the rest say they're neutral, that the U.S. should stay out.",
      "Now, where this comes back to the administration is, the people who say they're neutral are more approving of how Donald Trump is handling all this. The people who say they back Ukraine, in addition to supporting aid, feel that Trump's actions have favored Russia in this conflict.",
      "Now, let's take a look at views on Russia. And the big majority calls Russia either an enemy or unfriendly. It's a little less so among Republicans. But then widen out to how the U.S. should act on the world stage. Views of our European allies. By and large, Americans call them allies or at the least friendlies, Great Britain, France, Germany, et cetera.",
      "Now, what should the U.S. actually do? The big majority is, cooperate with allies on the world stage. Those folks tend to be less approving of the changes that they see Donald Trump making to U.S. foreign policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, back to the - the key issue, the economy, how are Americans perceiving what the president is doing on that, as well as his cuts to the federal workforce?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, on the point about cuts, let's start with this sort of central premise about, is there waste in the federal government? By and large Americans agree that there is. The difference is, where does it come from? If I ask people, is it poor spending choices? Is it fraud? Well, you get more Democrats saying, it probably comes from poor spending choices. Republicans saying it comes from fraud.",
      "And then that goes into a split on the changes you're making in the federal workforce. That divides the country. And you start to see people looking at and wondering about what the implications of this might be.",
      "So, I ask, is this going to have an effect? There's a lot of people who say, yes, it will have an effect on cutting services that they like, an effect on their local area. But there's also just as many who say it's going to save taxpayer money, it's going to eliminate waste. And when I see that wide span of answers, what my sense is, is, people are anticipating a lot of things. They're unsure at this point. But they are definitely looking and waiting to see what they believe will be an impact.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony Salvanto, thank you very much.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Thank you.",

One is that the fight that Ukraine is having is not only about Ukraine's sovereignty, but it's much, much broader. It's about freedom of the free world really. It is about the world where international law applies. And - and the world where might does not make right. It is clear that Russia attacked Ukraine. There's one aggressor and one victim.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the Trump administration has decided now not to say that explicitly, arguing that the president needs negotiating room. Do you think that that's persuasive to Vladimir Putin?",
      "KAJA KALLAS: Well, it is certainly, you know, a very strong Russian narrative that they want to run to really push - saying that, you know, oh, it's a conflict between two equal parties. It is very clear, one country attacked another country very brutally with force and is - is bombing Ukraine every day. I mean President Trump says that he wants the killing to stop. I don't think that anybody wants the killing to stop more than the Ukrainians.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, why do you think acknowledging who is responsible does matter?",
      "KAJA KALLAS: We have the United Nations charter where we have agreed how countries are, you know, interacting with each other. And it says very clearly that you can't attack sovereign territorial integrity of another country. And if you do, there are consequences. And why is it important? It is important for small countries in the world, for whom this is the only thing that protects them. If we don't really defend this principle, then we're going to see all these developments that we don't want to see because all the countries who are afraid of their neighbors will want to go for nuclear weapons because this is the only thing that protects them.

    "published": "Sun, 02 Mar 2025 10:22:53 -0500",
    "summary": "The investor who was close friends with the Washington Post publisher talks about the woman who became a pivotal figure in Washington politics, whose story is told in a new documentary, \"Becoming Katharine Graham.\"",
    "story": [
      "Warren Buffett rarely gives interviews. But also rare is his friendship with the late, trailblazing publisher of the Washington Post, Katharine Graham. \"If there's any story that should be told, it should be her story,\" he said. \"If I was a young girl, I'd want to hear that story. It would change my self-image.",
      "\"She was one of a kind, and she was terrified of the job,\" Buffett said. \"She knew she could do things, but she'd been told all her life that she wasn't [allowed], and that females didn't do things. I mean, her mother told her, 'Nobody's interested in listening to you.' And so, all of a sudden, here she is, and she had an all-male board that was waiting for her, and all they wanted was her to stay home and cash the dividend checks.\"",
      "Graham was thrust into the role, taking over the company, after her husband, Philip Graham, died by suicide. She was then the center of some of the century's biggest stories. She made the decision to publish the Pentagon Papers that helped lead to the end of Vietnam War. It was Graham who supported the investigative journalism that led to President Nixon's resignation after Watergate.",
      "All this in spite of the fact that, Buffett said, Graham had had drummed into her head the idea, \"Only men can succeed at business.\"",
      "Graham herself once said, \"The worst handicap women work under is the self-inflicted one \u2013 that is, if you've grown up thinking of yourself as a second-class citizen, that you tend always to put yourself down.\"",
      "Graham's journey from housewife to the first female CEO of a Fortune 500 company is laid out in a new documentary, \"Becoming Katharine Graham,\" now streaming on Amazon Prime.",
      "And at the center of the story is an unlikely friendship that began on June 4, 1973, when Buffett sent Graham a letter after buying a significant amount of the Washington Post Company's stock. \"I said, 'I'll never buy another share unless you personally okay it,' and I signed a document. Then we became friends.\"",
      "In the documentary, Graham recalled of Buffett: \"He used to come to board meetings with about 20 annual reports, and he would take me through these annual reports. I mean, it was like going to business school with Warren Buffet.\"",
      "Asked why he invested in the Post to begin with, Buffett replied, \"It was ridiculously cheap. It was a super bargain. It was worth at least $500 million and was selling for $100 million.\"",
      "Katharine Graham's son, Don Graham, a former publisher of the Post, said that Buffett was the greatest thing in business that ever happened to Katharine Graham.",
      "Buffett said, \"She needed somebody to reassure her.\"",
      "I asked, \"What were the things you would say to her to boost her confidence?\"",
      "\"The biggest thing I said is, when you look in the mirror, it's a funhouse mirror because you're seeing it for the eyes of what the males are telling you about it,\" Buffett replied. \"So, my job is to turn that funhouse mirror into a regular mirror. And she knew I was on her side, and I admired her enormously. And she was torturing herself. She couldn't help doing that.\"",
      "The documentary, for the first time, shows the public the full extent of President Nixon's feud with Graham. A White House recording features one of the president's conversations with FBI director J. Edgar Hoover:",
      "Hoover: \"I saw her on TV last night, Mrs. Graham. I would've thought she's about 85 years old. She's only about, I think, something like 57.\"Nixon: \"Oh, no, I know that.\"Hoover: \"She's aged terribly.\"Nixon: \"She's a terrible old bag.\"Hoover: \"Oh, she's an old bitch, in my estimation.\"Nixon: \"That's right!\"",
      "But according to Buffett, \"Nixon didn't scare her at all.\" What did scare her was the idea of losing the paper. Never did that feel more real to Graham than in 1975, when the Post's printers damaged the presses and went on a bitter strike for more than four months, limiting the paper's circulation.",
      "\"How challenging was that time?\" I asked.",
      "\"Well, it tore her apart,\" said Buffett. \"She was suffering in that way at that time more than she ever suffered during Watergate, or during the Pentagon Papers, or anything. But she thought she might be blowing everything.\"",
      "Buffett told us Katharine Graham prevailed because she was brave \u2026 and it's because of her that the Washington Post Company stock price went up more than 3,000 percent while she was publisher.",
      "But she didn't just make Buffett a lot of money; she said she introduced to him \"the possibility that a steady diet of fast food and Cherry Cokes might not be the best for him.\"",
      "\"Yeah, but she didn't convert me!\" laughed Buffett, who said his favorite foods were what he was eating when he was six years old: \"Hot dogs and hamburgers and Coke and ice cream sundaes, and root beer floats are my favorite. I frequently have a dinner with a root beer float.\"",
      "Once, attending a dinner at Graham's, prepared by a French chef, Buffett was served a lobster: \"Well, I unfortunately attacked it from the wrong side,\" he said. \"Of course, she was very reluctant to criticize me. Finally at some point she said, 'You know, it might be helpful \u2026'\u00a0 What did I know about lobsters?\"",
      "Graham died in 2001, and Buffett served as an usher at her funeral.",
      "As for the \"Oracle of Omaha,\" the legendary investor is now 94 years old, still chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, and still making front page news. Every word he utters has the power to roil the financial markets.",
      "When asked about the state of the economy today, Buffett demurred: \"Well, I think that's the most interesting subject in the world, but I won't talk, I can't talk about it, though. I really can't.\"",
      "Asked about how tariffs will affect the economy, Buffett stated, \"Tariffs are actually, we've had a lot of experience with them. They're an act of war, to some degree.\"",
      "I asked, \"How do you think tariffs will impact inflation?\"",
      "\"Over time, they are a tax on goods. I mean, the Tooth Fairy doesn't pay 'em!\" he laughed. \"And then what? You always have to ask that question in economics. You always say, 'And then what?'\"",
      "Despite deflecting questions about the current news from Washington, or of Trump adviser Elon Musk's efforts to cut the government, Buffett did admit that he is bullish on American companies. \"A majority of any money I manage will always be in the United States,\" he said.",
      "And why is that? \"It's the best place!\" he laughed. \"I was lucky to be born here.\"",

    "summary": "The meeting has been overshadowed by the extraordinary scolding of Ukrainian President Volodymyr by President Trump at the White House.",
    "story": [
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told leaders gathered Sunday for a summit on the\u00a0war in Ukraine\u00a0that they need to step up and continue to support Kyiv and meet a \"once in a generation moment\" for the security of Europe.",
      "Starmer pledged to supply more arms to defend Ukraine, announcing that the U.K. will use 1.6 billion pounds ($2 billion) in export financing to supply 5,000 air defense missiles.",
      "His call for European allies to increase their arms spending to shore up their own defenses and Ukraine's was not a sign that he thought the United States had become an unreliable ally, he said. No two countries are as closely aligned as the U.K. and the U.S., Starmer said.",
      "\"One thing our history tells us is that if there is conflict in Europe, it will wash up on our shores,\" he said.",
      "Starmer, flanked by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and French President Emmanuel Macron, said the three of them have agreed to work on a plan to stop the fighting, and then take it to the United States, which has discussed brokering a peace deal.",
      "The meeting, which has taken on greater importance in defending the war-torn ally, has been overshadowed by the extraordinary scolding of Zelenskyy by President Trump, who blasted him Friday at the White House as being ungrateful for U.S. support against the invasion by Russia.",
      "Starmer told CBS News partner BBC\u00a0that he does not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin but does trust Mr. Trump.",
      "\"Do I believe Donald Trump when he says he wants lasting peace? The answer to that is yes,\" he said.",
      "Starmer said there are \"intense discussions\" to get a security guarantee from the U.S.",
      "\"If there is to be a deal, if there is to be a stopping of the fighting, then that agreement has to be defended, because the worst of all outcomes is that there is a temporary pause and then Putin comes again,\" Starmer said. \"That has happened in the past, I think it is a real risk, and that is why we must ensure that if there's a deal, it is a lasting deal, not a temporary pause.\"",
      "The three essentials Starmer listed for a successful peace deal were: arming the Ukrainians to put them in a position of strength; including a European element to guarantee security; and providing a \"U.S. backstop,\" to prevent Putin from breaking promises.",
      "\"That's the package. All three parts need to be in place, and that's what I'm working hard to bring together,\" Starmer said.",
      "Starmer hosted the meeting at Lancaster House, a 200-year-old mansion near Buckingham Palace, following a charm offensive last week to persuade Mr. Trump to put Ukraine at the center of negotiations and tilt his allegiances toward Europe.",
      "Leaders from Germany, Denmark, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Canada, Finland, Sweden, the Czech Republic and Romania were at the summit. The Turkish foreign minister, NATO secretary-general and the presidents of the European Commission and European Council were also in attendance.",
      "Meetings in recent days had provided some hope \u2014 until Zelenskyy visited the White House.",
      "Visits to the Oval Office by Macron, who had declared his visit a \"turning point,\" and Starmer were seen as steps in the right direction. The meetings were cordial and Mr. Trump even took a gentler tone toward Ukraine, though he would not commit to providing U.S. security guarantees and maintained Europe would need to provide peacekeeping troops.",
      "European Union top diplomat Kaja Kallas told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" in an interview taped Friday that the visits to the White House were coordinated with a message that the fight is \"much broader\" than just Ukraine's sovereignty.",
      "\"It's about freedom of the free world, really. It is about the world where international law applies and the world where might does not make right,\" she said. \"It is clear that Russia attacked Ukraine. There is one aggressor and one victim. And we need to really make sure that Russia doesn't attack again. And for that, we need to concentrate our efforts. I mean putting politically and economically pressure on Russia to stop this war, but at the same time also help Ukraine to defend itself.\"",

      "In his note, the pope also prayed again for peace in Ukraine and elsewhere.",

      "Doctors on Saturday reported that Francis was in stable condition, with no mention of him being critical, and managed to take \"long periods\" of time off the noninvasive mechanical ventilation he needed to recover after Friday's respiratory crisis.",
      "\"The night was quiet, the pope is still resting,\" the Vatican said in its Sunday update. Francis was up, read the Sunday papers and had coffee and breakfast while continuing with his therapy.",
      "The 88-year-old pope had a \"good response\" in his gas exchange levels even while off the ventilator mask Saturday and only using high-flow supplemental oxygen, the Vatican said.",
      "He had no fever or signs of elevated white blood cells, which would signal his body was fighting a new infection.",
      "Cardinal Pietro Parolin and his chief of staff, Archbishop Edgar Pena Parra, also called on the pope Sunday morning, their second visit since Francis' Feb. 14 hospitalization, according to the Vatican spokesman, Matteo Bruni. There were no details of what was discussed, but the mere visit suggested Francis' condition was stabilizing.",
      "Francis' hospitalization has come as the Vatican is marking\u00a0its Holy Year, drawing pilgrims to Rome\u00a0from all over. Many have added a pilgrimage destination to their itineraries so they can pray for Francis at the Gemelli hospital, which is around a 20-minute drive from the Vatican, longer in rush hour or on public transport.",

      "When Navyn Salem received a letter Wednesday terminating the federal government's contract with her Rhode Island company, Edesia, she halted its production line, which makes a life-saving paste for severely malnourished babies.",
      "A day later she received an email, just a few short sentences, rescinding the contract's termination.",
      "The reversal failed to put her mind at ease.",
      "\"This is what our everyday looks like. The government is in a state of chaos,\" Salem said. \"And the way that we see that is 24 hours ago, we had a contract terminated, and 10 minutes ago [the termination] was rescinded.\"",
      "In the weeks since Elon Musk, an adviser to President Trump and the richest person in the world, began targeting the State Department agency USAID for closure, disruptions to the supply chain and services for a variety of global life-saving causes have faltered.",
      "While Salem's contract has remained active, except for most of Wednesday, she said the hollowing out of USAID \u2014 with nearly all of its staff suddenly placed on leave or outright fired \u2014 has caused growing disarray. Most pressing, she said, is that the USAID-operated payment system she relies on \"has been down for weeks.\"",
      "That's created unparalleled uncertainty that is spreading from her business of 150 employees to her American suppliers \u2014 farmers across 25 states \u2014 and the U.S. ocean liners she uses to ship hundreds of metric tons of Edesia's Plumpy'Nut therapeutic paste, and finally, to the international organizations that distribute it to children staving off death.",
      "\"Everybody who is caught up in this time of chaos with massive uncertainty is worried. Everybody is,\" Salem said.",

      "Plumpy'Nut is classified as a ready-to-use therapeutic food, prescribed for the treatment of severe acute malnutrition in children as young as six months old. It's a peanut-based paste that includes vitamins, minerals and milk powder, in accordance with World Health Organization guidelines. Edesia says it produces 800 metric tons of Plumpy'Nut and other foods used to treat malnutrition every week.",
      "Salem believes ultimately that her company's goal of protecting children aligns with Trump administration priorities. \"We have a strong belief that our mission will be protected, that these funds will be there, but I can't promise that to anyone.\"",
      "Salem said she agrees that USAID could be operated more efficiently, and she has ideas from years of work with the agency. She faces the same dilemma, whether she wants to propose solutions or simply try to process payments.",
      "\"Who should I call?\" She asked. \"I have been offering suggestions for years, and now is the time for someone to listen, if I can just find someone who will pick up the phone.\"",
      "A State Department spokesperson said Thursday that it had ended more than 90% of its USAID contracts, retaining only those that it believes make America stronger, safer and more prosperous. The agency's cuts are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to drastically shrink the federal workforce and budget.",
      "Each packet of Plumpy'Nut produced by Edesia is printed with the phrase \"from the American people\" printed on it. Salem said the message to the desperate parents and caretakers of malnourished children is an important part of her company's mission.",
      "\"They will never, ever forget that it was the American people who were there for them in their biggest time of crisis,\" Salem said.",
      "She and others who run organizations associated with USAID told CBS News another global superpower is poised to step in if the United States retreats from corners of the world where it provides support for crucial medical care: China.",
      "\"This is an incredibly strong use of soft power to deliver a food, a specialized food to people in their biggest time of need,\" Salem said.",

      "Hamas started the war with its Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack that left about 1,200 dead in Israel, mostly civilians, and took some 250 hostage. Since then, Israel's military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, who do not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths but say more than half the dead have been women and children.",
      "According to Israel, 32 of the 59 hostages still in Gaza are dead.",
      "The two sides agreed to the three-phase ceasefire deal in January. Talks on the second phase were meant to start the first week of February. Israelis rallied Saturday night to urge their government to continue the deal.",
      "Hamas has reaffirmed its \"full commitment to implementing all terms of the agreement in all its stages and details\" and called on the international community to pressure Israel to immediately proceed to the second phase.",
      "Other challenges complicate the ceasefire's future. Israel has said Hamas cannot be involved in governing Gaza after the war. Netanyahu has also ruled out any role in Gaza for the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, dominated by Hamas' main rival, Fatah.",
      "Hamas leader Mohamed Darwish on Saturday reiterated the group is willing to hand over power to a Palestinian national consensus government or an Egypt-proposed body of technocrats not aligned with Hamas or Fatah. His comments came in an open letter to next week's summit of Arab leaders in Cairo. Hamas has dismissed Israel's suggestion that its leadership go into exile.",
      "Witkoff, speaking on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" last weekend, said that securing the release of the last U.S. national believed to be among the surviving hostages,\u00a0Edan Alexander\u00a0was \"front and center for us.\" Alexander was serving with the Israel Defense Forces when he was abducted during the Oct. 7 terrorist attack,",
      "\"I know his parents,\" Witkoff told CBS News. \"We talk all the time. He's critical. It's one of President Trump's most important objectives is to get all Americans home, and we're going to be successful in getting Edan home, I believe.\"",

It will take place on Sunday.",
      "The shouting match that unfolded Friday in the final minutes of the highly anticipated meeting at the White House between Trump and Zelenskyy seemed to dash, at least for now, Ukrainian hopes that the United States could be locked in as a reliable partner in helping fend off, and conclude, Russia's three-year onslaught.",
      "President Trump threatened Zelenskyy during the meeting to make a deal with Russia or \"we're out,\" and Vance accused the Ukrainian leader of being \"disrespectful.\" \u00a0Zelenskyy kept an even tone throughout the entire exchange, even as Mr. Trump and Vance at times raised their voices.",
      "National security adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio asked Zelenskyy and Ukrainian officials to leave the White House. The blowout also derailed plans to sign an economic agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine. In a Fox News interview, Waltz rejected suggestions from Trump critics that the president and\u00a0Vice President JD Vance \"ambushed\"\u00a0Zelenskyy, and said the Ukrainian leader \"has not gotten the memo that this is a new sheriff in town.\"",

      "\"If we don't increase our effort fast enough and let the aggressor dictate its conditions, we won't end up well,\" he said.",
      "Slovak populist Prime Minister Robert Fico repeated his country won't provide Ukraine any military or financial support that would help it fight Russia. Fico also demanded that an emergency EU summit in Brussels on Thursday agree to a call for an immediate ceasefire, \"which is something that President Zelenskyy and a majority of EU member states refuse to do.\" Fico said his country also wants the summit to specifically request Ukraine to reopen the transit of Russian gas to Europe.",
      "He warned that if the summit doesn't respect the Slovak requests, \"the European Council might not be able to agree on its position regarding Ukraine on Thursday.\"",
      "Poland's President Andrzej Duda has called on Zelenskyy to return to the negotiating table in order to ensure the security of his country, arguing that only the United States is able to stop Russian aggression. Duda is a strong supporter of Ukraine and has friendly ties with Trump.",

      "He said that he sees no other force than the United States that could stop Russian aggression. Russia said on Saturday that it shot down three Ukrainian drones that targeted part of the infrastructure of the TurkStream gas pipeline, which transports Russian gas across the Black Sea to Turkey and Europe.",
      "The French minister of the armed forces says France's nuclear deterrent will remain the prerogative of the country's president as European leaders mull ways to bolster their security amid uncertainty over U.S. support. Sebastien Lecornu posted a clarification on the social network X on Saturday after French president Emmanuel Macron said he was ready to open discussions\u00a0on a possible European nuclear deterrent.",
      "\"Our nuclear deterrent is French, and it will remain so: from the design and production of our weapons, to their deployment on the decision of the President of the Republic,\" Lecornu said. \"It protects France's vital interests, which the head of state alone is responsible for defining.\"",

    "summary": "The Blue Ghost lunar lander privately developed by Firefly Aerospace is carrying a suite of sophisticated instruments to the moon for NASA.",
    "story": [
      "Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost lander closed in on the moon Saturday, on course for a nail-biting automated descent to touchdown early Sunday, the first of three private-sector robotic moon landers to reach its target after launches earlier this year.",
      "The Blue Ghost lunar lander spent a month orbiting Earth after launch atop a Falcon 9 rocket in January, giving Firefly flight controllers in Austin, Texas, plenty of time to activate and test its systems and science payloads before heading to the moon.",
      "Once there, the spacecraft spent 16 days in lunar orbit refining its trajectory and beaming back spectacular views of Earth from 240,000 miles away.",
      "Now, after multiple thruster firings to reach the planned descent orbit, the 6.6-foot-tall spacecraft is poised for a rocket-powered drop to the surface. Touchdown at Mare Crisium \u2014 the Sea of Crisis \u2014 is expected around 3:34 a.m. EST, near an ancient volcanic feature called Mons Latreille.",
      "The solar-powered lander is expected to operate for a full lunar \"day,\" or 14 Earth days. If all goes well, it may continue operating on battery power for a few hours into the dark lunar night before finally going silent.",
      "Firefly CEO Jason Kim said the Blue Ghost is the latest example of commercial technology provided by the private sector \"really bringing down the cost and affordability of (space) systems.\"",
      "\"Once in a blue-moon long time ago, these type of lunar landers took billions of dollars and countries behind (them) to land on the moon,\" he said in a pre-launch interview with CBS News.",
      "\"This is Firefly Aerospace that's gonna land on the moon at fractions of the cost on a fixed-price contract, and doing it with the latest commercial technology,\" he said. \"Just like Simone Biles stuck the landing in the Olympics, we're gonna do the same thing for the state of Texas, for America and for the world.\"",
      "NASA paid Firefly Aerospace $101 million to carry 10 agency-sponsored  science instruments, built at a cost of $44 million, to the moon as  part of the agency's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS)  initiative.",
      "The CLPS program is aimed at encouraging private  industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science  and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the  surface near the lunar south pole later this decade.",
      "\"One of these days, we're going to get there in terms of the commercial aspects of the moon,\" Kim said. \"There's going to be a lot of business plans that are going to be self-sustaining and growing. It's a great location to frequently go and test out new missions to sustain life in space, and it's a stepping stone for Mars as well.\"",
      "Sharing a ride to space with Blue Ghost aboard the same Falcon 9 rocket was another moon lander, a spacecraft called \"Resilience\" that was built by Tokyo-based ispace. The company sent another lander to the moon last year, but it crashed to the surface after running out of fuel due to a software glitch.",
      "For ispace's second attempt, the appropriately-named Resilience took a long, low-energy route to the moon and is expected to make its landing attempt in May.",
      "Yet another lunar lander, this one built by Houston-based Intuitive Machines and known as Athena, was launched last Wednesday by another Falcon 9 and is expected to touch down on the moon March 6.",
      "Athena also was funded in large part by NASA's CLPS program, which agreed to pay the company $62.5 million to carry a sophisticated drill and mass spectrometer to the moon.",
      "NASA awarded a $15 million technology \"tipping point\" contract to Nokia to test cellular communications on the moon and another $41 million to Intuitive Machines for a rocket-powered \"hopper\" that will jump into a permanently shadowed crater in search of ice deposits.",
      "Firefly's lander is carrying 10 instruments, including cameras, a drill to bore into the surface below the spacecraft, a radiation-tolerant computer, equipment that will attempt to pull in GPS navigation signals from Earth, an experiment to learn more about managing lunar dust and one to monitor the dispersal of dust kicked up by the lander's rocket engines.",
      "\"One of the core purposes of the CLPS program with NASA is to be a precursor to Artemis, which is obviously sending humans back to the moon,\" said Ray Allensworth, Firefly's spacecraft program director.",
      "\"So our payloads are collecting data so we can figure out what does it feel like to be on the lunar surface, to operate on the lunar surface? So all that data will inform when we actually return humans to the moon.\"",

    "story": [
      "Kurdish militants who have waged a 40-year insurgency in Turkey declared a ceasefire on Saturday in what could mark a significant boost to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government, two days after their imprisoned leader called for the group to disarm.",
      "The announcement by the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, comes against the backdrop of fundamental changes in the region, including the reconfiguration of power in neighboring Syria after the toppling of President Bashar Assad, the weakening of the Hezbollah militant movement in Lebanon and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.",
      "The conflict between Turkey and the PKK has led to tens of thousands of deaths since it began in 1984. The ceasefire is the first sign of a breakthrough since peace talks between the PKK and Ankara broke down in the summer of 2015.",
      "The PKK declaration was published by the Firat News Agency, a media outlet close to the group, on Saturday. It referred to the insurgents' leader, Abdullah Ocalan, who has been imprisoned by Turkey since 1999.",
      "\"We declare a ceasefire effective today to pave the way for the implementation of Leader Apo's call for peace and democratic society. None of our forces will take armed action unless attacked,\" it said, referring to Ocalan by his nickname.",
      "On Thursday, a delegation of Kurdish politicians announced Ocalan's call for the PKK to lay down its arms and disband after visiting him on his island prison.",
      "The White House praised the call for peace, CBS News reported earlier this week.",
      "In its statement, the PKK's executive committee said Ocalan's call indicated that a \"new historical process has begun in Kurdistan and the Middle East.\" Kurdistan refers to the parts of Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Iran inhabited by Kurds.",
      "While stating that it would \"comply with and implement the requirements of the call from our own side,\" the PKK emphasized that \"democratic politics and legal grounds must also be suitable for success.\"",
      "Ocalan's call came as the main pro-Kurdish political party in Turkey has faced pressure, with several of its mayors being removed from office in recent months and replaced by government appointees.",
      "The PKK also appealed for Ocalan to be released from Imrali prison, located in the Marmara Sea, to \"personally direct and execute\" a party congress that would lead to the militants laying down their arms.",
      "The peace initiative between the Turkish state and the PKK, which is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey and its Western allies, was started in October by Erdogan's coalition partner, Devlet Bahceli, a far-right politician who suggested that Ocalan could be granted parole if his group renounces violence and disbands.",
      "Berkay Mandiraci, senior Turkey analyst with the\u00a0International Crisis Group\u00a0think tank, told CBS News a peace deal between the Turkish government and the PKK could \"remove this long-standing thorn in bilateral ties,\" and it could bring with it \"a host of dividends for Turkey.\"",
      "Erdogan said Ocalan's message was a \"new phase\" in peace efforts in Turkey.",
      "\"There is an opportunity to take a historic step toward tearing down the wall of terror that has stood between (Turkish and Kurdish peoples') 1,000-year-old brotherhood,\" Erdogan said on Friday.",
      "The government's first response to the ceasefire came from Vice President Cevdet Yilmaz. \"A new phase has been entered towards the goal of a terror-free Turkey. \u2026 We hope that this opportunity will be seized, this effort will be concluded quickly and successfully,\" he posted on X.",
      "Some believe the main aim of the reconciliation effort is for Erdogan's government to garner Kurdish support for a new constitution that would allow him to remain in power beyond 2028, when his term ends.",
      "Bahceli has openly called for a new constitution, saying it was essential for Turkey's future that Erdogan remain in power. Erdogan and Bahceli are reportedly seeking parliamentary support from the pro-Kurdish People's Equality and Democracy Party, or DEM.",
      "\"There will be a series of meetings next week, including state officials and politicians, and many things will become clearer and more concrete. We hope that everything will be arranged in the next three months,\" said Sirri Sureyya Onder, one of the DEM members who visited Ocalan in prison on Thursday.",
      "The leader of the U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces has said Ocalan's call for a ceasefire does not apply to his group in Syria.",
      "Ocalan, 75, wields significant influence in the Kurdish movement despite his 25-year imprisonment, during which the PKK has been led by top figures who have fled and found sanctuary in the Kurdish region in northern Iraq.",
      "But a decade of fighting seems to have \"weakened\" the PKK, Mandiraci said. \"The Turkish military drove the group out of Turkey's southeast and pressed it deep into the steep and unforgiving mountains of northern Iraq,\" he said.",
      "In recent years, the PKK has been limited to isolated attacks inside Turkey as the Turkish military, backed by armed drones, has pushed PKK insurgents increasingly across the mountainous border into Iraq.",
      "The leader of the U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces has said Ocalan's call for a ceasefire does not apply to his group in Syria.",

      "The day started on a positive note, with Mr. Trump joking with Zelenskyy, a guest book signing and warm conversation in the Oval Office.",
      "But the episode has raised questions about whether Zelenskyy can move forward toward a peace deal, and whether the U.S. will or should pause aid to Ukraine.",
      "Though several of the president's allies have called on Zelenskyy to step down or \"change,\" Mr. Trump is not seeking regime change in Ukraine, according to the officials, who said there have been no discussions about who in Ukraine might be a better leader than its current president.",

      "The minerals deal was set to be signed with much pomp and circumstance, and it was the first step in what Mr. Trump foresaw as a progression towards peace. According to the officials, Mr. Trump fully intended to sign the minerals deal. Two official binders were prepared and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and his Ukrainian counterpart, Zelenskyy and Mr. Trump were going to sit at a conference table in the East Room to trumpet the success.",

Waltz told Zelenskyy he had made a tremendous mistake and had done a disservice to Ukraine and to Americans.",
      "U.S. officials thought negotiations would be much harder with Russian President Vladimir Putin and have been in disbelief that it has been Zelenskyy who has been difficult, the sources said. Trump officials were concerned the Russians would come with all-or-nothing demands during a recent meeting in Riyadh, but they didn't. The negotiators had reasonable requests for Rubio and Waltz, but instead it has been Ukraine that has had maximalist demands, according to the Trump officials.",
      "The White House is now uncertain if they can get Russia and Ukraine to end the war that has dragged on for more than three years, the officials told CBS News.",
      "Asked how Zelenskyy can repair this, the Trump officials said the Ukrainian leader needs to explicitly say he wants a ceasefire, because it's now unclear to the administration that he would ever sign anything with Putin.",

      "The U.S. has made it clear to Ukraine that Mr. Trump wanted an economic partnership before talking about security guarantees as part of a ceasefire, if it happened, the officials disclosed. There have been no discussions among Trump officials about putting U.S. boots on the ground in Ukraine.",

      "POPE FRANCIS\u2019 MEDICAL CONDITION: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT BILATERAL PNEUMONIA",
      "The pope has a long history of medical problems, including respiratory infections. Back in 1957, he had a piece of one lung removed.",
      "(Despite this, Pope Francis is not a smoker, and in fact ordered a ban on the sale of cigarettes in the Vatican\u2019s duty-free shop beginning in 2018.)",

      "The Catholic leader was last hospitalized for pneumonia in 2023. He previously underwent abdominal surgery, when part of his colon was removed.",
      "Most recently, the pope was hospitalized for a respiratory infection on Feb. 14, 2025, at Gemelli Hospital, one of the best hospitals in Italy.",
      "What is the pope's medical condition?",
      "The pope's condition has been described as bilateral pneumonia, which generally appears as consolidation on a chest x-ray or CT scan.",
      "Pneumonia is an infection in the air sacs of the lung. Bilateral pneumonia is more problematic and difficult to recover from than unilateral pneumonia or pneumonia in one lobe, especially in an elderly patient with scarring from previous surgeries and bouts of pneumonia.",
      "The pope is presumably being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and is reportedly non-septic.",
      "LUNG CANCER RISING AMONG NON-SMOKERS \u2014 HERE'S WHY",

      "Given that the pope has likely been given antibiotics for several days and appears to be stable, the chances of him developing sepsis are greatly reduced.",
      "What is sepsis?",
      "Sepsis is a life-threatening condition of hemodynamic compromise (where the body is not getting enough blood flow to function properly), which causes a drop in blood pressure.",

      "\"Although the pope's prognosis is currently unknown, it doesn\u2019t sound like he is truly in critical condition.\"",

      "Blood cultures can turn positive with a pathogen, which in this case would presumably be a bacteria.",
      "Why is the pope on oxygen?",
      "The pope is receiving what is known as high-flow oxygen by nasal cannula (a device that provides extra oxygen through a tube and into the nose), which can vary in oxygen percentage.",
      "This is a treatment for respiratory decompensation (breathing difficulties), but is not as aggressive as CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) or mechanical ventilation.",

      "Reports of complications",
      "Over the weekend, on Saturday, the pope reportedly experienced an asthmatic episode, which was presumably treated with oxygen and with bronchodilators to open his airways (which constrict during an airway attack).",

      "While Pope Francis is certainly far from out of the woods, per Vatican reports, it is important to clarify that mild renal insufficiency simply means blood flow to the kidney is mildly reduced, perhaps from low volume or dehydration, and it might well be improving from the blood transfusions he is receiving.",
      "As long as his urine output keeps up and his kidney function doesn\u2019t worsen, this should not be a major obstacle.",

      "\"The Europeans have a serious problem of readiness \u2026 that they\u2019re trying to fix, but it takes time,\" Camille Grand, a former NATO official who is now with the European Council on Foreign Relations, said in a Washington Post report Sunday. \"If Trump decides \u2018I\u2019m going to pull out U.S. troops from Germany because I\u2019m upset with the trade imbalance,\u2019 that\u2019s much more complicated to manage than to say we have a plan to do this within X years.\"",
      "The comments come as European leaders have become increasingly anxious about the future of the security of the continent in the second era of Trump, with the Washington Post reporting that leaders are wary that the American president is too friendly with Moscow and that they widely expect him to pull back roughly 20,000 U.S. troops that were deployed to the continent by former President Joe Biden in the aftermath of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "\"I would not be surprised if at some point [those troops] go back to their home base in America,\" a NATO diplomat told the outlet while noting that those troops were sent to Europe at the height of an emergency and that their exit \"would be, so to speak, a return to normalcy.\"",

      "But fears persist that those numbers could fall even more rapidly than expected under Trump, despite assurances from Trump administration officials that there are no imminent plans for a large reduction of forces on the continent.",
      "Those fears have been buoyed by recent events, including Vice President JD Vance\u2019s remarks at a security conference in Munich in which the American leader scolded European leaders for their alleged break from shared values such as freedom of speech and Trump\u2019s widening rift with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "However, American presidents from both parties have been warning European leaders for more than a decade of the potential shift of troops away from the continent as the U.S. seeks to focus more effort on confronting the emerging threat of China in the Indo-Pacific, leaving Europe in charge of a greater share of its own security.",

At the height of hostilities between the U.S. and the Soviet Union in the 1950s and 1960s, the U.S. had nearly 500,000 troops deployed to the continent. There were still roughly 350,000 U.S. troops in Europe at the start of the 1990s and the end of the Cold War, a number that fell further to more than 100,000 at the turn of the century.",

      "What you need to know",
      "The Zacks Investment breach first came to light in late January 2025 when a hacker known as \"Jurak\" claimed on BreachForums that they had gained access to Zacks' systems as early as June 2024.",
      "According to the hacker, they obtained domain administrator privileges for Zacks' active directory, a critical network security component, allowing them to steal source code for Zacks.com and 16 other websites, including internal tools, along with user account data. The stolen information was then put up for sale on hacker forums, with samples offered for a small cryptocurrency payment to prove authenticity, as reported by\u00a0BleepingComputer.",
      "Further investigation confirmed the breach occurred in June 2024, exposing 12 million unique email addresses and other personal data. The fact that the attacker managed to gain domain admin access suggests a highly sophisticated attack, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in Zacks' network security.",
      "This is not the first time Zacks has suffered a breach. Previous incidents include a 2022 attack that compromised an older Zacks Elite product database from 1999 to 2005, as noted on Zacks' own breach disclosure page.",

      "What data got compromised",
      "The Zacks Investment data breach, confirmed by Have I Been Pwned (HIBP), exposed a range of sensitive user information, putting those affected at risk. The leaked data includes email addresses, IP addresses, names, phone numbers, physical addresses, usernames, and unsalted SHA-256 hashed passwords.",
      "This kind of information can be misused for phishing, identity theft, credential stuffing, harassment, SIM swapping and even physical threats. Alarmingly, 93% of the leaked email addresses had already been exposed in previous breaches, making reused passwords an even bigger problem. The use of unsalted SHA-256 hashes \u2014 widely considered outdated \u2014 only adds to the risk, making it easier for attackers to crack passwords and compromise accounts.",

      "1. Beware of phishing attempts and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0After a data breach, scammers often use the stolen data to craft convincing phishing messages. These can come via email, text or phone calls, pretending to be from trusted companies. Be extra cautious about unsolicited messages with links asking for personal or financial details, even if they reference recent orders or transactions. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "2. Invest in identity theft protection:\u00a0Given the exposure of personal data, such as names, addresses and order details, investing in identity theft protection services can provide an extra layer of security. These services monitor your financial accounts and credit report for any signs of fraudulent activity, alerting you to potential identity theft early on. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "3. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on accounts:\u00a0Enabling\u00a0two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts. Even if hackers get hold of your login credentials, they won\u2019t be able to access your accounts without the second verification step, such as a code sent to your phone or email. This simple step can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive personal information.",
      "4. Update your passwords: Change passwords for any accounts that may have been affected by the breach, and use unique, strong passwords for each account. Consider using a\u00a0password manager. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Remove your personal data from public databases: If your personal data was exposed in this breach, it\u2019s crucial to act quickly to reduce your risk of identity theft and scams. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap \u2014 and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "The Zacks Investment breach highlights just how real the threat of cyberattacks is for financial institutions. With millions of users affected and personal data exposed, the risks of scams and identity theft are higher than ever. The fact that Zacks hasn\u2019t said much about the breach only adds to the uncertainty for those impacted. As these types of attacks become more common, it\u2019s more important than ever to stay on top of your online security \u2014 use unique passwords, keep an eye on your accounts, and stay alert for any signs of suspicious activity.",

When we perform everyday tasks, our fingers move in coordinated patterns called \"postural synergies.\" These synergies are fundamental to how we grasp and manipulate objects. The team, led by Antonio Bicchi and Dario Farina, developed a method that integrates these postural synergies with the analysis of electrical signals from the nervous system. By decoding the activity of spinal motoneurons (the nerve cells that control muscle movement), they can predict the hand movements a user intends to make. This information is then used to control the prosthetic hand.",

One of the most exciting features of this new prosthetic hand is its ability to perform in-hand manipulation.

The results were encouraging, showing that the hand allowed users to perform complex movements and manipulate objects with greater precision and naturalness compared to other prosthetic hands. The tests showed that combined neural and postural synergies allowed accurate and natural control of coordinated multidigit actions, achieving over 90% of the continuous mechanical manifold, and the target hit rate for specific hand postures was higher with neural synergies compared with muscle synergies.",

    "summary": "Just two months into 2025 there have been numerous Mac malware threats targeting Apple laptops, ranging from infostealers to malicious software.",
    "story": [
      "Jose-Marie Griffiths discusses the increasingly important subject with Fox News Digital.",
      "It's early, but 2025 is not shaping up to be a great year for Mac cybersecurity.",
      "In less than two months, we've seen numerous Mac malware threats targeting Apple laptops, which are generally considered very secure. These threats range from infostealers to malicious software capable of reading screenshots and stealing passwords.",
      "Now, Microsoft has identified a resurfaced malware that has returned after years, equipped with new malicious capabilities, including stealing sensitive information such as digital wallets and data from the legitimate Notes app.",
      "STAY SAFE & IN THE KNOW \u2013 AT NO COST! SUBSCRIBE TO KURT\u2019S THE CYBERGUY REPORT FOR FREE SECURITY ALERTS & TECH TIPS",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know about the malware",
      "Microsoft Threat Intelligence has discovered a new version of XCSSET, a dangerous macOS malware that spreads by infecting Xcode projects, which are files used by developers to create Mac apps. While this malware is currently being seen in only a few attacks, it has been upgraded with new tricks to make it harder to detect and remove.",
      "One of the biggest changes is how the malware hides itself. It now scrambles its code in a more unpredictable way, making it difficult for security software to recognize. It also renames parts of its code to disguise its true purpose, allowing it to stay hidden for longer.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Once it infects a Mac, the malware ensures it keeps running even after the computer is restarted. It does this in two ways. First, it inserts itself into system files that launch when the computer starts. Second, it replaces the shortcut to Launchpad, which is the tool used to open apps, with a fake version that runs both the real Launchpad and the malware at the same time.",
      "This malware also finds new ways to sneak into Xcode projects, making it more difficult to spot. If an infected project is shared or downloaded, the malware can spread to other devices without the user realizing it.",
      "A person working on their Mac (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "SPOTIFY PLAYLISTS ARE BEING HIJACKED TO PROMOTE PIRATED SOFTWARE AND SCAM",
      "What data can it steal?",
      "The XCSSET malware is designed to steal a variety of sensitive information from infected Macs, putting both personal and financial data at risk. One of its primary targets is digital wallets, which are used to store cryptocurrency. If a user has a crypto wallet on their Mac, the malware can attempt to access and steal funds.",
      "It can also collect data from the Notes app, where many users store personal information, passwords and other sensitive details. If important data is saved in Notes, it could be accessed and sent to hackers.",
      "Beyond this, the malware can exfiltrate system information and files, meaning it can gather details about the Mac itself, installed applications and even specific files stored on the device. This could include work documents, saved login credentials or any other valuable information. Because XCSSET is a modular malware, meaning it can be updated with new capabilities, it may gain even more data-stealing abilities over time.",

      "5 tips to protect yourself from Mac malware",
      "Follow these essential tips to safeguard your Mac from the latest malware threats, including the notorious XCSSET.",
      "1. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Protect your Mac from XCSSET and other threats by installing strong antivirus software on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Be cautious with downloads and links: Only download software from reputable sources such as the Mac App Store or official websites of trusted developers. Be wary of unsolicited emails or messages prompting you to download or install updates, especially if they contain links.\u00a0Phishing attempts often disguise themselves as legitimate update notifications or urgent messages.",
      "3. Keep your software updated: Ensure that both macOS and all installed applications are up to date. Apple frequently releases security patches and updates that address vulnerabilities. Enable automatic updates for macOS to stay protected without having to manually check for updates. If you need more help, see my\u00a0guide on keeping all your devices updated.",
      "4. Use strong and unique passwords:\u00a0To protect your Mac from malware, it\u2019s also crucial to use strong, unique passwords for all your accounts and devices. Avoid reusing passwords across different sites or services. A\u00a0password manager can be incredibly helpful here; it generates and stores complex passwords for you, making them difficult for hackers to crack.",
      "It also keeps track of all your passwords in one place and automatically fills them in when you log into accounts, so you don\u2019t have to remember them yourself. By reducing the number of passwords you need to recall, you\u2019re less likely to reuse them, which lowers the risk of security breaches. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Use two-factor authentication (2FA): Enable\u00a02FA for your important accounts, including your Apple ID, Google account, email and any financial services. This adds an extra step to the login process, making it harder for attackers to gain access even if they have your password.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Mac users can\u2019t afford to be complacent anymore. Gone are the days when Macs were considered \"safe by default.\" Cybercriminals have leveled up, moving beyond basic adware to full-blown information stealers. They\u2019re swiping passwords, hijacking authentication cookies, intercepting OTPs and even emptying crypto wallets. The threats are getting smarter and more aggressive, and no platform is off-limits. Staying ahead means taking security seriously, because the bad guys definitely are.",

      "The report also found that 3.9 billion credentials were shared in credential lists that appear to be sourced from infostealer logs. KELA\u2019s analysis suggests that almost 65% of infected devices were personal computers storing corporate credentials, making them a prime target for infostealer malware.",

      "2025 is not going to be any different",
      "Infostealer malware is not going anywhere in 2025. With malware-as-a-service platforms on the rise and infostealers becoming more advanced, cybercriminals will likely keep using them as a go-to method for stealing credentials and gaining access to systems.",
      "Law enforcement has been cracking down, though. In 2024, authorities managed to take down key parts of the infostealer ecosystem, including disrupting Redline, one of the most widely used infostealers. This showed that international agencies can go after not just the malware developers but also the networks and underground markets that keep these operations running.",
      "But takedowns like these rarely put an end to the problem. When one major infostealer operation is shut down, others quickly step in to take its place. The constant demand for stolen credentials and the ability of cybercriminals to adapt means infostealer attacks will likely remain a major threat in 2025.",

      "Ways to stay safe from infostealer malware",
      "With infostealer malware becoming a growing threat, protecting your data requires a mix of smart security habits and reliable tools. Here are some effective ways to keep your information safe.",
      "1. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your credentials are stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code from an authentication app or biometric confirmation. Cybercriminals rely on stolen usernames and passwords to break into accounts, but with 2FA enabled, they cannot gain access without the additional security step. Make sure to enable 2FA on important accounts like email, banking and work-related logins.",
      "2. Use strong antivirus software and be cautious with downloads and links: Infostealer malware often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Use a password manager: Many infostealers target saved passwords in web browsers. Instead of relying on your browser to store credentials, use a dedicated password manager. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "4. Keep software updated:\u00a0Cybercriminals exploit outdated software to deliver malware.\u00a0Keeping your operating system, browsers and security software up to date ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched. Enable automatic updates whenever possible and install reputable antivirus or endpoint protection software that can detect and block infostealer threats before they compromise your system.",
      "HOW TO FIGHT BACK AGAINST DEBIT CARD HACKERS WHO ARE AFTER YOUR MONEY",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Given the surge in infostealer malware warnings, it is clear that cybercriminals are actively targeting passwords. Both organizations and individuals are urged to strengthen their security measures by enabling 2FA, monitoring credential exposure and using endpoint protection tools. While no security measure is completely foolproof, combining these practices can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to infostealer malware.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot reports on the funeral for the murdered Israeli hostages and the nation\u2019s response.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) released most of its investigation of what happened on Oct. 7, 2023, and in the days leading up to Hamas\u2019 massacre. While the initial investigation began in November 2023, outgoing IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi ordered all units to start probes in March 2024. The IDF refrained from offering recommendations in its report, saying that those would be left to incoming IDF Chief of Staff Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir, who will enter the role next week.",

      "OCTOBER 7 HASN'T ENDED. ONE YEAR LATER, 101 HOSTAGES ARE STILL BEING HELD IN GAZA",
      "1. Oct. 7 in numbers",
      "According to the IDF\u2019s assessment, 5,000-5,600 militants infiltrated Israel in three waves. Meanwhile, 4,696 rockets and mortars were fired towards Israel. The attacks left 829 Israeli civilians, 76 foreign nationals and 415 security personnel dead. Additionally, 251 hostages were taken into the Gaza Strip.",
      "\"The fundamental failure was a result of failure to understand Hamas's intentions and readiness for a wide-scale surprise attack,\" IDF senior officials say in the report.",
      "2. Hamas attack timeline",
      "Hamas\u2019 attacks were not done hastily, according to the IDF, the planning began nearly seven years before the massacre, with the formation of the \"fundamental concept\" in November 2016 and an \"initial plan\" in July 2017. Hamas\u2019 plan was approved in July 2019 and the operational plan was set in August 2021. In early 2022, a readiness committee was established and over the course of the year the terror group evaluated options for implementing its plan.",
      "The IDF says Hamas considered numerous dates for the attacks, including Sept. 16, which was Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year, and Sept. 25, Yom Kippur, the Jewish day of atonement. Ultimately, Oct. 7, 2023, which coincided with the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah, which marks the end and re-start of the Torah.",

      "LOOKING BACK ON THE TIMELINE OF ISRAEL'S WAR AGAINST HAMAS AFTER OCT. 7",
      "3. Full timeline of Oct. 7",
      "The attack, according to the IDF\u2019s assessment began taking shape in the early hours of Oct. 7. Hamas allegedly began preparing its forces around 11:00 p.m. on Oct. 6, after spending much of the day putting them on alert and gathering weapons, and concluded briefings by 4:00 a.m. on Oct. 7.",
      "The infiltration itself began with the first wave at 6:29 a.m. when 1,154 members of Hamas\u2019 Nukhba forces invaded, breaking the security barrier between Gaza and Israel. The IDF declared a state of emergency at 6:43 a.m., and at 7:10 a.m. the Israeli Air Force (IAF) followed suit.",
      "Between 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m., 3,400 militants were inside Israeli territory. Additionally, just before 8:00 a.m., Hamas military commander Mohammed Deif called on civilians in Gaza to join the attacks. The assessment states that after 9:00 a.m. attackers took advantage of IDF failures and seized opportunities to further the assault. Some allegedly planned to go deeper into Israeli territory.",
      "Several of the \"main attacks\" were stopped by the IDF around 1:00 p.m., but there were still hundreds of attackers in Israel at 3:00 p.m. The IDF says it gained control of some of the communities and surrounding areas by 9:00 p.m., but dozens were present around midnight.",
      "\"We did not predict Hamas would be able to be so brutal in its fighting,\" IDF senior officials wrote.",
      "4. IDF\u2019s incorrect assessment of threats",
      "Much of the IDF\u2019s focus was on Iran and Hezbollah prior to the Oct. 7 attacks, and Hamas was defined as a secondary threat at the time. Additionally, the IDF assumed that it could contain Hamas activity as it worked toward \"gradually improving the existing reality\" with the goal of removing the terror group.",
      "The IDF also believed that \"Hamas didn\u2019t want a full-scale war,\" leading Israel to conclude that a large-scale invasion was unlikely. In the assessment, the IDF says Hamas took advantage of Israel\u2019s perception of the situation and used it to its advantage.",
      "Another major misconception highlighted in the assessment is the IDF\u2019s thinking that the main threat from Hamas were the rockets and mortars being shot from Gaza. This combined with reliance on defense tactics and a barrier, as well as the reduction of troops on the Israel-Gaza border would lead to catastrophe.",
      "5. Intelligence failures",
      "Israel\u2019s Intelligence Directorate did not fully grasp or analyze intel it had on Hamas and its intentions. This apparently also applies to the IDF\u2019s perception of the Shi\u2019ite \"Axis\" and its views on Israel. The IDF says that during the review it found deep-rooted systemic issues with the intelligence directorate and culture.",
      "Since 2018, the Intelligence Directorate had been gathering information on Hamas\u2019 concept for a large-scale attack on Israel. However, the plan was deemed unfeasible and was thought to reflect Hamas\u2019 long-term goals.",
      "In August 2021, intel on Hamas\u2019 military wing described the plan for a large-scale attack on Israeli communities and military outposts surrounding the Gaza Strip. Intelligence officials failed to make the connection between this new intel and what it had gathered in 2018.",
      "The intelligence received in the months leading up to Oct. 7 indicated that Hamas was carrying out training exercises for raids. This apparently changed Israel\u2019s elite Unit 8200\u2019s assessment of the situation, but this was allegedly not communicated with senior leadership.",
      "Israeli soldiers inspect the burnt cars of festival-goers at the site of an attack on the Nova Festival by Hamas gunmen from Gaza, near Israel's border with the Gaza Strip, in southern Israel, Oct. 13, 2023.\u00a0 (REUTERS/Amir Cohen)",
      "ISRAELI ARMY FINDS BODIES OF 3 HOSTAGES IN GAZA KILLED AT OCT. 7 MUSIC FESTIVAL",
      "6. \"Early signs\" missed",
      "In the evening hours of Oct. 6, 2023, Israeli sim cards were activated inside Gaza. However, this was not alerted as it had happened before. Those same sim cards would later allow Hamas militants to communicate after they crossed the border into Israel. There were also indications that night that Hamas leaders were meeting. However, according to the IDF\u2019s assessment, neither of these facts were enough to change the Intelligence Directorate\u2019s way of thinking on Gaza, therefore there was no alert.There were also indications of both usual and unusual Hamas activity that evening. The inquiry revealed that there were intelligence sources that could have been utilized overnight to enhance information that were not used. However, the IDF asserts that had the Intelligence Directive changed its assessment of the situation, there would have been a higher alert for a localized Hamas offensive, but not for an all-out war.",
      "7. Assessment of the IAF",
      "The IAF was found to have met and even exceeded the defined standards for readiness except for two instances due to heavy rocket fire. However, these standards did not align with what would have been required to prepare for a large-scale surprise attack. The IDF concluded that there was \"significant difficulty\" distinguishing IDF troops, civilians and terrorists from one another.",
      "While the IAF struck key Hamas command centers, the IDF admits that even in its review of the strikes it is challenging to determine if there could have been a more effective strike effort given the circumstances.",
      "However, it was noted that the IDF did not prepare for anything like the brutal Oct. 7 massacre.\"We were addicted to the precise intelligence and information we got as commanders and did not consider other scenarios. This failure will forever be etched in our memories, and we will never and should never forget,\" IDF senior officials wrote.",

      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "In its conclusion, the IDF notes that the assessment of the situation in Gaza and regarding Hamas was so entrenched in the establishment that there was no deep discussion about alternate possibilities. Additionally, it now says that it was \"incorrect\" to try to \"conflict manage\" Hamas and, in the future, the removal of threats should be prioritized.",
      "The assessment also addresses the possibility of a future attack, saying that a preventative strategy will be key.",

      "Starmer announced a loan of 2.2 billion British pounds ($2.8 billion) to support Ukraine, funded through the freezing of Russian assets passed on Saturday. He also highlighted a new deal that would allow Ukraine to use 1.6 billion pounds ($2 billion) in export finance to buy missiles made in Northern Ireland.",
      "Starmer vowed to bolster Ukraine to allow the nation to negotiate a peace agreement from a position of power.",
      "\u201cWe have to learn from the mistakes of the past,\u201d Starmer said at a press conference. \u201cWe cannot accept a weak deal like Minsk, which Russia can break with ease. Instead any deal must be backed with strength. Every nation must contribute to that in the best way that it can.\u201d",

There are a number of different routes people could go down. One is to ramp up the rhetoric as to how outraged we all are or not.\u201d",
      "Starmer added that he believed Trump was motivated by a \u201clasting peace\u201d and the U.K. would work with France and Ukraine to present a ceasefire plan to the U.S.",

      "Yet for Chipotle customers, it appears, for now, that it will be smoother sailing at the check-out register.",
      "In an exclusive interview with the Sunday edition of \"NBC Nightly News,\" Chipotle CEO Scott Boatwright told anchor Hallie Jackson that, for now, the burrito purveyor intends to keep costs constant for consumers even as some of its cost of goods move higher.",
      "\u201cIt is our intent as we sit here today to absorb those costs,\u201d he said, though he cautioned pricing changes could eventually come if elevated costs become a \u201csignificant headwind.\u201d",
      "For the most part, Chipotle is insulated from many of the costs implied by the types of tariffs Trump has proposed, which, if followed through with next week, would set 25% duties on Canada and Mexico and an additional 10% on ones from China on top of a 10% levy imposed last month.",
      "Boatwright has previously indicated Chipotle now gets about 50% of its avocados from Mexico, with the rest coming from Colombia, Peru and the Dominican Republic. All told, Boatwright has estimated cost of goods would increase 0.6%, or 60 basis points, on a rolling basis from the planned tariffs.",
      "\u201cWe are fortunate to have such an extraordinary economic model at Chipotle that we can withstand those types of inflationary pressures and not have to pass those costs off to the consumer,\u201d Boatwright told Jackson.",
      "\u201cAnd that\u2019s our intent this year. Let\u2019s hold pricing constant, because we don\u2019t know if the tariffs are transitory, if they\u2019re going to be permanent, how sticky they\u2019ll be in the new administration.",
      "He continued: \u201cWe don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to the consumer to pass those costs off to the consumer, because pricing becomes permanent. And so again, back to the idea of delivering extraordinary value to the consumer. We\u2019re going to stay the course.\u201d",
      "Chipotle finds itself in something of a transition period: In August, Starbucks poached longtime Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol to head the coffee giant. Since then, Chipotle shares have slumped, and in February it cautioned that the rest of 2025 would prove a volatile year. with slower sales growth than analysts had hoped for.",
      "Yet Boatwright told Jackson he remained bullish on the company\u2019s fortunes, noting it planned to build out more than 300 new locations.",
      "\u201cIf we can hold price constant, regardless of what\u2019s happening in inflationary pressures, what\u2019s happening with global economic uncertainty, and give the consumer abundance, [and] variety with wholesome, fresh ingredients that they can\u2019t get anywhere else, that\u2019s how we\u2019ll deliver value for the consumer in 2025,\u201d he said.",
      "Boatwright also discussed the firm\u2019s new AI tool, Ava Cado, that is designed to help screen job applicants.",
      "\u201cAva now takes all that work out of the hands of the manager,\u201d he said. \u201cThe candidates respond directly to Ava and she qualifies them, gets the resume loaded or the application loaded, and schedules those interviews for the manager who simply shows up at a scheduled time slot, interviews the candidate and puts them into the workflow.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "SpaceX plans to launch its Starship megarocket on its next test flight on Monday, roughly six weeks after the vehicle\u2019s upper stage blew up over the Atlantic Ocean during the last such test.",
      "In that mishap on Jan. 16, SpaceX lost communication with Starship about eight minutes into the flight, and the vehicle\u2019s subsequent explosion sent debris streaking through the sky. Dust and small pieces rained over parts of Turks and Caicos, but local authorities said there were no injuries.",
      "The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration launched an investigation after the accident and grounded the rocket during the probe. On Friday, the agency cleared Starship to return to flight but said its investigation remains open.",
      "SpaceX\u2019s own investigation found that the likely root cause was leaking propellant in a section of Starship known as the \u201cattic,\u201d which is located between the bottom of the liquid oxygen tank and the rear heat shield.",
      "The leak likely sparked \u201csustained fires\u201d that eventually caused \u201call but one of Starship\u2019s engines to execute controlled shut down sequences,\u201d SpaceX said in an update on Monday.",
      "The company said it stopped receiving data just over eight minutes into the test flight, and that the vehicle broke apart three minutes after that.",
      "SpaceX said it has since made \u201cseveral hardware and operational changes\u201d to Starship\u2019s upper stage, but the company did not specify what those upgrades were.",
      "The upcoming test flight, Starship\u2019s eighth, was originally scheduled for Friday; no explanation was provided for the short delay.",
      "The FAA, which signed off on the flight, is one of many federal agencies that the Trump administration has targeted for budget and personnel cuts. Reuters reported that the Department of Government Efficiency, led by SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, has infiltrated FAA facilities and that SpaceX engineers have been working at the agency as special government employees.",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether DOGE employees have had a presence within the FAA\u2019s commercial spaceflight division, which oversees private companies like SpaceX, but some lawmakers and critics, including Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., have nonetheless raised concerns about Musk\u2019s conflicts of interest.",
      "If Starship launches as intended on Monday, it will attempt to release four mock Starlink satellites during the flight. If successful, that would mark the first time the vehicle has deployed a payload.",
      "The plan also calls for the megarocket\u2019s hulking first stage to return to the launchpad after separating from the second stage, and for SpaceX to \u201ccatch\u201d it there using giant mechanical arms on the rocket\u2019s launch tower. SpaceX completed that part as intended during the January flight, leading the company to deem the test a partial success.",
      "The catch maneuver is a key part of SpaceX\u2019s goal to make Starship a fully reusable rocket system.",
      "If all goes according to plan, the vehicle\u2019s upper stage will fly for about an hour on Monday before splashing down in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Western Australia.",
      "Starship is the most powerful rocket ever developed, measuring 400 feet tall. The system has two parts: a first-stage booster known as Super Heavy and an upper-stage spacecraft.",
      "It is expected to play a crucial part in NASA\u2019s efforts to return to the moon. The agency selected SpaceX to carry astronauts to the lunar surface during NASA\u2019s planned Artemis III mission, which is scheduled to launch in 2027. Musk has also said Starship could be used for future missions to Mars."

    "summary": "While protests against Trump and Musk's cuts to the federal government are happening around the country, much of the organizing has been happening online.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has long warned about an entrenched \u201cdeep state\u201d of malevolent bureaucrats working to thwart his agenda. Many actual employees of the federal government have scoffed at this characterization, proud of the apolitical nature of the civil service and its ability to work across Republican and Democratic administrations.",
      "This time might have been no different \u2014 if Trump and Elon Musk hadn\u2019t come in and declared war on them.",
      "While there were conflicts between Trump and civil servants in his first term, Trump may now be creating the broad resistance within the federal government he thought was there all along.",
      "We\u2019re looking to hear from federal government workers who have been laid off. If you\u2019re willing to talk with us, please email us at\u00a0tips@nbcuni.com\u00a0or\u00a0contact us\u00a0through one of these methods.",
      "Protests opposing the cuts and supporting laid-off workers have started popping up, but the real hotbed of organizing has been happening online, in Signal chats, on Facebook and in the popular \u201cFedNews\u201d channel on Reddit, where federal workers are sharing advice, talking about their experiences and encouraging opposition.",
      "\u201cKEEP SHOUTING THE TRUTH, KEEP RINGING THE BELL: It\u2019s working!\u201d read a post last week. \u201cI just got a mass email from my agency branch \u2018reminding\u2019 us not to talk to the media, listing several regulations that state we\u2019re not to talk to the media. They wouldn\u2019t have sent that if the media wasn\u2019t getting FLOODED with federal workers reporting the truth, reporting what is REALLY going on. It\u2019s affecting them.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve heard so many people ask: WHY is Donald T. so hell-bent on destroying Federal workers?\u201d read another recent post. \u201cBecause we are in his way. \u2026 Hold the line.\u201d",
      "The totality of the effort is quite broad. Workers are filing lawsuits, joining protests and sharing internal documents with media outlets. They\u2019ve launched anonymous websites and social media accounts to promote their narratives. They\u2019ve built resource guides and recorded private meetings. And they\u2019ve resigned, sometimes in large numbers, to protest Musk and the U.S. DOGE Service.",
      "Amy Paris, who worked at the Health Resources and Services Administration, said she would \u201chave very willingly collaborated with the Trump administration\u201d if it had come in and looked for ways to increase efficiency. Instead, she and thousands of other federal workers were laid off last month.",
      "\u201cThey sowed chaos,\u201d she said. \u201cThey made everyone scared for their jobs. \u2026 What they\u2019ve done is they\u2019ve radicalized me. What they\u2019ve done is they\u2019ve taken someone who would have willingly served under their administration to help all of the American people, and what they\u2019ve done is they\u2019ve made me think that they want to destroy the republic. They want to destroy democracy. So now I am activated.\u201d",
      "Before she was fired, Paris was working on modernizing the federal web platform for organ transplants. She is considering appealing her termination.",
      "One civil servant at an agency within the Department of Commerce said they previously thought the idea of a \u201cdeep state\u201d was \u201cludicrous.\u201d Now, however, they believe Trump and Musk have created the conditions for such a \u201cresistance\u201d to thrive.",
      "\u201cThat is definitely something that appears to be happening,\u201d this person said. \u201cI do not believe the deep state existed before, but they could be getting something like that as a response. \u2026 Not trying to take over the world, just trying to oppose this.\u201d",
      "Limited options",
      "The Trump administration first targeted federal employees tied to diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. The Office of Personnel Management, which has been working closely with Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency effort, then offered most of the 2 million-plus federal workforce a \u201cdeferred resignation\u201d to leave their positions. Weeks of confusion and court battles followed, though the program was allowed to move forward.",
      "Next, the administration proceeded to go after people like Paris, who are either new to the federal government and don\u2019t yet have full civil service protections, transferred to new departments or took a promotion. Many of these employees were told they were being let go for performance reasons, even though they had exemplary reviews.",
      "The next step will be a \u201creduction in force,\u201d which will mean large-scale layoffs across agencies, according to a new OPM memo. All along the way, Musk and other members of the Trump administration have belittled, insulted and mischaracterized federal workers.",
      "The episode that stood out most to federal workers was a line in an FAQ that OPM shared to answer questions about the deferred resignation program that they felt diminished their efforts.",
      "\u201cThe way to greater American prosperity is encouraging people to move from lower productivity jobs in the public sector to higher productivity jobs in the private sector,\u201d the comment read.",
      "Musk himself has sent a number of missives to civil servants, including when he posted that he is \u201c1000% more trustworthy than untold numbers of deep state bureaucrats and fraudsters\u201d or wrote on X that \u201ca significant number of people who are supposed to be working for the government are doing so little work that they are not checking their email at all!\u201d",
      "That last comment followed Musk\u2019s latest effort: telling federal workers that their jobs are at risk if they don\u2019t respond to an email asking them to provide five bullet points on what they did the previous week. That email was sent by OPM on Feb. 22, a Saturday. But it was only on his social media platform X that Musk said a failure to respond would be taken as a resignation. A second such email started going out Friday evening.",
      "The options for resistance are increasingly limited. Soon after taking office, Trump fired 18 inspectors general, who act as internal agency watchdogs. He also tried to remove Hampton Dellinger, who leads an agency tasked with whistleblower protection, as well as the chair of the Merit Systems Protection Board, an independent body that weighs federal workers\u2019 employment appeals. (Federal judges have so far blocked those moves.) Both Dellinger and the merit board chair were appointed by President Joe Biden.",
      "\u201cAnyone who thinks protests, lawsuits, and lawfare will deter President Trump must have been sleeping under a rock for the past several years,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \u201cPresident Trump will not be deterred from delivering on the promises he made to make our federal government more efficient and more accountable to the hardworking American taxpayers across the country who overwhelmingly re-elected him.\u201d",
      "With few options for pushback, federal workers have centered their opposition on influencing public opinion and shaping narratives. They\u2019re seeking to counter not just Trump and Musk\u2019s effort, but decades of public perception that civil servants are unproductive and prone to wasting the taxpayer dime. They\u2019ve held protests outside agencies DOGE has targeted, including the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Department of the Treasury. And the National Treasury Employees Union is slated to hold a protest near the Capitol on Wednesday.",
      "They may also be getting more involved politically \u2014 with some expressing interest in running for office. Outside of a recent Democratic Party event in Virginia, a man named Matthew described himself as a political independent who never previously attended a Democratic gathering. That was until he was recently fired from his federal job.",
      "Asked if the layoffs may factor into his vote in the state\u2019s 2025 governor\u2019s race, he said: \u201c100%.\u201d",
      "\u2018We are all desperately trying to figure out how to navigate this\u2019",
      "But a number of federal workers who spoke with NBC News said they recoil at the idea of being hostile to the administration writ large.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not comfortable with the word combat, because it shouldn\u2019t ever be adversarial, right?\u201d one assistant U.S. attorney said. \u201cWe are all desperately trying to figure out how to navigate this. Whether or not I agree with the administration\u2019s priorities or their worldview of anything is absolutely, positively not relevant. And I worked for this administration the first time. \u2026 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever agreed with 100% of any administration\u2019s priorities.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat I haven\u2019t dealt with so far, and where I think we\u2019re all extremely troubled, is that some of what is happening now appears to any reasonable observer to be blatantly unconstitutional,\u201d this person added. \u201cAnd so the question that we have in our minds is, how do we try to advance the administration\u2019s objectives without running afoul of the law, quite frankly.\u201d",
      "A staffer at the Small Business Administration said \u201ceverybody\u2019s too afraid\u201d to take actions that could risk their employment.",
      "But those who have already been fired have had fewer reservations. Already, Democratic lawmakers including Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., have highlighted stories from ousted federal workers on the services they provided the public and what the firings have meant to them personally.",
      "Max Stier, president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, said the most effective pushback to the cuts involves sharing stories \u201cabout how the public is getting hurt.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey need to share not just what\u2019s happening to them personally, which is important, but what\u2019s happening to the public as a result of the chaotic management that is current now,\u201d he said.",
      "Stier said the firings of the head of the Office of Special Counsel and inspectors general have served as a warning to any employees who consider speaking out \u2014\u00a0even internally.",
      "\u201cBy their oath of office, [civil servants] have a responsibility to speak up,\u201d Stier said. \u201cBut I think you have an incredibly difficult situation for them because they\u2019re being taught that to do so puts them in an additional harm\u2019s way.\u201d",
      "Republicans have largely expressed resounding support for DOGE\u2019s mission to cut federal spending and staffing, pointing to surveys that show support for streamlining government and adding that the mission was not only core to Trump\u2019s presidential bid but is an undertaking that any Republican officeholder in this era would be pursuing.",
      "But some grumblings over the effort have arisen, whether over Musk appearing to usurp powers that should be reserved for Trump\u2019s Cabinet heads, a lack of compassion in the broader restructuring, or having Musk, the world\u2019s richest man, be the face of the effort.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it sparks a resistance,\u201d one Trump ally said. \u201cI think those days are long over. I just think there\u2019s risk and potential blowback on the political side if something gets messed up. I also think there\u2019s risk in department heads appointed by the president clashing with Musk. You are already kind of seeing it in some instances.\u201d",
      "At Wednesday\u2019s Cabinet meeting, Trump asked Cabinet heads directly if anyone was \u201cunhappy\u201d with Musk\u2019s leadership. None spoke up against him.",
      "\u201cI still think what they\u2019re doing is broadly popular, just that Elon is very off-putting and unpopular,\u201d a senior Senate GOP aide said, adding that the job cuts so far are small when compared to the depth of the federal workforce as a whole. \u201cElon does this all very chaotically, but this is actually something I think you could have seen any generic Republican admin doing.\u201d",
      "Republicans have faced heat at town halls over the effort while others have shared concerns from federal workers in their own states. Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga., told NBC News his \u201cbiggest concern is that we\u2019re being compassionate.\u201d Sen. John Curtis, R-Utah, told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d: \u201cIf I could say one thing to Elon Musk it\u2019s, \u2018Please put a dose of compassion in this. These are real people. These are real lives.\u2019\u201d And Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, on Monday called for \u201cjust a little bit of humanity and dignity to the process.\u201d",
      "Musk himself has bristled at some of the pushback, lamenting what he sees as a certain level of ridiculousness over federal employees stressing about responding to an email calling for them to list out their accomplishments.",
      "\u201cThe email request was utterly trivial, as the standard for passing the test was to type some words and press send! Yet so many failed \u2026 urged on in some cases by their managers,\u201d he posted to X. \u201cHave you ever witnessed such INCOMPETENCE and CONTEMPT for how YOUR TAXES are being spent? Makes old Twitter look good. Didn\u2019t think that was possible.\u201d",
      "But as civil servants and their advocates noted, there are codified processes by which federal employees have to go through performance reviews, are disciplined or terminated, and that the DOGE effort has so far skirted these systems.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of civil servants who are trying in the best ways that they know how to resist what they believe are illegal actions,\u201d Paris said, adding: \u201cThese are not people who are well-skilled in the idea of a resistance movement.\u201d"

    "summary": "A budget resolution adopted Tuesday by House Republicans could jeopardize the health insurance coverage of millions of low-income and disabled people who rely on Medicaid if lawmakers follow through with their proposed spending cuts, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "A budget resolution adopted Tuesday by House Republicans could jeopardize the health insurance coverage of millions of low-income and disabled people who rely on Medicaid if lawmakers follow through with their proposed spending cuts, experts warn.",
      "The budget plan instructs the Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicaid, to identify at least $880 billion in mandatory spending cuts over the next 10 years. The savings are expected to be used to extend President Donald Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts, which are set to expire at the end of this year.",
      "While the resolution doesn\u2019t specifically mention Medicaid, experts say it would be unfeasible for Republicans to hit that target without significant cuts to the health program, since it\u2019s one of the largest sources of federal spending, costing more than $600 billion per year, according to government data.",
      "\u201cThe way the math would work is that those cuts would largely need to come out of Medicaid,\u201d said Robin Rudowitz, director of the program on Medicaid and the uninsured at KFF, a nonprofit group that focuses on health policy. \u201cMedicare is off the table, and there just aren\u2019t any other sources of funding for the Energy Commerce to look at.\u201d (During his presidential campaign, Trump vowed to preserve Medicare.)",
      "The possible cuts are expected to extend beyond those who benefited from the 2014 Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, potentially affecting nearly all of the people in the program.",
      "\u201cEveryone who relies on Medicaid would be at risk,\u201d said Edwin Park, a research professor at the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.\u00a0 \u201cSpecifics of the proposal will matter \u2014 each state will be hit, and how hard they\u2019ll be hit will vary \u2014 but certainly they\u2019re all at risk.\u201d",
      "Who does Medicaid cover?",
      "Medicaid provides health insurance primarily to people with low incomes, although it covers other groups including some older adults, pregnant women and people with disabilities. That includes about 72 million people.",
      "In 2023, Medicaid covered nearly 4 in 10 children, including over 8 in 10 children in poverty, 1 in 6 adults, and almost half of adults in poverty, according to KFF. The program covers more than 1 in 4 adults with disabilities and provides coverage for 41% of all births in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a sense that Medicare and Social Security are sort of these sacrosanct programs and Medicaid is often not lumped into the category,\u201d said Allison Orris, the director of Medicaid policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a think tank. \u201cPolling over the last few years shows that two- thirds of adults in the U.S. have some connection to Medicaid, and almost three- quarters of the population have a generally favorable view of the program. And that\u2019s because Medicaid really touches people and provides health care at all stages of life.\u201d",
      "The program is jointly funded by states and the federal government. States cover the upfront cost of care and then are reimbursed by the federal government for at least 50%.",
      "When the Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid to more people, the federal government committed to paying at least 90% of the total costs for the people who enrolled due to the expansion in each state.",
      "The share of people on Medicaid varies by state, but the states with the highest number of enrollees include California, New Mexico, Arkansas, Louisiana, Kentucky, West Virginia and New York, according to KFF. The program covers nearly half of Puerto Rico residents, the largest share among states and territories. Only 10 states, including Florida and Texas, don\u2019t participate in Medicaid\u2019s expansion.",
      "With fewer dollars coming from the federal government, states would bear a larger share of Medicaid costs, which many would likely struggle to afford, Orris said.",
      "\u201cCapping federal spending doesn\u2019t make health care needs go away,\u201d Orris said. \u201cIt just shifts the risk of higher spending to states and makes states make choices about: do they cut coverage, do they cut eligibility, do they cut provider rates?\u201d",
      "What about fraud in Medicaid?",
      "The GOP House budget plan is only the first step in a series of negotiations between House and Senate lawmakers before a bill can reach Trump\u2019s desk.",
      "Republican leaders have argued that the proposed budget cuts would eliminate fraud in Medicaid, but Park, of Georgetown, said there\u2019s no data to support the claim that fraud is more prevalent in Medicaid than in other parts of the health care system, including Medicare and private insurance.",
      "On Wednesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said on CNN that lawmakers were not going to make cuts to Medicaid benefits. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take care of those who are rightful beneficiaries of the program,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to cut the fraud, waste and abuse and that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to get the savings to accomplish this mission.\u201d",
      "Park said that\u2019s misleading.",
      "\u201cThe fraud argument is being used as a frame to justify Medicaid cuts, but the major proposals that are under consideration today to achieve this $880 billion target are the same major Medicaid cuts that were included in the [2017] Affordable Care Act repeal and replace bills that ultimately failed,\u201d Park said. \u201cBack then, there was no talk about combating fraud or waste or abuse.\u201d",
      "\u201cRepublicans are saying, \u2018We\u2019re not going to hurt enrollees, we\u2019re not going to hurt people, we\u2019re just going to deal with waste, fraud and abuse,\u2019\u201d Orris said. \u201cBut I think we need to unpack that and understand that just like any health care program, there are some improper payments in Medicaid, which generally result from paperwork not being filled out. That happens across all programs.\u201d",
      "The argument, experts say, shifts the focus away from the harms that would come to people across age and income spectrum if Medicaid gets cuts.",
      "\u201cCongress is very unlikely to say, \u2018Dear states, you need to cut coverage for people with disabilities,\u2019\u201d Orris said. \u201cAll of those hard decisions are going to be left for states to make and it\u2019s hard to say that any population would be spared, especially if you get into the realms of cuts that are big enough that lead to hospitals closing and impacting access to care.\u201d",
      "Without Medicaid coverage, people often don\u2019t have any other options.",
      "\u201cMedicaid is such a complicated program, and it covers so many different facets of the health care system, many of which people don\u2019t fully appreciate,\u201d Rudowitz said. \u201cWe know that most people who lose Medicaid would likely become uninsured and then would still need health care services, and may still show up to clinics, and those providers would likely not be reimbursed.\u201d"

      "It already has the world\u2019s largest navy, but new satellite imagery shows that China is developing a huge nuclear-powered aircraft carrier that would rival the biggest vessel in the American fleet, five analysts told NBC News after studying new satellite imagery.",
      "The images of China\u2019s Dalian shipbuilding facility in northeast China suggest that the new ship will allow fighter jets to be launched from four parts of the flight deck, leading analysts to conclude that the images suggest a new ship design \u2014 unlike anything now in the Chinese fleet.",
      "The analysts made the assessment after examining images provided to NBC News by Maxar Technologies, a defense contractor headquartered in Colorado used by the U.S. government.",
      "China\u2019s three current aircraft carriers have the capacity to launch jets from only three parts on the front and the waist, or center, on the deck. Its latest supercarrier, the recently launched Fujian, a Type 003, has three electromagnetic catapult launching systems to propel fighter jets, said Michael Duitsman, a researcher at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, a California-based nongovernment organization devoted to curbing the spread of weapons of mass destruction.",
      "The United States has 11 supercarriers that can launch from four places.",
      "\u201cWe think this is them testing equipment and layouts for the upcoming Type 04 carrier,\u201d Duitsman said in a video call this week.",
      "The general consensus, he said, is\" that the new carrier will have four catapults,\u201d which would allow more planes to take off and match U.S. carriers like the USS Gerald R. Ford, the Navy's largest and most advanced aircraft carrier. To accommodate four catapults, the ship will need to be larger than the Fujian, matching American tonnage and powered by a nuclear reactor.",
      "The satellite images of China\u2019s Dalian shipbuilding facility in northeast China show an engineering prototype of a module with two tracks, or trenches.",
      "These tracks \u201cobviously are related to catapults,\u201d said H.I Sutton, an independent naval analyst based in the U.K. \u201cBut this is not the actual carrier under construction. Instead what it suggests is that the yard is gearing up to produce carriers,\u201d he said in a telephone interview last week."

      "Francis, 88, was admitted to Rome\u2019s Gemelli hospital on February 14 with respiratory problems that degenerated into\u00a0double pneumonia\u00a0\u2014 a serious infection in both lungs that can inflame and scar them, making it difficult to breathe.",
      "\u201cI would like to thank you for the prayers,\u201d Francis said in a note released by the Vatican in place of his usual Sunday prayer with pilgrims, which the\u00a0pope\u00a0was not able to lead for the third week running.",
      "\u201cI feel all your affection and closeness and ... I feel as if I am \u2018carried\u2019 and supported by all God\u2019s people,\u201d the message said.",

    "story": [
      "A singer in Iran was arrested on charges of organizing an unlicensed concert and performing as the sole female singer in the presence of men, according to state media.",
      "A lawyer for Hiva Seyfizadeh told state media outlet Fars News Agency on Saturday that his \u201cclient and the rest of the group were released on bail today.\u201d",
      "\u201cOnly the concert organizer remains in custody,\u201d the lawyer, Saeed Nemati, said.",
      "Seyfizadeh, 27, was taken into custody last Thursday while performing at concert venue\u00a0Emarat Rooberoo in the nation\u2019s capital Tehran, according to Iran International, a Farsi-language news network based in Washington, D.C.",
      "Responding to Seyfizadeh\u2019s arrest, Ahmad Sadri \u2014 who heads the music office of the government\u2019s Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance \u2014 said in an interview with Iranian state media ISNA this week that \u201cthe building, Emarat Rooberoo, is a multipurpose cultural and artistic institute.\u201d",
      "The building is situated in downtown Tehran, in the city\u2019s artistic hub, an area populated by cafes, galleries and theaters. Across the street from Emarat Rooberoo is Tehran\u2019s main playhouse, where events are frequently held. While solo female singers and DJs often perform in these venues, Iranian law prohibits women from performing solo in front of audiences that include male onlookers, allowing them to sing only as part of a band.",
      "Shortly after the incident, the venue announced on Instagram that it would remain closed until further notice. On Sunday, FATA, Iran\u2019s cyber police, appeared to have taken over the account, citing \u201cthe publication of criminal content\u201d that \u201cgoes against public morality and ethics.\u201d",
      "Seyfizadeh\u2019s Instagram account also appears to have been taken over by the cyber police with a similar warning.",
      "Her lawyer, Nemati, did not immediately respond to multiple requests for details about Thursday\u2019s incident.",
      "Seyfizadeh has previously drawn attention for performing without the mandatory hijab, according to Iran International. She is also not the first female performer to be arrested in recent months.",
      "In December, a woman was similarly arrested in the country after she posted a video of herself singing without a hijab on YouTube. The woman, Parastoo Ahmadi, was seen in the video wearing a sleeveless dress with her hair down and was accompanied by four male musicians. Ahmadi\u2019s 27-minute performance\u00a0has been viewed more than 2.5 million times on YouTube.",
      "That same month, the Iranian government passed a law that imposes severe punishment on women and girls for not wearing hijabs in public. Violators of the law can face up to 15 years in prison or the death sentence, according to the United Nations.",
      "Women\u2019s rights issues have engulfed Iran in national turmoil over the last several years following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was arrested in 2022 by the nation\u2019s \u201cmorality police\u201d for failing to properly wear her hijab. She died in police custody three days later, sparking nationwide protests.",
      "The Iranian government has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and claimed that Amini died of pre-existing medical conditions."

      "PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. \u2014 Two days after Joe Highsmith made a nervy par putt to make the cut, he won the Cognizant Classic with the lowest weekend ever at PGA National and is going to the Masters.",
      "Highsmith rallied from a four-shot deficit Sunday with three straight birdies around the turn and a 20-foot birdie putt on the par-3 17th that all but clinched it, giving him another 6-under 64 to win his first PGA Tour title by two shots.",
      "\u201cWinning was the last thing on my mind,\u201d Highsmith said. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible to come out on top. I played probably the best round of my life.\u201d",
      "Highsmith had a little help from Jake Knapp, who opened the tournament with a 59 and held it together until one shot into the water and two more to get out.",
      "Knapp, trying to become the first wire-to-wire winner in tournament history, had a one-shot lead when his wedge to the 11th came up short and into the water, with only half of the golf ball submerged. He tried to blast out and it trickled down the slope and back to the water. He tried again, this time the ball holding up in the rough.",
      "\u201cDidn\u2019t hit any of them really hard enough, unfortunately,\u201d Knapp said.",
      "He would up with a triple bogey and never caught up. Knapp didn\u2019t make another birdie the rest of the way, closed with a 72 and tied for sixth along with Michael Kim (71), who played with him in the final group.",
      "Jacob Bridgeman closed with a 64 and J.J. Spaun had a 66 to share second place.",
      "\u201cI was trying to make as many birdies as I could,\u201d Bridgeman said. \u201cI knew I had to do something kind of extraordinary today to catch the leaders, and I caught them, but they\u2019re only on the ninth hole.\u201d",
      "His runner-up finish was enough to get him into the Arnold Palmer Invitational next week.",
      "Highsmith, a 24-year-old lefty with a bucket hat and a broad smile, became the first player to make the cut on the number and win since Brandt Snedeker at Torrey Pines in 2016.",
      "With so many players in the mix going into the final round, it was set up to be a wild finish, and five players had at least a share of the lead at one point.",
      "Highsmith eliminated the drama in the final hour with a flawless round and an unforgettable weekend he played in 14-under 128. His big run started with a wedge to 3 feet on No. 9. He two-putted for birdie on the par-5 10th and rolled in an 18-foot birdie on No. 11.",
      "He added a 15-foot birdie putt at the 13th to take control, and then sealed it with his birdie putt down the slope on the 17th.",
      "Highsmith was all smiles coming off the 18th green with his caddie Joe LaCava IV, the son of the caddie who was on the bag for Masters champions Fred Couples in 1992 and Tiger Woods in 2019, and who now works for Patrick Cantlay.",
      "Highsmith is the second first-time winner in as many weeks, following Brian Campbell winning the Mexico Open. He finished at 19-under 265 and picked up plenty of perks. Along with earning a place in the Masters and PGA Championship, Highsmith is in the remaining five signature events, starting next week at Bay Hill.",
      "Jordan Spieth had four birdies in a five-hole stretch around the turn to get on the fringe of contention, only to play the final six holes in 1 over for a 68 to tie for ninth, his second top 10 in four starts since returning from wrist surgery last August.",
      "Florida State junior Luke Clanton, who secured a PGA Tour card through the PGA Tour University program by making the cut, shot 69 and tied for 18th.",
      "Highsmith shot the lowest 72-hole score since the tournament moved to PGA National, which has held two PGA Championships and a Ryder Cup, in 2007. The course was overseeded, making the rough less daunting and the fairways softer.",
      "\u201cI get that the overseed was there and the wind was down, but it\u2019s still a stressful golf course, and this was some of the best golf I\u2019ve seen played relative to what I would have thought would have happened on a golf course in quite a while,\u201d Spieth said. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy good golf out there.\u201d"

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s plan to impose tariffs on America\u2019s largest trading partners is sending ripples through the U.S. economy, as businesses and consumers alike prepare to pay",
      "Yet for Chipotle customers, it appears, for now, that it will be smoother sailing at the check-out register.",
      "In an exclusive interview with the Sunday edition of \"NBC Nightly News,\" Chipotle CEO Scott Boatwright told anchor Hallie Jackson that, for now, the burrito purveyor intends to keep costs constant for consumers even as some of its cost of goods move higher.",
      "\u201cIt is our intent as we sit here today to absorb those costs,\u201d he said, though he cautioned pricing changes could eventually come if elevated costs become a \u201csignificant headwind.\u201d",
      "For the most part, Chipotle is insulated from many of the costs implied by the types of tariffs Trump has proposed, which, if followed through with next week, would set 25% duties on Canada and Mexico and an additional 10% on ones from China on top of a 10% levy imposed last month.",
      "Boatwright has previously indicated Chipotle now gets about 50% of its avocados from Mexico, with the rest coming from Colombia, Peru and the Dominican Republic. All told, Boatwright has estimated cost of goods would increase 0.6%, or 60 basis points, on a rolling basis from the planned tariffs.",
      "\u201cWe are fortunate to have such an extraordinary economic model at Chipotle that we can withstand those types of inflationary pressures and not have to pass those costs off to the consumer,\u201d Boatwright told Jackson.",

      "Ramadan, the most sacred month of the Islamic calendar and a joyous time for Muslims around the world, comes during a time of growing uncertainty this year \u2014 following the expiration of the first phase of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, with many questioning if there will be a second phase or an extension of the first.",
      "On Saturday, colorful lights flickered in celebration of the holy month, which is when Muslims believe the first verses of the Quran were revealed to Prophet Muhammad over 1,000 years ago.",
      "The suhoor, an initiative sponsored by Jordan, had a large turnout that included mostly children. Hundreds sat at a table that seemed to stretch for miles, laden with cheese, vegetables, falafel, olives and bread. Symbolizing resilience and the joyous ambience, messages wishing Gazans a happy Ramadan were drawn on the few remaining walls of destroyed buildings.",
      "Young children at the gathering sang a popular Ramadan song by Emirati singer Hussain Al Jassmi: \u201cEverywhere we walk, there are Ramadan lanterns and decoration in the street. The sound of the adhan [the Islamic call to prayer] pours into the heart, and we pray taraweeh [Ramadan voluntary night prayer] in the mosque.\u201d",

This year, we feel safe during Ramadan, unlike last year, when we were living in fear.\u201d",

      "Hundreds gathered at a table resembling the mileslong one from the suhoor, breaking their fast with rice and chicken amid the sunset call to prayer.",
      "Malaak Fada, who helped organize the iftar, recalled how that street in Rafah looked before the war.",
      "\u201cBefore the war, this street was crowded with happy people going to the markets,\u201d she said. \u201cHere there was a watercress salesman, over there was a pickles salesman, and over there was a juice salesman. The Ramadan vibes were amazing because all the people had decorated their homes.\u201d",

      "Many Gazans remain hopeful for a better future, even as Israel cut off aid to the enclave Sunday in an attempt to pressure Hamas to accept a new ceasefire proposal.",
      "Israel faced criticism for the move, including from the foreign minister of Egypt, who accused the country of using \u201cstarvation as a weapon.\"",
      "Even so, Mamdouh A'rab Abu Oday says he will not leave Gaza.",
      "\u201cDespite what happens to us, we are united and together,\u201d he said. \u201cWe tell the entire world that we are together\u00a0and we will\u00a0not leave our country.\u201d"

      "As a steady stream of people marched through Yosemite National Park, homemade signs held high over their heads, they echoed a single unifying message: \u201cProtect our parks.\u201d",
      "From the Grand Canyon to the Rocky Mountains to Yellowstone and beyond, thousands gathered at national parks across the country on Saturday to protest sweeping federal cuts to the United States\u2019 historic public lands.",
      "In recent weeks, President Donald Trump\u2019s administration fired around 2,000 recently hired employees at the U.S. Forest Service and slashed an additional 1,000 jobs at the National Park Service.",
      "The mass terminations, part of an ongoing push to cut federal bureaucracy and spending, have raised concerns about the future of these lands. Affected national park and forest employees told NBC News that fewer workers will lead to longer lines, filthy bathrooms and unsafe hiking and camping conditions.",
      "\u201cWe need to stop the nonsense,\u201d John Goodwin, a now-retired longtime park service employee, told NBC Bay Area while protesting at Golden Gate National Recreation Area in San Francisco. \u201cWe need to hire back the people who were fired, not only at national parks but every federal employee who has lost their job in the last six weeks.\u201d",
      "Following initial backlash over the cuts, The Associated Press had reported that the administration would restore at least 50 jobs as well as hire nearly 3,000 additional seasonal workers.",
      "Still, the discontent was visible leading up to Saturday\u2019s nationwide protests. At Yosemite a week earlier, a group of laid-off park employees hung an American flag upside down at the summit of El Capitan, a famed 3,000-foot vertical rock formation.",
      "An upside-down American flag is traditionally a sign of \u201cdire distress,\u201d according to the U.S. Flag Code.",

      "Responding to Seyfizadeh\u2019s arrest, Ahmad Sadri \u2014 who heads the music office of the government\u2019s Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance \u2014 said in an interview with Iranian state media ISNA this week that \u201cthe building, Emarat Rooberoo, is a multipurpose cultural and artistic institute.\u201d",

      "Seyfizadeh has previously drawn attention for performing without the mandatory hijab, according to Iran International. She is also not the first female performer to be arrested in recent months.",
      "In December, a woman was similarly arrested in the country after she posted a video of herself singing without a hijab on YouTube. The woman, Parastoo Ahmadi, was seen in the video wearing a sleeveless dress with her hair down and was accompanied by four male musicians. Ahmadi\u2019s 27-minute performance\u00a0has been viewed more than 2.5 million times on YouTube.",

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced billions in support for Ukraine on Sunday following a summit with European leaders, just days after President Donald Trump berated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office.",
      "Starmer announced a loan of 2.2 billion British pounds ($2.8 billion) to support Ukraine, funded through the freezing of Russian assets passed on Saturday. He also highlighted a new deal that would allow Ukraine to use 1.6 billion pounds ($2 billion) in export finance to buy missiles made in Northern Ireland.",
      "Starmer vowed to bolster Ukraine to allow the nation to negotiate a peace agreement from a position of power.",
      "\u201cWe have to learn from the mistakes of the past,\u201d Starmer said at a press conference. \u201cWe cannot accept a weak deal like Minsk, which Russia can break with ease. Instead any deal must be backed with strength. Every nation must contribute to that in the best way that it can.\u201d",
      "The Minsk agreements are a set of deals aimed at ending the fighting between Ukrainian armed forces and Russian separatists. Zelenskyy also referenced the weakness of the Minsk agreements during his tense visit to the Oval Office last week.",
      "Backing of any peace deal would include U.S. security guarantees, according to Starmer. The British premier rejected a characterization posed by a reporter that the U.S. was an \u201cunreliable ally.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe discussions we\u2019ve had today, particularly the coalition of the willing, is on the basis that this is a plan we will work on with the U.S. and that it will have U.S. backing,\u201d Starmer said, adding that he spoke to Trump Saturday night.",
      "Leaders must work to secure more support for Ukraine, because while the Russians talk of peace, they are \u201ccontinuing their relentless aggression,\u201d Starmer said Sunday in his opening remarks of the summit.",
      "\u201cGetting a good outcome for Ukraine is not just a matter of right and wrong. It\u2019s vital for the security of every nation here,\u201d Starmer said.",
      "Russia\u2019s top diplomat, meanwhile,\u00a0praised what he called Trump\u2019s\u00a0\u201ccommon sense\u201d approach to ending a war that began when Russia invaded Ukraine three years ago, and accused European countries of trying to prolong the conflict.",
      "With many of America\u2019s once staunch allies now uncertain where they stand with the Trump administration, leaders and officials from more than a dozen countries attended the high-level meeting at Lancaster House, a 200-year-old mansion near Buckingham Palace.",
      "Starmer gave Zelenskyy a warm hug and a handshake outside his home at No. 10 Downing St. on Saturday and said he was determined to end the war in Ukraine, where Russian forces control nearly one-fifth of the country.",
      "The Ukrainian leader flew to the U.K. after his extraordinary encounter on Friday with Trump and Vice President JD Vance.",
      "Zelenskyy was at the White House to sign a deal with Trump that would grant the U.S. access to rare earths and other critical minerals in Ukraine after the war with Russia ends.",
      "Trump has said the deal with the U.S. would serve as a security guarantee for Ukraine against a future Russian invasion like the one that started the war in February 2022. The invasion of Ukraine precipitated the most important confrontation between Russia and the West since the Cold War.",
      "But the deal was never signed and remains in limbo after Zelenskyy was asked to leave the White House when the meeting devolved into an argument in front of reporters.",
      "The encounter left\u00a0Trump angry and publicly questioning whether his Ukrainian counterpart wants to negotiate an end to the war.",
      "Zelenskyy has since thanked Trump for hosting him and Americans for supporting Ukraine.",
      "Speaking to the BBC on Sunday, Starmer said the encounter made him feel \u201cuncomfortable.\u201d But he said the \u201cimportant thing is how to react to that. There are a number of different routes people could go down. One is to ramp up the rhetoric as to how outraged we all are or not.\u201d",
      "Starmer added that he believed Trump was motivated by a \u201clasting peace\u201d and the U.K. would work with France and Ukraine to present a ceasefire plan to the U.S.",
      "On Sunday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov emphasized his country\u2019s growing common ground with Trump.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump is a pragmatist,\u201d Lavrov told the Russian military newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda, according to a transcript released by the Foreign Ministry. \u201cHis slogan is common sense. It means, as everyone can see, a shift to a different way of doing things.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut the goal is still MAGA (Make America Great Again),\u201d Lavrov said. \u201cThis gives a lively, human character to politics. That\u2019s why it\u2019s interesting to work with him.\u201d"

      "Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n made history as the first openly transgender actor to be nominated for an Oscar, then shortly found herself in the middle of a backlash.",
      "In the best picture contender \"Emilia P\u00e9rez,\" Gasc\u00f3n, 52, plays Juan \u201cManitas\u201d Del Monte, a cartel kingpin who dreams of living openly as a woman. She portrays the vicious gang leader transitioning into her authentic self \u2014 Emilia P\u00e9rez.",
      "Her Oscar chances gained momentum when \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\" won multiple Golden Globes on Jan. 5. Gasc\u00f3n accepted an award on behalf of the cast and crew and gave an emotional speech about overcoming prejudice.",
      "\u201cLight always wins over darkness,\u201d she said in her tearful address. \u201cYou can maybe put us in jail, you can beat us up, but you never can take away our soul, our existence, and our identity.\u201d",
      "However, a few weeks later journalist Sarah Hagi accused Gasc\u00f3n of hypocrisy after sharing screenshots on Jan. 30 of what appear to be past posts on X from the actor. The posts were written in Spanish with Google translations appearing below.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s alleged past social media posts, mainly from 2020, contain racist and Islamophobic comments. Other\u00a0posts surfaced\u00a0of Gasc\u00f3n allegedly making negative comments about George Floyd and the racial identity of past Oscar winners.",
      "TODAY.com has not independently verified the now-deleted X posts in question.",
      "In the wake of the alleged posts, Gasc\u00f3n deactivated her X account and explained why in a statement to\u00a0The Hollywood Reporter.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I can no longer allow this campaign of hate and misinformation to affect me and my family, so at their request I am closing my account on X,\u201d she said. \u201cI have been threatened with death, insulted, abused and harassed to the point of exhaustion. I have a wonderful daughter to protect, whom I love madly and who supports me in everything.\u201d",
      "Gasc\u00f3n issued an apology on Jan. 30 after her past social media posts about Muslims, George Floyd and the Oscars resurfaced.",

      "She also spoke about the controversy in an interview with\u00a0CNN Espa\u00f1ol\u00a0interview on Feb. 2.",
      "\u201cI believe I have been judged, I have been convicted and sacrificed and crucified and stoned without a trial and without the option to defend myself,\u201d she said in Spanish.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n said at the time of the posts, she was using social media more like a diary than as a platform\u00a0\u201cthat can influence someone, because before being here my post was viewed by three people.\u201d",
      "Has Gasc\u00f3n attended past award shows?",
      "Gasc\u00f3n attended the Golden Globes, but following the controversy's eruption, Gasc\u00f3n did not appear at a pair of major awards shows.",
      "She was not at the British Academy Film Awards on Feb. 16, where she was a best-actress nominee. Her \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\" costar Zoe Salda\u00f1a  won the award for best film not in the English language.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n also was not in attendance at the Screen Actors Guild Awards on Feb. 23, where Salda\u00f1a won the award for outstanding performance by a female actor in a supporting role.",

      "She did not do any press and proceeded directly into the venue, according to Variety.",

      "\u201cthis is all from the star of a movie that is campaigning on its progressive values, you really gotta laugh,\u201d Hagi wrote on X. \u201cstuff like this doesn\u2019t get flagged because you can say whatever you want about muslims, it\u2019s never considered racist.\u201d",
      "Gasc\u00f3n has since deactivated her X account. She explained her decision to leave the social media platform in a statement to\u00a0The Hollywood Reporter.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I can no longer allow this campaign of hate and misinformation to affect me and my family, so at their request I am closing my account on X,\u201d she said. \u201cI have been threatened with death, insulted, abused and harassed to the point of exhaustion.

      "She added that the experience she had with \u201cevery individual\u201d who was part of the film was \u201cabout inclusivity, collaboration and racial, cultural and gender equity.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt saddens me that we\u2019re having to face this setback right now,\u201d Salda\u00f1a said. \u201cBut I\u2019m happy that you\u2019re all here and that you\u2019re all still showing up for \u2018Emilia\u2019 because the message that this film has is so powerful and the change that it can bring forward to communities that are marginalized day in and day out is important.\u201d",
      "Gasc\u00f3n had been set to attend the panel discussion but ended up not attending the event, according to moderator Edith Bowman.",
      "Salda\u00f1a followed up in an interview with Variety\u2019s Awards Circuit podcast.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sad. Time and time again, that\u2019s the word because that is the sentiment that has been living in my chest since everything happened,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m also disappointed. I can\u2019t speak for other people\u2019s actions. All I can attest to is my experience, and never in a million years did I ever believe that we would be here,\u201d she continued.",
      "Selena Gomez, meanwhile, who co-stars in \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d as P\u00e9rez\u2019s wife, does not appear to have publicly addressed Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s recently unearthed posts.",

      "\u201cOf course that\u2019s not mine,\u201d Gasc\u00f3n said. \u201cI have never said anything about my co-star. I would never refer to her that way.\u201d",
      "What has the director of \u2018Emilia Perez\u2019 said?",
      "Director Jacques Audiard broke his silence about the lead of the Oscar-nominated film in an\u00a0interview with Deadline\u00a0that published Feb. 5.",
      "In it, Audiard called Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s comments \u201cinexcusable,\u201d and said it impacted both their personal relationship as well as the film\u2019s reception.",
      "\u201cVery unfortunately, it is taking up all the space, and that makes me very sad. It\u2019s very hard for me to think back to the work I did with Karla Sof\u00eda. The trust we shared, the exceptional atmosphere that we had on the set that was indeed based on trust. And when you have that kind of relationship and suddenly you read something that that person has said, things that are absolutely hateful and worthy of being hated, of course that relationship is affected. It\u2019s as if you fall into a hole. Because what Karla Sof\u00eda said is inexcusable,\u201d he said.",
      "Audiard said he has not spoken to Gasc\u00f3n and does not plan to. \u201cI\u2019m not getting in touch with her because right now she needs space to reflect and take accountability for her actions,\u201d he said.",
      "He called her behavior \u201cself-destructive\u201d and said he doesn\u2019t understand \u201cshe\u2019s harming people who were very close to her,\u201d like co-stars Saldana and Gomez."

      "Who are the women who\u2019ve been by his side? Read on to learn all about them.",
      "Justine Musk (n\u00e9e Wilson)",
      "In the early 1990s, Musk attended Queen\u2019s University in Kingston, Ontario, where he met his Canadian-born college sweetheart, Justine Wilson, a then-aspiring writer one year behind him.",
      "In an essay she penned for Marie Claire in 2010, she recalled young Musk as \u201ca clean-cut, upper-class boy with a South African accent who appeared in front of me one afternoon as I was leaping up the steps to my dorm. He said we\u2019d met at a party I knew I hadn\u2019t been to. (Years later, he would confess that he had noticed me from across the common room and decided he wanted to meet me.)\u201d",

As the financial tech company\u2019s largest shareholder, Musk made $165 million from the deal, according to CNN Business. Meanwhile, his wife launched her own career as a dark fantasy author.",

In 2004, they welcomed twins, son Griffin and a child who later transitioned and now goes by her middle name, Jenna. And just two years after that, the Musk family added three more sons with the arrival of triplets Kai, Saxon and Damian.",
      "In her Marie Claire essay, the mother of six noted that their relationship \u201cwas a dream lifestyle, privileged and surreal. But the whirlwind of glitter couldn\u2019t disguise a growing void at the core.\u201d",

      "\u201cI remember thinking that this guy probably didn\u2019t get to talk to young actresses a lot and that he seemed quite nervous,\u201d she told Ashlee Vance, author of the 2015 biography \u201cElon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future.\u201d \u201cI decided to be really nice to him and give him a nice evening. Little did I know that he\u2019d spoken to a lot of pretty girls in his life.\u201d",
      "At first, Riley did not know much about Musk. But soon, she realized she knew enough to make a big commitment.",
      "\u201cIt all happened very fast,\u201d she recalled in a 2014 interview with \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d \u201cWe were engaged after, I think, two weeks of knowing each other. And I was 22 and it was ... fast. And then we were in it.\u201d",
      "In 2010, they wed \u2014 and stayed hitched for a while. By 2012, they divorced. But that wasn\u2019t the end of their romance. The couple gave it another go, walking down the aisle for a second time in 2013, before finally parting ways permanently in 2016.",
      "Amber Heard",
      "A year after Musk\u2019s divorce from Riley and a year after \u201cAquaman\u201d star Amber Heard filed for divorce from Johnny Depp, the two high-profile personalities began publicly dating.",
      "By May of 2017, things seemed solid for the couple, as Heard shared photos to Instagram featuring an Australian vacation in which she can be seen frolicking with Musk\u2019s sons.",

      "In May 2018, after several weeks of dating rumors, the couple attended the Met Gala together, seemingly confirming their relationship status. But by August, they were contending with split rumors after reports from sources including Business Insider shared that the two unfollowed each other on social media.",
      "It appeared they were going strong again in 2020, as they welcomed a son, X \u00c6 A-Xii, followed by another child via surrogate in 2021, a girl named Exa Dark Sider\u00e6l.",
      "In March 2022, Grimes told Vanity Fair, \u201cI would probably refer to him as\u00a0my boyfriend, but we\u2019re very fluid. We live in separate houses. We\u2019re best friends.\u201d",
      "At least that was the case at the time.",
      "By the time the story was published, she had another update to share, writing on X, formerly Twitter, \u201cMe and E have broken up *again* since the writing of this article haha, but he\u2019s my best friend and the love of my life.\u201d",
      "In mid-June of 2022, Musk and Grimes \u2014 perhaps as a couple, perhaps as best friends \u2014 welcomed another son. They named him Techno Mechanicus.",

      "\u201cI\u2019m just a fool for love. I am often a fool, but especially for love,\u201d Musk is quoted in Walter Isaacson\u2019s 2023 biography, \u201cElon Musk.\u201d",
      "But according to Zilis, love had nothing to do with bringing their children into the world. Strictly speaking, the two weren\u2019t even in a romantic relationship.",
      "\u201cHe really wants smart people to have kids, so he encouraged me to do this,\u201d Zilis explained in the book. \u201cI can\u2019t possibly think of genes I would prefer for my children.\u201d",
      "In February 2024, Musk and Zilis welcomed their third child, Arcadia. About a year later, Zilis announced on X that they had welcomed son Seldon Lycurgus.",
      "She wrote, \u201cDiscussed with Elon and, in light of beautiful Arcadia\u2019s birthday, we felt it was better to also just share directly about our wonderful and incredible son Seldon Lycurgus. Built like a juggernaut, with a solid heart of gold. Love him so much.\u201d",
      "In response, Musk shared a heart emoji to her post."

      "\"I was so moved by it at the end that I was literally the only person sitting in the theater, weeping, crying, as the ushers are cleaning up programs,\" she said. \"And I was like, 'I feel terrible.'\"",
      "Bassett jokingly explained that she wanted to make others \"feel as bad\" as she felt in the theater, so she spent her life trying to re-create what she saw on stage.",
      "After graduating from Yale's School of Drama, Bassett eventually set her sights on working in Hollywood. She said she told herself she had six months to find work.",
      "\"I was fortunate enough to get my share of some of these jobs,\" she said. \"And my six-month period came up, and I remember calling my great uncle in New York. I said, 'Unc, I\u2019m working. Each week, I get a new guest star.' There were only three stations, so there\u2019s a finite number.\u201d",

She got a second Oscar nom in 2023 for playing Queen Ramonda in \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.\"",

We have sat for months next to each other in the makeup trailer and you never mentioned that.' But now that we\u2019re at this point where we can celebrate, then he brings it up.

      "In Season Three, Episode One, Carl Boudreaux has dinner with Cole, pulling out her chair for her before sitting across from her.",
      "When Belinda waves to Cole, he turns his head to acknowledge her as well.",
      "Boudreaux is the first David tribe member to make it onto \"The White Lotus\" screen. In \"Survivor,\" White cast the final vote to eliminate Boudreaux on Day 30 and made him the fifth jury member. Boudreaux voted for Wilson to win the season."

      "Shane Gillis returned to \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d for his second hosting gig on March 1, alongside musical guest Tate McRae.",
      "The episode featured one of the late-night sketch comedy show\u2019s staples \u2014 a commercial parody.",
      "Gillis appeared in the fake advertisement for a new \"medication\" called CouplaBeers. At the beginning of the commercial, his character shared that \u201canxiety and depression were ruining\u201d his life.",
      "The comedian elaborated on his struggles, which included an inability to converse with his coworkers or pay attention to his wife. He also said he struggled to be a good father, as evidenced by a short clip of him yelling, \u201cCome on, Andrew, you can\u2019t be bad at school and sports!\u201d from the bleachers at his son\u2019s baseball game.",
      "\u201cI was at a real low point. That\u2019s when I talked to my doctor about CouplaBeers,\u201d Gillis explained. \u201cCouplaBeers is a revolutionary medicine that treats anxiety and depression fast. And within minutes of taking it, I\u2019m back to my old self.\u201d",
      "Gillis experienced a marked personality change after taking a \"dose\" of CouplaBeers at his son\u2019s baseball game, telling his son how much he loved and support him.",
      "After sharing that his \u201cconfidence is through the roof,\u201d instead of appearing awkward in the workplace, he transformed into the bully.",
      "At one point, he called his colleague \u201cstupid\u201d before pulling down his pants in front of everyone and commented on his female coworker\u2019s body and appearance. But he brushed off his brashness as \u201chaving a tough time adjusting\u201d to his new medication.",
      "\u201cSo the way it works is simple. CouplaBeers quickly turns a cloudy, rainy day into a sunny one. It\u2019s that easy,\u201d Gillis said. \u201cNow I\u2019m the me I want to be, and I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s noticed.\u201d",
      "The commercial parody claimed CouplaBeers was \u201ca clinically proven treatment\u201d for a variety of symptoms including \u201cdepression, winter, museum, hangovers, affair, moderate to severe Italian wife.\u201d However, it comes with the \"common side effect\" of drowsiness.",
      "\"So if you're ready to get your life back, talk to your doctor about a CouplaBeers,\" Gillis said in closing.",
      "Ending the commercial, the camera showed family and friends of Gillis' character gathered in the living room, seemingly about to stage an intervention.",
      "\"Honey, can you come sit down. We need to talk,\" Heidi Gardner says.",
      "\"Mom and Dad! What are you guys doing here,\" Gillis adds, before the clip cut to black.",
      "The new episode of \u201cSNL\u201d also featured a surprise cameo from former cast member Mike Myers. The actor appeared in the show\u2019s politically charged cold open as Elon Musk.",
      "This marked Gillis\u2019 second time hosting \u201cSNL,\u201d after making his hosting debut in February 2024. During his first monologue, he addressed his 2019 firing from the show, which occurred before the season even started."

    "story": [
      "This year\u2019s Oscars race has been one for the books. It\u2019s been a time to recognize the work of some of Hollywood\u2019s finest and to celebrate first-time and historic nominations.",
      "But it seems that amid this history-making season, there\u2019s been an equal amount of controversies. Many of the best picture nominees have been mired in headlines that have nothing to do with the movie.",
      "Here's what to know about the Oscars race we can't look away from.",
      "All the ways the 2025 Oscars movies faced controversy",
      "One movie takes the award for most-nominated \u2014 and most controversial. Netflix's \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d officially holds the record for the most Oscar nominations for a non-English language film.",
      "Garnering 13 nods, including ones for best picture, best director, best actress and supporting actress for Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n and Zoe Salda\u00f1a, respectively, the film beat out previous record holders such as \u201cCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\u201d (2000) and \u201cRoma\u201d (2018).",
      "The Spanish-language musical crime thriller, written and directed by Jacques Audiard, follows a criminal defense attorney (Salda\u00f1a) who helps a Mexican cartel leader (Gasc\u00f3n) disappear so he can transition into a woman.",
      "While there were some mixed reactions to the film, including GLAAD, who called it \u201ca step backward for trans representation,\u201d the film received mostly positive reviews from critics, including the New York Times, which said Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s performance added \u201csoul to the melodrama.\u201d",
      "But in late January, less than three months after its release, Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s rise as an award show favorite was quickly halted after a journalist shared some of her past tweets online, which many deemed offensive. Following the backlash, the actor issued an apology through Netflix and gave an interview to CNN Espa\u00f1ol Feb. 2, addressing her past comments and noting that she used her social media \u201cmore like a diary\u201d than as a platform with influence. Some felt that the actor didn\u2019t take full accountability for her actions, including the film's director, who told Deadline Feb. 5 that Gasc\u00f3n was \u201cself-destructive\u201d and needed \u201cspace to reflect and take accountability for her actions.\u201d",
      "While Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s past tweets and her recent responses to the backlash have cast a shadow over the film and her buzz-worthy portrayal, the actor\u2019s indiscretions weren\u2019t the only thing about \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d that have caused controversy.",
      "Some viewers have questioned why Audiard, a French man who doesn\u2019t speak Spanish, served as director. Others, like Mexican actor and singer Mauricio Mart\u00ednez, criticized the director\u2019s self-admitted lack of research about the country and its people while making the film.",
      "Other criticisms surrounding the film included the perceived dismissal of Mexican culture by not casting Mexican actors in most of the lead roles and Selena Gomez\u2019s Spanish language skills, among other issues pointed out by viewers.",
      "But Gasc\u00f3n isn\u2019t the only first-time best actress nominee that has caught flak for past or recent behavior. \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d Oscar nominee Fernanda Torres, who plays a mother coping with the disappearance of her politician husband, also recently made headlines after a 2008 clip of her in blackface resurfaced online.",
      "In a statement to Deadline Jan. 26, Torres apologized for appearing in blackface, saying she was \u201cvery sorry\u201d and that at the time \u201cthe awareness of the racist history and symbolism of blackface hadn\u2019t yet entered the mainstream public consciousness in Brazil.\u201d The actor\u2019s apology followed her best actress Golden Globe win in early January and her best actress Oscar nod, which made her the second Brazilian actress (after her mom, Fernanda Montenegro) to ever be nominated for that award. If she wins, she would make history as the first Brazilian actress to take home that Oscar.",
      "\"Anora\" had a controversy of its own. First-time Oscar nominee Mikey Madison, who plays a stripper who falls for the son of a Russian oligarch, received backlash after her comments for her decision not to use an intimacy coordinator on set.",
      "\u201cIt was a choice that I made,\u201d Madison said in a conversation with Pamela Anderson for Variety\u2018s Actors on Actors. The actor said she was offered the option of an intimacy coordinator by the film\u2019s director, Sean Baker, and his wife, producer Samantha Quan, but she and her co-star, Mark Eydelshteyn, \u201cdecided that it would be best just to keep it small. We were able to streamline it, shoot it super quickly.\u201d",
      "Some fans online took issue with an intimacy coordinator being a choice and not a \u201cmandatory requirement\u201d on set, while others felt her comments could \u201clead to other directors thinking intimacy coordinators aren\u2019t necessary.\u201d",
      "Baker had previously told Variety that keeping \u201cactors safe, protected, comfortable and involved in the process\u201d was his team\u2019s No. 1 priority on set, but still some argued that Madison was \u201cmanipulated\u201d into not using one.",
      "It\u2019s not just films with best actress nominees that have been put through wringer this award show season. \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d which landed 10 Oscar nominations, including a best actor nod for its star Adrien Brody, has sparked a slew of backlash for its use of artificial intelligence.",
      "The movie, which follows a Hungarian-Jewish Holocaust survivor who struggles in the U.S. until a wealthy client recognizes his talent as a visionary architect, used AI to digitally alter the Hungarian accents of actors Brody and Felicity Jones, neither of whom speaks Hungarian natively. Though the film\u2019s director, Brady Corbet, went on to defend his use of AI in the movie in a statement to Deadline, some fans said the use of the technology diminished the film\u2019s \u201cauthenticity.\u201d",
      "Another major contender, \u201cConclave,\u201d which received a best picture and best actor nomination for Ralph Fiennes, caused a bit of a stir among Catholics. Centering around scandals and power struggles within a fictional papal conclave, the film ignited a holy, or rather unholy, debate about the film being \u201canti-Catholic propaganda,\u201d as some Catholic publications put it.",
      "Bishop Robert Barron, the bishop of the Diocese of Winona-Rochester, Minnesota, shared his criticism of the film on X, calling it an \u201cirredeemable situation\u201d and advising others to \u201crun away from it as fast as you can.\u201d His sentiments, which were viewed over one million times, were also reflected by various conservative commentators who said Catholics should be upset with the film.",
      "Then, just as some of the online chatter about the controversies surrounding this year\u2019s nominated projects appeared to quiet down ahead of the award show on March 2, a new controversy concerning \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d director Ali Abbasi emerged just days after Oscar voting ended on Feb. 18.",
      "After multiple outlets reported that Abbasi was dropped by his talent agency and management after an alleged groping incident that reportedly happened at a Golden Globes party, Abbasi took to X to address the reports and apologize for his actions.",
      "\u201cI made an over-familiar gesture \u2014 a slap on the rear \u2014 which I intended as playful and not in any sexual way whatsoever,\u201d he wrote in part. \u201cI quickly realized I had misjudged the situation. I apologized to him on the spot, and the following day I made sure my apology was reiterated through my representatives.\u201d",
      "He also refuted reports that he was \u201cdropped\u201d by his representation \u201cdue to this interaction.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy decision to part ways was a long-term career decision that was not shaped by short motivations. I believe in taking accountability for my actions; I made a mistake, I apologized and have learned a valuable life lesson,\u201d he added.",
      "Abbasi\u2019s film, which follows Donald Trump\u2019s rise to power as a real estate mogul in the \u201880s under the mentorship of lawyer Roy Cohn, landed two Oscar nods, one for Sebastian Stan as Trump and one for Jeremy Strong, who portrayed Cohn.",
      "How the 2025 Oscars also were a landmark for history-making representation",
      "Amid the onslaught of controversies, there\u2019s a silver lining to the Oscars this year: there\u2019s a big opportunity for some major history to be made.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n became the first openly trans actress to receive an Oscar nomination. This year also marks the first time four Latino performers were nominated in Oscar acting categories \u2014 Gasc\u00f3n, Salda\u00f1a, Torres, and Colman Domingo.",
      "Domingo, who was nominated for his portrayal of Bayard Rustin in \u201cRustin\u201d last year, also has an opportunity to become the first Afro-Latino to win the best actor Oscar for his performance in \u201cSing Sing,\u201d a prison-drama that follows incarcerated men who take part in a theater arts rehabilitation program.",
      "Meanwhile, Cynthia Erivo, nominated for her portrayal of Elphaba in \u201cWicked,\u201d has the potential to become the youngest EGOT winner, or winner of an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony.",
      "She already has a 2016 Tony for her role as Celie in Broadway\u2019s \u201cThe Color Purple,\u201d a 2017 Grammy for best musical theater album for \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d and a 2017 Daytime Emmy for her performance on TODAY with the cast of \u201cThe Color Purple.\u201d",
      "The film, which follows the complicated friendship of two witches, marks the third time Erivo has had a shot at the coveted honor; she received a best actress Oscar nod for \u201cHarriet\u201d in 2020 and another nod for best original song for \u201cStand Up\u201d from the same film.",
      "While it's uncertain if Erivo will take home the Oscar on Sunday night, the singer talked about the tough lessons she's learned along the way during her acceptance speech at the Essence Black Women in Hollywood Awards on Feb. 27. She compared her journey to Elphaba's and encouraged the audience \u2014 filled with Black women \u2014 to recognize their value regardless if others acknowledged or honored them for it.",
      "\"Elphaba's journey as a woman seen as different and cast aside for the very thing that makes her unique speaks to the heart of every Black woman who has ever been judged and misunderstood and yet still learned that her power was a gift or love,\" Erivo said. \"So I thought that I, Cynthia, would speak to your hearts. I wanted to take this opportunity as more than an opportunity to accept this beautiful award and honor, and I wanted to use it as a way to affirm you all.\"",
      "She continued, \"You weren't insane when you were dreaming of being a superhero. You weren't asking too much when you wanted to be seen for the lead. When you were little and you believed you could fly, that wasn't a fairy tale. When you look at the mirror and the thought crosses your mind, if only for a fleeting moment that you might be in possession of power for magic entertainment thought, do not dismiss it. Nourish it, because it's real.\"",
      "Essence's annual soiree, which celebrates the cinematic achievements of Hollywood's finest, including Teyana Taylor, Raamla Mohamed, Marla Gibbs, Charles and Stacey King's annual MACRO party, and the Lexus Uptown Honors Hollywood Awards are examples of culturally significant events during Oscars week that  continue to highlight and celebrate actors and creatives in a way that big award shows don't.",
      "Jeff Friday, founder of ABFF Ventures and annual events like the American Black Film Festival and ABBF Honors, said that these type of celebrations not only acknowledge the history-making achievements of those in the industry but they put their culture and what they represent at the forefront.",
      "\"I think it's really up to us. Instead of asking questions like, 'Why don't we get the validation and celebration we deserve?' I think it's really up to us to invest in our own celebration,\u201d Friday told TODAY.com during the Lexus Uptown Honors Hollywood Awards on Feb. 26. \"Our message and our mission is more about economic empowerment ... It's about investing in your own culture.\"",

      "\u201cWicked\u201d stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, who play Glinda and Elphaba in the movie adaptation of the musical, are set to perform at the 97th Annual Academy Awards on March 2.",
      "The duo has not shared exactly what they plan to perform, but \u201cDefying Gravity,\u201d the defining anthem of the musical, is a likely contender.",
      "Since the moment the musical opened on Broadway over 20 years ago, \u201cDefying Gravity\u201d has proven a favorite among theater-lovers across the globe.",
      "The release of the movie adaptation of \u201cWicked\u201d last November, and the use of the song in its promotional materials, bolstered the popularity of \u201cDefying Gravity\u201d even further.",
      "\u201cDefying Gravity\u201d also inadvertently shaped one of the press tour\u2019s viral moments. Tracy E. Gilchrist, a reporter for Out, told Grande and Erivo that people in the LGBTQ+ community are \u201ctaking the lyrics of \u2018Defying Gravity\u2019 and really holding space with that.\u201d In response, Grande grasped Erivo\u2019s finger and Erivo issued an earnest answer. The internet, meanwhile, tried to understand what it all meant.",
      "Read on for the meaning and significance of \u201cWicked\u2019s\u201d eminent song, \u201cDefying Gravity.\u201d",
      "What happens during \u2018Defying Gravity\u2019?",
      "\u201cDefying Gravity\u201d is the Act I finale of \u201cWicked\u201d in the stage musical and the ending of the movie \u201cWicked,\u201d which is the first of two films.",
      "\u201cWe found it very difficult to get past \u2018Defying Gravity\u2019 without a break,\u201d Schwartz said in a fan newsletter. \u201cThat song is written specifically to bring a curtain down, and whatever scene to follow it without a break just seemed hugely anti-climactic.\u201d",
      "Within \u201cWicked\u2019s\u201d storyline, \u201cDefying Gravity\u201d marks Elphaba\u2019s reaction to discovering the Wizard of Oz does not actually have the magical powers that he claims to hold.",
      "Elphaba goes to the Emerald City under the pretense that she could harness her powers and train alongside the Wizard, and maybe even get his help in removing her green skin tone.",
      "Right before \"Defying Gravity,\" Elphaba learns that the Wizard and her Shiz University professor Madame Morrible only wanted to use her powers to carry out their sinister plan to strip the animals in Oz of their autonomy and rights.",
      "Elphaba, in response, flees. Glinda, following Morrible\u2019s orders, chases her in an attempt to convince Elphaba to go along with the plan.",
      "The song marks a pivotal turning point in Glinda and Elphaba\u2019s friendship. Their philosophical differences and approaches to working with the Wizard mean there is no going back to the way things were. From here on out, there is a divide between Glinda and Elphaba.",
      "Glinda sarcastically sings to Elphaba, \u201cI hope you\u2019re happy now.\u201d Elphaba\u2019s decision not to comply with Morrible and Oz means that she will likely be arrested by one of the guards swarming them \u2014 unless she can somehow escape.",
      "Elphaba retorts back, \u201cI hope you\u2019re happy too / I hope you\u2019re proud how you would grovel in submission / To feed your own ambition.\u201d In these words, she describes her disappointment with Glinda\u2019s choice to side with Morrible and Oz.",
      "Elphaba realizes she does not want to go along with what others want her to do, unlike Glinda, who so clearly does. After trying to change herself for so long, Elphaba embraces her individuality, green skin and all.\u00a0She lives by her own rules.",
      "For a moment, she appears to persuade Glinda to support her efforts. Together, they sing, \u201cThere\u2019s no fight we cannot win / just you and I defying gravity,\u201d they decide.",
      "By the end of the number, the idea of defying gravity becomes more than a metaphor. Elphaba mounts a broomstick and uses the magic she now celebrates to literally defy gravity and fly into the sky.",
      "Glinda has the option to join her in the sky, but ultimately decides not to mount the broom \u2013 choosing, perhaps, to be \"popular\" instead.",
      "Elphaba continues the song until the end of the film, relishing in her newfound individuality \u2014 the very thing that will earn the label of \"wicked.\"",
      "So, what is \u2018Defying Gravity\u2019 really about?",
      "\u201cDefying Gravity\u201d is about a lot of things. It's about Elphaba's empowerment and commitment to her principles in the face of an authoritarian regime. It's about the magic of unlocking personal power (or, in this case, the ability to fly).",
      "But Elphaba's triumph is undercut by a sense of bittersweetness: Her decision also separates her from her true friend.",
      "The song likely resonates with audiences because it inspires listeners to be unapologetically themselves and question, if not outright defy, social norms.",
      "Within the bounds of \u201cDefying Gravity,\u201d anyone who has ever been pinned \"the enemy\" deserves to \"a chance to fly.\" Anyone who has ever felt like an underdog might come out the winner.",
      "What has Erivo said about 'Defying Gravity'?",

    "story": [
      "\u201cEmilia Perez\u201d was an awards show favorite, raking in\u00a0four Golden Globes, including two for best picture, and multiple SAG Awards and Oscar nominations. Then came the controversy.",
      "The sweeping Spanish-language operatic musical defies easy categorization, as star Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n told Netflix\u2019s\u00a0Tudum blog\u00a0in January.",
      "\u201cYou have an action movie that\u2019s not an action movie, a drama that\u2019s not a drama, a comedy that\u2019s not a comedy,\u201d she said.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n plays dual roles in the gritty film: first, that of Juan \u201cManitas\u201d Del Monte, a murderous Mexican gang leader who dreams of living openly as a woman.",
      "The cartel kingpin recruits a lawyer, Rita (Zoe Salda\u00f1a), to help her fake her own death and secretly obtain gender-affirming care \u2014 and at last, her new, authentic self, Emilia P\u00e9rez, is born.",
      "However, Emilia cannot completely escape her violent origins, and when her wife, Jessi (Selena Gomez) comes back into the picture, past and present collide in tragic ways.",
      "Some critics and filmmakers have raved about the Spanish-language musical, with\u00a0Variety\u00a0calling the movie \u201cdazzling\u201d and director Michael Mann\u00a0calling it\u00a0a \u201ccontemporary masterpiece.\u201d",
      "However, at the start of awards season, viewers have criticized the movie for its lack of cultural authenticity.",
      "Some have asked why the movie, which is helmed by a French director, Jacques Audiard, was not filmed in Mexico despite being set there, and features no Mexican leads. Per the\u00a0Hollywood Reporter, most of the movie was filmed on a sound stage in Paris, save for five days of exterior shots in Mexico. Others have criticized the language skills of Gomez, who is not fluent in Spanish.",
      "And the movie\u2019s approach to transgender representation is considered, by some, \u201ca step backward,\u201d as\u00a0GLAAD\u00a0put it.",
      "Then, star Gasc\u00f3n became embroiled in a controversy of her own when her past tweets, which show her making racist and Islamophobic statements, resurfaced.",
      "Keep reading to learn more about some of the controversies surrounding \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez.\u201d",
      "Star Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n addressed past tweets \u2014 and so did her co-stars",
      "In late January, Journalist Sarah Hagi shared, on X, screenshots of what appeared to be Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s past tweets from 2020.",
      "In the tweets, which were written in Spanish, Gasc\u00f3n weighed in on the George Floyd\u2019s murder and Muslims in Europe, expressing racist and Islamophobic sentiments.",
      "Amid backlash, Gasc\u00f3n issued a statement of apology through Netflix.",
      "\u201cI want to acknowledge the conversation around my past social media posts that have caused hurt. As someone in a marginalized community, I know this suffering all too well and I am deeply sorry to those I have caused pain,\u201d she said in her statement, according to\u00a0NBC News. \u201cAll my life I have fought for a better world. I believe light will always triumph over darkness.\u201d",
      "She also gave an interview with\u00a0CNN Espa\u00f1ol Feb. 2\u00a0addressing her tweets and their reception.",
      "\u201cI believe I have been judged, I have been convicted and sacrificed and crucified and stoned without a trial and without the option to defend myself,\u201d she said in Spanish.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n said she was using social media \u201cmore like a diary\u201d than as a platform \u201cthat can influence someone, because before being here my post was viewed by three people.\u201d",
      "\u201cEmilia Perez\u201d cast members and director Jacques Audiard have since weighed in. Zoe Salda\u00f1a addressed Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s online presence in a Q&A session for the film in London on Jan. 31.",
      "She said, in a video shared by\u00a0The Hollywood Reporter, \u201cI\u2019m still processing everything that has transpired in the last couple of days. It makes me really sad because I don\u2019t support and I don\u2019t have any tolerance for any negative rhetoric towards people of any group.\u201d",
      "Audiard spoke up in an\u00a0interview with Deadline\u00a0that published Feb. 5.",
      "\u201cVery unfortunately, it is taking up all the space, and that makes me very sad. It\u2019s very hard for me to think back to the work I did with Karla Sof\u00eda. The trust we shared, the exceptional atmosphere that we had on the set that was indeed based on trust. And when you have that kind of relationship and suddenly you read something that that person has said, things that are absolutely hateful and worthy of being hated, of course that relationship is affected. It\u2019s as if you fall into a hole. Because what Karla Sof\u00eda said is inexcusable,\u201d he said.",
      "He said he has no plans of reaching out to Gasc\u00f3n. \u201cI\u2019m not getting in touch with her because right now she needs space to reflect and take accountability for her actions,\u201d he said.",
      "Gomez said at the Santa Barbara Film Festival, in a\u00a0video shared by the LA Times, that \u201csome of the magic has disappeared\u201d amid controversies. \u201cBut I choose to be proud of what I\u2019ve done,\u201d she said.",
      "The director says he \u2018didn\u2019t study much\u2019 about Mexico while making the film",
      "Some viewers have questioned why the film was directed by Jacques Audiard, who is French and doesn\u2019t speak Spanish, he confirmed to the\u00a0New York Times.",
      "Audiard also faced criticism when he said did not do much research on Mexico while making the film.",
      "\u201cHow much did you have to study Mexico to be able to make this film?\u201d an interviewer asks him in\u00a0a clip making the rounds\u00a0on social media.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t study much,\u201d Audiard says through a translator, according to a translation by NBC News. \u201cWhat I had to understand, I knew,\u201d he says in French.",
      "\u201cFrenchman \u2014 who speaks no Spanish or English \u2014 wins award for France for a film in Spanish, based in Mexico but filmed in France, about a Mexican cartel leader,\u201d Mexican American journalist Tom\u00e1s Mier\u00a0wrote on X\u00a0the day after the Golden Globes.",
      "Mexican actor and singer Mauricio Mart\u00ednez also criticized Audiard\u2019s self-admitted lack of research about Mexico for the film, and slammed the movie in\u00a0an X post\u00a0for \u201cportraying a Mexico full of stereotypes, ignorance (and) lack of respect.\u201d",
      "Film critic Ana Iribe also took issue with the movie\u2019s lack of research and the way it portrayed violence in Mexico.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the lack of info that makes it insensitive: we don\u2019t want a white French director to portray the violence we have to face every day,\u201d she\u00a0wrote on X. \u201cI\u2019m not opposed to foreign artists making films about other countries, as long as they have good research, and EMILIA P\u00c9REZ didn\u2019t have that.\u201d",
      "Director Audiard responded to criticism of his approach to the Spanish language in an interview with Deadline. \u201cI happen to enormously love the Spanish language,\u201d he said. He also said, \u201cSpanish is such a rich language that crosses borders. What\u2019s been said about my statement is actually exactly the opposite of what I think.\u201d",
      "Audiard also said the movie was not meant to be realistic and compared his vision to an opera.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never claimed that I wanted to make a realistic work. If I wanted to make a work that was particularly documented, then I would do a documentary, but then there would be no singing and dancing. For example, I read a review where it said that night markets in Mexico City don\u2019t have photocopiers. Well, in night markets in Mexico City, one also doesn\u2019t sing and dance. You have to accept that is part of the magic here. This is an opera, not a criticism of anything about Mexico,\u201d he said.",
      "The movie is set in Mexico but most of the cast is not Mexican",
      "While \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d takes place in Mexico, the film\u2019s leads are not Mexican.",
      "Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, who plays Emilia, is from Spain, Zoe Salda\u00f1a, who plays Rita, is from the U.S. with Dominican and Puerto Rican ancestry, and Selena Gomez is from the U.S. with Mexican and Italian heritage.",
      "In one notable exception, supporting cast member Adriana Paz, who plays Emilia\u2019s lover, Epifan\u00eda, is from Mexico.",
      "Paz defended the movie in an interview with\u00a0IndieWire.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve heard people saying it\u2019s offensive to Mexico. I really want to know why, because I didn\u2019t feel that way. And I have questioned some people that I trust, not just as artists but as people, and they don\u2019t feel that way, so I am trying to understand,\u201d Paz said, adding that she feels the movie\u2019s director is a \u201cgenius.\u201d",
      "In November, casting director\u00a0Carla Hool said during a SAG-AFTRA\u00a0panel she and her team \u201cdid a big search\u201d for actors across Mexico, the United States, Spain and \u201call Latin America\u201d but did not find any Mexican actors suitable for the main roles.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to keep it really authentic but at the end of the day, the best actors who embodied these characters are the ones that are right here,\u201d she said, gesturing to Gasc\u00f3n, Gomez and Salda\u00f1a on the panel beside her. \u201cSo we had to figure out how to adjust authenticity \u2026 with the accents, and them not necessarily being native Mexican.\u201d",
      "The lack of Mexican stars in the movie was met with criticism on social media.",
      "One\u00a0X user\u00a0called the film \u201cridiculous\u201d and said it was a \u201cEuropean movie with hollywood stars that pretend to be mexican, with harmful stereotypes.\u201d",
      "Another X user criticized the movie\u2019s lack of Mexican stars and called the film \u201ca parody, a mockery of Mexico.\u201d",
      "Mexican director and cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto also questioned why the film did not include more Mexican people behind the camera.",
      "\u201cWhy not hire a Mexican production designer, costume designer, or at least some consultants?\u201d he said in a November\u00a0Deadline\u00a0interview. \u201cYes, they had dialogue coaches but I was offended that such a story was portrayed in a way that felt so inauthentic.\u201d",
      "He also said the film included mistakes that could have been avoided if more Mexican people were involved in the production.",
      "\u201cYou would never have a jail sign that read \u2018C\u00e1rcel,\u2019\u201d he said of a sign shown on a building in the movie. \u201cIt would be \u2018Penitenciaria.\u2019 It\u2019s just the details, and that shows me that nobody that knew was involved. And it didn\u2019t even matter. That was very troubling to me.\u201d",
      "Selena Gomez\u2019s Spanish-language acting has been criticized",
      "Controversy arose over Selena Gomez\u2019s Spanish language skills in \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez.\u201d\u00a0Gomez\u2019s character is Mexican and grew up in the U.S., with family there.",
      "Mexican actor and comedian Eugenio Derbez\u00a0made headlines in December\u00a0when he called Gomez\u2019s Spanish \u201cindefensible\u201d in a clip from the \u201cHablando de Cine Con\u201d podcast\u00a0shared on TikTok.",
      "\u201cI feel like she doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s saying,\u201d host Gaby Meza also said on the podcast. \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s saying, she can\u2019t give her acting any nuance.\u201d",
      "Gomez responded to these criticisms in a comment on the TikTok post.",
      "\u201cI understand where you are coming from..I\u2019m sorry I did the best I could with the time I was given,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Amid backlash, Derbez then issued an apology to the \u201cOnly Murders in the Building\u201d star.",
      "\u201cDear Selena, I truly apologize for my careless comments \u2014 they are indefensible and go against everything I stand for,\u201d he wrote on\u00a0TikTok. \u201cAs Latinos, we should always support one another. There\u2019s no excuse. I was wrong, and I deeply admire your career and your heart.\u201d",
      "Gomez grew up speaking Spanish but \u201clost\u201d the language when she started taking mainly English-speaking acting jobs at age 7, she told\u00a0NPR\u00a0in November.",
      "She said in an\u00a0interview\u00a0at the Cannes Film Festival that she is \u201cnot as happy with what I feel like I could have done in Spanish,\u201d but said she hoped \u201cit doesn\u2019t hinder my performance.\u201d",
      "Some people have defended Gomez\u2019s use of Spanish in the film.",
      "Annie Abbott, a professor of Spanish at the University of Illinois, argued that the criticism of Gomez mirrors the judgment sometimes experienced by heritage speakers \u2014 i.e., people with a Latino cultural and familial background who are not formally fluent in Spanish \u2014 from native Spanish speakers.",
      "\u201cGomez is critiqued for experiencing the typical challenges of heritage speakers while being held to native speaker standards \u2014 a no-win situation that a rapidly growing number of Americans can relate to,\u201d Abbott wrote in a recent opinion piece for\u00a0The Fulcrum.",
      "A 2023 study from the\u00a0Pew Research Center\u00a0found that 24% of U.S. Latino adults say they carry on a conversation in Spanish \u201ca little or not at all.\u201d",
      "According to the study, 54% of U.S. Latinos who say that only speak a little Spanish \u201csay another Hispanic person has made them feel bad for it.\u201d",
      "However, one commenter on X responding to Abbott argued that the issue wasn\u2019t with Gomez\u2019s language ability or identity, but with the fact that her Spanish skills did not match the demands of her role in \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe author misses the point completely. This has nothing to do with racism. Selena Gomez should be proud of her Spanish,\u201d the X user\u00a0wrote. \u201cBut her accent doesn\u2019t match the character that she plays in the movie. And that\u2019s very distracting for viewers who know exactly how Mexicans speak.\u201d",
      "Director Audiard has addressed issues with the actors\u2019 varying Spanish accents in the movie.",
      "\u201cThroughout the shoot we had problems, for instance, with Selena\u2019s accent in Spanish. She is Texan. Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n speaks Castilian Spanish. She\u2019s from Madrid,\u201d he told\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0in November. \u201cGiven that I don\u2019t speak Spanish, the nuances of the Mexican accent versus the Castilian were lost on me. We had all these problems with accents, but we fixed them in the edit. We did a lot of dubbing.\u201d",
      "Some argue the movie perpetuates harmful trans stereotypes",
      "Some viewers have criticized the movie\u2019s depiction of trans people and the trans experience.",
      "GLAAD, the LGBTQ advocacy group formerly known as the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation,\u00a0called \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d\u00a0a \u201cstep backward for trans representation\u201d and said the film \u201crecycles the trans stereotypes, tropes, and clich\u00e9s of the not-so-distant past.\u201d",
      "Some critics say the film perpetuates the harmful narrative that transitioning is a form of lying. Emilia keeps her past a secret from her wife, posing as Manitas\u2019 aunt.",
      "\u201cIts protagonist\u2019s transition is seen as duplicitous and dishonest, an act of manipulation through which she continues her selfish attempts to control those that she abandoned,\u201d Mattie Lucas wrote in a November review for\u00a0Trans | Cendental Cinema.",
      "\u201cNot only is her transition portrayed as more of a disguise to evade the authorities, it\u2019s an act of continued selfishness that ends up destroying not only her own life, but the lives of those she loves,\u201d Lucas added.",
      "Film critic Juan Barquin called the movie \u201ca regressive picture masquerading as progressive\u201d and criticized the way masculinity and femininity were portrayed in the film.",
      "\u201cAny time Emilia \u2018reverts\u2019 to her \u2018old ways,\u2019 Gascon lowers her vocal register as if to equate masculinity with evil and femininity with good,\u201d Barquin wrote for\u00a0Little White Lies magazine.",
      "Reviewer David Opie echoed this criticism, pointing to a scene when Emilia throws her wife Jessi onto a bed \u201cand threatens her using the same low, masculine voice she used pre-surgery.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s as if the so-called \u2018evil\u2019 in Emilia is a separate entity, the \u2018man\u2019 she was raised to be, rather than her being the same person going through a transitional journey,\u201d Opie wrote for\u00a0Yahoo! Movies.",
      "Several critics and viewers, including Barquin, also took issue with one line from the movie in which Emilia describes herself as \u201chalf male, half female.\u201d",
      "Some transgender commentators shared counterpoints to these arguments and defended the film\u2019s representation of its trans protagonist.",
      "Journalist and critic Mey Rude, who is trans, rejected the argument that Emilia uses a \u201cmale voice\u201d in moments of anger.",
      "\u201cShe simply is a woman with a lower register, and when she gets angry, it shows,\u201d Rude wrote in a piece for\u00a0Out Magazine. \u201cIf you listen to the scenes where Gasc\u00f3n is playing the character as Manitas, you can clearly hear a difference in the voice she uses in the fight scene with Gomez.\u201d",
      "Rude also argues that the film does not lean into \u201charmful trans tropes about trans women being deceptive or liars.\u201d",
      "\u201cEmilia isn\u2019t a liar because she\u2019s trans, she\u2019s a liar because she\u2019s a bad person and she\u2019s in many ways, afraid,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe movie shows that if you live a lie, whether you\u2019re trans or not, your lies will catch up with you.\u201d",
      "Writer Julie River, who is trans, argues in a piece for\u00a0Out Front magazine\u00a0that Emilia is portrayed sensitively as a \u201cmorally complex\u201d character who makes \u201ca desperate attempt to atone for her sins in her former life.\u201d",
      "River also argues that Emilia hides her transition not because the movie is painting trans people as duplicitous, but because as a cartel leader, Emilia \u201cwas hardly surrounded by people who were easy to come out to or who were likely to accept her transition.\u201d",
      "\u201cI may be amongst the minority in the LGBTQ+ community doing this, but I\u2019ll be applauding it for every award it wins,\u201d River wrote.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n herself has pushed back at people calling her \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d character transphobic.",
      "\u201cThere are some that say, \u2018I want to see LGBTQ or trans characters outdoing what people do in real life,\u2019 but we do bad things too ... I don\u2019t understand the criticism about the representation of portraying Emilia P\u00e9rez this way,\u201d she told\u00a0Vanity Fair\u00a0in January. \u201cThe reality is that the trans experience is not the same for everybody \u2014 my trans experience is different from somebody else\u2019s.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, go and make your own movie,\u201d Gasc\u00f3n also said. \u201cGo create the representation you want to see for your community.\u201d"

      "Here\u2019s how it works. Voters rank the eligible films in order of their preference. If one film receives the majority of the top votes, it\u2019s automatically the winner. If no single nominee gets over 50% of the vote, the movie with the fewest votes is eliminated, and the voters who had\u00a0that\u00a0film as their number one have their votes count for their next choice.",

      "LONDON \u2014 British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced billions in support for Ukraine on Sunday following a summit with European leaders, just days after President Donald Trump berated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office.",
      "Starmer announced a loan of 2.2 billion British pounds ($2.8 billion) to support Ukraine, funded through the freezing of Russian assets passed on Saturday. He also highlighted a new deal that would allow Ukraine to use 1.6 billion pounds ($2 billion) in export finance to buy missiles made in Northern Ireland.",
      "Starmer vowed to bolster Ukraine to allow the nation to negotiate a peace agreement from a position of power.",
      "\u201cWe have to learn from the mistakes of the past,\u201d Starmer said at a press conference. \u201cWe cannot accept a weak deal like Minsk, which Russia can break with ease. Instead any deal must be backed with strength. Every nation must contribute to that in the best way that it can.\u201d",
      "The Minsk agreements are a set of deals aimed at ending the fighting between Ukrainian armed forces and Russian separatists. Zelenskyy also referenced the weakness of the Minsk agreements during his tense visit to the Oval Office last week.",
      "Backing of any peace deal would include U.S. security guarantees, according to Starmer. The British premier rejected a characterization posed by a reporter that the U.S. was an \u201cunreliable ally.\u201d",

      "Trump has said the deal with the U.S. would serve as a security guarantee for Ukraine against a future Russian invasion like the one that started the war in February 2022. The invasion of Ukraine precipitated the most important confrontation between Russia and the West since the Cold War.",
      "But the deal was never signed and remains in limbo after Zelenskyy was asked to leave the White House when the meeting devolved into an argument in front of reporters.",
      "The encounter left\u00a0Trump angry and publicly questioning whether his Ukrainian counterpart wants to negotiate an end to the war.",
      "Zelenskyy has since thanked Trump for hosting him and Americans for supporting Ukraine.",
      "Speaking to the BBC on Sunday, Starmer said the encounter made him feel \u201cuncomfortable.\u201d But he said the \u201cimportant thing is how to react to that. There are a number of different routes people could go down. One is to ramp up the rhetoric as to how outraged we all are or not.\u201d",

      "Naim made his comments during a critical impasse: The first phase of a tenuous deal between Hamas and Israel is set to end on Saturday, and no arrangements have been made for continuing the ceasefire.",
      "While there have been few publicly acknowledged negotiations to extend the truce into a second phase, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said it will soon send a diplomatic delegation to Cairo to continue talks.",
      "Naim said that beyond that public announcement, Hamas had not been officially notified of Israel's intention to resume negotiations.",

      "Hamas has stated before that it is willing to cede governance of the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian body, and Israel has made clear that any plan for Gaza\u2019s \u201cday after\u201d should not include Hamas, which led the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on southern Israel. On that day, about 1,200 people were killed and 250 were kidnapped, according to local officials, sparking Israel's 15-month war on Gaza that has killed at least 48,300 people, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, and destroyed much of the enclave.",

That strategy included allowing Qatar to send\u00a0suitcases of cash\u00a0into Gaza and sidelining Hamas\u2019 rival, the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority.",
      "The prime minister has not taken responsibility, saying he will answer tough questions only after the war, which has been paused for nearly six weeks by a tenuous ceasefire.\u00a0Despite public pressure, including from the families of the roughly 1,200 people killed in the Oct. 7 attack and the 251 taken as hostages into Gaza, Netanyahu has resisted calls for a commission of inquiry.",
      "The military\u2019s main findings were that the region\u2019s most powerful and sophisticated military misread Hamas\u2019 intentions, underestimated its capabilities and was wholly unprepared for the surprise attack by thousands of heavily armed militants in the early morning hours of a major Jewish holiday.",
      "The military\u2019s findings are\u00a0in line with past conclusions\u00a0reached by officials and analysts. The military released only a summary of the report and military officials outlined its findings.",
      "\u201cOct. 7 was a complete failure,\u201d said one military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.",
      "A central misconception was that Hamas, which seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority in 2007, was more interested in governing the territory than fighting Israel, the inquiry found.",
      "The military also misjudged the militant group\u2019s capabilities. Military planners had envisioned that, at worst, Hamas could stage a ground invasion from up to eight border points, the official said. In fact, Hamas had more than 60 attack routes.",
      "Intelligence assessed in the aftermath of the attack has shown Hamas came close to staging the offensive on three earlier occasions but delayed it for unknown reasons, the official said.",
      "The official said that in the hours before the attack, there were signs that something was amiss, including when Hamas fighters switched their phones over to the Israeli network.",
      "The perception that Hamas did not want war guided decision makers away from taking action that might have thwarted the attack. The Israeli military official said intelligence shows that\u00a0Yahya Sinwar, a mastermind of the Oct. 7 attack who was killed last October, had begun planning it as early as 2017.",
      "With the military off guard on a holiday weekend, Hamas launched a heavy wave of rockets that allowed thousands of fighters to burst through the security fence or fly over it on hang gliders. They knocked out surveillance cameras and quickly overwhelmed hundreds of soldiers stationed along the border.",
      "From there they advanced to key highway intersections and attacked troops dispatched to the area, including some senior officers, disrupting the military\u2019s command and control, according to a second military official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "For the first three hours after the attack, Hamas fighters marauded through border communities and a\u00a0music festival\u00a0with little resistance. That was when most of the 251 hostages were taken and most people were killed, the official said. The official said the chaos led to friendly fire incidents, although he said there were not many, without disclosing a figure.",
      "It took hours for the military to regain control and days until the area was fully cleared of militants.",
      "According to the first official, the report blamed the military for being overconfident in its knowledge and not showing enough doubt in its core concepts and beliefs. It did not place blame on any individual soldiers or officers, but is likely to pave the way for a reckoning in the military and eventual dismissals.",
      "Some high-ranking officers\u00a0have already resigned, including the former head of military intelligence and Israel\u2019s top general, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, who steps down next week."

    "summary": "The prime minister made the remarks in an interview with NBC News on the eve of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's visit to Washington.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said there is \u201cvalue\u201d in an agreement that President Donald Trump is pursuing on Ukrainian mineral rights to repay some of the $500 billion in military aid that the U.S. has sent in support of the country's war against Russia.",
      "Starmer, who met with Trump at the White House on Thursday to discuss efforts at ending the Russia-Ukraine war and a possible trade deal with the U.S., said in an interview with NBC News that economic ties between Washington and Kyiv could be considered a form of security.",
      "\u201cI can see the value in the approach in relation to minerals,\u201d Starmer said in the interview. \u201cThat\u2019s a matter between President Trump and President [Volodymyr] Zelenskyy. But I can see very clearly the argument that President Trump makes in relation to minerals, and I can also see the validity of his points when he says that if there is a deal on minerals then the U.S. has economic interests in Ukraine, which, if you like, form at least one element of any security guarantee.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cThat, in its own right, is an important aspect.\u201d",
      "Trump has been vocal about his interest in settling the yearslong conflict in Ukraine and talked about compensation for the billions of dollars in aid that Washington has provided Ukraine since Russia's invasion in February 2022. But he has shied away from committing to any security guarantees, saying this week that he would ask Europe to take the lead on that.",
      "Earlier in the day, Trump warned that if a peace deal \u201cdoesn\u2019t happen quickly, it may not happen at all.\u201d",
      "\u201cEverybody wants peace, everybody wants bloodshed to end. Not least the Ukrainians,\u201d Starmer told NBC News, adding that discussions were already underway on what security would look like.",
      "Asked if Britain can achieve its objectives without U.S. participation, Starmer responded that \u201cthe first thing is to get the European element in place.\u201d",
      "He said Trump \u201cis right\u201d to press for talks to drive forward a deal, while adding words of caution about Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "\u201cMy concern is that we know, historically, that Putin might go again,\u201d Starmer said. \u201cHe has ambitions in relation to Ukraine. And therefore, if there\u2019s to be a deal, it has got to be a deal that lasts.\u201d",
      "The Starmer-Trump meeting comes at a sensitive time for the United Kingdom as the prime minister commits to sending British troops to Ukraine to help secure a \u201clasting peace\u201d if a peace deal with Russia is reached.\u201cThe stakes, they couldn\u2019t be higher,\u201d Starmer said during a joint news conference with Trump at the White House. He said it was essential that Ukraine be \u201cbacked by strength that will stop Putin coming back for more.\u201d",
      "Starmer, standing beside Trump, insisted that any deal should put to rest Russian ambitions and committed to putting \u201cboots on the ground and planes in the sky\u201d to limit future incursions into Ukrainian territory.",
      "Trump offered praise to Starmer, greeting him warmly at several junctures throughout the day. The two leaders held a bilateral meeting and continued their discussions on Ukraine and a possible trade deal over lunch, Trump said during the news conference.",
      "Starmer is a \u201cspecial man,\u201d Trump said, adding that they \u201cget along famously.\u201d",
      "The meeting came a day before the president is scheduled to meet with Zelenskyy in Washington, as Trump hopes the U.S and Ukraine can sign an agreement on rare mineral rights.",
      "The deal to jointly develop Ukrainian resources has been envisioned as a step toward an eventual peace deal between Ukraine and Russia."

      "The vote followed a week\u00a0in which\u00a0Trump seemed to side with Russia against Ukraine, announcing plans to negotiate a peace deal without Ukraine at the table, and blaming Kyiv for starting the war that Russian\u00a0President Vladimir Putin\u00a0launched with a full-scale invasion three years ago.",
      "Governments in Europe and democracies around the world are treating Trump\u2019s actions and statements not as provocative posturing, but as an earthquake.",
      "\u201cThis administration\u2019s policies are a fundamental shift,\u201d said James Bindenagel, a former senior U.S. diplomat who served for years in Germany.",
      "After Trump\u2019s\u00a0move toward\u00a0Russia, threats of tariffs against\u00a0NATO allies and talk of acquiring Greenland, European and other democratic governments are adjusting to the reality that the U.S. can no longer be considered a trusted ally, current and former Western diplomats told NBC News.",
      "An opportunity for China",
      "With American\u00a0reliability in doubt, some European\u00a0nations and other countries may seek alternative partners and markets, possibly in China, Bindenagel said.",
      "\u201cThe loss of trust in America creates a vacuum, and that vacuum is likely to be filled by cooperation between Moscow, Beijing, Pyongyang and Iran,\u201d said Bindenagel, professor emeritus at the University of Bonn.",
      "Trump\u2019s shift away from Europe creates\u00a0an\u00a0opportunity for Beijing\u00a0to try to draw Europe further into its orbit, he said,\u00a0adding, \u201cChina is the real winner here.\u201d",
      "If the Trump administration continues to antagonize its partners and question its alliances, there is a risk that China \u2014 as well as Russia\u2014\u00a0could expand their spheres of influence in the Asia-Pacific region, Africa and Eastern Europe, experts said.\u00a0In Asia, stunned officials in countries aligned with the United States are grappling with the implications of the apparent about-face in Washington, said Michael Green, chief executive officer of the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney.",
      "\u201cIt is no exaggeration to say that this deeply unnerved even our closest allies in Asia,\u201d said Green, who served on the White House National Security Council under President George W. Bush.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s aggressive dismantling of the U.S. agency overseeing foreign aid has had ripple effects abroad, according to Green. U.S. embassies are hampered by the chaos in Washington and funding for democracy programs has dried up, a potential boon for China, he said.",
      "\u201cSenior officials in Japan, Australia, Indonesia and Thailand have told me that China is swooping in, offering to replace the United States as the partner of choice,\u201d Green said.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s treatment of Ukraine has raised fears among Asian allies that Washington may not come to the aid of Taiwan if China seeks to seize control of the island by force or coercion, former U.S. officials said.",
      "Before French President Emmanuel Macron met with Trump in Washington on Monday, Macron said: \u201cHow can you, then, be credible in the face of China if you\u2019re weak in the face of Putin?\u201d",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has said that if America were to scale back military assistance for Ukraine, it would allow the U.S. to focus its resources on the Asia-Pacific region.",
      "The image that America has long tried to present to the world, as a champion of democratic rule and a counterweight to autocracy, also seemed to be radically altered. Singaporean Defense Minister Ng Eng Hen said last week that America had once been seen as a force for \u201cmoral legitimacy\u201d and was now looking like \u201ca landlord seeking rent.\u201d",
      "Pushing allies?",
      "The Trump administration and its supporters say the president is merely pushing allies to pay a bigger share of their own defense needs, recalibrating trade relationships and working to bring an end to the war in Ukraine.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s America First approach to diplomacy prioritizes what\u2019s in the best interest of the United States,\u201d said Brian Hughes, spokesperson for the White House National Security Council.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration will continue to engage our allies and partners to improve burden-sharing measures for defense spending, rebalancing trade deficits and ensuring global adversaries do not take advantage of America as they did under Biden,\u201d Hughes added.",
      "But for Europe, there is now a grim determination to prepare for a future without America at its side.",
      "Friedrich Merz, the presumptive next chancellor of Germany after the country\u2019s parliamentary elections Sunday, said it was unclear if the NATO alliance would survive.",
      "\u201cAfter Donald Trump\u2019s statements in the last week, it is clear that the Americans are largely indifferent to the fate of Europe,\u201d Merz, the leader of the center-right CDU/CSU alliance, said on German television.",
      "Members of NATO and the European Union currently lack the military strength, economic unity and political will to be able to secure peace in Ukraine and fill the void currently filled by the U.S., Bindenagel and other former officials said.",
      "\u201cRussia is not an all-powerful adversary with an economy the size of Italy\u2019s,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is simply far more determined than we are, which amplifies its limited potential tremendously.\u201d",
      "Nile Gardiner, a fellow at the Heritage Foundation think tank, which strongly supports the president\u2019s agenda, said that despite the friction with European governments, Trump will likely bolster the NATO alliance with his policies and possibly end a war that threatens to destabilize Europe.",
      "European countries, including the United Kingdom, recently announced further increases in defense spending, which Gardiner said was a response to Trump\u2019s demands for NATO allies to take more responsibility for the continent\u2019s defense.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re already seeing the Trump effect across Europe, and I think that Trump\u2019s goal is to leave NATO in far, far stronger shape four years from now, than when he inherited it,\u201d he said.",
      "But a flawed peace agreement that fails to provide sufficient security guarantees for Ukraine against future Russian attacks could embolden Putin and produce even greater dangers for Europe, said Timothy Sayle, author of \"Enduring Alliance: A History of NATO and the Postwar Global Order.\"",
      "\u201cWhat might feel like peace in the short term could be laying the conditions for a broader war in the future,\u201d said Sayle, an associate professor of history at the University of Toronto.",
      "If Russia is allowed to retain the territory it has seized in Ukraine, a peace deal could provide Moscow with a platform to stage further incursions or covert operations against other European countries nearby, including the Baltic states, he said.",
      "In a speech at Monday\u2019s U.N. session on Ukraine, Polish Foreign Minister Rados\u0142aw Sikorski said that ending the war \u201cat any cost\u201d by appeasing Russia would be a fatal error.",
      "Such a move would only invite further aggression, he said. \u201cIf Ukraine is abandoned today, who will be next?\u201d"

      "Experts say Kim won\u2019t likely accept Trump\u2019s overture anytime soon as he is now focusing on his support of Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine with\u00a0provision of weapons and troops.\u00a0They say Kim could consider resuming diplomacy with Trump when he thinks he cannot maintain his country\u2019s current booming cooperation with Russia",
      "Kim and Trump\u00a0met three times from 2018-19 during Trump\u2019s first term to discuss the future of North Korea\u2019s nuclear program. Their high-stakes\u00a0diplomacy eventually collapsed\u00a0due to wrangling over U.S.-led economic sanctions on North Korea."

      "It already has the world\u2019s largest navy, but new satellite imagery shows that China is developing a huge nuclear-powered aircraft carrier that would rival the biggest vessel in the American fleet, five analysts told NBC News after studying new satellite imagery.",
      "The images of China\u2019s Dalian shipbuilding facility in northeast China suggest that the new ship will allow fighter jets to be launched from four parts of the flight deck, leading analysts to conclude that the images suggest a new ship design \u2014 unlike anything now in the Chinese fleet.",
      "The analysts made the assessment after examining images provided to NBC News by Maxar Technologies, a defense contractor headquartered in Colorado used by the U.S. government.",
      "China\u2019s three current aircraft carriers have the capacity to launch jets from only three parts on the front and the waist, or center, on the deck. Its latest supercarrier, the recently launched Fujian, a Type 003, has three electromagnetic catapult launching systems to propel fighter jets, said Michael Duitsman, a researcher at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, a California-based nongovernment organization devoted to curbing the spread of weapons of mass destruction.",
      "The United States has 11 supercarriers that can launch from four places.",
      "\u201cWe think this is them testing equipment and layouts for the upcoming Type 04 carrier,\u201d Duitsman said in a video call this week.",
      "The general consensus, he said, is\" that the new carrier will have four catapults,\u201d which would allow more planes to take off and match U.S. carriers like the USS Gerald R. Ford, the Navy's largest and most advanced aircraft carrier. To accommodate four catapults, the ship will need to be larger than the Fujian, matching American tonnage and powered by a nuclear reactor.",
      "The satellite images of China\u2019s Dalian shipbuilding facility in northeast China show an engineering prototype of a module with two tracks, or trenches.",
      "These tracks \u201cobviously are related to catapults,\u201d said H.I Sutton, an independent naval analyst based in the U.K. \u201cBut this is not the actual carrier under construction. Instead what it suggests is that the yard is gearing up to produce carriers,\u201d he said in a telephone interview last week."

      "LONDON \u2014 Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Saturday as European leaders grapple with the fallout from an extraordinary on-air exchange in which the Ukrainian president was loudly berated by Donald Trump.",
      "Ahead of the meeting, Starmer told Zelenskyy, \"We stand with you, with Ukraine, for as long as it may take. And I hope you\u2019ve heard some of that cheering in the street that is the people of the United Kingdom coming out to demonstrate how much they support you, how much they support Ukraine and our absolute determination to stand with you.\"",
      "\"I want to thank you, the people of the United Kingdom, such big support from the very beginning of this war,\" Zelenskyy told Starmer.",
      "\"We\u2019re really really happy that we have such partners and such friends,\" the Ukrainian president added, saying that he'd also accepted an invitation to meet with King Charles on Sunday.",
      "Zelenskyy was seen leaving 10 Downing Street with Starmer on Saturday evening after their meeting ended. Starmer went back inside, while Zelenskyy got into a car. Neither made a statement to the media.",
      "European leaders are set to meet on Sunday at an emergency summit to discuss Russia and a peace plan for Ukraine.",
      "Britain\u2019s Starmer and President Emmanuel Macron of France have led efforts to convince Trump to continue supporting Ukraine, which was invaded by Russia three years ago. The spat in the Oval Office in front of the media has called into question whether that support will continue, and if the United States will proceed with a dramatic rapprochement with Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin.",
      "Most European countries came out in support of Ukraine, breaking with Washington as differences in the trans-Atlantic alliance built over the past 80 years burst into public view.",
      "\u201cToday it became clear that the free world needs a new leader. It\u2019s up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge,\u201d European Union foreign minister Kaja Kallas said.",
      "Friday\u2019s meeting was meant to jump-start talks on a deal over Ukraine\u2019s critical minerals, but degenerated into confrontation, with Trump and Vice President JD Vance criticizing Zelenskyy and telling him he wasn\u2019t grateful enough.",
      "European leaders quickly lined up to support the Ukrainian leader.",
      "Zelenskyy\u2019s \u201cdignity honors the bravery of the Ukrainian people,\u201d European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen posted on X. \u201cBe strong, be brave, be fearless. You are never alone, dear President Zelenskyy. We will continue working with you for a just and lasting peace.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war,\u201d wrote Friedrich Merz, the likely next leader of Germany.",
      "Macron said it was essential to respect the Ukrainians \u201cfighting for their dignity, their independence, for their children and for the security of Europe.\u201d",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who has called on Ukraine's president to resign in the aftermath of the tense Oval Office meeting, slammed European leaders for their support of Zelenskyy.",
      "\u201cThe Europeans are piling on in support of Zelensky. Here\u2019s my message to the Europeans. Maybe it\u2019s time for you to defend your continent,\" Graham said in an interview with Breitbart Radio on Saturday. \"Maybe it\u2019s time for you to stop hollowing out your military. And if you want to use tough rhetoric toward Putin, how about back it up with some muscle?\"",
      "Zelenskyy has remained adamant that security guarantees be included in any agreement to end the war alongside the minerals deal drafted by the White House. These guarantees, he said, are the only thing that will keep Putin, who has a record of violating agreements, from continuing to fight in Ukraine and beyond.",
      "On Friday, Trump told Zelenskyy he was being \u201cdisrespectful\u201d and \u201cgambling with World War III.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office,\u201d Trump said in a post on his Truth Social website after the meeting ended. \u201cHe can come back when he is ready for Peace.\u201d",
      "A day after the contentious Oval Office meeting, a White House official told NBC News that direct negotiations between the Trump Administration and Ukraine remain on hold.",
      "The administration has provided little clarity on what it would take for it to reengage with Zelenskyy but when asked before he departed from the White House on Friday night, Trump responded that Zelenskyy has \u201cgot to say I want to make peace\u201d and suggested he refrain from \u201cnegative\u201d comments about Putin.",
      "Trump also told reporters that Zelenskyy \u201coverplayed his hand\u201d and accused the Ukrainian president of \u201clooking to go on and fight, fight, fight.\u201d",
      "After leaving the White House, Zelenskyy posted on X, \u201cThank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you @POTUS, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.\u201d",
      "During a Fox News interview Friday evening, Zelenskyy reiterated his appreciation of U.S. support but rebuffed calls to apologize for his comments at the White House.",
      "Zelenskyy has repeatedly thanked the United States for its help. In December 2022, he spoke before both chambers of Congress and his first words were:",
      "\u201cThank you so much. Thank you so much for that. Thank you. It\u2019s too much for me. All this for our great people. Thank you so much. Dear Americans, in all states, cities and communities, all those who value freedom and justice, who cherish it as strongly as we Ukrainians in our cities, in each and every family, I hope my words of respect and gratitude resonate in each American heart.\u201d",
      "According to the Department of Defense, since February 2022, Congress has appropriated about $183 billion for Ukraine\u2019s defense, though Trump has claimed that the U.S. has spent over $300 billion on aid to Ukraine."

      "The reward: 1 million Hong Kong dollars, or $130,000.",
      "The flyers that arrived in this town 7 miles from Windsor Castle are the latest threat directed at Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy diaspora, who have fled the city trying to escape the long arm of Chinese law, only to find that harassment can cross borders.Lau, who spoke to NBC News from outside the U.K. on Friday, said she did not \u201cfeel safe living at my current address,\u201d and was now weighing temporary residence options elsewhere.

      "The law followed a political crackdown triggered by Hong Kong\u2019s 2019 pro-democracy protests. It threatens stringent penalties for a wide range of actions authorities call threats to national security, with the most severe \u2014 including treason and insurrection \u2014 punishable by life imprisonment. Lesser offenses, including the possession of seditious publications, could also lead to several years in jail.",

Two other men, Chung Biu Yuen and Chi Leung Peter Wai, will go on trial next month. They deny the charges, which include breaking into a residence.",

      "\u201cHe is dictating terms that the Europeans are very scared of and are really worried about what\u2019s going to come of this,\u201d Tybring-Gjedde said in an interview. \u201cRight now, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s the prospect of a Nobel Peace Prize. But you never know.\u201d",
      "A peace deal looks more elusive now than at any point since Trump\u2019s return to power. His meeting Friday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy turned dark, with Trump browbeating his counterpart for not being grateful enough for U.S. firepower that helped repel Russia\u2019s invasion.",
      "Negotiations with Ukraine appear to have collapsed for now, jeopardizing Trump\u2019s pledge to bring a quick end to the war \u2014 and perhaps spoiling his best shot at winning an award that has been on his mind for years.",
      "Four American presidents have won the Nobel Peace Prize, none named Trump. That missing piece of the resume grates on him, former aides say, as was evident during his meeting in the Oval Office last month with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",

      "If not, it won\u2019t be for lack of trying.",
      "In the space of a few days last week, no fewer than three senior Trump administration officials or nominees made a case for Trump winning the prize, using similar talking points.",
      "Unprompted, both Mike Waltz, Trump\u2019s national security adviser, and Rep. Elise Stefanik, the New York Republican nominated to be ambassador to the United Nations, told conservative activists that Trump is a president \u201cof peace\u201d who deserves the award.",
      "\u201cHe is going to end the war in Europe. He is going to end the wars in the Middle East,\u201d Waltz told the audience at the Conservative Political Action Conference.",

      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also mentioned the prize during an interview with Fox News. Without prompting, Bessent said Trump\u2019s plan to end the conflict between Ukraine and Russia merits the honor.

      "Fears have risen in recent weeks that Trump will use his leverage to end the war on Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s terms. His rhetoric has grown discernibly more hostile to Ukraine.",
      "Even before the angry meeting in the Oval Office on Friday, he called Zelenskyy a \u201cdictator\u201d and suggested that Ukraine instigated the war.",
      "Now, Trump\u2019s anger has spilled into public view. As Zelenskyy sat with arms folded, Trump and Vice President JD Vance scolded him like they would a disobedient schoolboy.",
      "\u201cHave you said \u2018thank you\u2019 once in this entire meeting?\u201d Vance said to Zelenskyy.",

      "At one point, Trump suggested he had bonded with Putin during his first term over what he called a \u201cphony witch hunt\u201d involving investigations into Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election.",
      "\u201cLet me tell you, Putin went through a hell of a lot with me,\u201d Trump said.",

      "If Trump forges an agreement that\u2019s favorable to Russia while leaving the rest of Europe vulnerable to Putin\u2019s aggression, that might sour any prospect of winning the prize. A pro-Russia deal may not sit well with the Nobel selection committee, whose five members are appointed by the Norwegian parliament.",

      "\u201cThey probably will never give it to me, even what I\u2019m doing in Korea, and in Idlib province and all of these places,\u201d Trump added. \u201cThey probably will never give it to me.\u00a0You know why?\u00a0Because they don\u2019t want to.\u201d",
      "Trump had two real shots at winning one back then: his efforts to rid North Korea of nuclear weapons (that didn\u2019t happen) and to normalize relations between Israel and some of its Arab neighbors (that one did).",
      "In September 2020, Tybring-Gjedde nominated him for the Middle East peace deal known as the Abraham Accords, though when the winners were announced the following year, Trump was skunked.",
      "Co-winners Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov were journalists who had exposed abuses of power in the Philippines and Russia, respectively.",
      "Even the nomination was something the White House chose to celebrate. The White House press office released a statement drawing attention it. Campaigning for re-election in Ohio that month, Trump complained that the press hadn\u2019t paid enough to attention to the nomination, though having one\u2019s name put forward isn\u2019t necessarily a rare distinction.",
      "The list of people allowed to nominate someone is long. Quite long.",
      "Any member of a national legislature can put someone\u2019s name before the selection committee. (Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-N.Y., nominated Trump last year). So can Cabinet ministers and heads of state (Japan\u2019s former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe nominated Trump for the 2019 prize). And university professors. And retired university professors. And someone serving on the board of directors of an organization that once won the prize. And anyone who advised the Nobel Committee in the past.",
      "Since Trump ran his first winning presidential campaign in 2016, an average of 323 people or groups a year have been nominated for the prize. That\u2019s enough to fill the rosters of six NFL teams.",
      "Earlier this week, Trump hosted British Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the White House. One topic they discussed was whether Trump would impose tariffs on Britain.",
      "If Starmer wants to ingratiate himself with Trump, there\u2019s an easy way to do it, said John Bolton, the White House national security adviser in Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "\u201cPeople say, \u2018What would you recommend Starmer do?\u2019 and I said I would recommend that he nominate Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize,\u201d Bolton said in an interview.",
      "Trump, he added, \u201cis definitely obsessed with it.\u201d",
      "A look at some previous winners suggests that Trump would be something of an anomaly if he\u2019s chosen. He\u2019s out of step with a few of the past winners.",
      "In 2012, the prize went to the European Union. At his first Cabinet meeting, held this week, Trump said he\u2019d soon be placing a 25% tariff on goods from the E.U., an institution he said was \u201cformed in order to screw the United States.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s allies say he has reason to be peeved. The last president to win the award was Barack Obama, who got it just nine months into his presidency, before he had notched any real achievements. Even Obama acknowledged in his acceptance speech that his accomplishments were \u201cslight.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think the fair question to ask is, would Barack Obama have won for helping bring an end to the war\u201d between Russia and Ukraine, Mick Mulvaney, a former Trump White House chief of staff, said in an interview. \u201cAnd I think we all know the answer to that question.\u201d",
      "The makeup of the Nobel selection committee could impede whatever chance Trump might have. Winners aren\u2019t chosen based on isolated actions. A candidate\u2019s \u201cpersonality\u201d also comes into play.",
      "\u201cI will only remind you that any candidate for any Nobel Prize must have given a contribution to the greatest benefit of humankind,\u201d Berit Reiss-Andersen, a former chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, told NBC News.",
      "The committee\u2019s new chairman, J\u00f8rgen Watne Frydnes, is also secretary-general of PEN Norway, a group whose mission includes supporting free expression and \u201cwriters at risk.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s not the career path of a MAGA enthusiast. Trump has faced criticism over his treatment of U.S. journalists on free speech grounds. One of his early actions has been to bar The Associated Press wire service from Air Force One and certain events in which only a small group of \u201cpool\u201d reporters are allowed to watch and ask questions.",
      "The punishment stems from the AP\u2019s decision to stick with the name \u201cGulf of Mexico,\u201d while noting that Trump has renamed it the \u201cGulf of America.\u201d The AP has filed suit to have its access restored.",
      "Elite recognition",
      "Why would Trump care about the prize? He rode to power as a populist who disdains the elite. Yet the Nobel Peace Prize brims with elite validation.",
      "That\u2019s the duality. Trump may be allied with the MAGA movement, but some part of him seems to pine for elite recognition. He often mentions an uncle who taught at the prestigious MIT. When Pete Hegseth struggled to win Senate confirmation, Trump vouched for him in an interview with NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d by mentioning that Hegseth had gone to Ivy League schools.",
      "But envy may play a role, as well. Obama\u2019s prize was a sore point for Trump, said Bolton and another former senior White House official from the first term.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s obsessed with the fact that Mr. Obama got it and he didn\u2019t,\u201d the ex-official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to talk freely."

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Even before the extraordinary Oval Office bust-up between President Donald Trump and Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskyy, relations between Washington and Europe were fraying dramatically.",
      "Now \u2014 after Friday\u2019s diplomatic implosion between Trump, the Ukrainian president and Vice President JD Vance \u2014 it\u2019s not clear what the way back could be for the trans-Atlantic alliance built over the past 80 years.",
      "European leaders lined up to support Zelenskyy in an effective rebuke to Trump, who told his Ukrainian counterpart he was being \u201cdisrespectful\u201d and \u201cgambling with World War III\u201d by defending his country against Russia\u2019s invasion.",
      "Zelenskyy\u2019s \u201cdignity honors the bravery of the Ukrainian people,\u201d European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen posted on X. \u201cBe strong, be brave, be fearless. You are never alone, dear President Zelenskyy. We will continue working with you for a just and lasting peace.\u201d",
      "Friedrich Merz, the likely next leader of Germany, wrote that \u201cwe must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war.\u201d While French President Emmanuel Macron said it was essential to respect the Ukrainians \u201cfighting for their dignity, their independence, for their children and for the security of Europe.\u201d",
      "Perhaps most strikingly, European Union foreign minister Kaja Kallas said, \u201cToday it became clear that the free world needs a new leader. It\u2019s up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge.\u201d",
      "Not everyone agreed of course. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban posted that during the \u201cdifficult\u201d Oval Office meeting, Trump \u201cstood bravely for peace.\u201d And other observers faulted Zelenskyy for his part in the exchange, saying he unnecessarily and publicly increased the temperature with a far more senior negotiating partner on which he relies.",
      "But for Zelenskyy\u2019s supporters, these European figures so passionately defend Ukraine because they see it as far more than an internecine conflict raging in the frigid fields of Eastern Europe.",
      "Putin\u2019s invasion is part of a far larger hybrid war, they say, from the Ukrainian battlefield to cyberattacks on Western democracy. They fear that giving the Kremlin a symbolic win in Ukraine may only embolden Russia to expand this assault elsewhere. Doubly so when they accuse Trump of undermining the alliance by barracking its allies and cozying up to Putin, widely reviled in Europe as a war criminal.",
      "This strength of feeling explains why trans-Atlantic relations were splintering before Friday\u2019s undiplomatic scenes. In fact, for the past few weeks, there have been increasing signs that European powers have finally decided to break free from their postwar dependence on the U.S.",
      "\u201cMy absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the U.S.,\u201d said Merz after his center-right Christian Democratic Union party won the German election Sunday. He questioned whether NATO\u2019s June summit would still see the alliance \u201cin its current form or whether we will have to establish an independent European defense capability much more quickly.\u201d",
      "It was a jaw-dropping statement from a conservative Americanophile, signaling not just a willingness to spend more on defense, a common Trump demand, but a desire to go it alone.",
      "\u201cI never thought I would have to say such a thing on a television program,\u201d he said.",
      "There are myriad uncertainties about how all this might work. Would Europe\u2019s newfound military independence mean spending parity with the U.S. within NATO? Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, for example, say they have no desire to reduce their cooperation with Washington. Or would American involvement on the continent diminish or even vanish altogether?",
      "Either way, the scale of the challenge is vast. The U.S. military is so deeply ingrained in Europe that its removal would leave \u201chuge holes\u201d in air defense, military satellites and cyberspace, said Sven Biscop, a director at the Egmont Institute, a think tank in Brussels.",
      "Since World War II, the U.S. has agreed to protect Europe\u2019s declining militaries against Russia on the understanding that in return it has been able to spread hard and soft American power through the continent and beyond. Unpicking this symbiosis will take hundreds of billions of dollars, likely footed by European taxpayers already embroiled in a cost-of-living crisis and cuts to public services.",
      "The combined E.U. defense budget of last year, $457 billion, was dwarfed by that of the U.S., $968 billion. Russia\u2019s total, $462 billion, was also larger, despite its far smaller economy, having retooled its entire economy on a war footing since invading Ukraine three years ago.",
      "It will take \u201cfive years as a minimum\u201d for Europe to \u201cfully deter Russia without any U.S. contribution,\u201d said Luigi Scazzieri, assistant director at the Centre for European Reform, a London think tank. \u201cYou can probably get something that fills a large part of the gap in two to three years \u2014 but only with a lot of urgency.\u201d",
      "Regardless of those practical mountains, Merz\u2019s comments showed an \u201cunderstanding that we are in a new era of trans-Atlantic relations,\u201d said Sophia Besch, a senior Europe fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington think tank.",
      "The Trump administration \u201cno longer acknowledges shared community of values, shared interests, and puts forward a very \u2018great power competition\u2019 view of the world, where Europe is a side player and Russia is an equal,\u201d Besch said.",
      "The German leader-apparent is far from alone. He has a fellow traveler in Macron, who for years has argued Europe needs to end its reliance on Washington. \u201cWe are experiencing a historic moment,\u201d he said Monday in response to Merz\u2019s overtures. \u201cIt can lead to an unprecedented Franco-German agreement.\u201d",
      "Biscop believes that these leaders need to form something akin to a European \u201cwar Cabinet\u201d around which to organize this newfound autonomy. Joining them, he believes, should be Britain\u2019s Starmer, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and the E.U.\u2019s von der Leyen.",
      "\u201cThey need agility and they need to move fast,\u201d he said. \u201cEven faster on Ukraine \u2014 because the Americans and Russians are already negotiating.\u201d"

      "The Trump administration\u2019s cancellation of $60 billion in U.S. Agency for International Development contracts is already unraveling significant programs and caused profound harm to many of the world\u2019s most vulnerable people, humanitarian officials tell NBC News.",
      "The pace of change has jumped since Wednesday, when the White House unveiled plans to cut more than 90% of contracts held by USAID, which has been the world\u2019s largest single aid provider for decades. In January, an official freeze on foreign aid was cast as part of a temporary review.",
      "The recently announced cuts essentially eliminate most U.S. development and humanitarian help abroad and come amid the dramatic contraction of government spending carried out under the aegis of Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency. President Donald Trump and Musk allege that USAID promotes a liberal agenda and wastes money.",
      "Some of the programs at risk support drought-prone populations in Africa, school feeding programs in West Africa, outreach to youth at risk of recruitment to extremist organizations like the Islamic State group, and public health efforts focused on HIV/AIDS, according to multiple officials familiar with the cuts.",
      "Several representatives for nongovernmental organizations that have been affected by the USAID cuts requested anonymity to speak to NBC News while they determined how to best work with the Trump administration and dealt with the devastating directive. One spokesperson said they were afraid they could lose funding for the few remaining programs that weren\u2019t hit by Wednesday\u2019s cuts while another hoped the administration would reconsider the cuts altogether.",
      "UNAIDS, the joint United Nations program responding to HIV/AIDS globally, on Friday said it had received a letter from the administration terminating funding with immediate effect. The U.S. has been the leading contributor through the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, known at PEPFAR, which has been credited with saving more than 26 million lives in 55 countries since its creation in 2003, according to UNAIDS.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. funding cuts are dismantling the system,\u201d International AIDS Society President Beatriz Grinsztejn said in a statement to NBC News. \u201cHIV treatment is crumbling. TB services are collapsing. No data means no tracking of who\u2019s in care. No counsellors, no HIV testing \u2014 even in hospitals. No outreach means people fall through the cracks. Services for the most vulnerable people, including mobile clinics and drop-in centres, are shut down. Lives are on the line.\u201d",
      "Organizations combating gender-based violence are also feeling immediate impact. The International Rescue Committee, which supports civilians impacted by humanitarian crises around the world, including by providing medical care, counseling and legal assistance to thousands in war-torn Sudan, has been forced to shut down some of its operations, according to its president.",
      "\u201cHumanitarian services and lifesaving assistance in Sudan, the world\u2019s world humanitarian crisis on record, have been shut down. The programs affected include services for children with acute malnutrition, putting them at risk,\u201d said IRC President and CEO David Miliband said in a statement shared with NBC News.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Peter Marocco, the deputy administrator-designate at USAID, \u201chave determined your award is not aligned with Agency priorities and made a determination that continuing this program is not in the national interest,\u201d according to a copy of a termination notice obtained by NBC News that was sent to companies with USAID contracts Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThere seems to be no pattern to it\u201d other than shutting down U.S. foreign aid, one humanitarian official said.",
      "USAID provided assistance to around 130 countries in fiscal year 2023. The top 10 recipients of aid in that year were Ukraine, Ethiopia, Jordan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, Yemen, Afghanistan, Nigeria, South Sudan and Syria.",
      "A spokesperson for the United Nations International Organization for Migration told NBC News that the cuts directly affect the organization\u2019s \u201cability to support some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable people.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration is fighting two lawsuits challenging the dissolution of USAID and the subsequent freeze on foreign aid. One of those suits has reached the Supreme Court, with the court on Wednesday temporarily pausing a lower court order that required the administration to release frozen foreign aid funding by midnight Wednesday.",
      "There will likely be more lawsuits against the administration as a result of the termination notices, with organizations on the hook for work that\u2019s already been done, and potentially costs to wind down these programs, while the USAID payment system remains shut down.",
      "DAI, a USAID-funded international development organization that says it works in 160 countries, received termination notices for more than 90% of its contracts.",
      "As a result, the group has been forced to furlough 500 employees, according to spokesman Steven O\u2019Connor. Not only that, the government still owes DAI for work already delivered, he said.",
      "\u201cWe prefinance all that work, then we invoice the government for reimbursement; without that reimbursement, we can\u2019t pay our staff, our partners, our vendors, our creditors,\u201d he said.",
      "In the meantime, the effects are already being felt in communities that rely on that assistance for emergency relief, with trust potentially eroding between those communities and USAID and its partner organizations.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be really hard to drive this truck in reverse, because they\u2019ve washed out the road behind us,\u201d a humanitarian official said."
