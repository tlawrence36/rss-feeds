      "An arbitrator upheld five-year suspensions of the chief executives of Bad Bunny\u2019s sports representation firm for making improper inducements to players and cut the ban of the company\u2019s only certified baseball agent to three years",
      "NEW YORK -- An arbitrator upheld five-year suspensions of the chief executives of Bad Bunny\u2019s sports representation firm for making improper inducements to players and cut the ban of the company's only certified baseball agent to three years.",
      "Ruth M. Moscovitch issued the ruling Oct. 30 in a case involving Noah Assad, Jonathan Miranda and William Arroyo of Rimas Sports. The decision became become public Tuesday when the Major League Baseball Players Association filed a petition to confirm the 80-page decision in New York Supreme Court in Manhattan.",
      "The union issued a notice of discipline on April 10 revoking Arroyo's agent certification and denying certification to Assad and Miranda, citing a $200,000 interest-free loan and a $19,500 gift. It barred them from reapplying for five years and prohibited certified agents from associating with any of the three or their affiliated companies. Assad, Miranda and Arroyo then appealed the decision, and Moscovitch was jointly appointed as the arbitrator on June 17.",
      "Moscovitch said the union presented unchallenged evidence of \u201cuse of non-certified personnel to talk with and recruit players; use of uncertified staff to negotiate terms of players\u2019 employment; giving things of value \u2014 concert tickets, gifts, money \u2014 to non-client players; providing loans, money, or other things of value to non-clients as inducements; providing or facilitating loans without seeking prior approval or reporting the loans.\u201d",
      "\u201cI find MLBPA has met its burden to prove the alleged violations of regulations with substantial evidence on the record as a whole,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThere can be no doubt that these are serious violations, both in the number of violations and the range of misconduct. As MLBPA executive director Anthony Clark testified, he has never seen so many violations of so many different regulations over a significant period of time.\u201d",
      "Mar\u00eda de Lourdes Mart\u00ednez, a spokeswoman for Rimas Sports, said the company declined to comment. Arroyo did not respond to a text message seeking comment.",
      "Moscovitch held four in-person hearings from Sept. 30 to Oct. 7 and three on video from Oct. 10-16.",
      "\u201cWhile these kinds of gifts are standard in the entertainment business, under the MLBPA regulations, agents and agencies simply are not permitted to give them to non-clients,\u201d she said.",
      "Arroyo's clients included Mets catcher Francisco Alvarez and teammate Ronny Mauricio.",
      "\u201cWhile it is true, as MLBPA alleges, that Mr. Arroyo violated the rules by not supervising uncertified personnel as they recruited players, he was put in that position by his employers,\u201d Moscovitch wrote. \u201cThe regulations hold him vicariously liable for the actions of uncertified personnel at the agency. The reality is that he was put in an impossible position: the regulations impose on him supervisory authority over all of the uncertified operatives at Rimas, but in reality, he was their underling, with no authority over anyone.\u201d",
      "In its petition to the court, the MLBPA asked the court to confirm Moscovitch's decision and to order the three individuals to pay the union $400,000, the amount they were fined by the union, plus interest dating from Moscovitch's decision.",

Because of the outstanding warrant, Nelly was arrested and searched. That's when the officer allegedly found four ecstasy pills. Police had sought a charge of felony possession of a controlled substance.",

      "The \u201cAmano Corpus Animae\u201d exhibition celebrates Amano as a transversal artist whose Japanese style has been infused with Western influences, from the Italian Renaissance to Marvel superheroes and Pop Art.",
      "Curator Fabio Viola said the exhibition aims to give the 72-year-old Amano \u201can artistic dignity\u201d with his first major European show.",
      "Amano's prolific career across media \u2014 from his start as an animator at the Tatsunoko studio at age 15 to recent work including posters celebrating Puccini\u2019s centenary \u2014 reflects his notion that an artist is someone with many talents.",
      "\"From what I see in Renaissance artists such as Michelangelo, artists cover everything. They did sculptures, costume designs and, of course, paintings,\u201d Amano said during a press preview on Tuesday.",

      "Striking out on his own in the 1980s, Amano illustrated such science fantasy classics as the Vampire Hunter D novel series and made his mark in the video game arena with the Final Fantasy franchise.",
      "The exhibition also includes more recent, and perhaps lesser-known, works: an illustration of a model for the January 2020 issue of Vogue Italia, its only cover ever not to feature a live model; an album cover for David Bowie featuring the artist and his wife, Iman; and the Candy Girl series of Pop Art and manga-inspired paintings on aluminum.",
      "\u201cThere were people who grew up with my works in real time. Those from the 1970s, I think, will appreciate my animation. Video games for the next generation, while the art can be recognized by two or three generations,\u2019\u2019 Amano said.",
      "Viola selected the 137 original works on display from Amano\u2019s vast archive of more than 10,000 drawings, paintings and other works stored in three warehouses in Tokyo. Amano does not sell any work that has not been specifically commissioned, Viola said, and he had not seen many pieces since storing them decades ago.",
      "\u201cEvery fan would immediately recognize his style,\u201d Viola said. \u201cTrue, it is full of influences. Whoever has a little background in art history would find art nouveau, Klimt, bites of Renaissance, or the Ukiyo-e and the traditional Japanese art prints techniques. But all of this is revisited in a way that Amano\u2019s woman is clearly Amano\u2019s woman.\"",
      "Trademarks include the lightly drawn eyebrows, smears of color and the brush strokes of acrylic paint, Viola said.",
      "The retrospective was organized by Lucca Comics with the city of Milan and runs through March 1 at the Fabbrica del Vapore."

      "Richie Owens \u2014 Parton's cousin, who she describes as \u201cthe family historian\u201d \u2014 produced \u201cSmoky Mountain DNA.\" He says that the family has long been archivists, but the idea to curate a record started around 2010 and 2011, delayed by a few deaths. Then, right before the pandemic, Parton approached Owens and said, \u201cwe need to get together and start trying to get all this information (and) material together,\u201d he recalls. Because Owens had already been working on a family story, specifically tied to his grandfather's fiddle, they teamed up for what is now \u201cSmoky Mountain DNA.\u201d",
      "For some of the new songs, Owens utilized digital technology \u2014 what he compares to the AI-assist on the last new Beatles song, \u201cNow and Then,\u201d used to extract John Lennon\u2019s voice from an old demo for a new composition \u2014 for \u201crestoration work.\u201d",
      "\u201cWith the technology that\u2019s been available, we were able to achieve wonderful, miraculous situations where we were able to go in and build new music tracks\" from previous vocal recordings of deceased family members, he says. It was about cleaning up the crackles and noise \u2014 not about creating doctored recordings.",
      "\u201cI got very, very emotional many times when I was singing, especially with the ones that have already passed and just remembering their voices, hearing them,\" Parton says. \"It just kind of threw me in to a deep emotional place, just like I had them back again. So, the whole thing was very heart wrenching. But it was really amazing and very restoring. It had so many colors of emotions in it.\u201d",
      "Parton and Owens started curating the album by finding songs that she had co-written with deceased family members \u2014 or those of deceased family members that she had recorded previously. Others were hits and integral to the story of their heritage, and the songs recorded with younger members of the family \u2014 including those born in the 21st century \u2014 included more Parton co-writes, but with styles that felt true to each person.",
      "That's one of the many reasons the album, which is centered in country, folk, hymns and bluegrass, spans a wide swath of genres, including a kind of soulful R&B performance (like on \"Not Bad\" with Shelley Ren\u00e1), swamp pop (\"I Just Stopped By\" with Parton's late uncle Robert \u201cJohn Henry\u201d Owens), various rock genres (\u201cWhere Will We Live Tomorrow\u201d with Rebecca Seaver and \u201cCrazy in Love with You\" with Richie Owens' daughter Estelle).",
      "The album revisits Parton's own career, too: There is a delightful cover of \u201cPuppy Love,\u201d originally recorded when she was 13, now sang with some of the youngest members of her family.",
      "\u201cSome of the little ones,\u201d she says, \u201cremind me so much of myself when I was young and playing the guitar.\u201d",
      "\u201cSmoky Mountain DNA\u201d could only end with one song: \u201cWhen It's Family,\u201d originally co-written by Parton and released as \u201cFamily\u201d on her 1991 album \u201cEagle When She Flies.\u201d It's a moving song about acceptance, Parton singing: \u201cSome are preachers, some are gay / Some are addicts, drunks and strays / But not a one is turned away / When it\u2019s family.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t condemn nor condone anything. I just love and accept people where they are for who they are,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t judge because I\u2019ve said before, I\u2019ve got some of everybody in my immediate family, whether they be trans, whether they be gay, whether they be drag queens or whatever. I mean, we\u2019ve got drunks, we\u2019ve got strays, we've got drug addicts \u2014 you always have that when you got a family as big as ours. And you love them all.\u201d",
      "So, what about all the material that isn't included here? \u201cI'm sure we'll be doing compilation albums,\u201d says Parton. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a docuseries as well, taking all the music back to the old country with a lot of our relatives over there that are still singing all those old songs that got brought over here... It's really moving.\"",
      "In the meantime, she's working on a musical based on her life, scheduled to hit Broadway in 2026. It, like \u201cSmoky Mountain DNA,\u201d is an opportunity to reflect on her career, and maybe even what her legacy will become five more generations down the line.",
      "\u201cI hope that a lot of my songs may last that long,\" she says. \u201cAnd I hope I\u2019ll be remembered as somebody that tried to do some good in the world and left, you know, a few good things.\u201d"

      "COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Artifacts and human remains taken by a Norwegian explorer and anthropologist in the late 1940s are being returned by a museum in Oslo to Chile\u2019s remote territory of Easter Island in the mid-Pacific, the Kon-Tiki Museum said Wednesday.",
      "In 1947, explorer Thor Heyerdahl sailed on a log raft named Kon-Tiki from Peru to Polynesia in 101 days to prove his theory \u2014 that the South Sea Islands were settled by seafarers from South America.",
      "He brought 5,600 objects back from Easter Island, also known as Rapa Nui. This is the third time objects taken by him are being returned.",
      "Many have been stored and displayed at the Kon-Tiki Museum in Oslo, Norway's capital, and some were given back in 1986 and others 2006. The return has been a collaboration between the museum, Chile and Rapa Nui's local authorities.",
      "\"My grandfather would have been proud of what we are about to achieve,\u201d said Liv Heyerdahl, head of the museum and the explorer's granddaughter.",
      "She told the Norwegian news agency NTB that the objects were brought to Norway \"with a promise that they would one day be returned.\u201d",
      "Among those that are being returned this time around are human remains called Ivi Tepuna and sculpted stones.",
      "A nine-person delegation had traveled to Norway this week to collect the items. Four of them spent the night at the Oslo museum, alongside the remains as part of a ritual ceremony to take back the spirits of the remains.",
      "\u201cFirst one must awaken the spirits, and then speak to them in our original language. Food is then prepared to eat a meal with them, where the smell of the food goes to the spirits,\u201d a member of the delegation, Laura Tarita Rapu Alarc\u00f3n, told NTB.",
      "\u201cIt is important that those who own the culture are involved in the process,\" Liv Heyerdahl was quoted as saying by NTB. \"Of course these remains should be returned, and it feels right because they belong to the Rapa Nui.\u201d",
      "In 2019, an agreement was signed in Santiago, Chile, during a visit by Norway's King Harald. However, the COVID-19 pandemic stopped all activities in 2020, the museum said. Harald met with the Rapa Nui delegation on Tuesday.",
      "A book about Thor Heyerdahl's voyage \u2014 he died in 2002 at the age of 87 \u2014 has become an international bestseller, and his film of the journey won an Academy Award for best documentary in 1951.",
      "Rapa Nui is best known for the hundreds of moai \u2014 monolithic human figures carved centuries ago by this remote Pacific island\u2019s Rapanui people.",
      "Covering about 164 square kilometers (63 square miles) and home to about 7,700 people, half of them with Rapa Nui ancestry, Easter Island was formed at least 750,000 years ago by volcanic eruptions and is one of the world\u2019s most isolated inhabited islands.",
      "Located 3,700 kilometers (2,300 miles) from South America, Rapa Nui was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995. In 2019, it was officially renamed \u201cRapa Nui-Easter Island\u201d from its previous name of just Easter Island."

      "Rustioni agreed to a three-year term, the company announced Wednesday.

      "\u201cI dared to try tempos in this repertoire that they know very well,\u201d Rustioni said of the orchestra. \u201cI offered and tried to convince them in some places to try to find more intimacy and to offer the music with a little bit more breathing here and there, maybe in a different space than they are used to,\u201d",
      "Valery Gergiev was the Met\u2019s principal guest conductor from 1997-98 through 2008-09, leading Russian works for about half of his performances.

      "The rhythms of bustling, working-class Mumbai are brought to vivid life in \u201cAll We Imagine as Light.\u201d",
      "The rhythms of bustling, working-class Mumbai are brought to vivid life in \u201cAll We Imagine as Light.\u201d The stunning narrative debut of filmmaker Payal Kapadia explores the lives of three women in the city whose existence is mostly transit and work. Even that isn\u2019t always enough to get by and pay the rent. One of the women, a widow, recently retired from working her whole life at a city hospital, Parvaty (Chhaya Kadam), is even facing eviction.",
      "The other two, roommates and co-workers in the maternity ward are in different parts of life. Prabha (Kani Kusruti) has a husband from an arranged marriage who she doesn\u2019t see and rarely speaks to. His life, we learn, is in Germany. She gets an occasional, ominous physical reminder of his existence in objects, like a fancy rice maker, that arrives one day. But she carries the weight of her arrangement everywhere, an invisible anchor on her being.",
      "Anu (Divya Prabha) is even younger, trying to figure out what her life is going to look like and already in something of an impossible situation: She\u2019s fallen in love with Shiz (Hridhu Haroon), who is Muslim. She\u2019s Hindu. But in a city of over 20 million, a secret relationship can have some room to grow. Yes, they\u2019re hiding this from their families, a burden in and of itself, but in the night markets with the city glimmering and moving around them, they\u2019re able to just be.",
      "Prabha is a little judgmental of her more carefree (possibly careless) younger housemate. More companions by circumstance than friends exactly, these women have different ideas about life, but we watch as they grow closer and understand one another more. Prabha even allows herself to go for a walk with a doctor who is clearly interested in her. A small act of agency and rebellion against her circumstances.",
      "These are not easy lives, either: Their apartment is drab and small, their activities mundane, their conversations ordinary. But even as hard as it is to exist in a place that not only doesn\u2019t love you back, it barely even notices you, something is always happening. How can anything be truly dull in a place always thrumming with life? Far from being a maudlin, bleak affair, Kapadia makes the banal cinematic. There is a dreamlike incandescence to it all, not a rejection of reality so much as a poetic detachment from it.",
      "And like a dream, this is a film that washes over you. The mechanisms of the plot are not really the point, we\u2019re just moving in time with Anu and Prabha. And while Anu\u2019s forbidden love and Prabha\u2019s existential longing will surely come to a head at some point in their journey, the most urgent of realities is Parvaty\u2019s unexpected housing crisis. The city is making way for more luxury high rises and pricing out the people who make everything run and work. So, they go to the sea.",
      "Anu and Prabha accompany Parvaty on her move back to her small coastal village in the final act. Suddenly it feels like everyone can breathe. It may be a little clich\u00e9, but you really feel it in your bones as an audience member.

      "The state that gave much of America the right to offer legal sports betting may decide that certain bets on college athletes are out of bounds",
      "TRENTON, N.J. -- After an unexpected loss in which he threw four interceptions in September, Auburn quarterback Payton Thorne heard from bettors angry that his subpar statistics lost bets for them. Some contacted him over the Venmo cash transfer app, asking him to refund their losses.",
      "In March, North Carolina basketball player Armando Bacot said he got over 100 direct messages on social media from angry gamblers when he did not make enough rebounds for their bets to win.",
      "Now the state whose U.S. Supreme Court victory led to an explosion of legal sports betting across America is considering banning such bets involving the statistical performance of college athletes.",
      "New Jersey argues that student athletes are more accessible and thus more vulnerable to pressure and harassment than professional players, given that they eat in the same dining halls, live in the same dorms and attend classes with many other students.",

      "A bill before the state Legislature would ban so-called proposition bets, commonly known as \u201cprops,\u201d on what a particular athlete does or doesn't do in a game. That can include how many touchdowns a quarterback throws, how many yards a running back accumulates, or how many rebounds a basketball player collects.",
      "Austin Mayo, assistant director of government relations for the NCAA, said 1 in 3 players in sports that are heavily bet on have reported receiving harassment from gamblers.",
      "The association wants such bets prohibited nationwide.

      "Pascrell said that the recent tournament success of New Jersey colleges Seton Hall and St. Peter's were bet on, either with illegal offshore internet sites, or legally by gamblers traveling to other states where it is permitted.",
      "The bill was approved and released from an Assembly committee Thursday. It still must be approved by both full chambers of the Legislature and signed by Gov. Phil Murphy to become law.",
      "New Jersey's lawsuit challenging a ban on legal sports betting in all but four U.S. states led to a 2018 Supreme Court ruling allowing any state in the nation to offer it; 38 currently do, and Missouri will soon become the 39th.",

      "Since a trip to Ethiopia in 1985 during the famine, Curtis has also devoted much of his time and energy to charitable causes: Co-founding Comic Relief, producing Red Nose Day for years and helping create organizations like Make Poverty History and more. Decades of work has helped raise more than $2 billion and supported over 170 million people.",
      "On Sunday he\u2019s being celebrated for those efforts by the film academy with the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award. Getting an Oscar is especially exciting for Curtis who remembers as a teen having to wait until the night after to watch the broadcast in the U.K.",
      "\u201cI've been excited by their existence for 50 years,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is particularly a special award, but it\u2019s not work for which one expects praise or needs praise. So it\u2019s very lovely.\u201d",
      "Curtis spoke to The Associated Press about his second career, the state of romantic comedies and Hugh Grant\u2019s second act. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "CURTIS: No, it\u2019s been one of those cascading things. I have always found that if you create a sort of venue for generosity, the public reaction is so often astonishing. When did this first TV show, we thought we\u2019d make \u00a35 million, but we made \u00a315 million. The next year we made \u00a327 million. I would have had to be a monster not to continue with it. I thought it was going to last a year. Instead, it\u2019s lasted a lifetime.",
      "CURTIS: We have a younger generation that is very passionate about issues of gender and diversity and climate. There\u2019s a more sophisticated understanding of how you solve problems and change things. A lot of it is about giving power to people on the ground. And particularly since the pandemic, it\u2019s important to go on pointing out how much difference a small amount of money can make abroad and at home.",
      "CURTIS: I don\u2019t see the things as different. What is slightly peculiar is that I have written two very serious movies, one about malaria and the other about the negotiation of a G8 (summit). But when doing my own films, I\u2019ve focused more on private romantic things and not gone all out on the stuff that I do the charity work for.",
      "CURTIS: I\u2019m a bit puzzled by it. I can\u2019t but sort of think it\u2019s almost a lucky break. I remember once bumping into Chris Rock, who I had never met, and he said to me, \u201cI like your films because they\u2019ve got man jokes in them.\u201d I think he was saying that the sentiment is repeatedly either undercut or reinforced by jokes that you don\u2019t quite expect. There must be something in that combination that makes feel people feel comfortable with the heart of it.",
      "CURTIS: I think all of these things go in waves. There are two shows on telly at the moment, \u201cNobody Wants This\u201d and \u201cColin from Accounts\u201d that I really love. \u201c(500) Days of Summer\u201d was a long time ago but I adored that. And it wasn\u2019t a comedy but \u201cThe Worst Person in the World.\u201d I think when you look back, you\u2019ll find there\u2019s a consistent stream of movies that deal with those issues, just not in quite the same format.",
      "CURTIS: Very much. With regard to Hugh now, no acting required. He was always a scoundrel. I think it\u2019s easier for him. He had to work harder in my movies when he was pretending to be nice. Now he\u2019s a self-evident psychopath. I\u2019m obviously joking but I love them. There were 10 years there where no one took any risks with Hugh. And it\u2019s lovely now that people are casting him in very different roles. I hope he does one or two movies more in line with what we used to do. He\u2019s a very interesting older man. But I\u2019m loving his current tendency to kill people.",
      "CURTIS: It has been a very schizophrenic life, in the end. It has been 50/50 for about the last 15 years. It\u2019s interesting thinking about how movies can affect change \u2014 the work of Participant and the idea that you could turn films into something with a real-world impact. I believe hugely in the ability of movies to change people\u2019s hearts and minds and attitudes. I do think that that might be worth us all thinking about is whether movies should have impact producers \u2014 a mechanism that actually tries to make the film as effective as possible in the real world. That\u2019s something that I\u2019ve started to think about in joining the two halves of my life together."

      "BLOOMINGTON, Indiana -- When composer Mason Bates approached Michael Chabon about turning his novel \u201cThe Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay\u201d into an opera, he said the writer told him frankly that \u201copera was not his thing.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was very supportive of the endeavor and he gave it his blessing, but he said he couldn\u2019t be involved,\u201d Bates recalled. \u201cHe was really more giving it a thumbs-up on a rights level.\u201d",
      "So Bates and librettist Gene Scheer proceeded on their own to wrangle into operatic form Chabon\u2019s sprawling, Pulitzer Prize-winning tale about two young Jewish cousins set over more than a decade before and after World War II.",
      "Now, six years after Bates first read the novel and became inspired by it, the opera is bound for the Metropolitan Opera, due to open the company\u2019s next season in September 2025.",
      "But first it\u2019s having its world premiere on Friday in what might seem an unlikely spot, at the Jacobs School of Music on the Indiana University campus in Bloomington. The premiere was originally planned for the Los Angeles Opera, but the company begged off, citing the costs involved.",
      "Bloomington turns out to be not such a surprising choice given that the school has nearly 300 voice students and the Musical Arts Center, built in 1972, was modeled after the Met stage.",
      "\u201cThe space and technology and those kinds of production elements were very attractive to the Met in terms of how the opera would play here,\u201d said Catherine Compton, managing director of the school\u2019s opera and ballet theater program.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been heartening to see how our students have reacted and been elevated by the Met\u2019s creative team that\u2019s been in residence here,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd also how the creative team has been able to adapt their process to our students.\u201d",
      "In fact, Met staff will be back in Bloomington in January to workshop another forthcoming commission, an opera by Carlos Simon called \u201cIn the Rush\u201d with a libretto by playwright Lynn Nottage and her daughter, Ruby Aiyo Gerber.",
      "\u201cKavalier & Clay\u201d was commissioned by the Met after Peter Gelb, the company\u2019s general manager, attended a performance of Bates\u2019 first opera, \u201cThe (R)evolution of Steve Jobs,\u201d in 2017 in Santa Fe, New Mexico.",
      "Paul Cremo, the Met\u2019s dramaturg, connected Bates with Scheer, a veteran librettist widely praised for his work in turning Herman Melville\u2019s unwieldy masterpiece \u201cMoby Dick\u201d into the text for an opera composed by Jake Heggie. The Met will perform that opera next March.",
      "\u201cI give \u2018Moby Dick\u2019 to new librettists for a model of how to get to the essence,\u201d Cremo said. \u201c\u2018Kavalier & Clay\u2019 goes down a lot of side roads into history and nooks and crannies. I figured we needed somebody who gets how to adapt and condense a book into an opera.\u201d",
      "With many of the \u201cnooks and crannies\u201d \u2014 like a 40-page detour to Antarctica \u2014 stripped away, Scheer was able to focus on the two main characters.",
      "There\u2019s Joe Kavalier, who escapes to America from Czechoslovakia on the eve of the Holocaust, dreams of bringing his younger brother to safety in America, and falls in love with Rosa, a Bohemian artist. His cousin is the Brooklyn-born Sammy Clay, who dreams of striking it rich and, ambivalent about his sexuality, has a thwarted love affair with a handsome actor.",
      "Together, using Sammy\u2019s talent for story-telling and Joe\u2019s artistic genius, the cousins invent a wildly popular comic strip character called The Escapist.",
      "Scheer and Bates identified three distinct worlds depicted in the novel, each of which lent itself to a different compositional style.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s the world of World War II, where we see the Kavalier family picked off one by one,\u201d Bates said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very dark musical space with a lot of drums and mandolins. Then the big band music of 1940s New York, a lot of swing, a lot of jazz. Then when they start to draw and they create art, we go into this electro-acoustic, techno-symphonic space.\u201d",
      "Bates said he deliberately keeps these sound worlds separate at first, but \u201cwhat becomes really exciting in the opera is that as Joe goes through kinds of a psychedelic spiral, these worlds start to collide and smash together.\u201d",
      "Keeping these worlds visually separate and then merging them posed both a challenge and an opportunity for director Bart Sher, who worked on the set design with 59 Productions, a company known for its innovative use of projections and animation.",
      "\u201cThe unique challenge to \u2018Kavalier & Clay\u2019 is the simultaneity of space and time,\u201d Sher said. \u201cYou might see them working in the office of Empire Toys and at the same time see their family struggling in Prague, and at the same time see them try to capture what the experience is like through The Escapist.",
      "\u201cAnd if you can get all three of those elements to work at the same time and have music and song \u2014 then you really have something in this piece that I think is very special.\u201d",

The lyrics are spare and reflect heartfelt \u2014 and at times earnest \u2014 realizations about pain and self-discovery. Created over seven years, the album is, as Gavin said, a testament to \u201chow much we change and stay the same\u201d over time.",
      "She\u2019s part of a new wave of musicians \u2014 including boygenius, Rene\u00e9 Rapp, and Chappell Roan \u2014 who are reimagining pop and folk-rock traditions with a queer sensibility. To celebrate the release of Gavin's album, Muna fan groups organized listening parties at lesbian bars like The Ruby Fruit in Los Angeles and Ginger\u2019s Bar in Brooklyn, New York.",
      "Gavin spoke recently with The Associated Press about finding her creative soulmates, getting in touch with her 14-year-old self and her first solo tour in the U.S., which kicks off Monday in Seattle.",
      "This interview has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "___",
      "Gavin: They\u2019re both my creative soulmates and collaborators. In some ways they helped decide the track list because the first step in the process was them rejecting songs for Muna.",
      "The process of opening myself up to new people \u2014 to work creatively \u2014 is very vulnerable.",
      "Gavin: It\u2019s a fun song. It feels young. It feels very much in the world of crush and fantasy. Which is one of my favorite kinds of pop songs to write.",
      "The solo project is, by nature, a very measured project. I\u2019m not really making these big, bold, sweeping pop statements. It\u2019s quite small and nuanced. My solo project is very \u201cif you know, you know.\u201d",
      "Gavin: It was amazing. I mean, she is a legend to me.",
      "There was a photo that she had taken \u2014 on view at Regen Projects \u2014 of a recent girlfriend in a bedroom with a bunch of stuff strewn everywhere. That photo was on every mood board and every treatment that I made for this album. It was the wallpaper on my computer. I was just like, \u201cThis is the vibe.\u201d",
      "Gavin: There are certain artists that I avoid listening to, if I notice that they really stick to me. I couldn\u2019t really write like Tori (Amos) or Fiona (Apple), even if I really tried super hard to emulate them, so I\u2019m not that worried about it. I\u2019m not a prodigious piano player, so it\u2019s going to be fine, you know what I mean?",
      "I mainly do listen to lesbians or lesbian-adjacent women from the \u201990s.",
      "Gavin: I\u2019m really excited about that. Except for the part of touring in the Midwest in mid-December. There\u2019s something very poetic about the solo tour for this record putting me back in Chicago in the winter. Really brutal. We\u2019re doing it in a van, and I haven\u2019t been back in a van, you know, in a minute.",
      "Gavin: I just saw a childhood friend this weekend and he gave me the nicest compliment. He was just like, \u201cI know that if we showed this to you when you were 14, you would have thought it was the coolest record.\u201d",
      "I would love for queer people and girls at that age to find something in this record and to attach to it. The music that I listened to when I was 14 and 15 is so important to me. Those are my comfort records.",
      "Gavin: Sometimes you have to disappoint people who want the creative direction to go a certain way ... But if you know in your heart that your vision is different, then you have to follow your vision.",
      "Being an artist does require a lot of sacrifice. Like, I don\u2019t have the same stability in my personal life and domestic life because of my job. But I wouldn\u2019t want to do anything else."

But on this morning, she\u2019s feeling contemplative.",
      "\u201cI woke up with such a philosophical streak,\u201d Gasc\u00f3n says, smiling. \u201cIn life, everything can be good or bad. We are a mix of so many things. There are things that make you happy and instead they make you sad, or the other way around.\u201d",
      "The dichotomies of life are a fitting subject for Jacques Audiard\u2019s \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d a film that puts just about every genre \u2014 musical, crime thriller, melodrama \u2014 into a grandiose mixer, and, by sheer nerve, manages to coalesce into one of the year\u2019s most memorable movie experiences. \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d which began streaming Wednesday on Netflix, is widely expected to be a best picture nominee.",
      "At the center of the \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d phenomenon \u2013 which began with a barn-storming premiere at the Cannes Film Festival \u2014 is Gasc\u00f3n who plays both the menacing cartel kingpin Manitas and the woman who emerges after Manitas fakes his own death, Emilia P\u00e9rez. Years later, Emilia contacts the lawyer who facilitated her transition (Zoe Salda\u00f1a) to her reunite with her wife (Selena Gomez) and their children.",
      "The wild swings of \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d \u2013 a movie that has earned comparisons to both \u201cSicario\u201d and \u201cMrs. Doubtfire\u201d \u2013 wouldn\u2019t be possible without Gasc\u00f3n. In Cannes, she and her co-stars shared in the best actress prize, which Gasc\u00f3n accepted.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been insulted, denigrated, subjected to a lot of violence without even knowing why,\u201d Gasc\u00f3n said that evening. \u201cI think this is award is so much more than anyone could imagine.\u201d",
      "Now, Gasc\u00f3n is widely forecast to be nominated for best actress at the Academy Awards. At a time when trans rights in the U.S. are the subject of intense political debate, Gasc\u00f3n is on the cusp of making trans history. (Only cisgender actors have previously been Oscar nominated for playing trans roles.) But, when Gasc\u00f3n sat down for an interview a few hours before the premiere of \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d at the Toronto International Film Festival in September, she was more inclined to gently muse about what might be in store for her.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a little like Nostradamus. I like to think about what can happen. But at the end of the day, it doesn\u2019t really matter,\u201d Gasc\u00f3n says. \u201cIf it does happen, I would be so grateful. It would be a beautiful thing. But if it doesn\u2019t, whatever. I\u2019d go back to my old life. I\u2019ll do my grocery shopping. I\u2019ll play with cats. I\u2019ll see my family. Maybe I\u2019ll do other jobs and people will like those jobs.",
      "\u201cI like to go lightly in my life,\u201d she adds, smiling.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n, 52, is Spanish and lives in Mexico. She spoke through an interpreter but understands English enough to sometimes giggle and shake her head at her own words while they're being translated. She was a regular in Mexican telenovels before transitioning in 2018.",
      "\u201cAll people that live in a body that they don\u2019t feel matches who they truly are do suffer one way or the other. But in my case, I feel like I handled it quite well,\u201d Gasc\u00f3n says. \u201cI always tried to be happy with the life I had, even before my transition. Maybe I chose to do this job as an actor because I wasn\u2019t quite happy with my life with the way I was before, so I wanted to experiment with other lives.\u201d",
      "Playing Emilia P\u00e9rez was in many ways a giant leap for Gasc\u00f3n. She had to change her voice (she uses a Mexican accent in the film), work on singing and movement, and change her posture. But there were also things Gasc\u00f3n shared with her character. Gasc\u00f3n has a 13-year-old daughter from a marriage pre-transition with whom she remains close.",
      "\u201cWe all find it hard to accept the loss of the people we love. You constantly try to get back your loved ones,\u201d Gasc\u00f3n says. \u201cThat\u2019s what I tried to implement in the character. This is what does unite me with the character \u2014 doing everything possible to get back the people you love. It\u2019s been a constant in my life. And sometimes it\u2019s impossible.\u201d",
      "Audiard, the protean French filmmaker, has long specialized in films of transformation and metamorphosis, including \u201cA Prophet,\u201d \u201cDheepan\u201d and \u201cRust and Bone.\u201d He initially balked, though, at having Gasc\u00f3n play Manitas as well as Emilia. For Gasc\u00f3n, it would mean returning to a male persona, something Audiard hesitated to ask of her. But Gasc\u00f3n insisted. To her, the only kind of character she doesn\u2019t want to play is a boring one.",
      "\u201cIf I was asked to play Abraham Lincoln tomorrow, I\u2019d love it. Bring it on! For me, the farther the character is from me in real life, the better,\u201d Gasc\u00f3n says.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve met actresses who had a hard time stepping back and going through stuff that was part of their past. They would cry and take it badly. Never for me.\u201d",
      "In conversation, Gasc\u00f3n seems still tickled by the whole experience. She\u2019s delighted that many people don\u2019t realize Manitas is played by her. She laughs at how a movie about a violent drug lord, someone who\u2019d normally be a villain, should inspire so much empathy. And for someone with a very big spotlight on her, she seems remarkably at peace.",
      "\u201cIf I were asked to do my life over again, I\u2019d probably do it exactly as it was, with all of it,\u201d Gasc\u00f3n says. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful that one gets to experience with these two poles, these two extremes. In a way, it\u2019d be wonderful if all of us had access to this. Having done that allowed to me to better understand so many things that weren\u2019t so clear to me before. In the end, what I realized is that we\u2019re all the same.\u201d"

      "Doctors say requests for permanent sterilizations and long-term birth control like IUDs have surged across the nation since Donald Trump was elected president last week",
      "Hours after Donald Trump was elected president for the second time, Dr. Clayton Alfonso had two messages from patients seeking to replace their IUDs. Over the next few days, three women inquired about getting their tubes tied.",
      "All of them said the election was the reason they were making these choices now.",
      "Requests for long-term birth control and permanent sterilizations have surged across the nation since the election, doctors told The Associated Press. And companies that sell emergency contraception and abortion pills say they're seeing significant spikes in requests from people who are stockpiling the medications \u2014 one saw a 966% increase in sales of emergency contraception from the week before in the 60 hours after the election.",
      "\u201cI saw this bump after the Trump election in 2016\" and after Roe vs. Wade was overturned in 2022, said Alfonso, an OB-GYN at Duke University in North Carolina. \u201cBut the patients seem more afraid this time.\u201d",
      "Although anti-abortion advocates are pressing Trump for more restrictions on abortion pills, it's unclear what \u2014 if much \u2014 will be done regarding access to contraceptives of any kind during the second Trump administration. Trump told a Pittsburgh television station in May that he was open to supporting regulations on contraception. But after media reports on the interview, he wrote on his social media platform Truth Social that he \u201chas never and will never\u201d advocate for restricting birth control and other contraceptives.",
      "Alfonso said his patients want to replace still-effective IUDs and \u201crestart\u201d the 3-to-12-year clock on them before the inauguration. He also said the women are particularly concerned about IUDs, which have been attacked by abortion opponents who believe life begins when an egg is fertilized. Experts believe the devices work mostly by blocking fertilization, but also may make it harder for a fertilized egg to implant in the womb.",
      "A patient who requested a tubal ligation Tuesday told Alfonso she doesn\u2019t want kids and is \u201cjust absolutely terrified of either forced pregnancy or inability to access contraception.\"",
      "Pittsburgh OB-GYN and abortion provider Dr. Grace Ferguson said more of her patients are scheduling IUD insertions or stockpiling emergency contraception, telling her upfront that it\u2019s \u201cbecause of the upcoming administration change.\u201d",
      "One patient, Mara Zupko, said she wants prescription emergency contraception since she\u2019s on the cusp of the weight limit for Plan B, the most well-known over-the-counter type. Her husband is getting a vasectomy.",
      "\u201cWe always kind of teetered on whether we wanted children or not,\u201d said Zupko, 27. \u201dBut as the world has become scarier and scarier, we realized we didn\u2019t want to bring a child into that environment. And I also have several health risks.\u201d",
      "Women are also turning to companies that sell emergency contraception online or offer abortion pills mifepristone and misoprostol through telehealth \u2014 something that's been happening even before the election, but that some companies say has accelerated.",
      "A study earlier this year showed the abortion pill supplier Aid Access received about 48,400 requests from across the U.S. for so-called \u201cadvance provision\u201d pills from September 2021 through April 2023 \u2014 with requests highest right after news leaked about Roe being overturned but before the formal announcement. Other research found that more women had their tubes tied post-Roe, with the biggest increases in states that ban abortion.",
      "Mifepristone has a shelf life of about five years and misoprostol around two years, according to Plan C, an organization that provides information about medical abortions. Plan B typically has a shelf life of four years.",
      "Telehealth company Wisp saw orders for abortion pills spike 600% between Election Day and the following day. And between Nov. 6 and 11, the company saw a 460% increase in sales of its emergency contraception and birth control offerings.",
      "At Gen Z-focused Winx Health, which sells emergency contraception called Restart, company leaders saw a 966% increase in sales in the 60 hours following the election compared with the week before. Sales of \u201cvalue packs\u201d of Restart \u2014 four doses instead of one \u2014 were up more than 7,000% in the past week.",
      "\"Morning after pills\u201d are legal in all states, but Winx co-founder Cynthia Plotch said many people seem confused about what emergency contraception is compared to abortion pills. In a 2023 poll by the health policy research organization KFF, a majority of responders said they know these two things aren't the same, but only 27% reported knowing emergency contraceptive pills cannot end a pregnancy.",
      "Doctors agree confusion around morning after pills may explain some of the stockpiling. But Alfonso at Duke suspects most people are doing this for the same reason they are seeking longer-term methods of birth control: to avoid abortion by preventing pregnancy in the first place.",
      "Alfonso predicts the birth control and abortion pill surge may level out like it did in 2016 and 2022. If the new administration \u201cis not focused on health care right away,\" he said, \"then I think it\u2019ll go to the back of people\u2019s minds until it picks up in the media.\u201d",

      "Seven-year-old Halima Abou Yassine was brought to Lebanon from Gaza for treatment after an Israeli strike left her near death with a gaping wound in her skull",
      "BEIRUT -- When Zarifa Nawfal\u2019s family arrived in Beirut for her wounded daughter\u2019s surgery, one of the first things she wanted to do was go to the sea. The Mediterranean had been a constant companion at their home in Gaza before the war.",
      "\u201cThe moment I smelled the sea, I felt at peace inside \u2014 as if I were in Gaza,\u201d she said.",
      "But soon their place of refuge reminded her of home in far more distressing ways.",
      "Nawfal\u2019s 7-year-old daughter, Halima Abou Yassine, is one of a dozen severely wounded Palestinian children brought to Lebanon this year for treatment through a program launched by a British-Palestinian surgeon, Dr. Ghassan Abu Sitta.",
      "But months after their arrival, Lebanon is itself embroiled in a war some fear will end in Gaza-like destruction.",
      "In February, Nawfal was staying with her five children and her mother in an apartment in central Gaza. They had been displaced from their home in the north and Nawfal\u2019s husband was missing, likely dead.",
      "The children were filling water containers outside when two missiles struck, Nawfal said. She rushed outside and found Halima, the youngest, lying in the street, her skull cracked open, her brain exposed.",
      "Through her shock, Nawfal said, \u201cI was relieved that her body was in one piece.\u201d In Gaza, blasts often ripped people apart, leaving their loved ones without even a body to bury.",
      "Halima\u2019s brother was unconscious next to her. He was quickly revived at the hospital. But staff at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital confirmed Nawfal\u2019s fears, she said: Halima was dead. Her small body was placed in the morgue.",
      "But as the family was preparing to bury her, the little girl\u2019s uncle noticed faint signs of life, the family said.",
      "Officials at Al-Aqsa hospital could not be reached to confirm the account. But Abu Sitta, who has worked in several Gaza hospitals during the war, said in the chaotic situation it was not uncommon for patients to be misidentified as dead because normal protocols for emergency room examinations were often abandoned.",
      "\u201cBecause of the sheer number of cases that would come in with each air raid ... the ambulance staff would take to the morgue immediately those who they thought were dead,\" he said.",
      "In the days after her daughter was determined to be alive, Nawfal stayed with her, manually pumping oxygen into her lungs. After a week, the little girl began to breathe on her own. Finally, she woke up.",
      "\u201cSome of the doctors cried and said this is a miracle,\u201d Nawfal said.",
      "But they were unable to do more than keep the little girl alive. Her skull was still gaping open, a shard of bone missing. Her brain was beset by infection.",
      "The family was evacuated to Egypt in May. In July, they boarded a plane for Lebanon.",
      "The first of the wounded Palestinian children arrived in Lebanon in May. Five-year-old Adam Afana had nearly lost his left arm in a blast that killed his father and sister. His arm was paralyzed and he needed a complex surgery to correct the nerve damage.",
      "At the time, Lebanon was already embroiled in a low-simmering conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.",
      "The Lebanese militant group began firing rockets across the border into Israel in support of its ally, Hamas, on Oct. 8, 2023, a day after Palestinian militants staged the deadly surprise incursion into southern Israel that sparked the ongoing war in Gaza. Israel responded with shelling and airstrikes.",
      "For months, the conflict in Lebanon was mainly confined to the border area, far from Beirut.",
      "Abu Sitta said he chose Lebanon for the wounded children's treatment because the Mediterranean country has specialists with wide experience treating war injuries.",
      "Lebanon has been through its share of conflicts, including a 15-year civil war that ended in 1990 and a brutal monthlong war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, as well as spillover effects from other regional conflicts.",
      "\u201cEven after the end of the wars (in Lebanon), the wounded from Iraq and Syria would come here for that kind of complex and multistage treatment,\u201d Abu Sitta said.",
      "In July, Halima underwent successful surgery to repair her skull at the American University of Beirut Medical Center.",
      "Nawfal said her daughter has lingering memory problems but is improving with therapy. A chipper, happy-go-lucky child, Halima thrived in Beirut. She swam in the hotel pool, loved to color and played with the other children from Gaza. She walked with her siblings to pick out fruit at the neighborhood produce stand, a straw hat covering the scar on the back of her head.",
      "In mid-September, Israel launched an offensive against Hezbollah. It pummeled wide swathes of Lebanon with airstrikes, including Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs and some sites within the city center.",
      "The children quickly snapped back into wartime habits. They cracked open the balcony's sliding glass doors to prevent the glass shattering from the pressure of a blast and began sleeping in the central sitting room in the family\u2019s hotel suite, away from windows.",
      "Nawfal said some organizations offered to evacuate the family from Lebanon to continue treatment elsewhere, but she \u201ccompletely refused.\u201d",

      "Adam Afana's uncle, Eid Afana, said the escalation in Lebanon \u201creminds us of the beginning of the war in Gaza.\u201d Afana said the sound of airstrikes frightened Adam, who felt the war was pursuing them.",

      "For the third straight year, efforts to fight climate change haven\u2019t lowered projections for how hot the world is likely to get \u2014 even as countries gather for another round of talks to curb warming, according to an analysis Thursday",
      "BAKU, Azerbaijan -- For the third straight year, efforts to fight climate change haven't lowered projections for how hot the world is likely to get \u2014 even as countries gather for another round of talks to curb warming, according to an analysis Thursday.",
      "At the United Nations climate talks, hosted in Baku, Azerbaijan, nations are trying to set new targets to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases and figure out how much rich nations will pay to help the world with that task.",
      "But Earth remains on a path to be 2.7 degrees Celsius (4.9 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial times, according to Climate Action Tracker, a group of scientists and analysts who study government policies and translate that into projections of warming.",
      "If emissions are still rising and temperature projections are no longer dropping, people should wonder if the United Nations climate negotiations \u2014 known as COP \u2014 are doing any good, said Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an awful lot going on that\u2019s positive here, but on the big picture of actually getting stuff done to reduce emissions ... to me it feels broken,\u201d Hare said.",
      "The world has already warmed 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. That's near the 1.5-degree (2.7 F) limit that countries agreed to at 2015 climate talks in Paris. Climate scientists say the atmospheric warming, mainly from human burning of fossil fuels, is causing ever more extreme and damaging weather including droughts, flooding and dangerous heat.",
      "Climate Action Tracker does projections under several different scenarios, and in some cases, those are going up slightly.",
      "\u201cThis is driven highly by China,\u201d said Sofia Gonzales-Zuniga of Climate Analytics. Even though China's fast-rising emissions are starting to plateau, they are peaking higher than anticipated, she said.",
      "Another upcoming factor not yet in the calculations is the U.S. elections. A Trump administration that rolls back the climate policies in the Inflation Reduction Act, and carries out the conservative blueprint Project 2025, would add 0.04 degree Celsius (0.07 Fahrenheit) to warming projections, Gonzales-Zuniga said. That's not much, but it could be more if other nations use it as an excuse to do less, she said.",
      "\u201cFossil fuels and emissions are not peaking,\u201d said Sherry Rehman, chair of climate and environment committee in Pakistan\u2019s senate. After 29 years of climate talks, Rehman said countries are \u201cstill talking in bumper stickers.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need a transformative solution. We need strong delivery,\u201d Rehman said.",
      "The major battle in Baku is over how much rich nations will pay for developing countries to decarbonize their energy systems, cope with future harms of climate change and pay for damage from warming's extreme weather.",
      "A special independent group of experts commissioned by United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres issued its own estimate of costs and finances on Thursday, calling for a tripling of the old commitment. It said about $1 trillion a year is needed by developing nations from all outside sources, not just government grants.",
      "\u201cAdvanced economies need to demonstrate a credible commitment\u201d to helping poor nations, the report said.",
      "Negotiations on a grand total and structuring the overall amount have taken \u201ca step back\u201d when a draft of just a few pages that was worked on for a year was rejected and the latest proposal with many options has more than 30 pages, said top European negotiator Veronika Bagi of Hungary. European Commission negotiator Jacob Werksman said there\u2019s a \u201cvery significant gap\u2033 between what rich and poor nations propose.",
      "German climate envoy Jennifer Morgan said \u201cprivate investment has to be brought to the table\u201d in order to fulfill developing countries needs. But Mariana Paoli of Christian Aid said any number that comes out of negotiations that's not based in publicly-financed grants \u201cwill be meaningless.\u201d",
      "Relying on the private sector means climate cash will not be \u201cneeds based, it will be profit-driven,\" she said, adding that crises like the COVID-19 pandemic and bank bailouts proves that public funds are available.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about fairness, it\u2019s about justice,\u201d she said.",
      "Getting climate cash is personal for many activists from vulnerable nations, like Sandra Leticia Guzman Luna, who is from Mexico and the director of the climate finance group for Latin America and the Caribbean. \u201cWe are observing the climate impacts causing a lot of costs, not only economic costs but also human losses,\u201d she said.",
      "Argentina withdrew from the climate talks on Wednesday on the orders of its president, climate skeptic Javier Milei. The Argentine government did not respond to requests from The Associated Press for comment.",
      "Climate activists called the decision regrettable.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to understand how a climate-vulnerable country like Argentina would cut itself from critical support,\" said Anabella Rosemberg, an Argentina native who works as a senior adviser at Climate Action Network International.",
      "Also Wednesday, France's environment minister, who was set to lead the delegation, pulled out of the talks after Azerbaijan president Ilham Aliyev called out France and the Netherlands for their colonial histories.",
      "Agn\u00e8s Pannier-Runacher called Aliyev\u2019s remarks on France and Europe \u201cunacceptable.\" Speaking at the French Senate on Wednesday, Pannier-Runacher criticized Azerbaijan\u2019s leader for using the fight against climate change \u201cfor a shameful personal agenda.\u201d",

      "The 71-year-old retiree starts each morning this way with a walking club.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m obsessed,\u201d she said. Not only does it ease her joint pain, \u201cit just gives me energy \u2026 And then it calms me, too.\u201d",
      "Medical experts agree that walking is an easy way to improve physical and mental health, bolster fitness and prevent disease. While it\u2019s not the only sort of exercise people should do, it\u2019s a great first step toward a healthy life.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t need equipment and you don\u2019t need a gym membership,\u201d said Dr. Sarah Eby, a sports medicine physician with Mass General Brigham. \u201cAnd the benefits are so vast.\u201d",
      "Walking can help meet the U.S. surgeon general\u2019s recommendation that adults get at least 2 1/2 hours of moderate-intensity physical activity every week. This helps lower the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, dementia, depression and many types of cancer.",
      "Walking also improves blood sugar levels, is good for bone health and can help you lose weight and sleep better, added Julie Schmied, a nurse practitioner with Norton Healthcare, which runs the free Get Healthy Walking Club.",
      "Another advantage? It\u2019s a low-impact exercise that puts less pressure on joints as it strengthens your heart and lungs.",

      "\u201cMy cardiologist says I\u2019m doing great,\u201d he said.",
      "For all its benefits, however, walking \u201cis not enough for overall health and well-being\u201d because it doesn\u2019t provide resistance training that builds muscle strength and endurance, said Anita Gust, who teaches exercise science at the University of Minnesota Crookston.",
      "That's especially important for women\u2019s bone health as they age.",
      "Experts recommend adding such activities at least twice weekly \u2013 using weights, gym equipment or your own body as resistance \u2014 and doing exercises that improve flexibility like yoga or stretching.",
      "Nearly everyone has heard about this walking goal, which dates back to a 1960s marketing campaign in Japan. But experts stress that it\u2019s just a guideline.",
      "The average American walks about 3,000 to 4,000 steps a day and it's fine to gradually work up to 10,000, Shmied said.",
      "Setting a time goal can also be useful. Shmied suggests breaking the recommended 150 minutes per week into 30 minutes a day, or 10 minutes three times a day, for five days. During inclement weather, people can walk in malls or on treadmills.",
      "As they become seasoned walkers, they can speed up the pace or challenge themselves with hills while still keeping the activity level moderate.",
      "\u201cIf you can talk but not sing,\u201d Eby said, \u201cthat\u2019s what we consider moderate-intensity exercise.\u201d",

      "Punjab, Pakistan\u2019s most populous province with 127 million residents, has been hit by a record-high ongoing wave of pollution since October. The U.N. children\u2019s agency on Monday warned that the health of 11 million children there was at risk.",
      "Lahore and Multan, the province\u2019s two main cities hit by smog, remained the two most polluted cities in the world on Wednesday, with air quality index readings of about 400, according to the Environmental Protection Department. Anything over 300 is considered hazardous to health.",
      "The dangerous smog is a byproduct of large numbers of vehicles, construction and industrial work as well as burning crops at the start of the winter wheat-planting season, experts say.",

      "Deep breathing can be a simple and effective way to reduce stress",
      "NEW YORK -- A simple, uncommon ritual starts each staff meeting at Myosin Marketing. When everyone is gathered on Zoom, and before they get to the meat of the agenda, CEO Sean Clayton leads his team through a deep-breathing exercise.",
      "The practice sets the tone for the meeting, and helps his employees, most of whom work remotely, to feel safe, grounded and willing to take creative risks, he said.",
      "\u201cAt first they thought it was really weird, like, \u2018What are we doing?\u2019\u201d Clayton said. \u201cThere were a lot of cameras off and I\u2019m sure a lot of people were like, \u2018This is awkward.\u2019\" But after a couple of weeks, there was a shift. Employees of the Austin, Texas company were saying, 'This feels good,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "Deep breathing can be an effective way to reduce stress at work, studies show. But on the job, many people don\u2019t think about how they\u2019re inhaling and exhaling.",
      "Desk workers sitting a computer tend to take shallow breaths as their shoulders creep up. Workers who spend the day on their feet in retail or health care may be too busy to focus on breathing.",
      "But there's good reason to remember to pause to take deep breaths. Chronic, unmanaged stress, which increases the risk of heart disease and stroke, can be as harmful to our health as secondhand smoke, according to the American Heart Association. Research suggests deep-breathing exercises can lower a person's blood pressure and reduce anxiety.",
      "Other benefits: deep breathing is free, can be done anywhere and doesn't require taking a half-hour to meditate. Spending just a minute or two breathing deeply can help calm racing thoughts, experts say.",
      "\u201cIt relaxes my mind. It makes my mind so full of ease,\u201d Lisa Marie Deleveaux, a marketing professional and mother of five, said. \u201cIt brings you back to the present moment.\u201d",
      "Deleveaux was laid off several months ago and has struggled to find a new job. She wakes most mornings at 4 or 5 a.m., before the children, to do breathing exercises. One is a technique known as alternate nostril breathing, a yoga exercise that involves inhaling through one nostril and out through another, using a thumb or forefinger to hold one nostril closed at a time.",
      "\u201cIf you set a priority for yourself ... you can make the time,\u201d Deleveaux said.",
      "Focusing on breathing for one to five minutes \"can help you clear the slate and wipe all these things out of your mind...and allow you to get back to focusing on the one thing you want to accomplish,\u201d said cardiologist Glenn Levine, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. \u201cThe best analogy is turning your computer off when you have 37 programs (open) and it freezes.\u201d",
      "A good way to do deep breathing exercises is while sitting on a bench outside, Levine said. If that\u2019s not an option, doing it at a desk works.",
      "\u201cEither turn off your screen or just put something blank on the screen so people think you\u2019re still working,\" Levine said. \u201cInstead of focusing on the screen or work, just focus on your breathing. If possible, close your eyes.\u201d",
      "There are other ways to fit in breathing exercises. To get ahead of anxiety before starting a day of cold calls, sales development representative Lindsay Carlisle does breathing exercises with her 7-year-old daughter during the drive to school. They breathe in for seven counts, hold their breath for five, breathe out for seven counts, and then repeat the cycle several times.",
      "\u201cThroughout that process, my shoulders start to drop on their own, and it really is calming,\u201d Carlisle, who lives in Flint, Michigan, said. \u201cI\u2019m not a yoga instructor. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing, but it works.\u201d",
      "Suze Yalof Schwartz was an overworked fashion editor when her mother-in-law taught her a three-minute meditation technique that she says changed her life. She gave up her fashion career and founded Unplug Meditation, a Santa Monica, California, company with a meditation studio, an app and programs for corporate clients.",
      "\u201cWhen we slow down our breath, we send a signal to our brain that everything\u2019s OK, even when it\u2019s not,\" she said.",
      "A 16-second breathing technique she's taught to firefighters, police officers, doctors and others is called the box breathing technique. You breathe in for four counts, hold for four, breathe out for four counts and hold for four.",
      "\u201cIt is the best thing that you can do at work before you have a meeting, before you send out an email that you wish you didn\u2019t send, before you have a difficult conversation, because it just calms you down, gets rid of your negative energy,\" Yalof Schwartz said.",
      "Employers such as Coca-Cola, Mattel and Netflix have hired Unplug Meditation to teach breathing or meditation.",
      "It's not always easy for workers to find space for deep breathing exercises. For example, in retail jobs, workers often mix with customers. Yalof Schwartz recommends doing breathing exercises when ringing up a sale or folding clothes. You can also take a deep breath right before walking through a door.",
      "Office workers can set a timer on their phones to remind themselves to breathe deeply. That's what Carlisle, the sales representative, does. She also keeps a Post-it note on her monitor that says \u201cBreathe.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe anxiety is always going to be there,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cBut at least I know I have one small tool. ... It sounds so simple and silly, but it works.\u201d",

      "Food and beverage manufacturer Kraft Heinz said Tuesday that it no longer is serving the Lunchables meals it created for U.S. schools.",
      "The company introduced the two packaged meals \u2014 one starring pizza and the other a turkey, cheddar cheese and cracker plate \u2014 at the beginning of the 2023-2024 academic year. At the time, Kraft Heinz said the offerings were protein-enriched and contained reduced levels of saturated fat and sodium to meet the requirements of the national free and reduced-price school lunch program.",
      "Nutritionists and advocacy groups were not thrilled by the launch. The Center for Science in the Public Interest called having Lunchables in cafeterias \u201ca highly questionable move for school nutrition\u201d that might confuse families into thinking the versions sold at supermarkets were a healthy option.",
      "The drumbeat quickened in April, when Consumer Reports said its tests showed the school-approved Lunchables contained more sodium than the store varieties. The organization also reported that commercially available Lunchables had more lead compared to ready-made meals made several other companies.",
      "Consumer Reports petitioned the U.S. Department of Agriculture to ban Lunchables and similar processed meal kits from schools.",
      "In a statement, Pittsburgh-based Kraft Heinz attributed the decision to pull out of the market served by the National School Lunch Program to a lack of demand. The company described the business impact as \u201cnegligible,\u201d saying sales of the school-designed meals \u201cwere far less than 1% of overall Lunchables sales\u201d during the last academic year.",
      "\u201cLast year, we brought two NSLP compliant Lunchables options to schools that had increased protein. While many school administrators were excited to have these options, the demand did not meet our targets,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThis happens occasionally across our broad portfolio, especially as we explore new sales channels. Lunchables products are not available in schools this year and we hope to revisit at a future date.\u201d",
      "The Kraft Heinz Co. produces a wide range of familiar products, including Capri Sun juice pouches, Oscar Meyer hot dogs, Grey Poupon mustard, Kool-Aid and Philadelphia Cream Cheese."

      "New rules require drugmakers to be clearer about explaining the risks and side effects of prescription drugs",
      "WASHINGTON -- Those ever-present TV drug ads showing patients hiking, biking or enjoying a day at the beach could soon have a different look: New rules require drugmakers to be clearer and more direct when explaining their medications' risks and side effects.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration spent more than 15 years crafting the guidelines, which are designed to do away with industry practices that downplay or distract viewers from risk information.",
      "Many companies have already adopted the rules, which become binding Nov. 20. But while regulators were drafting them, a new trend emerged: thousands of pharma influencers pushing drugs online with little oversight. A new bill in Congress would compel the FDA to more aggressively police such promotions on social media platforms.",

A 2007 law directed the FDA to ensure that drug risk information appears \u201cin a clear, conspicuous and neutral manner.\u201d",
      "FDA has always required that ads give a balanced picture of both benefits and risks, a requirement that gave rise to those long, rapid-fire lists of side effects parodied on shows like \u201c Saturday Night Live.\u201d",
      "But in the early 2000s, researchers began showing how companies could manipulate images and audio to de-emphasize safety information. In one example, a Duke University professor found that ads for the allergy drug Nasonex, which featured a buzzing bee voiced by Antonio Banderas, distracted viewers from listening to side effect information, making it harder to remember.",
      "Such overt tactics have largely disappeared from drug ads.",
      "\u201cIn general, I would say the ads have gotten more complete and transparent,\u201d says Ruth Day, director of the medical cognition lab at Duke University and author of the Nasonex study.",
      "The new rules are \u201csignificant steps forward,\u201d Day said, but certain requirements could also open the door to new ways of downplaying risks.",
      "One requirement instructs companies to show on-screen text about side effects while the audio information plays. A 2011 FDA study found that combining text with audio increased recall and understanding.",
      "But the agency leaves it to companies to decide whether to display a few keywords or a full transcript.",
      "\u201cYou often cannot put all that on the screen and expect people to read and understand it,\u201d Day said. \u201cIf you wanted to hide or decrease the likelihood of people remembering risk information, that could be the way to do it.\u201d",
      "Viewers tend to tune out long lists of warnings and other information. But experts who work with drug companies don\u2019t expect those lists to disappear. While the guidelines describe how the information should be presented, companies still decide the content.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re a company and you\u2019re worried about possible FDA enforcement or product liability and other litigation, all your incentives are to say more, not less,\u201d said Torrey Cope, a food and drug lawyer who advises companies.",
      "Experts also say the new rules will have little effect on the overall tone and appearance of ads.",
      "\u201cThe most salient element of these ads are the visuals, and they are uniformly positive,\u201d said Cox. \u201cEven if the risk message is about, for instance, sudden heart failure, they\u2019re still showing someone diving into a swimming pool.\u201d",
      "The new rules come as Donald Trump's advisers begin floating plans for the FDA and the pharmaceutical industry.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an anti-vaccine activist who has advised the president-elect, wants to eliminate TV drug ads. He and other industry critics point out that the U.S. and New Zealand are the only countries where prescription drugs can be promoted on TV.",
      "Even so, many companies are looking beyond TV and expanding into social media. They often partner with patient influencers who post about managing their conditions, new treatments or navigating the health system.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re teaching people to live a good life with their disease, but then some of them are also paid to advertise and persuade,\u201d said Erin Willis, who studies advertising and media at the University of Colorado Boulder.",
      "Advertising executives say companies like the format because it\u2019s cheaper than TV and consumers generally feel influencers are more trustworthy than companies.",
      "FDA\u2019s requirement for truthful, balanced risk and benefit information applies to drugmakers, leaving a loophole for both influencers and telehealth companies like Hims, Ro and Teledoc, who may not have a direct financial connection to makers of the drugs they\u2019re promoting.",
      "The issue has attracted attention from members of Congress.",
      "\u201cThe power of social media and the deluge of misleading promotions has meant too many young people are receiving medical advice from influencers instead of their health care professional,\u201d Sens. Dick Durbin of Illinois and Mike Braun of Indiana wrote the FDA in a February letter.",
      "A recently introduced bill from the senators would bring influencers and telehealth companies clearly under FDA\u2019s jurisdiction, requiring them to disclose risk and side effect information. The bill also would require drugmakers to publicly disclose payments to influencers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s asking the FDA to take a more serious stance with this kind of marketing,\u201d said Willis. \"They know it\u2019s happening, but they could be doing more and their regulations haven\u2019t been updated since 2014.\"",

      "New government data shows that U.S. drug overdose deaths appear to be showing a sustained decline",
      "NEW YORK -- The decline in U.S. drug overdose deaths appears to have continued this year, giving experts hope the nation is seeing sustained improvement in the persistent epidemic.",
      "There were about 97,000 overdose deaths in the 12-month period that ended June 30, according to provisional Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data released Wednesday. That's down 14% from the estimated 113,000 for the previous 12-month period.",
      "\u201cThis is a pretty stunning and rapid reversal of drug overdose mortality numbers,\u201d said Brandon Marshall, a Brown University researcher who studies overdose trends.",
      "Overdose death rates began steadily climbing in the 1990s because of opioid painkillers, followed by waves of deaths led by other opioids like heroin and \u2014 more recently \u2014 illicit fentanyl. Provisional data had indicated a slight decline for 2023, and the tally released Wednesday showed that the downward trend has kept going.",
      "Of course, there have been moments in the last several years when U.S. overdose deaths seemed to have plateaued or even started to go down, only to rise again, Marshall noted.",
      "\u201cThis seems to be substantial and sustained,\u201d Marshall said. \"I think there's real reason for hope here.\"",
      "Experts aren't certain about the reasons for the decline, but they cite a combination of possible factors.",
      "One is COVID-19. In the worst days of the pandemic, addiction treatment was hard to get and people were socially isolated \u2014 with no one around to help if they overdosed.",
      "\u201cDuring the pandemic we saw such a meteoric rise in drug overdose deaths that it\u2019s only natural we would see a decrease,\u201d said Farida Ahmad of the CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics.",
      "Still, overdose deaths are well above what they were at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "The recent numbers could represent the fruition of years of efforts to increase the availability of the overdose-reversing drug naloxone, and addiction treatments such as buprenorphine, said Erin Winstanley, a University of Pittsburgh professor who researches drug overdose trends.",
      "Marshall said such efforts likely are being aided by money from settlements of opioid-related lawsuits, brought by state, local and Native American governments against drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies. Settlement funds have been rolling out to small towns and big cities across the U.S., and some have started spending the money on naloxone and other measures.",
      "Some experts have wondered about changes in the drug supply. Xylazine, a sedative, has been increasingly detected in illegally manufactured fentanyl, and experts are sorting out exactly how it's affecting overdoses.",
      "In the latest CDC data, overdose death reports are down in 45 states. Increases occurred in Alaska, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Washington.",
      "The most dramatic decreases were seen in North Carolina and Ohio, but CDC officials voiced a note of caution. Some jurisdictions have had lags in getting death records to federal statisticians \u2014 particularly North Carolina, where death investigations have slowed because of understaffing at the state medical examiner's office. The CDC made estimates to try to account for incomplete death records, but the decline in some places may ultimately turn out not to be as dramatic as initial numbers suggest.",
      "Another limitation of the provisional data is that it doesn't detail what's happening in different groups of people. Recent research noted the overdose deaths in Black and Native Americans have been growing disproportionately larger.",
      "\u201cWe really need more data from the CDC to learn whether these declines are being experienced in all racial ethnic subgroups,\" Marshall said.",

      "Democratic lawmakers who wield control of the Virginia Legislature are hoping to make good on promises made on the campaign trail, including becoming the first Southern state to expand constitutional protections for abortion access",
      "RICHMOND, Va. -- Democrats who control both chambers of the Virginia legislature are hoping to make good on promises made on the campaign trail, including becoming the first Southern state to expand constitutional protections for abortion access.",
      "The House Privileges and Elections Committee advanced three proposed constitutional amendments Wednesday, including a measure to protect reproductive rights. Its members also discussed measures to repeal a now-defunct state constitutional ban on same-sex marriage and ways to revise Virginia's process to restore voting rights for people who served time for felony crimes.",
      "\u201cThis meeting was an important next step considering the moment in history we find ourselves in,\u201d Democratic Del. Cia Price, the committee chair, said during a news conference. \u201cWe have urgent threats to our freedoms that could impact constituents in all of the districts we serve.\u201d",
      "The at-times raucous meeting will pave the way for the House and Senate to take up the resolutions early next year after lawmakers tabled the measures last January. Democrats previously said the move was standard practice, given that amendments are typically introduced in odd-numbered years. But Republican Minority Leader Todd Gilbert said Wednesday the committee should not have delved into the amendments before next year's legislative session. He said the resolutions, particularly the abortion amendment, need further vetting.",
      "\u201cNo one who is still serving remembers it being done in this way ever,\u201d Gilbert said after the meeting. \u201cCertainly not for something this important. This is as big and weighty an issue as it gets.\u201d",
      "The Democrats' legislative lineup comes after Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin, to the dismay of voting-rights advocates, rolled back a process to restore people's civil rights after they completed sentences for felonies. Virginia is the only state that permanently bans anyone convicted of a felony from voting unless a governor restores their rights.",
      "\u201cThis amendment creates a process that is bounded by transparent rules and criteria that will apply to everybody \u2014 it's not left to the discretion of a single individual,\u201d Del. Elizabeth Bennett-Parker, the patron of the voting rights resolution, which passed along party lines, said at the news conference.",
      "Though Democrats have sparred with the governor over their legislative agenda, constitutional amendments put forth by lawmakers do not require his signature, allowing the Democrat-led House and Senate to bypass Youngkin's blessing.",
      "Instead, the General Assembly must pass proposed amendments twice in at least two years, with a legislative election sandwiched between each statehouse session. After that, the public can vote by referendum on the issues. The cumbersome process will likely hinge upon the success of all three amendments on Democrats' ability to preserve their edge in the House and Senate, where they hold razor-thin majorities.",
      "It's not the first time lawmakers have attempted to champion the three amendments. Republicans in a House subcommittee killed a constitutional amendment to restore voting rights in 2022, a year after the measure passed in a Democrat-led House. The same subcommittee also struck down legislation supporting a constitutional amendment to repeal an amendment from 2006 banning marriage equality.",
      "On Wednesday, a bipartisan group of lawmakers voted 16-5 in favor of legislation protecting same-sex marriage, with four Republicans supporting the resolution.",
      "\u201cTo say the least, voters enacted this (amendment) in 2006, and we have had 100,000 voters a year become of voting age since then,\u201d said Del. Mark Sickles, who sponsored the amendment as one of the first openly gay men serving in the General Assembly. \u201cMany people have changed their opinions of this as the years have passed.\u201d",
      "A constitutional amendment protecting abortion previously passed the Senate in 2023 but died in a Republican-led House. On Wednesday, the amendment passed on party lines.",
      "If successful, the resolution proposed by House Majority Leader Charniele Herring would be part of a growing trend of reproductive rights-related ballot questions given to voters. Since 2022, 18 questions have gone before voters across the U.S., and they have sided with abortion rights advocates 14 times.",
      "The voters have approved constitutional amendments ensuring the right to abortion until fetal viability in nine states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Ohio and Vermont. Voters also passed a right-to-abortion measure in Nevada in 2024, but it must be passed again in 2026 to be added to the state constitution.",
      "As lawmakers debated the measure, roughly 18 members spoke. Mercedes Perkins, at 38 weeks pregnant, described the importance of women making decisions about their own bodies. Rhea Simon, another Virginia resident, anecdotally described how reproductive health care shaped her life.",
      "Then all at once, more than 50 people lined up to speak against the abortion amendment.",
      "\u201cLet's do the compassionate thing and care for mothers and all unborn children,\u201d resident Sheila Furey said.",
      "The audience gave a collective \u201cAmen,\u201d followed by a round of applause.",

The seven resigning directors said they had yet to receive an adequate transaction proposal from the chief executive and cited a \u201cclear\u201d difference of opinion on 23andMe\u2019s future.",
      "At the time, Wojcicki said she was \u201csurprised and disappointed\u201d by the resignations but maintained that taking 23andMe private and \u201coutside of the short-term pressures of the public markets\u201d would be best for the company long term.",
      "After more than a month with Wojcicki left as the sole member of the board, 23andMe announced that it had appointed three new independent directors in late October.",
      "23andMe went public in 2021 and has struggled to find a profitable business model since \u2014 particularly with most buyers of its saliva-based testing kits only needing to purchase once. The company reported a net loss of $667 million for its last fiscal year, more than double the loss of $312 million for the year prior.",
      "23andMe posted another loss in quarterly earnings released Tuesday, although with less of a dent than in previous quarters. The company reported a net loss of $59.1 million for the 2025 fiscal year's second quarter, compared to a loss of $75.3 million for the same year prior.",
      "Revenue, however, totaled at $44.1 million for the second quarter \u2014 down from $50 million from the year prior. The company cited lower testing kit sales and telehealth orders, as well as a decrease in research revenue, but said that was partially offset by a growth in membership services.",
      "23andMe anticipates the job cuts and other restructuring efforts announced Monday to reduce its operating expenses and save the company more than $35 million annually. 23andMe also expects to incur up to $12 million in costs, primarily related to one-time severance and other termination-related expenses.",
      "23andMe ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $127 million, compared with $216 million as of March 31, 2024.",
      "Last month, 23andMe completed a 1-for-20 reverse stock split. Shares were down nearly 4% by midday Tuesday, sitting at around $4.43."

      "KANSAS CITY, Kan. -- After working at a crowded and dangerous internment camp in Iraq, Air Force Staff Sgt. Heather O'Brien brought home with her anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder.",
      "A bouncy labradoodle and a Kansas City-area program helped her get back on her feet.",
      "Dogs 4 Valor, operated through the Olathe, Kansas-based organization called The Battle Within, helps retired veterans and first responders work with their service dogs to help manage depression, anxiety and other challenges.",
      "\u201cA lot of times the veteran with severe PTSD is homebound,\u201d said Sandra Sindeldecker, program manager for Dogs 4 Valor. \u201cThey\u2019re isolated. They\u2019re very nervous. They won\u2019t make eye contact. Some won\u2019t leave the house at all.\u201d",
      "The program involves both group and one-on-one training. The goal is to get the veteran and the dog comfortable with each other and understanding each other. The group takes outings to help the veterans regain their footing in public places like airports. Program leaders also provide mental health therapy at no cost.",
      "The veterans and dogs graduate in six to nine months, but group gatherings continue.",
      "There is growing evidence of the value of service dogs for veterans with PTSD. A small study published in JAMA Network Open in June looked at a program operated by K9s For Warriors. Service dogs in the program are taught to pick up a veteran\u2019s physical signs of distress and can interrupt panic attacks and nightmares with a loving nudge.",
      "Researchers compared 81 veterans who received service dogs with 75 veterans on the waiting list for a trained dog. After three months, PTSD symptoms improved in both groups, but the veterans with dogs saw a bigger improvement on average.",
      "O'Brien, 40, recalled that the camp where she worked in Iraq sometimes had over 20,000 detainees. Violence and rioting were common and it left her with severe anxiety.",
      "\u201cWhen I got out of the military, I just assumed that you\u2019re supposed to be on edge all the time as a veteran,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.",
      "O\u2019Brien\u2019s mother spotted the frisky lab-poodle mix on Facebook and convinced her daughter to adopt the dog she named Albus. Months later, O'Brien learned about Dogs 4 Valor, and the pair joined the program in October 2023.",
      "O\u2019Brien says she can now go out in public again \u2014 she even went on vacation to Branson, Missouri, \u201cthings that I never would have thought I would do really, probably ever again.\u201d",
      "Mark Atkinson, 38, served in Afghanistan as a corporal in the Marine Corps. He returned home with PTSD and major depressive disorder, causing sleeplessness and anxiety. He adopted Lexi, now 5, in 2020.",
      "Lexi, a muscular cane corso breed, needed Atkinson as much as he needed her. Her previous owner had kept Lexi in chains before surrendering her. Since joining Dogs 4 Valor, the two can get out together and enjoy life.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t really like leaving the house because I\u2019m safe there, you know?\" Atkinson said. \u201cAnd having Lexi has just made me get out to be more social.\u201d",
      "Having a group of fellow veterans facing the same challenges has also helped, Atkinson said.",
      "\u201cWe come from the same backgrounds, different branches,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cSame issues. You know, PTSD or traumatic brain injuries. And they\u2019re all very welcoming, as well. There\u2019s no judgment.\u201d",
      "O\u2019Brien compared living with Albus to a relationship with a sometimes pushy best friend who often wants to go out.",
      "\u201cThe best friend constantly wants to make you do things that make you nervous,\u201d O\u2019Brien laughed, acknowledging that it is ultimately up to her.",
      "\u201cI have to decide to walk out and just deal with life,\" O'Brien said. \"And so that has been hard. And it still is hard from time to time, but it\u2019s it\u2019s getting manageable.\u201d",
      "Some veterans said their family relationships have improved since they started the program.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m able to talk, not fly off the handle and just get along with people and not be as stressed, not have as much anxiety,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cOr even if I do, she (Lexi) is right there with me.\u201d",
      "Timothy Siebenmorgen, 61, said his relationships also are better with help from his 1-year-old American bulldog, Rosie, and Dogs 4 Valor, which he joined in July. He served in both the Marines and the Army, deploying 18 times.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re in the military, kind of taught not to show weakness,\" Siebenmorgen said. \"So you figure you can tackle everything yourself and you honestly believe that. And then you realize you can\u2019t do it on your own.\u201d",
      "Veterans said the dogs, and the program, have given them new hope and a renewed ability to move forward.",
      "\u201cI got my life back,\u201d O\u2019Brien said."

      "LONDON -- Cases of mpox in the region of Congo where a new and more infectious variant was first detected appear to be \u201cplateauing,\u201d the World Health Organization said on Monday, even as the virus continues to increase in other areas of the country, as well as in Burundi and Uganda.",
      "A report by the U.N. health agency said the number of mpox infections \u201cshows a general rising trend,\u201d but that they may have plateaued in South Kivu, where the more infectious form of mpox was first identified to be spreading earlier this year among sex workers and miners in the gold mining town of Kamituga.",
      "WHO acknowledged that testing is still not widespread, making it difficult to understand how exactly the virus is spreading.",
      "According to data from last week, Congo reported fewer than 100 laboratory-confirmed mpox cases, down from nearly 400 in July. In recent weeks, experts say that infections appear to be stabilizing, offering a chance for health authorities to definitively stamp out the outbreak.",
      "So far, about 50,000 people in Congo have been immunized against mpox. The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 3 million vaccines are needed to stop the outbreak.",
      "Last week, Africa CDC's director Dr. Jean Kaseya said the continent was \u201cstill in the acute phase\u201d of the mpox epidemic, with 19 countries affected. He warned that without more resources, the virus could become a global threat.",
      "WHO said the Burundi outbreak is also being driven by the newer variant, which causes less severe symptoms \u2014 meaning people who are infectious may not realize they are spreading it. In the last two weeks, Burundi has reported more than 200 new mpox cases every week, mostly in children and young adults.",
      "In Uganda, which reported 100 new cases last week, WHO said the virus is spreading mostly through sex, with the vast majority of cases in adults.",
      "Mpox -- previously known as monkeypox because it was first seen in research monkeys \u2014 is spread primarily through close skin-to-skin contact with infected people or their soiled clothes or bedsheets. It often causes visible skin lesions that could make people less likely to be in close contact with others.",
      "In August, WHO declared the rapid spread of mpox in Congo and elsewhere in Africa to be a global health emergency. To date, Africa has reported more than 46,000 suspected cases, including 1,081 deaths.",
      "WHO said it would convene an expert meeting on Nov. 22 to determine if mpox still constitutes an international emergency.",
      "Last week, Britain announced the first instance of the more infectious kind of mpox spreading beyond Africa. It identified mpox in a person who had recently traveled to Africa and in three of their household contacts. All the individuals are currently being treated in two London hospitals.",

    "story": [
      "Four-year-old Hussein Mikdad survived an Israeli airstrike on his home in a Beirut suburb last month",
      "BEIRUT -- Curled up in his father \u2019s lap, clinging to his chest, Hussein Mikdad cried his heart out. The 4-year-old kicked his doctor with his intact foot and pushed him away with the arm that was not in a cast. \u201cMy Dad! My Dad!\" Hussein said. \"Make him leave me alone!\u201d With eyes tearing up in relief and pain, the father reassured his son and pulled him closer.",
      "Hussein and his father, Hassan, are the only survivors of their family after an Israeli airstrike last month on their Beirut neighborhood. The strike killed 18 people, including his mother, three siblings and six relatives.",
      "\u201cCan he now shower?\u201d the father asked the doctor.",
      "Ten days after surgery, doctors examining Hussein's wounds said the boy is healing properly. He has rods in his fractured right thigh and stitches that assembled his torn tendons back in place on the right arm. The pain has subsided, and Hussein should be able to walk again in two months \u2014 albeit with a lingering limp.",
      "A prognosis for Hussein's invisible wounds is much harder to give. He is back in diapers and has begun wetting his bed. He hardly speaks and has not said a word about his mother, two sisters and brother.",
      "\u201cThe trauma is not just on the muscular skeletal aspect. But he is also mentally hurt,\u201d Imad Nahle, one of Hussein\u2019s orthopedic surgeons, said.",
      "Israel said, without elaborating, that the strike on the Mikdad neighborhood struck a Hezbollah target. In the war that has escalated since September, Israeli airstrikes have increasingly hit residential areas around Lebanon. Israel accuses the Lebanese militant group of hiding its capabilities and fighters among civilians. It vows to cripple Hezbollah, which began firing into northern Israel after Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack triggered the war in Gaza.",
      "But children have been caught in the midst.",
      "With more strikes on homes and in residential areas, doctors are seeing more children affected by the violence. More than 100 children have been killed in Lebanon in the past six weeks and hundreds injured. And of the 14,000 wounded since last year, around 10% are children. Many have been left with severed limbs, burned bodies, and broken families \u2014 scars that could last for a lifetime.",
      "Ghassan Abu Sittah, a renowned British-Palestinian surgeon who is also treating Hussein, sees that long road ahead. This is his worry: \u201cIt leaves us with a generation of physically wounded children, children who are psychologically and emotionally wounded.\"",
      "At the American University of Beirut Medical Center, which is receiving limited cases of war casualties, Nahle said he operated on five children in the past five weeks \u2014 up from no cases before. Most were referred from south and eastern Lebanon.",
      "A few miles away, at the Lebanese Hospital Geitaoui, one of the country\u2019s largest burns centers increased its capacity by nearly 180% since September so it could accommodate more war wounded, its medical director Naji Abirached said. About a fifth of the newly admitted patients are children.",
      "In one of the burn center\u2019s ICU units lies Ivana Skakye. She turned 2 in the hospital ward last week. Ivana has been healing from burns she sustained following an Israeli airstrike outside their home in southern Lebanon on Sept. 23. Israel said it struck ammunition depots and launchers in southern Lebanon that day when its warplanes launched hundreds of airstrikes in different parts of Lebanon, making it the deadliest day of the war so far. More than 500 people were killed.",
      "Six weeks later, the tiny Ivana remains wrapped in white gauze from head to toe except her torso. She sustained third-degree burns over 40 percent of her body. Her hair and head, her left side all the way to her legs, both her arms and her chest were burned. Her family home was damaged, its ceiling set afire. The family\u2019s valuables, packed in their car as they prepared to leave, were also torched. Ivana\u2019s older sister, Rahaf, 7, has recovered faster from burns to her face and hands.",
      "Fatima Zayoun, their mother, was in the kitchen when the explosion hit. Zayoun jumped up to grab the girls, who were playing on the terrace.",
      "It was, Zayoun said, \"as if something lifted me up so that I can grab my kids. I have no idea how I managed to pull them in and throw them out of the window. She spoke from the ICU burns unit. \u201cThey were not on fire, but they were burned. Black ash covered them. ... (Ivana) was without any hair. I told myself, `That is not her.'\u201d",
      "Now, Ivana's wound dressings are changed every two days. Her doctor, Ziad Sleiman, said she could be discharged in a few days. She\u2019s back again to saying \u201cMama\u201d and \u201cBye \u2014 shorthand for wanting to go out.",
      "Like Hussein, though, Ivana has no home to return to. Her parents fear collective shelters could cause an infection to return.",
      "After seeing her kids \u201csizzling on the floor,\u201d Zayoun, 35, said that even if their home is repaired, she wouldn\u2019t want to return. \u201cI saw death with my own eyes,\u201d she said.",
      "Zayoun was 17 last time Israel and Hezbollah were at war, in 2006. Displaced with her family then, she said she almost enjoyed the experience, riding out of their village in a truck full of their belongings, mixing with new people, learning new things. They returned home when the war was over.",
      "\u201cBut this war is hard. They are hitting everywhere,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat do they want from us? Do they want to hurt our children? We are not what they are looking for.\"",
      "Abu Sittah, the reconstructive surgeon, said most of the children's injuries are from blasts or collapsing rubble. That attack on a space they expect to be inviolable can have lingering effects.",
      "\u201cChildren feel safe at home,\" he said. \"The injury makes them for the first time lose that sense of security \u2014 that their parents are keeping them safe, that their homes are invincible, and suddenly their homes become not so.\u201d",
      "One recent morning, children were playing in the courtyard of a vocational school-turned-shelter in Dekwaneh, north of Beirut, where nearly 3,000 people displaced from the south are now living. The parents were busy with an overflowing bathroom that serves one floor in a building that houses nearly 700 people.",
      "Only playtime brings the children, from different villages in the south, together. They were divided in two teams, ages ranging between 6 and 12, competing to get the handkerchief first. A tiny girl hugged and held hands with strangers visiting the shelter. \u201cI am from Lebanon. Don't tell anyone,\u201d she whispered in their ears.",
      "The game turned rowdy when two girls in their early teens got into a fist fight. Pushing and shoving began. Tears and tantrums followed. The tiny girl walked away in a daze.",
      "Maria Elizabeth Haddad, manager of the psychosocial support programs in Beirut and neighboring areas for the U.S.-based International Medical Corps, said parents in shelters reported signs of increased anxiety, hostility and aggression among kids. They talk back to parents and ignore rules. Some have developed speech impediments and clinginess. One is showing early signs of psychosis.",
      "\u201cThere are going to be residual symptoms when they grow up, especially related to attachment ties, to feeling of security,\u201d Haddad said. \u201cIt is a generational trauma. We have experienced it before with our parents. ... They don\u2019t have stability or search for (extra) stability. This is not going to be easy to overcome.\u201d",
      "Children represent more than a third of over 1 million people displaced by the war in Lebanon and following Israeli evacuation notices, according to U.N. and government estimates (more than 60,000 people have been displaced from northern Israel). That leaves hundreds of thousands in Lebanon without schooling, either because their schools were inaccessible or have been turned into shelters.",
      "Hussein's father says he and his son must start together from scratch. With help from relatives, the two have found a temporary shelter in a home \u2014 and, for the father, a brief sense of relief. \u201cI thank God he is not asking for or about his mother and his siblings,\u201d said Hassan Mikdad, the 40-year-old father.",
      "He has no explanation for his son, who watched their family die in their home. His two sisters \u2014 Celine, 10, and Cila, 14 \u2014 were pulled out of the rubble the following day. His mother, Mona, was pulled out three days later. She was locked in an embrace with her 6-year-old son, Ali.",
      "The strike on Oct. 21 also caused damage across the street, to one of Beirut\u2019s main public hospitals, breaking solar panels and windows in the pharmacy and the dialysis unit. The father survived because he had stepped out for coffee. He watched his building crumble in the late-night airstrike. He also lost his shop, his motorcycles and car \u2014 all the evidence of his 16 years of family life.",
      "His friend, Hussein Hammoud, arrived on the scene to help sift through rubble. Hammoud spotted young Hussein Mikdad\u2019s fingers in the darkness in an alley behind their home. At first, he thought they were severed limbs \u2014 until he heard the boy\u2019s screams. He dug out Hussein with glass lodged in his leg and a metal bar in his shoulder. Hammoud said he didn\u2019t recognize the boy. He held the child's almost-severed wrist in place.",
      "In the hospital now, Hussein Mikdad sipped a juice as he listened to his father and his friend. His father turned to him, asking if he wanted a Spider-Man toy \u2014 an effort to forestall a new outburst of tears. He said he buys Hussein a toy each day.",
      "\u201cWhat I am living through seems like a big lie. ...The mind can\u2019t comprehend,\u201d he said. \u201cI thank God for the blessing that is Hussein.\u201d",

      "Four women suing over Idaho\u2019s strict abortion ban told a judge Tuesday how excitement over their pregnancies turned to grief and fear after they learned their fetuses were not likely to survive to birth \u2014 and how they had to leave the state to get abor...",
      "BOISE, Idaho -- Four women suing over Idaho's strict abortion bans told a judge Tuesday how excitement over their pregnancies turned to grief and fear after they learned their fetuses were not likely to survive to birth \u2014 and how they had to leave the state to get abortions amid fears that pregnancy complications would put their own health in danger.",
      "\u201cWe felt like we were being made refugees, medical refugees,\u201d said Jennifer Adkins, one of the plaintiffs in the case.",
      "The women, represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, aren't asking for the state's abortion ban to be overturned. Instead, they want the judge to clarify and expand the exceptions to the strict ban so that people facing serious pregnancy complications can receive abortions before they are at death's door.",
      "Currently, the state's near-total ban makes performing an abortion a felony at any stage of pregnancy unless it is \u201cnecessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.\u201d",
      "Adkins' fetus had a severe medical condition that meant it would not survive the pregnancy. The illness also put Adkins at risk of developing \u201cmirror syndrome,\u201d a dangerous syndrome that can cause fatally high blood pressure and other issues, she said.",
      "Adkins and her husband decided to seek an abortion, and learned they would have to go out of state to get one after another ultrasound showed the fetus still had a heartbeat.",
      "\u201cNo parent wants to wish that when they look at an ultrasound they don't see their baby's heartbeat, yet here I was hoping that I wouldn't,\u201d Adkins said. \u201cI wanted the decision to be made for us, and I wanted to end her suffering, so it was really hard to see that and know that we had the challenges ahead of us that we did.\u201d",
      "Kayla Smith cried as she told the judge how she found out she was pregnant for a second time on Mother's Day of 2022, and how she and her husband chose the name \u201cBrooks\u201d for their son. She was around 18 or 20 weeks along in her pregnancy when the sonographer grew quiet during a routine anatomy scan, Smith said.",
      "Brooks' heart had fatal anomalies, and the young family could not find a pediatric cardiologist willing to attempt an operation. The veins supplying Brooks' lungs were also abnormal, Smith said, and he would not survive birth.",
      "Smith had developed dangerously high blood pressure during a previous pregnancy, and she was at risk of developing the condition called preeclampsia again.",
      "\u201cIf I were to continue pregnancy not only would I risk my life with preeclampsia, I was not willing to watch my son suffer and potentially gasp for air,\u201d Smith said, crying.",
      "Idaho's abortion ban went into effect two days before Brooks' diagnosis, she said, making it impossible for her to get an abortion in her home state.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to meet our son \u2014 that was really important to us \u2014 so we needed to do it in a hospital,\u201d she said. They took out a loan to cover the estimated $16,000 to $20,000 out-of-network cost and drove more than eight hours to a hospital where doctors induced labor.",
      "\u201cAll four of these women were overjoyed to be pregnant with their second child and all four of them received the worst news a mother can imagine,\u201d attorney Gail Deady, with the Center for Reproductive Rights, told 4th District Judge Jason D. Scott during opening arguments. All of them sought abortions \u201cto protect their health, to spare their babies from pain and suffering, and to remain alive and healthy to protect their young children.\u201d",
      "James Craig, a division chief with the Idaho Attorney General\u2019s office, said the women and their attorneys are relying on hypotheticals rather than concrete facts to make their case. Under their proposal, a pregnant woman could receive her abortion for something as minor as stepping on a rusty nail \u2014 even though the risk of infection in that scenario could be easily treated by receiving a tetanus booster shot, Craig said.",
      "\u201cUnborn children have a fundamental right to life, and protecting the lives of children is a legitimate and fundamental government interest,\u201d Craig said.",
      "The state also has the same interest in protecting the lives of women, Craig said \u2014 and the abortion ban laws do both, he contended.",
      "In the \u201crare circumstances where abortion is necessary\u201d to prevent the death of the mother, Idaho law allows that to occur, Craig said. The women suing are trying to \u201cusurp the role of the Legislature\u201d by asking the judge to rewrite the law, he said, and that is not the proper role of the court.",
      "Dr. Emily Corrigan, an ob-gyn who works in emergency medicine at Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center who is also a plaintiff in the case, told the judge how Idaho\u2019s multiple abortion bans have created confusion for physicians and made it difficult to treat pregnant patients who need emergency care.",
      "Doctors have had to \u201cbasically guess which pregnancy conditions would fall under the state medical exception,\u201d Corrigan said.",
      "\u201cI have had other hospital staff refuse to participate in the care of my patients because of the lack of understanding of the laws, and this has caused patient care delays,\u201d she said. \u201cI have personally cared for several patients who have been denied stabilizing abortion care at other hospitals in Idaho. By the time they arrive at my institution, their conditions have deteriorated and have lead to increased complications that I need to manage.\u201d",
      "Several conditions can put the health of pregnant people at risk, she said. Some are caused by pregnancy like preeclampsia, and others \u2014 including some chronic illnesses and cancers \u2014 can be made worse by pregnancy, she said. In those cases, delaying an abortion might not cause immediate death but can cause a shortened life span or have dramatic effects on a person's health, Corrigan said.",
      "\u201cWe are not trained to wait until things become urgent or emergent. We are trained to prevent harm to our patients,\u201d she said."

    "story": [
      "There's some good news about sexually-transmitted diseases in newly released U.S. health data",
      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. syphilis epidemic slowed dramatically last year, gonorrhea cases fell and chlamydia cases remained below prepandemic levels, according to federal data released Tuesday.",
      "The numbers represented some good news about sexually transmitted diseases, which experienced some alarming increases in past years due to declining condom use, inadequate sex education, and reduced testing and treatment when the COVID-19 pandemic hit.",
      "Last year, cases of the most infectious stages of syphilis fell 10% from the year before \u2014 the first substantial decline in more than two decades. Gonorrhea cases dropped 7%, marking a second straight year of decline and bringing the number below what it was in 2019.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m encouraged, and it\u2019s been a long time since I felt that way\u201d about the nation\u2019s epidemic of sexually transmitted infections, said the CDC\u2019s Dr. Jonathan Mermin. \u201cSomething is working.\"",
      "More than 2.4 million cases of syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia were diagnosed and reported last year \u2014 1.6 million cases of chlamydia, 600,000 of gonorrhea, and more than 209,000 of syphilis.",
      "Syphilis is a particular concern. For centuries, it was a common but feared infection that could deform the body and end in death. New cases plummeted in the U.S. starting in the 1940s when infection-fighting antibiotics became widely available, and they trended down for a half century after that. By 2002, however, cases began rising again, with men who have sex with other men being disproportionately affected.",
      "The new report found cases of syphilis in their early, most infectious stages dropped 13% among gay and bisexual men. It was the first such drop since the agency began reporting data for that group in the mid-2000s.",
      "However, there was a 12% increase in the rate of cases of unknown- or later-stage syphilis \u2014 a reflection of people infected years ago.",
      "Cases of syphilis in newborns, passed on from infected mothers, also rose. There were nearly 4,000 cases, including 279 stillbirths and infant deaths.",
      "\u201cThis means pregnant women are not being tested often enough,\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, a professor of medicine at the University of Southern California.",
      "What caused some of the STD trends to improve? Several experts say one contributor is the growing use of an antibiotic as a \u201cmorning-after pill.\u201d Studies have shown that taking doxycycline within 72 hours of unprotected sex cuts the risk of developing syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia.",
      "In June, the CDC started recommending doxycycline as a morning-after pill, specifically for gay and bisexual men and transgender women who recently had an STD diagnosis. But health departments and organizations in some cities had been giving the pills to people for a couple years.",
      "Some experts believe that the 2022 mpox outbreak \u2014 which mainly hit gay and bisexual men \u2014 may have had a lingering effect on sexual behavior in 2023, or at least on people's willingness to get tested when strange sores appeared.",
      "Another factor may have been an increase in the number of health workers testing people for infections, doing contact tracing and connecting people to treatment. Congress gave $1.2 billion to expand the workforce over five years, including $600 million to states, cities and territories that get STD prevention funding from CDC.",
      "Last year had the \"most activity with that funding throughout the U.S.,\u201d said David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors.",
      "However, Congress ended the funds early as a part of last year\u2019s debt ceiling deal, cutting off $400 million. Some people already have lost their jobs, said a spokeswoman for Harvey's organization.",
      "Still, Harvey said he had reasons for optimism, including the growing use of doxycycline and a push for at-home STD test kits.",
      "Also, there are reasons to think the next presidential administration could get behind STD prevention. In 2019, then-President Donald Trump announced a campaign to \u201celiminate\u201d the U.S. HIV epidemic by 2030. (Federal health officials later clarified that the actual goal was a huge reduction in new infections \u2014 fewer than 3,000 a year.)",
      "There were nearly 32,000 new HIV infections in 2022, the CDC estimates. But a boost in public health funding for HIV could also also help bring down other sexually transmitted infections, experts said.",
      "\u201cWhen the government puts in resources, puts in money, we see declines in STDs,\u201d Klausner said.",

      "The Justice Department is suing to block UnitedHealth Group\u2019s $3.3 billion purchase of Amedisys",
      "NEW YORK -- The Justice Department is suing to block UnitedHealth Group's $3.3 billion purchase of Amedisys, citing concerns the combination would hinder access to home health and hospice services in the U.S.",
      "The antitrust complaint, filed in Maryland by the Justice Department and four states' attorneys general Tuesday, argues that a potential merger is illegal because the two companies are \"such large competitors\" already \u2014 and the deal would give UnitedHealth too much control in many local markets.",
      "That would mean less choice for patients looking for affordable care, the suit alleges, as well as fewer employment options for nurses seeking competitive pay and benefits.",
      "\u201cAmerican healthcare is unwell,\" Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter of the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, said in a prepared statement. \u201cUnless this $3.3 billion transaction is stopped, UnitedHealth Group will further extend its grip to home health and hospice care, threatening seniors, their families and nurses.\u201d",
      "Tuesday's lawsuit follows UnitedHealth's acquisition of LHC Group Inc., another home health and hospice provider. Since that transaction's completion last year, the Justice Department said, UnitedHealth and Amedisys have emerged as two of the largest providers of home health and hospice care in the country.",
      "The complaint alleges that UnitedHealth's plan to acquire Amedisys is the result of \"an intentional, sustained strategy of acquiring, rather than beating, competition.\u201d After completing the LHC acquisition, the suit says UnitedHealth prevented Amedisys' 2023 plans to merge with infusion provider OptionCare by paying a \u201cbreakup fee\u201d \u2014 and then separately made its own acquisition offer, which Amedisys eventually accepted.",
      "UnitedHealth is seeking to add Amedisys to Optum, its subsidiary that provides care as well as pharmacy and technology services. In a response Tuesday to the antitrust suit, Optum said the transaction \u201cwould be pro-competitive and further innovation.\u201d It said it plans to \u201cvigorously defend (itself) against the DOJ\u2019s overreaching interpretation of the antitrust laws.\u201d",
      "Amedisys added that it also remains committed to the deal, which it believes \u201cwill create more opportunities to deliver quality, compassionate and value-based care to patients and their families.\u201d",
      "In details about the deal published on Optum's website, the company maintained Optum and Amedisys \u201cwould operate just a fraction\" of all home health and hospice care markets nationwide when combined. Optum also noted plans to divest some of its care centers to home health provider VitalCaring upon the deal's completion. It said the divestments would aid competition but the Justice Department said that the proposal is inadequate.",
      "Beyond its Optum unit, UnitedHealth Group also runs one of the nation\u2019s largest health insurers, UnitedHealthcare. The Minnesota-based healthcare giant reported third-quarter net income of $6.06 billion on revenue of $100.82 billion.",
      "Louisiana-based Amedisys reported third-quarter earnings of $16.9 million and a revenue of $587.7 million for the period.",
      "Tuesday's lawsuit arrives in the final months of the Biden administration, which has been particularly aggressive in antitrust enforcement. In recent years, the Justice Department has also targeted companies accused of engaging in illegal monopolies and driving up prices across industries like entertainment, travel and tech.",
      "The four states\u2019 attorneys general joining Tuesday's suit against UnitedHealth and Amedisys are from Maryland, Illinois, New Jersey and New York."

    "story": [
      "A pregnant woman has filed a lawsuit seeking the right to an abortion in Kentucky",
      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- A pregnant woman filed a lawsuit Tuesday seeking to restore the right to an abortion in Kentucky in the latest challenge to the state's near-total ban on the procedure.",
      "The suit, filed in state court in Louisville, claims that Kentucky laws blocking abortions violate the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights to privacy and self-determination. It asks that both state laws be struck down by a judge in Jefferson County Circuit Court.",
      "The woman, a state resident identified by the pseudonym Mary Poe to protect her privacy, is about seven weeks pregnant, the suit said. She wants to terminate her pregnancy but cannot legally do so in Kentucky, it said.",
      "The decision about whether to become or remain pregnant is among the \u201cmost personal and consequential decisions a person will make in their lifetime,\u201d the suit said. Her legal team includes attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union.",
      "\u201cWithout the ability to decide whether to continue a pregnancy, Kentuckians have lost the right to make critical decisions about their health, bodies, lives and futures,\u201d the suit said.",
      "The plaintiff said in a statement that ending her pregnancy is the best decision for her and her family.",
      "\u201cI feel overwhelmed and frustrated that I cannot access abortion care here in my own state, and I have started the difficult process of arranging to get care in another state where it\u2019s legal,\u201d she said in the statement issued by the ACLU of Kentucky. \u201cThis involves trying to take time off work and securing child care, all of which place an enormous burden on me.\u201d",
      "Defendants in the latest suit include Russell Coleman, Kentucky\u2019s Republican attorney general.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the attorney general\u2019s responsibility to defend the laws passed by the General Assembly, and we will zealously work to uphold these laws in court,\u201d Coleman said in a statement.",
      "The suit was quickly denounced as meritless by David Walls, executive director of The Family Foundation, a conservative group staunchly opposed to abortion.",
      "\u201cThe ACLU\u2019s suggestion that the Kentucky Constitution somehow secretly contains a hidden right to terminate the life and stop the beating heart of an unborn human being, despite Kentucky\u2019s clear 150-year pro-life history, is absolutely absurd,\u201d Walls said in a statement.",
      "The suit is seeking class-action status to include others who are or will become pregnant and want the right to have an abortion. It is challenging Kentucky\u2019s near-total trigger law ban and a separate six-week ban, both of which were passed by Republican legislative majorities.",
      "The trigger law took effect when Roe v. Wade was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 and bans abortions except to save the life of the patient or to prevent disabling injury. It does not include exceptions for cases of rape or incest.",
      "The lawsuit is similar to legal action taken nearly a year ago, also by a pregnant woman who sought the right to an abortion in Kentucky. That challenge was dropped after the woman learned her embryo no longer had cardiac activity, but abortion rights groups said the legal fight was far from over.",
      "In 2022, Kentucky voters rejected a ballot measure that would have denied any constitutional protections for abortion, but abortion rights supporters have made no inroads in the Republican-controlled Legislature at chipping away at the laws.",
      "Kentucky's Supreme Court refused last year to halt the near-total ban, resulting in abortion access remaining virtually shut off in the. Abortion rights groups have searched for plaintiffs to challenge the ban.",
      "Brigitte Amiri, deputy director of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, said Tuesday that bans in Kentucky and elsewhere have \u201cwreaked havoc on people\u2019s lives.\u201d",
      "\u201cThose who can scrape together the resources may be able to travel out of state to get care, but others will be forced to carry their pregnancies to term against their will, often at great cost to their health or lives,\u201d Amiri said in a statement.",
      "The plaintiff in the new lawsuit said the decision whether to end her pregnancy should be hers.",
      "\"I am bringing this case to ensure that other Kentuckians will not have to go through what I am going through, and instead will be able to get the health care they need in our community,\u201d she said."

      "\u201cPrior to these record-breaking levels of air pollution, about 12% of deaths in children under 5 in Pakistan were due to air pollution,\" Fadil said. \"The impact of this year\u2019s extraordinary smog will take time to assess, but we know that doubling and tripling the amount of pollution in the air will have devastating effects, particularly on children and pregnant women.\u201d",
      "Pakistan has shut schools until Nov. 17 in parts of Punjab as part of measures aimed at protecting children\u2019s health. Authorities on Friday ordered the closure of all parks and museums for 10 days, and they have been urging people to avoid unnecessary travel.",
      "According to the Environmental Protection Department in Punjab, Multan remained the most polluted city on Monday, with air quality index readings of about 800. Anything over 300 is considered hazardous to health.",

      "The family of a security guard who was fatally shot at a hospital in Portland, Oregon, has sued the facility for $35 million",
      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- The family of a security guard who was shot and killed at a hospital in Portland, Oregon, sued the facility for $35 million on Tuesday, accusing it of negligence and failing to respond to the dangers that the gunman posed to hospital staff over multiple days.",
      "In a wrongful death complaint filed Tuesday, the estate of Bobby Smallwood argued that Legacy Good Samaritan Medical Center failed to enforce its policies against violence and weapons in the workplace by not barring the shooter from the facility, despite staff reporting threats and aggression toward them in the days before the shooting.",
      "\u201cThe repeated failures of Legacy Good Samaritan to follow their own safety protocols directly led to the tragically preventable death of Bobby Smallwood,\u201d Tom D\u2019Amore, the attorney representing the family, said in a statement. \u201cDespite documented threats and abusive behavior that required immediate removal under hospital policy, Legacy allowed a dangerous individual to remain on the premises for three days until those threats escalated to violence.\u201d",
      "In an email, Legacy Health said it was unable to comment on pending litigation.",
      "The shooting at Legacy Good Samaritan Medical Center in Portland was part of a wave of gun violence sweeping through U.S. hospitals and medical centers, which have struggled to adapt to the growing threats. Such attacks have helped make health care one of the nation\u2019s most violent fields. Health care workers racked up 73% of all nonfatal workplace violence injuries in 2018, the most recent year for which figures are available, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "The gunman at the Portland hospital, PoniaX Calles, first visited the facility on July 19, 2023, as his partner was about to give birth. On July 20 and July 21, nursing staff and security guards filed multiple incident reports describing outbursts, violent behavior and threats, but they weren't accessible or provided to workers who were interacting with him, according to the complaint.",
      "On July 22, nurse supervisors decided to remove Calles from his partner's room, and Smallwood accompanied him to the waiting room area outside the maternity ward. Other security guards searching the room found two loaded firearms in a duffel bag, and his partner told them he likely had a third gun on his person, the complaint said.",
      "According to the complaint, over 40 minutes passed between the discovery of the duffel bag and Smallwood's death. Two minutes before he was shot, a security guard used hand gestures through glass doors to notify him that Calles was armed. Smallwood then told Calles he would pat him down, but Calles said he would leave instead. Smallwood began escorting him out of the hospital, and as other staff members approached them, Calles shot Smallwood in the neck.",
      "The hospital did not call a \u201ccode silver,\u201d the emergency code for an active shooter, until after Smallwood had been shot, the complaint said.",
      "Smallwood's family said his death has profoundly impacted them.",
      "\u201cEvery day we grieve the loss of our son and all the years ahead that should have been his to live,\u201d his parents, Walter \u201cBob\u201d and Tammy Smallwood, said in the statement released by their attorney. \u201cNothing can bring Bobby back, but we will not stop fighting until Legacy is held fully responsible for what they took from our family.\u201d",
      "After the shooting, Legacy said it planned to install additional metal detectors; require bag searches at every hospital; equip more security officers with stun guns; and apply bullet-slowing film to some interior glass and at main entrances.",
      "Around 40 states have passed laws creating or increasing penalties for violence against health care workers, according to the American Nurses Association. Hospitals have armed security officers with batons, stun guns or handguns, while some states allow hospitals to create their own police forces."

There were also \u201crioters, moving in small groups, by foot, scooter or car, quickly attacking Maccabi fans before disappearing,\u201d it said.",
      "Amsterdam police said five people were treated in hospital for injuries. Police detained dozens of people before the match, but there were no immediate arrests for violence after it.",
      "On Wednesday night, hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters gathered on Amsterdam's central Dam Square to hold a demonstration despite a new city ban on such gatherings. Large numbers of police, including some on horseback, were present and detained most of the protesters after they refused to leave, escorting them mostly peacefully into two buses and driving them away from the square.",
      "Reports of antisemitic speech, vandalism and violence have been on the rise in Europe since the start of the war in Gaza, and tensions were high in Amsterdam ahead of the soccer match. The assaults on Maccabi fans sparked outrage and were widely condemned as antisemitic.",
      "The violence badly tarnished Amsterdam's long-held image as a haven of tolerance and sparked soul-searching across the country.",
      "Wilders, whose anti-immigration Party for Freedom won elections last year and now is part of a four-party ruling coalition government, said Wednesday that on the night Amsterdam commemorated Kristallnacht, the 1938 anti-Jewish pogrom in Nazi Germany, \u201cwe saw Muslims hunting Jews on the streets of Amsterdam,\u201d and blamed \u201dMoroccans who want to destroy Jews.\"",
      "He gave no evidence. Police and prosecutors have not disclosed the identities of any of the suspects that were detained, in line with Dutch privacy rules.",
      "Wilders advocated canceling the Dutch passports of people convicted of involvement in the violence \u2014 if they have a double passport \u2014 and deporting them.",
      "Wilders, who is sometimes described as the Dutch Donald Trump because of his fierce anti-immigration rhetoric, has lived under round-the-clock protection for 20 years because of death threats from Islamic extremists. He has also long been a staunch supporter of Israel.",
      "Some lawmakers warned that his new comments only served to deepen divisions in Dutch society.",
      "Rob Jetten of the centrist D66 party said Wilders' rhetoric \"does not contribute in any way to healing. In no way does he contribute to bringing our country together, but he throws oil on the fire and thus does not bring solutions against antisemitism and for a better society any closer, but only further away.\u201d",
      "Frans Timmermans, who leads the biggest center-left bloc in parliament, agreed.",
      "\u201cWhat you are doing is just stirring things up, dividing this country when this country needs politicians who bring people together, who bring solutions closer,\" Timmermans said.",
      "In Amsterdam, a prominent Jewish member of the City Council, Itay Garmy, said that although there\u2019s a lot of anger and fear within the Jewish community, inflammatory remarks wouldn\u2019t help.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t use my security or my suffering or my fear as a Jew to create political gains for yourself and make your points about integration, migration or Muslim hate,\u201d Garmy said.",

      "Syria\u2019s state news agency says Israel has carried out two airstrikes on a western neighborhood of Damascus and one of the capital\u2019s suburbs",
      "DAMASCUS, Syria -- Israel carried out at least two airstrikes on a western neighborhood of Damascus and one of the capital\u2019s suburbs on Thursday, killing at least 15 people and wounding another 16, Syria's state news agency said.",
      "The airstrikes on the Mazzeh neighborhood in Damascus and the suburb of Qudsaya, northwest of the capital, struck two buildings, the SANA news agency said. An Associated Press journalist at the scene in Mazzeh said that a five-story building was damaged by a missile that hit the basement.",
      "The Israeli military said it had hit infrastructure sites and command centers of the Islamic Jihad militant group in Syria, and had \u201cinflicted significant damage to the terrorist organization\u2019s command center and to its operatives.\u201d",
      "The airstrikes in Damascus and the nearby suburb came shortly before Ali Larijani, an adviser to Iran\u2019s supreme leader Ali Khamenei, was scheduled to meet in the Syrian capital with representatives of Palestinian factions at the Iranian Embassy in Mazzeh.",
      "The Israeli military said Islamic Jihad had participated alongside Hamas, the Palestinian militant group in the Gaza Strip, in the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks on southern Israel that killed some 1,200 people \u2014 mostly civilians \u2014 and saw 250 others abducted into Gaza.",
      "The military \u201cwill continue to operate against the Islamic Jihad terrorist organization wherever necessary,\u201d it said.",
      "Israel's retaliation to the Oct. 7 attack and the ensuing Israel-Hamas war has spilled into the wider region, affecting Lebanon, Syria and leading to strikes between Israel and Iran. The war has left much of Gaza in ruins and has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to local health authorities who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants.",
      "An official with the Palestinian Islamic Jihad Group said that the strike in Mazzeh targeted one of their offices, and that several members of the group were killed. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn\u2019t authorized to speak to the media.",
      "Syria\u2019s state news agency SANA said that the country\u2019s air defenses were activated against a \u201chostile target\u201d south of the central city of Homs. It gave no further details.",
      "Tehran has been a main backer of Syrian President Bashar Assad\u2019s government since a 2011 uprising turned into a full-blown civil war and has played an instrumental role in turning the tide of the conflict in his favor.",
      "Iran has sent scores of military advisers and thousands of Iran-backed fighters from around the Middle East to Syria to fight on Assad\u2019s side. Tehran has also been an economic lifeline for Assad, sending fuel and credit lines worth billions of dollars.",
      "Israel has carried out hundreds of airstrikes in Syria targeting members of neighboring Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah and officials from Iranian-backed groups.",
      "Hezbollah began firing into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with Hamas in Gaza. Since then, more than 3,200 people have been killed in Lebanon and more than 14,200 wounded, the country\u2019s Health Ministry reported. In Israel, 76 people have been killed, including 31 soldiers.",
      "Lebanon's state media said an Israeli airstrike Thursday hit a building in Baalbek city in eastern Lebanon, killing at least nine people and wounding five others.",
      "The strike on Baalbek came without warning. The Israeli military did not immediately comment and the target was not clear.",
      "Speaking Thursday evening, Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said that over the past week, Israel had \"struck more than 300 targets from the air across Lebanon, including about 40 targets in the heart of the Dahiyeh in Beirut.\u201d",
      "Israeli warplanes intensified airstrikes on Thursday, targeting various areas in southern and eastern Lebanon, including the outskirts of the southern port city of Tyre city and the Nabatieh province, the National News Agency said.",
      "Throughout the day, sporadic airstrikes targeted Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs in a clear uptick in attacks on the area over the past two days, with the Israeli army issuing evacuation warnings for several locations and buildings in the suburbs.",
      "The Israeli military said it carried out strikes on Hezbollah targets in the Dahiyeh area, including weapons storage facilities and command centers.",
      "Lebanon\u2019s Health Ministry said the death toll in Lebanon since the war began on Oct. 8, 2023 has reached 3,365 while those wounded are 14,344. Nearly 1.2 million people have been displaced.",
      "Before the war intensified on Sept. 23, Hezbollah said that it had lost nearly 500 members but the group has stopped releasing statements about their killed fighters since.",
      "United Nations peacekeeping chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix, speaking during a visit to Lebanon, said the U.N. remains committed to keeping its peacekeeping force, known as UNIFIL, in place in all of its positions in southern Lebanon, despite intense ongoing battles between Israeli forces and Hezbollah militants.",
      "UNIFIL has continued to monitor the escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah across the boundary known as the Blue Line despite Israeli calls for peacekeepers to pull back five kilometers (three miles) from the border. UNIFIL has accused Israel of deliberately destroying observation equipment, and 13 peacekeepers have been injured in the fighting.",
      "Lacroix visited some of the wounded peacekeepers during his trip.",
      "UNIFIL forces \u201ccontinue to be deployed in all the positions, and we think it is very important to preserve that presence everywhere,\u201d LaCroix said. \u201d...Had we vacated some of the positions, then that would have certainly jeopardized the capacity for UNIFIL to continue today, but probably even more importantly, that would have significantly undermined the capacity for UNIFIL to play a role, tomorrow, when the cessation of hostilities takes place - hopefully sooner than later.\u201d",
      "Lacroix said there is still a \u201clarge consensus that resolution 1701 remains the critical framework for settlement,\u201d referring to the U.N. Security Council resolution that ended the brutal monthlong war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, but which has never been fully implemented by either party.",

    "story": [
      "Legislators from Mexico\u2019s ruling party have reelected the head of the National Human Rights Commission despite widespread opposition and her refusal to criticize the government",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Legislators from Mexico\u2019s ruling party reelected the head of the National Human Rights Commission on Wednesday despite widespread opposition and her failure to call out the government for abuses.",
      "The reelection of Rosario Piedra in a party-line Senate vote appeared to be another example of the ruling Morena party's attempts to weaken independent oversight bodies. Morena has proposed eliminating a host of other oversight, transparency and freedom-of-information agencies, claiming they cost too much to run.",
      "Mexico's civic and nonprofit rights groups have been almost unanimous in their criticism of Piedra's reelection.",
      "\u201cThis is an undeserved prize for a career marked by inaction, the loss of independence and the weakening of the institution,\u201d the Miguel Agust\u00edn Pro Ju\u00e1rez human rights center wrote on social media.",
      "Piedra is a committed supporter of former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who left office on Sept. 30, and she once affirmed that none of the deaths caused by the armed forces under his administration were illegal or unjustified. She shared the former president's delight in attacking and criticizing other independent human rights groups.",
      "Since her first election in 2019, Piedra has done little to investigate allegations of massacres or extrajudicial killings by soldiers and members of the militarized National Guard, to whom L\u00f3pez Obrador gave sweeping powers.",
      "Despite receiving over 1,800 citizen complaints against the armed forces between 2020 and 2023, her commission issued only 39 recommendations, and most of the few military cases her commission did follow up on involved abuses committed under previous administrations.",
      "The rights commission has the power to make nonbinding recommendations to government agencies. If they do not agree to follow the recommendations, they are at least required by law to explain why.",
      "Piedra has almost exclusively focused the commission's work on issuing recommendations in cases where people have not received proper health care at government-run hospitals. Those recommendations accomplish little, because they don't address the underlying problem of underfunded, poorly equipped hospitals forced to handle too many patients.",
      "At times Piedra acted as if human rights violations no longer existed under L\u00f3pez Obrador. In 2019, she expressed disbelief when asked about the killing of journalists, despite the fact that almost a dozen were killed in L\u00f3pez Obrador's first year in office.",
      "\u201cAre they killing journalists?\u201d she said with an expression of disbelief.",
      "Piedra comes from a well-known activist family: Her mother founded one of Mexico's first groups to demand answers for families whose relatives had been abducted and disappeared by the government in the 1960s and '70s. But even her mother's group, the Eureka Committee, did not support Piedra's reelection.",
      "\u201cHer actions appear to support impunity for the perpetrators of governmental terrorism, and the government's line of obedience and forgetting\u201d rights abuses, the committee wrote in a statement.",
      "Piedra broke with two important traditions: she was a member of the ruling party up until she was elected to her first term in 2019. The job has usually gone to nonpartisan human rights experts.",
      "And she has openly endorsed and supported government policies and actions. Previous heads of the commission had a more critical relationship with the government.",
      "Piedra also failed to make the final cut for candidates for the post this year in a congressional examination of their qualifications, but was put on the ballot anyway.",
      "That's important, since similar evaluation committees will decide who gets on the ballot in judicial reforms that make federal judges stand for election next year. Activists worry that the same kind of favoritism will come into play in the election of judges.",
      "\u201cThis decision comes after a selection process in which she (Piedra) wasn't found to be the most qualified,\u201d a coalition or rights groups said in a statement. \u201cThat reveals the political, partisan considerations that put her onto the ballot.\u201d",
      "She also apparently falsified a letter of recommendation, after a bishop and human rights activist said a letter she presented to support her reelection had not been signed by him.",
      "Piedra will serve under new President Claudia Sheinbaum, another devoted follower of L\u00f3pez Obrador, who took office Oct. 1. On Sheinbaum's first day in office, the army killed six migrants near the Guatemalan border; 10 days later, soldiers and National Guard killed three bystanders  in the northern border city of Nuevo Laredo while chasing suspects.",
      "Sheinbaum\u2019s third week in office was capped by the killing of a crusading Catholic priest who had been threatened by gangs, and a lopsided encounter in northern Sinaloa state in which soldiers killed 19 drug cartel suspects, but suffered not a scratch themselves. That awakened memories of past human rights abuses, like a 2014 incident in which soldiers killed about a dozen cartel suspects after they had surrendered.",
      "The purportedly leftist government has been quick to criticize human rights groups and activists who expose abuses.",
      "In June, an outspoken volunteer advocate for missing people found an apparent body dumping ground with human remains in Mexico City, embarrassing ruling party officials who had done little to look for such clandestine grave sites. City prosecutors lashed out at her, claiming \u201cthe chain of custody\u201d of the evidence had been manipulated, which could lead to charges.",

      "By day, Xing Long works in an office for a state-owned company in Changchun, an industrial city in the northeastern rust belt of China",
      "CHANGCHUN, China -- Crouch through the small metal door and walk down the dark tunnel, and even before you step into the abandoned air raid shelter, the air reverberates with pounding techno beats. Young Chinese holding booze and cigarettes shake and sway in a red-lit passageway, below a big screen rolling through quotations from Chairman Mao.",
      "This is an underground rave in China, part of a subculture growing in hidden corners of the nation\u2019s cities, even as its political and cultural mainstream grow increasingly controlled, staid and predictable.",
      "For Chinese ravers, these gatherings \u2014 often called \u201cye di,\u201d or \u201cwild dances\u201d \u2014 not only offer a rare space for unfettered fun, but signal resistance to the narrowly prescribed future a rigid society expects for them.",
      "By day, Xing Long works in the office of a state-owned company in Changchun, an industrial city in China's northeastern rust belt region.",
      "By night, he\u2019s a DJ and underground rave organizer, a side gig that offers an escape from the humdrum of reviewing corporate contracts.",
      "\u201cMy job cannot make me feel I fulfilled my values,\u201d he said. \u201cGoing to work is like executing a prewritten program.\u201d",
      "Chinese young people face intense pressure and high expectations from the society around them. In recent years, facing bleak economic prospects, Chinese youth culture has been swept by a series of viral slang terms to describe frustration and hopelessness: \u201c 996 \u201d \u2014 the brutal 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week work schedule many companies ask of employees. \u201cInvolution\u201d \u2014 an endless treadmill of pointless competition that fresh graduates face. \u201c Lying flat \u201d \u2014 the growing trend among young people of giving up all ambition and aiming to do as little as possible.",
      "Techno dance parties are an escape from all that for people like Xing. Every time he walks into a rave, the 31-year-old said, his brain \u201cjolts awake like a bang.\u201d",
      "Xing first learned about techno music from a documentary made by the American media company Vice.",
      "\u201cMy eyes brightened up when I heard it,\" he said. \"I should\u2019ve listened to this kind of music earlier.\u201d",
      "Xing began going to raves in Shenzhen, a southern city with a population of 17 million, but when he moved home in 2021 he realized no one else was organizing them.",
      "\u201cI want this city to have an underground techno music scene,\" he said. \"I want to listen to it myself, so I want to make it happen.\u201d",
      "Xing said that the underground techno scene fascinated him because it's \u201creal\u201d even if not perfect, bad, not in the right order, or broken.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a beautiful thing that was deliberately produced into a mold to present to the mainstream.\u201d",
      "In recent years, space for culture and creativity has been shrinking in China as the authorities have ramped up censorship of concerts, shows, and other cultural events. Comedians have been silenced after joking about topics considered politically sensitive. A growing number of independent bookstores and creative spaces have shut down under pressure, while state-sanctioned media promotes uplifting, often saccharine narratives.",
      "Yet underground raves are free from all those limitations because they sprout in gray zones. Hidden from public view, they skirt formal approval processes, neither supported nor suppressed by the state.",
      "Feng Zhe, 27, a rave organizer in Shenyang, a northeastern city about 400 miles from Beijing, said raves are about \u201crefusing to be disciplined by society.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is probably not how the world functions nowadays,\u201d he said, adding that societies want to make people follow their rules and be useful but \"underground culture is useless.\u201d",
      "\u201cMost people are going to be repressed,\" Feng said.",
      "But for most rave organizers, the real meaning of underground rave culture is simply having fun. Loong Wu, a 26-year-old art student, started organizing raves in 2021 during COVID-19 lockdowns out of boredom.",
      "\u201cMy original intention was just to break through the boredom,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you are truly enjoying it, you don\u2019t think about meanings.\u201d",
      "On one recent Saturday night, civil servants, students, an ex-firefighter, girls with dyed hair, and a man with a full face mask and goggles filed into a bar tucked behind a flower shop in downtown Changchun to attend one of Xing\u2019s raves.",
      "They danced to fast-paced industrial techno spun by Du Jizhe, a local part-time DJ who works in HR by day.",
      "He said it\u2019s the natural soundtrack of auto manufacturing cities like Changchun and Detroit, which prides itself on being the birthplace of techno. For Du, techno evokes childhood memories of the auto factory where his father worked.",
      "\u201cTechno is basically industrial noise like hammering and mechanical sounds,\u201d Du said \u201cThese noises exert a subtle influence on people\u2019s ears in industrial cities.\u201d",
      "Chen Xiangyu, a fashion student in an oversized black t-shirt with hair dyed blond, a black leather choker, a lip piercing, and smoky eye makeup, said raves are a pure release.",
      "\u201cThe first time I came, I thought to myself, I don\u2019t know anyone, no one knows me, so nobody\u2019s paying any attention to how I dance, so long as I\u2019m happy, it\u2019s all good,\" she said. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t care too much about what others think.\u201d",
      "Even at raves, illegal drugs are rarely seen in China, but promoters still face risks from authorities who have little patience for unapproved social gatherings.",
      "Advertisements promoting raves are often cryptic, with only a date, a DJ line-up, and the cost of admission. Sometimes, the location won\u2019t be revealed until an hour ahead of the party. Some organizers require guests to cover their phone\u2019s camera with a sticker.",
      "Loong Wu said her requirements for a rave spot were no CCTV cameras, no security, and no nearby residents. Even those aren't a guarantee \u2014 local police once busted one of her raves in an industrial port.",
      "\u201cIt was pathetic how few such places exist in the city,\u201d she said.",
      "Frustrated with how hard it was to find a good rave spot, she once organized a public party where she put her DJ equipment on a cart and pushed it through city streets as revelers danced alongside.",
      "\u201cRestrictions exist for sure, but that\u2019s exactly why we need to create our own scene,\u201d she said. \u201cWe always need \u2018wild dances.\u2019 We always need to dance outside of set rules.\u201d",

      "In a press conference, Salazar launched his harshest criticism yet of rampant violence, police corruption and the Mexican government\u2019s mistaken attitude that \u201cthere is no problem.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen they just say \u2018there is no problem, we have these statistics to show people there is no problem,\u2019 that is not based on reality,\u201d\u201c Salazar said. \u201cThere is a very big problem.\u201d",
      "Mexico sent a diplomatic note to the U.S. embassy \u201cexpressing its surprise\u201d at Salazar's statement, the foreign relations ministry said in a statement later Wednesday.",
      "Salazar cited violence in recent days in the northern state of Sinaloa as an example. Sinaloa state police chief Gerardo M\u00e9rida said Wednesday authorities found a pile of between five and seven bodies on a roadside there, but were still counting body parts to see how many there were.",
      "\u201cThere is a pile of various bodies, with what we have found we have identified five bodies, but some are in pieces, they have been dismembered, there are mentions of seven,\u201d said M\u00e9rida.",
      "Sinaloa's embattled governor, Ruben Rocha, seemed to typify Mexico's attitude when he said Tuesday \u2014after a similar number of dead bodies were dumped on roadsides - that \u201cwe're doing well, we'll get over this soon.\u201d",
      "Salazar countered that in Sinaloa \u201cthe dead can be seen everywhere.\u201d",
      "Salazar had previously defended many of the Mexican government\u2019s actions, but he now says former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s \u201chugs not bullets\u201d strategy of not confronting the cartels \u201cdid not work.\u201d",
      "L\u00f3pez Obrador left office on Sept. 30, but his successor, President Claudia Sheinbaum, has pledged to continue the policy, even though under her leadership troops appear more willing to open fire.",
      "Fighting between two factions of the Sinaloa drug cartel broke out after two drug capos \u2014 one from each faction \u2014 flew to the United States and were arrested there on July 25.",
      "Drug lords Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada and Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez were apprehended in the United States after flying there in a small plane.",
      "Zambada later claimed he was kidnapped and forced aboard the plane by Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez, causing a violent battle between Zambada\u2019s faction and the \u201cChapitos\u201d group led by the sons of imprisoned drug lord Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n.",
      "Mexico later blamed the United States for detaining the capos, saying that had caused the outbreak of violence. Salazar said Mexico also shut down anti-drug cooperation after that.",
      "\u201cIt totally accelerated from there, the Mexican government closed its doors,\u201d Salazar said. The ambassador also criticized efforts by both L\u00f3pez Obrador and Sheinbaum to downplay the problem of crime and violence, claiming the problem was being exaggerated and crime statistics were dropping.",
      "Salazar did not clarify why he thought the Mexican government's numbers were untrustworthy, but in recent days the government appears to have changed the way it reports homicide figures.",
      "\u201cThe reality for the Mexican people, and that is for businesspeople, members of the press like you who work on the streets, those who have ranches, like the cattleman killed in Sinaloa over the weekend because he was a leader, they don't live with security,\u201d Salazar said.",
      "The continuing violence \u201cis a very serious problem in Mexico and saying there is no problem, blaming someone else, blaming the United States, obviously is not (the solution)\", he continued.",
      "He also blamed L\u00f3pez Obrador for having refused \u201c$32 million,\" an apparent reference to L\u00f3pez Obrador's decision to drop out of a U.S.-funded program to donate money to train and equip Mexican police.",
      "\u201cIt was rejected for ideological problems, and other explanations,\u201d Salazar said. L\u00f3pez Obrador said at the time he didn't want U.S. helicopters and guns, but by that point most of the U.S. money was going for training, professionalization and legal reform.",
      "After taking office in 2018, L\u00f3pez Obrador also cut funding for police forces and gave the army, navy and militarized National Guard the lead role in law enforcement.",
      "\u201cPolice become corrupt because they don't earn enough to live on,\u201d Salazar said. \u201cYou cannot pay a police officer almost nothing and expect them to do their job.\u201d",
      "Salazar had been previously known for defending L\u00f3pez Obrador despite his constant efforts to militarize law enforcement, concentrate power, eliminate regulatory and oversight bodies and shore up Mexico's government-run companies even at the expense of U.S. firms.",
      "It was unclear if Wednesday's critical turn in his rhetoric was in any way related to the victory of Donald Trump in last week's U.S. presidential elections. Trump has long been fiercely critical of Mexico.",

      "U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken says the Biden administration is determined in its final months to help Ukraine keep fighting its war with Russia next year",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- The Biden administration is determined in its final months to help ensure that Ukraine can keep fighting off Russia's full-scale invasion next year, sending it as much aid as possible so that it might hold Russian forces at bay and possess a strong hand in any potential peace negotiations, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday.",
      "\u201cPresident Biden has committed to making sure that every dollar we have at our disposal will be pushed out the door between now and Jan. 20,\u201d when President-elect Donald Trump is due to be sworn in, Blinken said.",
      "NATO countries must focus their efforts on \u201censuring that Ukraine has the money, munitions and mobilized forces to fight effectively in 2025, or to be able to negotiate a peace from a position of strength,\u201d Blinken said during a visit to Brussels.",
      "The U.S. will \u201cadapt and adjust\u201d with the latest equipment it is sending, Blinken said, without providing details.",
      "The almost three-year war has shown no signs of winding down.",
      "Russia attacked the Ukrainian capital Kyiv with a sophisticated combination of missiles and drones for the first time in 73 days on Wednesday. That came a day after the State Department said most of the North Korean troops sent to help Moscow's war effort are fighting to drive Ukraine's army off Russian soil in the Kursk border region.",
      "Ukraine is also straining to hold back a monthslong Russian onslaught in the eastern Donetsk region.",
      "Political uncertainty over how a U.S. administration under Trump will change Washington\u2019s policy on the war is a key new factor in the conflict. U.S. military aid is vital for Ukraine, but Trump has signaled that he doesn\u2019t want to keep giving tens of billions of dollars to Kyiv.",
      "Air raid warnings blared for hours as Russia targeted eight regions of Ukraine on Wednesday, firing six ballistic and cruise missiles and 90 drones, the Ukrainian air force said.",
      "Air defenses downed four missiles and 37 drones, and another 47 drones were stopped by electronic jamming, the statement said. The damage was being assessed.",
      "Meanwhile, most of the more than 10,000 North Korean troops sent by Pyongyang to help Moscow in the war are engaged in combat in Russia's Kursk border region, State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters Tuesday. A Ukrainian army incursion into Kursk three months ago has succeeded in holding a broad area of land and has embarrassed the Kremlin.",
      "Russia\u2019s military has trained the North Korean soldiers in artillery, drone skills and basic infantry operations, including trench clearing, Patel said. The cooperation faces challenges, including how to achieve military interoperability and overcoming the language barrier, he said.",
      "Kyiv officials say that Russia has deployed around 50,000 troops to Kursk in a bid to dislodge the Ukrainians.",

      "A Norwegian government report says that men earn an average of 13% more than women in egalitarian Norway",
      "OSLO, Norway -- The Norwegian equality minister said Thursday that she found it \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d that men on average earn 13% more than women as she reacted to a government report stressing that the pay gap in egalitarian Norway persists.",
      "The conclusion of the report, which covers the period 2015-2022, was on par with the figures in the European Union of which Norway isn't a member. According to the European Commission, the gender pay gap in the 27-member EU stood at 12.7 % in 2021 and has only changed minimally over the last decade.",
      "The report, which had been commissioned by the Norwegian Ministry of Culture and Equality and was published Thursday, said that since 2015, there has been little change in the wage differences between women and men performing the same work.",
      "\u201cI find it completely unacceptable that women and men who have the same job, the same experience and the same competence, end up with different salaries,\" Culture and Equality Minister Lubna Jaffery told Norwegian news agency NTB.",
      "The report by the Institute for Social Research, concluded that women who work in the same sector, industry and profession, have the same length of education and experience and similar job size, earn 8% less than men. If women also have the same professional title and employer, they earn 6% less than men.",
      "\u201cAn important explanation is that men and women work in different parts of the labor market with different wage levels,\u201d the 122-page Norwegian report said.",
      "\u201cWe show how the wage gap varies across sectors, industries, education groups, occupations and labor market regions,\u201d it said. \u201cWe find that women on average have longer education than men, but within fields of study with lower wages. The gap between men and women with equally long education is therefore larger than between all men and women.\u201d",
      "Norway, a country of 5.6 million, has often been described as at the forefront internationally in terms of gender equality and living standards. According to official Norwegian figures, about 70% of women participate in the workforce.",
      "In October, the annual report from the U.S. Census Bureau said that in 2023, the gender wage gap between men and women working full-time widened year-over-year for the first time in 20 years. It said that women working full time earned 83 cents on the dollar compared to men in 2023, down from a historic high of 84 cents in 2022."

They are due to appear at Salisbury Magistrates\u2019 Court on Dec. 13.",
      "Soon after the spray attack at the UNESCO World Heritage Site, the group Just Stop Oil took responsibility and released video showing a man it identified as Naidu blast a fog of orange from a fire extinguisher at one of the vertical stones. The second protester, identified as Lynch, sprayed three stones before she was stopped. It said the paint was made of cornstarch and would dissolve in the rain.",
      "Following the protest, English Heritage, a charity that manages hundreds of historic sites, said that experts had quickly removed the orange powder from the stones.",
      "Stonehenge was built on a windswept plain in southern England in stages starting 5,000 years ago. Its origin and purpose remain somewhat of a mystery, though the stone circle aligns with the summer solstice sunrise and winter solstice sunset, drawing crowds of spiritualists, druids and sun worshippers.",
      "The publicity stunt was among a long line of disruptive acts by Just Stop Oil to draw attention to the climate crisis. The protests have halted sporting events, sullied famous works of art and caused traffic jams. The acts have led to convictions, jail terms and widespread criticism.",

      "ROME -- A delegation of former hostages held by Hamas in Gaza and their relatives met Thursday with Pope Francis and expressed hope that the incoming and outgoing U.S. administrations would work together to bring the remaining hostages home.",
      "The freed hostages included Yelena Troufanov, who was released last November but whose son Sasha remains in Gaza and appeared in a video released Wednesday by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group.",
      "\u201cYou see in the picture how my child has changed over the course of this year,\u201d Yelena Troufanov told a news conference in Rome after the papal audience. \u201cI am very worried about his condition, I see that he is not in a good mental state and not in a good physical state.\u201d",
      "She and the other former hostages and relatives renewed their calls for a deal to bring the remaining hostages home, especially with winter approaching. They said they hoped the incoming Trump administration would work with the outgoing Biden administration to push the process forward.",
      "The war started when Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and kidnapping 250, with dozens still in Gaza. Israel\u2019s subsequent campaign has killed more than 43,000 people, according to Gaza health officials, whose count doesn't distinguish between civilians and fighters, though they say more than half of the dead are women and children.",
      "The war has ignited a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, driven Israel into increasing international isolation, with two world courts examining charges of war crimes, and had sparked a wave of protests on American campuses that have fueled debate over the U.S. role as Israel\u2019s key military and diplomatic supporter.",

The meeting in the prison's hospital took place after her family and friends had not heard anything from the popular and charismatic symbol of resistance for more than 20 months.",
      "\u201cI finally could embrace her,\u201d Kolesnikov said, adding that she \u201cwas in relatively normal condition.\u201d He said he couldn\u2019t comment further because authorities only allowed the brief meeting on condition that he not release any other details.",

      "Kolesnikova gained prominence when mass protests broke out in Belarus after the widely disputed August 2020 election gave Lukashenko a sixth term. With her close-cropped hair, broad smile and trademark gesture of forming her outstretched hands into the shape of a heart, she often was seen at the front of the demonstrations.",
      "A classical flautist before the protests, Kolesnikova became an even more powerful symbol of defiance the next month when she tore up her passport to avoid deportation when the authorities drove her to the border. A year later, she was convicted of charges including conspiracy to seize power.",
      "Pavel Sapelka of Viasna said allowing Kolesnikova to see her father could be a signal by Lukashenko that he\u2019s open for a dialogue about political prisoners. \"Lukashenko is waiting for Western reaction to the latest steps and is prepared to bargain ahead of January\u2019s election,\u201d Sapelka said."

      "Italy's president has sharply rebuked Elon Musk",
      "ROME -- Italian President Sergio Mattarella sharply rebuked Elon Musk on Wednesday for weighing in on Italian court rulings that have stymied the government\u2019s plans to process some asylum-seekers in Albania.",
      "Musk, who is expected to have a top advisory role in Donald Trump\u2019s new administration, wrote Tuesday on X that \u201cthese judges need to go.\u201d He was referring to the latest Italian court ruling against right-wing Premier Giorgia Meloni\u2019s much-touted Albania immigration deal.",
      "\u201cThis is unacceptable. Do the people of Italy live in a democracy or does an unelected autocracy make the decisions?\u201d he wrote in a subsequent post Wednesday.",
      "The posts concerned a Rome court's refusal to rule on a formal request to detain seven migrants rescued at sea and transferred to Albania for processing. Monday's ruling resulted in the men being brought to Italy for processing.",
      "Mattarella didn\u2019t cite Musk by name but \u2014 in an unusually piqued statement \u2014 made clear on Wednesday that he was referring to him. Italy's head of state demanded respect for the country's sovereignty, especially from other soon-to-be public officials.",
      "\u201cItaly is a great democratic country and \u2026 knows how to take care of itself while respecting its Constitution,\u201d Mattarella said in a statement issued by his spokesman.",
      "\u201cAnyone, particularly if as announced is about to assume an important role of government in a friendly and allied country, must respect its sovereignty and cannot attribute to himself the task of imparting prescriptions,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Trump announced Tuesday that Musk, one of the most influential people around the U.S. president-elect, would help lead a Department of Government Efficiency, essentially an independent advisory panel to eliminate waste and fraud.",
      "Musk is a supporter of Meloni and has met with her in Rome on a few occasions, and in September joined her at an awards ceremony on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. Photos of them together made such news that Musk seemingly felt the need to tamp down speculation by posting \u201cWe are not dating.\u201d",
      "Musk has a history of making provocative statements and sparring with leaders on X. Earlier this year, he posted messages insulting U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and saying the United Kingdom was headed for civil war. He has also clashed with a Brazilian supreme court justice over free speech, far-right accounts and purported misinformation on X, and also accused Venezuela\u2019s socialist president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, of \u201cmajor election fraud\u201d after that country\u2019s disputed election.",
      "Later Wednesday, an Italian representative of X, Andrea Stroppa, tweeted what appeared to be a statement from Musk that said he had spoken during the day with Meloni.

      "PESHAWAR, Pakistan -- A powerful car bomb accidentally detonated at the house of a Pakistani Taliban militant in northwestern Pakistan on Thursday, killing at least two children and five suspected militants, police said.",
      "The explosion took place before dawn in the city of Mir Ali in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province when a man identified a local commander of the militants, Rasool Jan, was fitting a bomb in a car at his house, police official Irfan Khan said.",
      "He said other militants from the Pakistani Taliban group quickly arrived at the scene and removed the bodies of the insurgents who died. Authorities later found the bodies of two children in the rubble of the house, which collapsed in the explosion.",
      "The blast also badly damaged several nearby homes and wounded 14 people, including women. Some of the injured were in critical condition in a hospital, Khan said, but he did not provide details.",
      "The Pakistani Taliban and other insurgents in the region often target security forces with assault rifles, rockets, grenades and suicide car bombings, and Khan said it appeared the car bomb was being prepared for such an attack.",
      "The Pakistani Taliban, known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, are separate from the Afghan Taliban but have been emboldened by the group\u2019s takeover of Afghanistan in 2021.",
      "Also Thursday, security forces raided a hideout of insurgents in Harnai, a district in restive southwestern Balochistan province, triggering an intense shootout in which a soldier and three insurgents were killed.

      "Police have offered little information about the 62-year-old driver who rammed his vehicle into a sports complex in Zhuhai on Monday, mowing down people as they were exercising. They said the man, identified only by his surname of Fan, was upset about his divorce settlement. He was arrested as he tried to flee the scene.",
      "The attack, which also severely injured 43 people, took place on the eve of the Zhuhai Airshow, sponsored by the People\u2019s Liberation Army and held every other year. China often makes extra efforts to tightly control information around major or sensitive events.",

      "On Tuesday and earlier Wednesday, residents laid flowers outside the Zhuhai People's Fitness Plaza in southern Guangdong province. Police presence was light, but the number of officers later increased.",
      "By Wednesday afternoon, authorities had removed the flowers and candles. Uniformed and plainclothes police monitored the area and prevented visitors from gathering or taking photographs. Residents who lingered for longer than a few minutes were asked to leave.",
      "Some visitors continued to lay flowers, but the bouquets were quickly taken away.",

      "COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Denmark\u2019s royal court said Wednesday it will phase out a labeling system dating to the 1800s that grants companies the right to use the image of the Danish crown on their letterhead, packaging and labels.",
      "The five-year renewable designations, including \u201cHolder of the Royal Warrant\u201d and \u201cBy Appointment to the Royal Danish Court\u201d and others, will be phased out by Dec. 31, 2029, the palace said in a statement.",

      "\u201cA system which implies that individual companies can claim special recognition from the Royal House of Denmark for a number of years is no longer in keeping with the times,\u201d the palace said in a statement.",

      "Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House has made many countries anxious and recalculating where they stand with the U.S., but India appears to be welcoming the change that may embolden nationalist leaders like Prime Minister Narendra Modi",
      "NEW DELHI -- Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House has made many countries anxious and recalculating where they stand with the U.S., but India appears to be welcoming the change that may embolden nationalist leaders like Prime Minister Narendra Modi.",
      "\u201cI know today a lot of countries are nervous about the U.S., let\u2019s be honest about that,\u201d India\u2019s External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said over the weekend. India was \u201cnot one of them.\u201d A call from Modi \u201cwas among the first three calls, I think, that President (elect) Trump took,\" he added.",
      "A second Trump presidency is likely to play out in New Delhi\u2019s favor, experts say, especially as Modi seeks to reset India\u2019s relationship with the West after recent frictions over his refusal to join sanctions against Russia or condemn its 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Modi has also been criticized over India's democratic backsliding.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s victory means that the Indian policies that have put New Delhi at odds with the West \u2026 will no longer be a cause of concern for Washington,\u201d said Michael Kugelman, South Asia director at the Wilson Center.",
      "There could be ruptures on trade, immigration and climate change goals \u2014 but on balance, \u201cthe return of Trump means that India\u2019s relations with the West \u2013 and specifically its most powerful country \u2014 will get a boost,\u201d he added.",
      "Modi has sought to cast India as a rising global player with a fast-growing economy that can counter China. But critics say his authoritarian politics and right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party have deeply polarized the country with minorities increasingly marginalized and the right to free speech and press under attack.",
      "When President Joe Biden honored Modi with a state visit last year, he walked a tightrope as activists and groups pressured him to confront Modi over his human rights record. Still, the two leaders rolled out new business deals on defense and technology.",
      "Such concerns won't be an issue with Trump, said Uday Chandra, assistant professor of government at Georgetown University in Qatar. \u201cHe is a refreshing reset from the Indian perspective \u2026 he is much more transactional.\u201d",
      "Trump, long an open admirer of Russian President Vladimir Putin, is also likely to be more understanding of India\u2019s strategic partnership with Moscow, which dates back to the Cold War, its record purchases of Russian crude, and its refusal to pick a side in the war in Ukraine. \u201cThis was the real sort of thorn in India-U.S. relations over the past two years \u2026 but with Trump, I don\u2019t see this being an issue,\u201d Chandra said.",
      "One hot-button issue is trade. In his first term, trade differences between the two countries came to the fore with Trump calling India the \u201ctariff king\u201d over disagreements on farm goods, Harley Davidson motorcycles and medical devices. In 2019, he canceled the country's special trade privileges and India responded by slapping tariffs on more than two dozen U.S. goods.",
      "This time, Trump wants to impose a \u201cuniversal\u201d tax of 10% or 20% on all imports and raise tariffs on Chinese goods to 60%. India, which counts the U.S. as its second-largest trading partner, won't be an exception.",
      "\u201cNew Delhi will have to do more than just tinkering with its policies to deal with Trump\u2019s emphasis on fair trade,\u201d said C Rajamohan, a professor at the Institute of South Asian Studies in Singapore.",
      "Immigration could turn into a sore point if Trump attempts to also curb skilled migration. Indians have often been the largest group applying for the H1-B work visa but Trump had called the visa program \u201cvery bad\u201d and \u201cunfair\u201d for U.S. workers.",
      "Progress on climate change and clean energy could also be hit.",
      "\u201cIndia and the U.S. have done quite a lot on this front over the past four years \u2014 but this is something that could unravel because a Trump administration is more aligned with the fossil fuel industry than with green technology,\u201d said Milan Vaishnav, South Asia Program director at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "Both Trump and Modi embody strongmen tactics, count on an impassioned support base and have ramped up polarization to consolidate votes. And unlike liberal leaders in the West, Trump doesn\u2019t view Modi\u2019s policies at home problematic \u2013 or even relevant, said Kugelman.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re both ardent nationalists committed to making their nations stronger at home and abroad,\u201d he added.",
      "Analysts also point to the personal bond between the two. When Trump visited India in 2020, Modi threw him an event in the world's largest cricket stadium.",
      "The year before that, Trump likened Modi to Elvis Presley for his crowd-pulling power at a joint rally in Texas. In his congratulatory post to Trump on X last week, Modi shared photos of the two leaders hugging, smiling and holding hands.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a bromance between the two,\u201d said Chandra. \"But they're also united by a shared worldview \u2014 that we are in a post- liberal world and that liberalism as an ideology for conducting global politics is no longer viable. That\u2019s as true in India as it is in America.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Wholesale prices in the United States rose last month, remaining low but suggesting that the American economy has yet to completely vanquish inflationary pressure",
      "WASHINGTON -- Wholesale prices in the United States rose last month, remaining low but suggesting that the American economy has yet to completely vanquish inflationary pressure.",
      "Thursday's report from the Labor Department showed that its producer price index \u2014 which tracks inflation before it hits consumers \u2014 rose 0.2% from September to October, up from a 0.1% gain the month before. Compared with a year earlier, wholesale prices were up 2.4%, accelerating from a year-over-year gain of 1.9% in September.",
      "A 0.3% increase in services prices drove the October increase. Wholesale goods prices edged up 0.1% after falling the previous two months. Excluding food and energy prices, which tend to bounce around from month to month, so-called core wholesale prices rose 0.3 from September and 3.1% from a year earlier. The readings were about what economists had expected.",
      "Since peaking in mid-2022, inflation has fallen more or less steadily. But average prices are still nearly 20% higher than they were three years ago \u2014 a persistent source of public exasperation that led to Donald Trump's defeat of Vice President Kamala Harris in last week's presidential election and the return of Senate control to Republicans.",
      "The October report on producer prices comes a day after the Labor Department reported that consumer prices rose 2.6% last month from a year earlier, a sign that inflation at the consumer level might be leveling off after having slowed in September to its slowest pace since 2021. Most economists, though, say they think inflation will eventually resume its slowdown.",
      "Inflation has been moving toward the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% year-over-year target, and the central bank\u2019s inflation fighters have been satisfied enough with the improvement to cut their benchmark interest rate twice since September \u2014 a reversal in policy after they raised rates 11 times in 2022 and 2023.",
      "Trump\u2019s election victory has raised doubts about the future path of inflation and whether the Fed will continue to cut rates. In September, the Fed all but declared victory over inflation and slashed its benchmark interest rate by an unusually steep half-percentage point, its first rate cut since March 2020, when the pandemic was hammering the economy. Last week, the central bank announced a second rate cut, a more typical quarter-point reduction.",
      "Though Trump has vowed to force prices down, in part by encouraging oil and gas drilling, some of his other campaign vows \u2014 to impose massive taxes on imports and to deport millions of immigrants working illegally in the United States \u2014 are seen as inflationary by mainstream economists. Still, Wall Street traders see an 82% likelihood of a third rate cut when the Fed next meets in December, according to the CME FedWatch tool.",
      "The producer price index released Thursday can offer an early look at where consumer inflation might be headed. Economists also watch it because some of its components, notably healthcare and financial services, flow into the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge \u2014 the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, index.",
      "Stephen Brown at Capital Economics wrote in a commentary that higher wholesale airfares, investment fees and healthcare prices in October would push core PCE prices higher than the Fed would like to see. But he said the increase wouldn\u2019t be enough \u201cto justify a pause (in rate cuts) by the Fed at its next meeting in December.\u2033",
      "Inflation began surging in 2021 as the economy accelerated with surprising speed out of the pandemic recession, causing severe shortages of goods and labor. The Fed raised its benchmark interest rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023 to a 23-year high. The resulting much higher borrowing costs were expected to tip the United States into recession. It didn\u2019t happen. The economy kept growing, and employers kept hiring. And, for the most part, inflation has kept slowing.",

      "Operating income for the entertainment segment, which includes its movie studio and parts of its television wing, more than quadrupled to $1.07 billion.",

      "The Walt Disney Co. said Thursday that its direct-to-consumer business, which includes Disney+ and Hulu, reported quarterly operating income of $253 million compared with an operating loss of $420 million a year earlier. Revenue rose 15% to $5.78 billion.",
      "The combined streaming businesses, which includes Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, achieved profitability for the first time in the third quarter.",

      "Iger was confident about the future of Disney's streaming platform on the company's conference call, noting that whenever Disney has success with a movie, or there's expected success for a movie, like with \u201cInside Out 2\u201d and \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\u201d the viewership for previous films, like \u201cInside Out\u201d and \u201cDeadpool,\u201d spikes significantly on its streaming service.

    "story": [
      "One of the nation\u2019s largest meat processors has agreed to pay $2 million to resolve allegations of child labor violations at a plant in Minnesota",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- Smithfield Foods, one of the nation\u2019s largest meat processors, has agreed to pay $2 million to resolve allegations of child labor violations at a plant in Minnesota, officials announced Thursday.",
      "An investigation by the Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry found that the Smithfield Packaged Meats subsidiary employed at least 11 children at its plant in St. James ages 14 to 17 from April 2021 through April 2023, the agency said. Three of them began working for the company when they were 14, it said. Smithfield let nine of them work after allowable hours and had all 11 perform potentially dangerous work, the agency alleged.",
      "As part of the settlement, Smithfield also agreed to steps to ensure future compliance with child labor laws. U.S. law prohibits companies from employing people younger than 18 to work in meat processing plants because of hazards.",
      "State Labor Commissioner Nicole Blissenbach said the agreement \"sends a strong message to employers, including in the meat processing industry, that child labor violations will not be tolerated in Minnesota.\u201d",
      "The Smithfield, Virginia-based company said in a statement that it denies knowingly hiring anyone under age 18 to work at the St. James plant, and that it did not admit liability under the settlement. The company said all 11 passed the federal E-Verify employment eligibility system by using false identification. Smithfield also said it takes a long list of proactive steps to enforce its policy prohibiting the employment of minors.",
      "\u201cSmithfield is committed to maintaining a safe workplace and complying with all applicable employment laws and regulations,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe wholeheartedly agree that individuals under the age of 18 have no place working in meatpacking or processing facilities.\u201d",
      "The state agency said the $2 million administrative penalty is the largest it has recovered in a child labor enforcement action. It also ranks among the larger recent child labor settlements nationwide. It follows a $300,000 agreement that Minnesota reached last year with another meat processer, Tony Downs Food Co., after the agency's investigation found it employed children as young as 13 at its plant in Madelia.",
      "Also last year, the U.S. Department of Labor levied over $1.5 million in civil penalties against one of the country\u2019s largest cleaning services for food processing companies, Packers Sanitation Services Inc., after finding it employed more than 100 children in dangerous jobs at 13 meatpacking plants across the country.",
      "After that investigation, the Biden administration urged U.S. meat processors to make sure they aren't illegally hiring children for dangerous jobs. The call, in a letter by Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack to the 18 largest meat and poultry producers, was part of a broader crackdown on child labor. The Labor Department then reported a 69% increase since 2018 in the number of children being employed illegally in the U.S.",
      "In other recent settlements, a Mississippi processing plant, Mar-Jac Poultry, agreed in August to a $165,000 settlement with the U.S. Department of Labor following the death of a 16-year-old boy. In May 2023, a Tennessee-based sanitation company, Fayette Janitorial Service LLC, agreed to pay nearly $650,000 in civil penalties after a federal investigation found it illegally hired at least two dozen children to clean dangerous meat processing facilities in Iowa and Virginia.",

      "The purchase of Alex Jones\u2019 Infowars at a bankruptcy auction by the satirical news publication The Onion is the latest twist in a yearslong saga",
      "The purchase of Alex Jones ' Infowars at a bankruptcy auction by the satirical news publication The Onion is the latest twist in a yearslong saga between the far-right conspiracy theorist and families of Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims.",
      "The sale was ordered after relatives of many of the 20 children and six educators killed in the 2012 shooting successfully sued Jones and his company for defamation and emotional distress. Jones repeatedly made false claims on his show that the Newtown, Connecticut, shooting was a hoax staged by crisis actors to spur more gun control.",
      "Here are some things to know about how Jones' misinformation empire ended up on the auction block.",
      "Fresh out of high school in the early 1990s, Jones, a barrel-chested, gravelly voiced Texas native, started broadcasting on a public-access television channel in the state capital. From the start, Jones promoted conspiracies about the U.S. government and false claims about a secret New World Order.",
      "In 2004, Jones had two employees and a tiny office in south Austin. In 2007, he formed Free Speech Systems, to run his growing media business, according to court records in his bankruptcy cases. By 2010, Jones had over 60 employees.",
      "As the outlandish nature of his false claims grew, so did his media empire, with annual revenues of up to $80 million, and a fanbase that at his height listened to him on more than 100 radio stations across the United States as well as through his Infowars website and social media.",
      "Jones has acknowledged in court that he promoted the conspiracy theory that the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre was a hoax perpetrated in part by the U.S. government as part of an effort to expand gun control. He called the parents of slain children \u201ccrisis actors\u201d on his show and said the shooting was \u201cphony as a three-dollar bill.\u201d",
      "After separate defamation lawsuits were filed in Connecticut and Texas by family members of victims, Jones acknowledged in 2022 that the shooting was \u201c100% real\u201d and said it was \u201cabsolutely irresponsible\u201d to call it a hoax.",
      "Victims\u2019 families who sued Jones said they were subjected to years of torment, threats and abuse by people who believed the lies told on his show.",
      "Courts in Texas and Connecticut found Jones liable for defamation for his portrayal of the Sandy Hook massacre as a hoax and awarded the families nearly $1.5 billion in damages. In both states, the judges issued default judgments finding Jones liable without trials because he failed to respond to court orders and turn over many documents. Juries then heard evidence and decided on the amount of damages, with judges tacking on additional penalties.",
      "The auctions resulted from Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy case, which he filed in late 2022. Many of Jones\u2019 personal assets also are being liquidated to help pay the judgment. Up for sale was everything from Jones\u2019 studio desk to Infowars\u2019 name, video archive, social media accounts and product trademarks. Buyers could even purchase an armored truck and video cameras.",
      "The Onion acquired Infowars' website; social media accounts; studio in Austin, Texas; trademarks; and video archive. The sale price was not disclosed.",
      "After the sale was announced, Infowars\u2019 website was down and Jones was broadcasting from what he said was a new studio location.",
      "Jones vowed to challenge the sale and auction process in court."

    "story": [
      "A hacking group that is believed to be Chinese state-sponsored has compromised two websites with ties to the Tibetan community in an attack meant to install malware on users\u2019 computers",
      "BANGKOK -- A hacking group that is believed to be Chinese state-sponsored has compromised two websites with ties to the Tibetan community in an attack meant to install malware on users' computers, according to findings released Wednesday by a private cybersecurity firm.",
      "The hack of the Tibet Post and Gyudmed Tantric University websites appears geared toward obtaining access to the computers of people visiting to obtain information on them and their activities, according to the analysis by the Insikt Group, the threat research division of the Massachusetts-based cybersecurity consultancy Recorded Future.",
      "The hackers, known in the report as TAG-112, compromised the websites so that visitors are prompted to download a malicious executable file disguised as a security certificate, Insikt Group said. Once opened, the file loads Cobalt Strike Beacon malware on the user's computer that can be used for key logging, file transferring and other purposes, including deploying additional malware.",
      "\u201cWhile we do not have visibility into the activity that TAG-112 conducted on compromised devices in this campaign, given their likely cyber espionage remit and the targeting of the Tibetan community, it is almost certain that they were engaged in information collection and/or surveillance rather than destructive attacks,\u201d Insikt Group senior director Jon Condra told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cThis behavior aligns with historical targeting of the Tibetan community,\u201d he said.",
      "Chinese authorities have consistently denied any form of state-sponsored hacking, saying China itself is a major target of cyberattacks.",
      "The Chinese Foreign Ministry said it was not aware of the hacking of the two websites reported by the Insikt Group.",
      "\u201cChina's stance on the issue of cybersecurity is consistent and clear,\u201d the ministry said in a faxed reply to a request for comment without elaborating.",
      "According to the Insikt group research, the sites were first compromised in late May and the attacks bear many overlaps with a previously tracked hacker group known as TAG-102, leading analysts to conclude it is a subgroup of the already known group \u201cworking toward the same or similar intelligence requirements,\u201d Insikt Group said.",
      "Overlaps include reuse of specific tactics, techniques and procedures and going after identical targets, Condra said.",
      "\u201cThese two threat clusters are almost certainly interrelated,\u201d he said.",
      "TAG-102, known by multiple names such as Evasive Panda and StormBamboo, has been in operation since as early as 2012, and is widely thought to be a Chinese-sponsored advanced persistent threat, or APT, group, Insikt Group said.",
      "Among other things, it uses custom malware frameworks used by other Chinese APT groups and its targeting \u201caligns with likely Chinese intelligence requirements,\u201d Condra said.",
      "\u201cThe group has engaged in a wide variety of campaigns over the years, with an emphasis on targeting individuals and organizations in opposition to the Chinese government, such as human rights organizations, religious organizations, ethnic minority groups, academic institutions, and supporters of democracy or independence movements in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and even in mainland China,\u201d Insikt Group said.",
      "The university and the news website, which are both located in India, have been informed by Insikt Group of the hack. As of this week, it appears the Gyudmed Tantric University, which is a place of learning about Tibetan Buddhism, language, history and culture, has remediated the problem while the news website remained compromised, Condra said.",
      "The Tibet Post is known for promoting democracy, freedom of speech and for advocating Tibetan independence from China, he said.",
      "China claims Tibet has been part of its territory for centuries, although it only established firm control over the Himalayan region after the Communist Party swept to power during a civil war in 1949.",
      "Many Tibetans' loyalties still lie with the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader who has lived in exile in India since a failed anti-Chinese uprising in 1959.",
      "China has been regularly accused of human rights abuses in Tibet, including earlier this year over its efforts to forcibly urbanize villagers and herders as part of a drive to assimilate rural Tibetans through control over their language and traditional Buddhist culture."

      "DETROIT -- General Motors is recalling nearly 462,000 pickup trucks and big SUVs with diesel engines because the rear wheels can lock up, increasing the risk of a crash.",
      "The recall in the U.S. covers certain Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 1500, 2500 and 3500 pickups from the 2020 through 2022 model years. Also included are the 2021 Cadillac Escalade, GMC Yukon and Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban.",
      "Documents posted Wednesday on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website say a transmission control valve can wear out over time. In rare cases it can fail and lock up the rear wheels. Drivers may notice harsh shifting before any wheel problems.",
      "GM says in documents that dealers will install new transmission control software that will monitor the valve and detect excess wear 10,000 miles before the wheels lock up. If wear is detected, the transmission will be limited to fifth gear, preventing wheel lockup, which happens when the transmission downshifts from eighth gear.",
      "GM will provide warranty coverage to fix transmissions that have a defective control valve.",
      "Owners will be notified of the recall by letter on Dec. 9.",
      "Documents say GM discussed an owner complaint about the problem with U.S. safety regulators in January and GM began an investigation in July. In September, a GM investigator found 1,888 reports of wheel lock up possibly related to the condition. The company also found 11 potentially related incidents including vehicles veering off the road, in some cases causing minor property damage. Three minor injuries were reported, although GM said they were not associated with a crash."

      "LIMA, Peru -- If things had gone differently last week, U.S. President Joe Biden could have arrived at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Peru on Thursday projecting confidence and pledging his successor\u2019s cooperation with eager Latin American partners. No longer.",
      "Just as in 2016, the last time that Peru\u2019s capital Lima hosted APEC, Donald Trump\u2019s election victory has pulled the rug out from under a lame-duck Democrat at the high-profile summit attended by over a dozen world leaders.",
      "The renewed prospect of Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d doctrine hampers Biden\u2019s ability to reinforce the United States\u2019 profile on his first presidential trip to South America, experts say, leaving China and its leader, Xi Jinping, to grab the limelight in America\u2019s proverbial backyard.",
      "President Xi\u2019s first order of business in Peru is inaugurating a $1.3 billion megaport that will put China\u2019s regional influence on stark display. Total investment is expected to top $3.5 billion over the next decade.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t the way the U.S. had hoped to participate in the summit,\u201d said Margaret Myers, the director of the China and Latin America program at the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington policy group. \u201cAll eyes are going to be on the port, what Xi says about it and how he articulates relations across the Pacific.\u201d",
      "With the U.S. seemingly headed back toward isolationism under Trump, \u201cChina will be seen as the alternative,\u201d Myers added.",
      "Sitting 60 kilometers (37 miles) northeast of Lima, the Chancay megaport \u2014 once a serene fishing village \u2014 is perhaps the clearest sign of Latin America's reorientation. The Chinese shipping and logistics giant Cosco holds a 60% stake in the project it developed with Peruvian partner, Volcan.",
      "\u201cWith this port, we\u2019re looking at the entire Pacific coast, from the United States and Canada all the way to Chile,\u201d Peruvian Foreign Minister Elmer Schialer told The Associated Press in his office on Monday. \u201cThe shipping business is being transformed.\u201d",
      "Peruvian Economy Minister Jos\u00e9 Arista said in June during a visit to China that the country\u2019s neighbors \u2014 Brazil, Colombia, Chile \u2014 are \u201cmaking constant trips to and from to see how they can modify their supply chain to use this port,\u201d which will cut shipping time to Beijing by 10 days.",
      "China\u2019s trade with the region ballooned 35-fold from 2000 to 2022, reaching nearly $500 billion, according to data from the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean. Most of the region's exports came from South America, and were concentrated in five products: soybeans, copper and iron ore, oil and copper cathodes.",
      "At the same time, China\u2019s diplomatic engagement in the region has become more effective, with Xi visiting 11 Latin American countries since becoming president, according to Xinhua, China\u2019s main state news agency. Brazil, host of the G20 summit, and Peru will bestow the rare honor of a full state visit to Xi this month, but not to Biden.",
      "The misguided notion that Latin America must choose between its two largest trading partners is \u201ca strategic defeat\u201d for the U.S., said Eric Farnsworth, vice president at the Washington-based Council of the Americas.",
      "\u201cThe idea that China is somehow a better partner is increasingly being heard around the region and I think Xi wants to solidify that and amplify that,\u201d Farnsworth said.",
      "Roughly a decade after China poured billions of dollars into building power plants, roads, airports and other infrastructure that saddled some developing countries with unserviceable debt, few expect Beijing to direct more massive loans to Latin America through its Belt and Road Initiative. But deeper cooperation on other infrastructure is possible, particularly renewable energy and telecommunications, said the Boston University bulletin.",
      "The U.S. has appealed to Latin American governments to reject telecoms investment, particularly opposing Huawei, the Chinese tech giant that it argues could open the door to Chinese government spying. Similarly, U.S. officials have raised concerns over the Chancay port\u2019s possible dual-use by Beijing\u2019s navy in the Pacific \u2014 a prospect dismissed by Chinese officials.",
      "China \u201cis working to exploit insecurity in our hemisphere,\u201d said U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin at the Southern Command headquarters in Florida this week, adding that the Asian giant is leveraging the need for investment in the Americas to advance its \u201cmalign agenda.\u201d",
      "Despite its objections to Chinese influence, the U.S. hasn\u2019t shown the ability or willingness to build infrastructure like Chancay's megaport, experts note.",
      "Even when the U.S. government has worked to ensure competitive bidding in Latin American massive public works projects, American companies have refrained from participating, said Benjamin Gedan, director of the Wilson Center\u2019s Latin America Program.",
      "A Kamala Harris administration wouldn\u2019t have changed that, but a Democratic victory would have enabled Biden to speak in Lima with authority about U.S. collaboration to come, such as building regional supply chains, Gedan said.",
      "In sharp contrast to Biden\u2019s alliance-building approach, Trump has vowed to protect American interests and promised more of the same unilateralist action the world saw in his first term, when he staked out a combative stance against foreign competitors and deepened the U.S. trade war with China.",
      "In 2022, Biden launched the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework to help integrate economies of the region and enable the U.S. to counterbalance China. But last year, on the campaign trail, Trump said he would kill the trade pact if he were to win the 2024 election and return to the White House \u2014 in the same way he pulled the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership immediately after taking office in 2017.",
      "In the years since, U.S. clout in South America has diminished while China\u2019s has grown, said Farnsworth, recalling how the last time Lima hosted APEC in 2016, the shock of Trump\u2019s victory sucked the energy out of then-President Barack Obama\u2019s delegation.",
      "Peru\u2019s top diplomat insists that the U.S. hasn\u2019t ceded its dominant voice guiding discussions about trade at gatherings such as APEC \u2014 and doubted that it will, even under Trump.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure that Trump will go against these types of multilateral contexts just because he is worried about the American people,\u201d Schialer said. \u201cHe knows that the U.S. is too important for the world. We have to sit down and have a nice dialogue and see how we can face these challenges together.\u201d",
      "Yet, in the wake of Trump\u2019s win and China\u2019s port opening in Peru, analysts expect the hard-nosed competition between the U.S. and China to overshadow APEC this week.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese love the idea of outmaneuvering the U.S. in its near-abroad,\u201d Gedan said. \u201cXi will luxuriate in this dynamic of being able to arrive with a big delegation, (...) to inaugurate this transformational port and suck all the air out of the room when his American counterpart is very weak politically. That is significant to China.\u201d",

      "Denmark\u2019s royal court says it will phase out a labeling system dating to the 1800s that grants companies the right to use the image of the Danish crown on their letterhead, packaging and labels",
      "COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Denmark\u2019s royal court said Wednesday it will phase out a labeling system dating to the 1800s that grants companies the right to use the image of the Danish crown on their letterhead, packaging and labels.",
      "The five-year renewable designations, including \u201cHolder of the Royal Warrant\u201d and \u201cBy Appointment to the Royal Danish Court\u201d and others, will be phased out by Dec. 31, 2029, the palace said in a statement.",
      "Currently, there are 104 Danish suppliers and five foreign companies who can use such designations and images of the Danish crown on their products.",
      "\u201cA system which implies that individual companies can claim special recognition from the Royal House of Denmark for a number of years is no longer in keeping with the times,\u201d the palace said in a statement.",
      "The title was first granted to a company in 1840. Originally, such designations were given to companies or tradesmen who continually supplied goods or services to the royals. In recent years, however, several of the companies which supply goods or services to the royal household are not on the list of Royal Warrant holders.",
      "King Frederik took over Denmark's throne last January after his mother, Queen Margrethe II, then Europe\u2019s longest-serving monarch, became the first Danish monarch to voluntarily relinquish the throne in nearly 900 years. Margrethe had stunned the nation when she announced during her traditional New Year\u2019s Eve speech that she would step down for health reasons.",
      "The abdication has left Denmark with two queens: Margrethe keeps her title, while Frederik\u2019s wife becomes Queen Mary. Frederik and Mary\u2019s eldest son Christian, 18, is now the crown prince and heir to the throne."

    "story": [
      "Deep breathing can be a simple and effective way to reduce stress",
      "NEW YORK -- A simple, uncommon ritual starts each staff meeting at Myosin Marketing. When everyone is gathered on Zoom, and before they get to the meat of the agenda, CEO Sean Clayton leads his team through a deep-breathing exercise.",
      "The practice sets the tone for the meeting, and helps his employees, most of whom work remotely, to feel safe, grounded and willing to take creative risks, he said.",
      "\u201cAt first they thought it was really weird, like, \u2018What are we doing?\u2019\u201d Clayton said. \u201cThere were a lot of cameras off and I\u2019m sure a lot of people were like, \u2018This is awkward.\u2019\" But after a couple of weeks, there was a shift. Employees of the Austin, Texas company were saying, 'This feels good,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "Deep breathing can be an effective way to reduce stress at work, studies show. But on the job, many people don\u2019t think about how they\u2019re inhaling and exhaling.",
      "Desk workers sitting a computer tend to take shallow breaths as their shoulders creep up. Workers who spend the day on their feet in retail or health care may be too busy to focus on breathing.",
      "But there's good reason to remember to pause to take deep breaths. Chronic, unmanaged stress, which increases the risk of heart disease and stroke, can be as harmful to our health as secondhand smoke, according to the American Heart Association. Research suggests deep-breathing exercises can lower a person's blood pressure and reduce anxiety.",
      "Other benefits: deep breathing is free, can be done anywhere and doesn't require taking a half-hour to meditate. Spending just a minute or two breathing deeply can help calm racing thoughts, experts say.",
      "\u201cIt relaxes my mind. It makes my mind so full of ease,\u201d Lisa Marie Deleveaux, a marketing professional and mother of five, said. \u201cIt brings you back to the present moment.\u201d",
      "Deleveaux was laid off several months ago and has struggled to find a new job. She wakes most mornings at 4 or 5 a.m., before the children, to do breathing exercises. One is a technique known as alternate nostril breathing, a yoga exercise that involves inhaling through one nostril and out through another, using a thumb or forefinger to hold one nostril closed at a time.",
      "\u201cIf you set a priority for yourself ... you can make the time,\u201d Deleveaux said.",
      "Focusing on breathing for one to five minutes \"can help you clear the slate and wipe all these things out of your mind...and allow you to get back to focusing on the one thing you want to accomplish,\u201d said cardiologist Glenn Levine, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. \u201cThe best analogy is turning your computer off when you have 37 programs (open) and it freezes.\u201d",
      "A good way to do deep breathing exercises is while sitting on a bench outside, Levine said. If that\u2019s not an option, doing it at a desk works.",
      "\u201cEither turn off your screen or just put something blank on the screen so people think you\u2019re still working,\" Levine said. \u201cInstead of focusing on the screen or work, just focus on your breathing. If possible, close your eyes.\u201d",
      "There are other ways to fit in breathing exercises. To get ahead of anxiety before starting a day of cold calls, sales development representative Lindsay Carlisle does breathing exercises with her 7-year-old daughter during the drive to school. They breathe in for seven counts, hold their breath for five, breathe out for seven counts, and then repeat the cycle several times.",
      "\u201cThroughout that process, my shoulders start to drop on their own, and it really is calming,\u201d Carlisle, who lives in Flint, Michigan, said. \u201cI\u2019m not a yoga instructor. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing, but it works.\u201d",
      "Suze Yalof Schwartz was an overworked fashion editor when her mother-in-law taught her a three-minute meditation technique that she says changed her life. She gave up her fashion career and founded Unplug Meditation, a Santa Monica, California, company with a meditation studio, an app and programs for corporate clients.",
      "\u201cWhen we slow down our breath, we send a signal to our brain that everything\u2019s OK, even when it\u2019s not,\" she said.",
      "A 16-second breathing technique she's taught to firefighters, police officers, doctors and others is called the box breathing technique. You breathe in for four counts, hold for four, breathe out for four counts and hold for four.",
      "\u201cIt is the best thing that you can do at work before you have a meeting, before you send out an email that you wish you didn\u2019t send, before you have a difficult conversation, because it just calms you down, gets rid of your negative energy,\" Yalof Schwartz said.",
      "Employers such as Coca-Cola, Mattel and Netflix have hired Unplug Meditation to teach breathing or meditation.",
      "It's not always easy for workers to find space for deep breathing exercises. For example, in retail jobs, workers often mix with customers. Yalof Schwartz recommends doing breathing exercises when ringing up a sale or folding clothes. You can also take a deep breath right before walking through a door.",
      "Office workers can set a timer on their phones to remind themselves to breathe deeply. That's what Carlisle, the sales representative, does. She also keeps a Post-it note on her monitor that says \u201cBreathe.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe anxiety is always going to be there,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cBut at least I know I have one small tool. ... It sounds so simple and silly, but it works.\u201d",

      "The companies agreed to a $8.5 billion deal in August 2023 that would have united Capri, the maker of Versace, Jimmy Choo and Michael Kors shoes, handbags and accessories, with Tapestry, which produces the same products under the Coach, Kate Spade New York, and Stuart Weitzman brands.",
      "But the deal has faced numerous obstacles.",

      "Last month, a U.S. District judge halted the merger, saying it would reduce competition and hurt consumers.",
      "Tapestry and Capri filed a notice to jointly appeal the decision, but Tapestry said Thursday the outcome of the legal process is \u201cuncertain and unlikely to be resolved by the February 10, 2025 outside date.\u201d",

      "Italy's president has sharply rebuked Elon Musk",
      "ROME -- Italian President Sergio Mattarella sharply rebuked Elon Musk on Wednesday for weighing in on Italian court rulings that have stymied the government\u2019s plans to process some asylum-seekers in Albania.",
      "Musk, who is expected to have a top advisory role in Donald Trump\u2019s new administration, wrote Tuesday on X that \u201cthese judges need to go.\u201d He was referring to the latest Italian court ruling against right-wing Premier Giorgia Meloni\u2019s much-touted Albania immigration deal.",
      "\u201cThis is unacceptable. Do the people of Italy live in a democracy or does an unelected autocracy make the decisions?\u201d he wrote in a subsequent post Wednesday.",
      "The posts concerned a Rome court's refusal to rule on a formal request to detain seven migrants rescued at sea and transferred to Albania for processing. Monday's ruling resulted in the men being brought to Italy for processing.",
      "Mattarella didn\u2019t cite Musk by name but \u2014 in an unusually piqued statement \u2014 made clear on Wednesday that he was referring to him. Italy's head of state demanded respect for the country's sovereignty, especially from other soon-to-be public officials.",
      "\u201cItaly is a great democratic country and \u2026 knows how to take care of itself while respecting its Constitution,\u201d Mattarella said in a statement issued by his spokesman.",
      "\u201cAnyone, particularly if as announced is about to assume an important role of government in a friendly and allied country, must respect its sovereignty and cannot attribute to himself the task of imparting prescriptions,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Trump announced Tuesday that Musk, one of the most influential people around the U.S. president-elect, would help lead a Department of Government Efficiency, essentially an independent advisory panel to eliminate waste and fraud.",
      "Musk is a supporter of Meloni and has met with her in Rome on a few occasions, and in September joined her at an awards ceremony on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. Photos of them together made such news that Musk seemingly felt the need to tamp down speculation by posting \u201cWe are not dating.\u201d",
      "Musk has a history of making provocative statements and sparring with leaders on X. Earlier this year, he posted messages insulting U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and saying the United Kingdom was headed for civil war. He has also clashed with a Brazilian supreme court justice over free speech, far-right accounts and purported misinformation on X, and also accused Venezuela\u2019s socialist president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, of \u201cmajor election fraud\u201d after that country\u2019s disputed election.",
      "Later Wednesday, an Italian representative of X, Andrea Stroppa, tweeted what appeared to be a statement from Musk that said he had spoken during the day with Meloni. According to Stroppa's tweet, Musk \u201cexpresses his respect\u201d for Mattarella and the Italian Constitution but insists on his right to freedom of expression.",
      "The courts\u2019 rulings have raised the ire of Meloni\u2019s far-right-led government, which has been seeking strategies to ease the strain on Italy of the arrival of migrants seeking a better life in Europe. The government had held up the opening of the Albanian centers as a centerpiece of its immigration crackdown, also as a means of deterrence, and said they could be a model for Europe.",
      "In both cases, Italian courts referred the cases to the EU court of justice in Luxembourg to rule if the countries of origin for the migrants are considered safe for repatriation. There is no word on when the European court might rule.",
      "But as a result of the Rome court decisions, no migrant has yet been processed in the Albanian centers, which are budgeted to cost Italy 670 million euros ($730 million) over five years to build and operate.",
      "Italy's opposition says the money could be much better spent on reinforcing Italian-operated migrant processing centers, while human rights groups say the outsourcing of asylum processing contravenes international law.",
      "The centers opened in October after a months-long delay, because crumbling soil at one of the facilities needed to be repaired. They are run by Italy and are under the country's jurisdiction, while Albanian guards provide external security."

      "South Africa\u2019s government says it will not help a group of illegal miners inside a closed mine in the country\u2019s North West province as part of an official policy against illegal mining",
      "JOHANNESBURG -- South Africa's government says it won't help a group of illegal miners inside a closed mine in the country's North West province who have been denied access to basic supplies as part of an official strategy against illegal mining.",
      "The miners in the mineshaft in Stilfontein are believed to be suffering from a lack of food, water and other basic necessities after police closed off the entrances used to transport their supplies underground.",
      "It is part of the police\u2019s Vala Umgodi, or Close the Hole, operation, which includes cutting off miners\u2019 supplies to force them to return to the surface and be arrested.",
      "Police had earlier indicated that information received from those who recently helped bring three miners to the surface indicated that up to 4,000 miners may be underground.",
      "However, on Thursday afternoon police spokesperson Athlenda Mathe said that they believed the number was exaggerated and maybe be far less than that, estimating a figure of between 350 and 400 miners.",
      "\"We feel that the numbers are being exaggerated. We have deployed maximum resources to this case including our intelligence operative who are on the ground who have engaged with all stakeholders.",
      "\u201cWe have managed to estimate the numbers to be between 350 and 400,\u201d Mathe said.",
      "South African ministers of police and defence are on Thursday expected to visit the mine to engage with officials and community members on the ground, Mathe said.",
      "Stilfontein is one of the mines that were targeted by police as they intensified their operation in the North West province from Oct. 18.",
      "It's unclear how long the current group of miners have been underground as the groups are reported to often stay underground for months, depending on supplies of basic necessities like food and water from the outside.",
      "\u201cWe have taken a decision that no police officer, no soldier or government official will go down to an abandoned mine. There is a high risk of loss of life,\u201d she said.",
      "Mathe said they had information that the miners may be heavily armed, adding that since embarking on operations against illegal miners since last December, police had seized more than 369 high caliber firearms, 10,000 rounds of ammunition, 5 million rand ($275,000) in cash and 32 million rand ($1.75 million) worth of uncut diamonds.",
      "In the past few weeks, more than 1,000 miners have surfaced at various mines in North West province, with many reported to be weak, hungry and sickly after going for weeks without basic supplies.",
      "Police continue on Thursday to guard areas around the mine to catch all those appearing from underground.",
      "Cabinet Minister Khumbudzo Ntshavheni told reporters on Wednesday that the government wouldn't send any help to the illegal miners, because they are involved in a criminal act.",
      "\u201cWe are not sending help to criminals. We are going to smoke them out. They will come out. Criminals are not to be helped. We didn\u2019t send them there,\" Ntshavheni said.",
      "Illegal mining remains common in South Africa's old gold-mining areas, with miners going into closed shafts to dig for any possible remaining deposits.",
      "The illegal miners are often from neighboring countries, and police say the illegal operations involve larger syndicates that employ the miners.",
      "Their presence in closed mines have also created problems with nearby communities, which complain that the illegal miners commit crimes ranging from robberies to rape.",
      "Illegal mining groups are known to be heavily armed, and disputes between rival groups sometimes result in fatal confrontations."

      "An insurance magnate who was once a big political donor in North Carolina has pleaded guilty related to what prosecutors call a $2 billion scheme to defraud insurance regulators, policyholders and others",
      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- An insurance magnate who was once a big political donor in North Carolina is in federal custody after pleading guilty in connection to what prosecutors call a $2 billion scheme to defraud insurance regulators, policyholders and others through a myriad of companies from which he skimmed funds for personal benefit.",
      "Greg E. Lindberg, 54, of Tampa, Florida, entered the plea on Tuesday in Charlotte before U.S. Magistrate Judge David Keesler to one count of conspiracy to commit offenses against the United States and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, according to legal documents.",
      "Lindberg, who had been indicted on 13 counts in February 2023, could face a maximum of 10 years in prison on the money laundering conspiracy count and five years on the other conspiracy count, a U.S. Department of Justice news release said.",
      "Lindberg, who lived previously in Durham, North Carolina, was already awaiting sentencing after he and an associate were convicted in May by a federal jury of attempting to bribe North Carolina's elected insurance commissioner to secure preferential regulatory treatment for his insurance business. The two had initially been convicted on two counts in 2020, but a federal appeals court vacated those convictions and ordered new trials.",
      "A document signed by Lindberg and government lawyers serving as the factual basis for Tuesday's plea said that from no later than 2016 through at least 2019 Lindberg and others conspired to engage in crimes associated with insurance business, wire fraud and investment adviser fraud. He and others also worked to deceive the state Insurance Department and other regulators by avoiding regulatory requirements, concealing the condition of his companies and using insurance company funds for himself, a news release said.",
      "It all resulted in companies that Lindberg controlled investing more than $2 billion in loans and other securities with his own affiliated companies, and Lindberg and co-conspirators laundering the scheme's proceeds, according to the government. The 2023 indictment alleged that Lindberg personally benefited by \u201cforgiving\u201d more than $125 million in loans to himself from the insurance companies that he controlled, the news release said.",
      "\u201cLindberg created a complex web of insurance companies, investment businesses, and other business entities and exploited them to engage in millions of dollars of circular transactions. Lindberg\u2019s actions harmed thousands of policyholders, deceived regulators, and caused tremendous risk for the insurance industry,\u201d U.S. Attorney Dena J. King for the Western District of North Carolina said. The FBI and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also were involved in the investigation.",
      "There was no immediate response to emails sent Wednesday about Tuesday's plea to a Lindberg attorney and a website associated with Lindberg's wellness and leadership activities.",
      "A sentencing date has not yet been set. Lindberg, who surrendered Tuesday to U.S. marshals, asked that he be held in a halfway house in Tampa before sentencing. Kessler scheduled another hearing on the matter for next week. After his initial conviction on bribery-related counts in 2020, a judge sentenced Lindberg to more than seven years in prison.",
      "Lindberg previously had given more than $5 million to state and federal candidates and committees since 2016, favoring Republicans but also giving to Democrats.",
      "The U.S. Justice Department said one of Lindberg\u2019s top executives still awaits sentencing after pleading guilty in late 2022 in a related case to conspiring with Lindberg and others to defraud the United States related to a scheme to move money between insurance companies and other businesses Lindberg owned.",
      "Some of Lindberg's insurance companies have been placed into liquidation and under a process to regain financial health, the Justice Department said.",
      "North Carolina Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey said in a news release on Wednesday that he and his state agency would keep working with federal prosecutors to ensure that \u201cany money recovered through the restitution and forfeiture process will be used to repay the policyholder victims.\u201d",
      "Jurors determined that Lindberg and a former consultant attempted to bribe Causey in the late 2010s. Causey wasn\u2019t accused of wrongdoing \u2014 he alerted authorities and recorded conversations that served as the basis of 2019 indictments against Lindberg and three others."

    "summary": "Japan&rsquo;s nuclear watchdog has formally disqualified a reactor in the country&rsquo;s north-central region from starting",
    "story": [
      "Japan\u2019s nuclear watchdog has formally disqualified a reactor in the country\u2019s north-central region from starting",
      "TOKYO -- Japan's nuclear watchdog on Wednesday formally disqualified a reactor in the country's north-central region from restarting, the first rejection under safety standards that were reinforced after the 2011 Fukushima disaster. The decision is a setback for Japan as it seeks to accelerate reactor restarts to maximize nuclear power.",
      "The Nuclear Regulation Authority said the Tsuruga No. 2 reactor is \u201cunfit\u201d as its operator failed to address safety risks stemming from the presence of possible active fault lines, which can potentially cause earthquakes, underneath it.",
      "Tsuruga No. 2, operated by the Japan Atomic Power Co., is the first reactor to be rejected under safety standards adopted in 2013 based on lessons from the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi meltdown disaster following a massive earthquake and tsunami.",
      "\u201cWe reached our conclusion based on a very strict examination,\u201d NRA chairperson Shinsuke Yamanaka told reporters.",
      "The verdict comes after more than eight years of safety reviews that were repeatedly disrupted by data coverups and mistakes by the operator, Yamanaka said. He called the case \u201cabnormal\u201d and urged the utility to take the result seriously.",
      "The decision is a blow to Japan Atomic Power because it virtually ends its hopes for a restart. The operator, which is decommissioning its other reactor, Tsuruga No. 1, had hoped to put No. 2 back online, but it would require an examination of dozens of faults around the reactor to prove their safety.",
      "\u201cThe decision is extremely regrettable,\" Japan Atomic Power said in a statement. It said it will continue efforts to restart.",
      "An NRA safety panel concluded three months ago it could not rule out the possibility of active fault lines about 300 meters (330 yards) north of the No. 2 reactor stretching to right underneath the facility, meaning the reactor cannot be operated.",
      "Japan\u2019s government in 2022 adopted a plan to maximize the use of nuclear energy, pushing to accelerate reactor restarts to secure a stable energy supply and meet its pledge to reach carbon neutrality by 2050.",
      "Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters that safety is the prerequisite for nuclear plant operation and that the government respects the scientific and highly technical decision by the watchdog. He said the government's position to promote nuclear energy is unchanged.",
      "Concern about the government\u2019s revived push for nuclear energy grew after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit Japan\u2019s Noto Peninsula on Jan. 1, 2024, killing more than 400 people and damaging more than 100,000 structures. The quake caused minor damage to two nearby nuclear facilities, and evacuation plans for the region were found to be inadequate.",
      "Building key nuclear facilities, such as reactors, directly above active fault lines is prohibited in earthquake-prone Japan.",
      "Yamanaka said the NRA is not immediately ordering a decommissioning because the reactor, which is offline and its spent fuel safely cooled, will not pose a major threat.",
      "If the utility decides to reapply, it must address not only the faults issue but it also must implement adequate safety measures for the entire plant, Yamanaka said. Providing scientific proof of the status of faults underneath key nuclear facilities is difficult, but other operators that obtained restart permits all cleared the requirement, he noted.",
      "The Tsuruga No. 2 reactor first started commercial operation in February 1987 and has been offline since May 2011. The operator rejected the NRA panel's 2013 on-site inspection results, which concluded that the faults under the No. 2 reactor were active, and applied for a restart in 2015.",
      "Of more than 50 commercial reactors, 27 have applied for restarts and 17 of them have been approved so far under the post-Fukushima safety standard."

      "European Union regulators hit Facebook parent Meta with a fine of nearly 800 million euros on Thursday for what it calls \u201cabusive practices\u201d involving its Marketplace online classified ads business",
      "LONDON -- European Union regulators issued their first antitrust fine to Facebook parent Meta on Thursday with a penalty of nearly 800 million euros for what they call \u201cabusive practices\u201d involving its Marketplace online classified ads business.",
      "The European Commission, the 27-nation bloc's executive branch and top antitrust enforcer, issued the 797.72 million euro ($841 million) penalty after its long-running investigation found that the company abused its dominant position and engaged in anti-competitive behavior.",
      "It\u2019s the first time the EU has imposed a fine on the social media giant for breaches of the bloc\u2019s competition law. Brussels has already slapped Big Tech rivals Google and Apple with billions in antitrust penalties.",
      "The commission had accused Meta of distorting competition by tying its online classified ad business to its social network, automatically exposing Facebook users to Marketplace \u201cwhether they want it or not\" and shutting out competitors.",
      "It was also concerned that Meta was imposing unfair trading conditions with terms of service that authorized the company to use ad-related data \u2014 generated from competing classified ad platforms who advertise on Facebook or Instagram \u2014 to benefit Marketplace.",
      "Meta's practices gave it \u201cadvantages that other online classified ads service providers could not match,\u201d Margrethe Vestager, the commission's executive vice-president in charge of competition policy, said in a press release \u201cThis is illegal under EU antitrust rules. Meta must now stop this behaviour.\u201d",
      "Meta said in a statement that the decision fails to prove any \u201ccompetitive harm\u201d to rivals or consumers and \u201cignores the realities of the thriving European market for online classified listing services.\u201d",
      "The company said the Commission's case ignores the fact that Facebook users can choose to \u201dengage with Marketplace, and many don't.\" It said online marketplaces, including global sites like eBay, Europe-wide platforms like Vinted, and national services are continuing to grow.",
      "Meta said it would comply with the Commission's order to end the offending conduct and not repeat it, but also vowed to appeal.",
      "The case dates back to 2021, when European Union regulators and their counterparts in Britain opened dual investigations into the classified business. The British regulator wrapped up its investigation last year after Meta made concessions.",
      "The company continues to face EU scrutiny on other fronts, including investigations into whether Facebook and Instagram child safety and election integrity measures comply with the bloc\u2019s digital rulebook. Meta has previously been hit with a series of fines for breaches of the EU\u2019s stringent privacy laws, including a record 1.2 billion euro penalty last year."

But we had the mindset this season to be a little more proactive with Mike,\" Wolves coach Chris Finch said.",

      "Hard-right Dutch political leader Geert Wilders has blamed \u201cMoroccans\u201d for attacks on Israeli soccer fans in Amsterdam last week and recommended the deportation of people convicted of involvement if they have dual nationality",
      "THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Hard-right Dutch political leader Geert Wilders on Wednesday blamed \u201cMoroccans\u201d for attacks on Israeli soccer fans in Amsterdam last week, asserting that they \u201cwant to destroy Jews\u201d and recommending the deportation of people convicted of involvement if they have dual nationality.",
      "While lawmakers condemned antisemitism and agreed that perpetrators of the violence should be prosecuted and handed harsh punishments, opposition legislators accused Wilders of \u201cpouring oil on the fire\u201d and said his statements during a parliamentary debate were not conducive to \u201ca better society.\u201d",
      "Violence erupted in the Dutch capital before and after last week's soccer match between Ajax Amsterdam and Maccabi Tel Aviv. Fans from both sides were involved in unrest; a number of Maccabi fans attacked a cab and chanted anti-Arab slogans while some men carried out \u201chit and run\u201d attacks on people they thought were Jews, according to Amsterdam Mayor Femke Halsema.",
      "After the match, parts of a large group of Maccabi supporters armed with sticks ran around \u201cdestroying things,\u201d a 12-page report on the violence issued by Amsterdam authorities said. There were also \u201crioters, moving in small groups, by foot, scooter or car, quickly attacking Maccabi fans before disappearing,\u201d it said.",
      "Amsterdam police said five people were treated in hospital for injuries. Police detained dozens of people before the match, but there were no immediate arrests for violence after it.",
      "On Wednesday night, hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters gathered on Amsterdam's central Dam Square to hold a demonstration despite a new city ban on such gatherings. Large numbers of police, including some on horseback, were present and detained most of the protesters after they refused to leave, escorting them mostly peacefully into two buses and driving them away from the square.",
      "Reports of antisemitic speech, vandalism and violence have been on the rise in Europe since the start of the war in Gaza, and tensions were high in Amsterdam ahead of the soccer match. The assaults on Maccabi fans sparked outrage and were widely condemned as antisemitic.",
      "The violence badly tarnished Amsterdam's long-held image as a haven of tolerance and sparked soul-searching across the country.",
      "Wilders, whose anti-immigration Party for Freedom won elections last year and now is part of a four-party ruling coalition government, said Wednesday that on the night Amsterdam commemorated Kristallnacht, the 1938 anti-Jewish pogrom in Nazi Germany, \u201cwe saw Muslims hunting Jews on the streets of Amsterdam,\u201d and blamed \u201dMoroccans who want to destroy Jews.\"",
      "He gave no evidence. Police and prosecutors have not disclosed the identities of any of the suspects that were detained, in line with Dutch privacy rules.",
      "Wilders advocated canceling the Dutch passports of people convicted of involvement in the violence \u2014 if they have a double passport \u2014 and deporting them.",
      "Wilders, who is sometimes described as the Dutch Donald Trump because of his fierce anti-immigration rhetoric, has lived under round-the-clock protection for 20 years because of death threats from Islamic extremists. He has also long been a staunch supporter of Israel.",
      "Some lawmakers warned that his new comments only served to deepen divisions in Dutch society.",
      "Rob Jetten of the centrist D66 party said Wilders' rhetoric \"does not contribute in any way to healing. In no way does he contribute to bringing our country together, but he throws oil on the fire and thus does not bring solutions against antisemitism and for a better society any closer, but only further away.\u201d",
      "Frans Timmermans, who leads the biggest center-left bloc in parliament, agreed.",
      "\u201cWhat you are doing is just stirring things up, dividing this country when this country needs politicians who bring people together, who bring solutions closer,\" Timmermans said.",
      "In Amsterdam, a prominent Jewish member of the City Council, Itay Garmy, said that although there\u2019s a lot of anger and fear within the Jewish community, inflammatory remarks wouldn\u2019t help.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t use my security or my suffering or my fear as a Jew to create political gains for yourself and make your points about integration, migration or Muslim hate,\u201d Garmy said.",

    "story": [
      "The Atlantic Coast Conference finds itself fighting for respect from the College Football Playoff selection committee",
      "Rhett Lashlee has done the math. It rolls around in the SMU coach's head every week. The more he thinks about it, the more it doesn't add up.",
      "Why, Lashlee wonders, is the Atlantic Coast Conference fighting what seems to be an uphill battle for respect from the College Football Playoff committee?",
      "\u201cTo look at our league and say, \u2018Well we may be a one-bid league,\u2019 but you look at another league (the Big Ten) that we have a winning record against, and say \u2018Oh they\u2019re going to get four in,\u2019\u201d Lashlee said Tuesday, a few hours before the latest CFP rankings had the Mustangs (8-1 overall, 5-0 ACC) as the second team out of the coveted top 12. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\u201d",
      "Over the summer, the college football paradigm shifted following the latest round of realignment, with the Big Ten and Southeastern Conference adding bluebloods like USC, Oregon and Texas and the ACC welcoming less-revered programs SMU, Cal and Stanford. What ACC officials and Lashlee\u2019s coaching brethren feared seems to be playing out.",
      "\u201cThe disrespect (was) there preseason,\u201d Pittsburgh coach Narduzzi said. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s there midseason.\u201d",
      "Narduzzi, whose team is at 7-2 overall and 3-2 in the league with nonconference wins over Big 12 members Cincinnati and West Virginia, believes the ACC is the best league in the country, pointing to parity as proof of its competitiveness. Shouldn't Georgia Tech toppling Miami and Louisville taking down Clemson in Death Valley be proof of the depth of the league as a whole?",
      "Apparently not.",
      "\u201cIt hurts when you\u2019re beating each other up, no question about it,\u201d Narduzzi said.",
      "If you play in the ACC anyway.",
      "It doesn't appear to be much of an issue in the SEC, where Alabama and Ole Miss find themselves inside the projected CFP field in mid-November despite having multiple conference losses, with another two-loss team (Georgia) right above SMU at No. 13 in the current bracket.",
      "The road for the ACC to get multiple teams into the CFP is narrowing by the week. The best case would seem to be for SMU and Miami to win out followed by a well-played and tightly contested ACC championship game.",
      "Warde Manuel, the CFP Selection Committee chair, said the Mustangs and Hurricanes have been impressive. What he didn't have to say is that only one of them has been impressive enough to merit a spot in the top 12 when the second, third and fourth-place teams in the SEC and Big Ten are both comfortably in the field for now.",
      "The irony is that the fourth-place team in the ACC (Louisville) may be the second-hottest team in the conference behind SMU. Clemson is currently in third and could keep its hopes of an ACC title game berth alive with a victory at Pitt on Saturday, with a shot to further bolster its CFP at-large hopes by downing rival South Carolina the weekend after Thanksgiving.",
      "Swinney struggles to understand how some narratives shift and others don't. Virginia Tech began its season with an overtime loss on the road at Vanderbilt. It looked like a red flag at the time. Now \u2014 with the Commodores in the midst of a renaissance \u2014 not so much.",
      "\u201cEverybody is like, \u2018Oh, the league stinks, you lost to Vanderbilt,'\u201d Swinney said. \"Well, I think Vanderbilt beat Alabama and Auburn. I think they're pretty good. And that was a touchdown game in Nashville with Virginia Tech.\u201d",
      "The same Virginia Tech team that took Miami to the last play in September and handled Georgia Tech in October, two weeks before the Yellow Jackets handed Heisman Trophy candidate Cam Ward and the Hurricanes their first loss.",
      "In the SEC, that sort of \u201cAny Given Saturday\u201d approach is celebrated. The ACC does not seem to be getting the same benefit of the doubt.",
      "\u201cWhen other leagues beat each other up internally, they\u2019re considered a deep, solid league,\u201d Lashlee said. \u201cWhen we beat up (each other) internally, we\u2019re considered a weak league.\u201d",
      "The Big 12 could feel the same way, since the CFP rankings suggest the league is looking a lot like a one-bid pony \u2014 BYU? Colorado? \u2014 despite a tight race for the championship.",
      "The ACC put up 43 nonconference wins, including eight victories over other Power Four schools. It currently has eight teams bowl eligible and nearly half its conference games have been decided by a touchdown or less, which the ACC considers proof of its depth.",
      "Throw in a little star power \u2014 Ward has been in the Heisman Trophy conversation all season, with Clemson quarterback Cade Klubnik on the fringe \u2014 and the league believes it checks all the same boxes the Big Ten and SEC do.",
      "Well, except for one: brand recognition. SMU is in its first season in the league after coming over from the American Athletic Conference. Miami is still Miami, but the Hurricanes haven't ended the season ranked in the top 10 in over two decades. Clemson remains among the ACC's elite, but the Tigers have taken a step back toward the rest of the field in recent seasons.",
      "It doesn't help that defending league champion Florida State \u2014 the same program that has sued the ACC in search of an escape plan \u2014 has nose-dived from preseason top 10 to the school's worst season in 50 years.",
      "While Lashlee admits he can get caught up thinking about the \u2018what ifs\u2019 he can take solace in knowing SMU controls its destiny.",
      "If the Mustangs keep winning, they're in. If do anything other than claim the conference title, they leave themselves at the mercy of a committee that doesn't seem \u2014 at the moment anyway \u2014 to consider the ACC an equal to its brethren.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what can be done,\u201d he said. \u201cI think some of that stuff is predetermined a little bit, and that\u2019s the bias we\u2019re talking about. ... I think we\u2019ve got four big-time leagues in college football. There needs to be quality representation from all from all four.\u201d",

      "The Capitals led 3-1 on goals by Taylor Raddysh, Dylan Strome and Aliaksei Protas before a turnover by Tom Wilson ended with Nylander beating Logan Thompson. Dowd's penalty became one mistake too many, and Washington lost for just the fifth time in 15 games this season.",

      "Capitals: After a charmed start to the season, the Capitals failed to add on and paid the price for a lackluster third period.",
      "The Leafs held the puck for a vast majority of the 3-on-3 OT before Tavares scored with 46.2 seconds left.",
      "Leafs defenseman Oliver Ekman-Larsson skated in his 1,000th regular-season NHL game.",
      "The Capitals open a three-game road trip Friday night at Colorado, while the Leafs host Connor McDavid and the Edmonton Oilers on Saturday night.",

      "Wembanyama shrugged, wondering when he will do better after the Spurs' 139-130 victory over the Washington Wizards on Wednesday night.",
      "\u201cReally, my first thought is, eventually I want the rest of our performances, the rest of our games to overshadow this one,\u201d said Wembanyama, the top pick in the 2023 draft. \u201cI wish, I want to make it so that in the future it\u2019s just another one.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s the pragmatism that has enabled Wembanyama to blossom into one of the league\u2019s youngest superstars.",
      "\u201cVery impressive,\u201d Spurs point guard Chris Paul said.",
      "At 20 years 314 days, Wembanyama is the fourth-youngest player to score 50 points, trailing only Brandon Jennings (20/52), LeBron James (20/80) and Devin Booker (20/145).",
      "\u201cThe big fella, man,\u201d San Antonio wing Julian Champagnie said. \u201cI mean obviously that\u2019s not where it\u2019s going to be every night, but when he comes out with that mindset, man, it\u2019s hard to, it\u2019s hard (for the opposition). Big praise to him, big shout out to him. He\u2019s working on his game.",
      "\u201cSo, we\u2019re super proud of him and that\u2019s what we expect from him.\u201d",
      "Wembanyama was 8 for 16 on 3-pointers, establishing a career high after setting and tying that mark with six 3-pointers in his previous two games.",
      "Wembanyama started quickly against the Wizards, hitting 3-pointers from 25 and 28 feet as the Spurs raced to a 13-3 lead.",
      "\u201cProbably not (played against anyone) who does everything on a high level,\u201d Washington center Jonas Valanciunas said. \u201cThem shots, the 3-point shots, we did everything to take that away, but he still managed them.\u201d",
      "Wembanyama had 24 points in the first half, his highest production in a first half, and then matched his highest production for any half with 26 in the final two quarters against the Wizards.",

      "Mike Tyson isn't the villain anymore as the 58-year-old prepares to fight the much younger Jake Paul in a sanctioned pro bout in Texas",
      "ARLINGTON, Texas -- Friendship is at the heart of how a fight came together between 58-year-old former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson and much younger YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul.",
      "Friction helped build the hype for a bout that is testing the formula for how boxing is delivered to the masses, a first-ever combat sports offering from the streaming platform Netflix rather than pay-per-view or traditional cable.",
      "\u201cI think they\u2019re beloved fans of Mike Tyson,\u201d Paul said, trying to explain the boisterous boos that have greeted him when the two have appeared together in recent months to hype the event.",
      "\u201cAnd I\u2019m the new kid on the block, the disrupter, loud mouth, polarizing figure,\u201d Paul said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve built my career as the heel. Naturally people want to root against me, and that\u2019s great for the sport of boxing.\u201d",
      "Tyson's first sanctioned professional fight in almost 20 years is set for Friday night at the home of the NFL's Dallas Cowboys. A crowd of at least 60,000 is expected while Netflix offers the bout at no additional cost to more than 280 million subscribers globally.",
      "The 27-year-old Paul is relatively new to the sport, the one-time social media influencer bringing a 10-1 record with seven knockouts mostly against mixed martial artists and journeymen boxers.",
      "Tyson was 50-6 with 44 knockouts when he retired after losing to Kevin McBride in 2005, saying he didn't have anything left to give the sport. He last fought in an exhibition against Roy Jones Jr. with no fans during the pandemic in 2020.",
      "A fight originally scheduled for July 20 was postponed when Tyson had to be treated for a stomach ulcer after falling ill on a flight.",
      "Tyson said in a documentary chronicling the preparations for the fight that he lost 26 pounds in the process of recovering.",
      "Promoter Nakisa Bidarian, who co-founded Most Valuable Promotions with Paul, said Tyson was cleared medically weeks ago. Bidarian sidestepped a question of how concerned he was for Tyson's health once he steps in the ring.",
      "\"I\u2019m nervous for both men,\u201d Bidarian said. \u201cThe reality is Jake\u2019s never been hit by someone like Mike Tyson flush on the chin. And Mike hasn\u2019t fought someone like Jake for a very long time. That\u2019s what makes this interesting.\u201d",
      "Paul said he had a vision for the fight about two years ago and shared it with Tyson because he thought the Hall of Famer would understand \u2014 and be interested. It took about that long for the bout to come together.",
      "Tyson appeared agitated at both hype events with fans in the Dallas area, first in the weeks before the originally scheduled fight and again at a news conference two nights before the bout.",
      "He was more reflective in a smaller setting with reporters, suggesting he wasn't the same foul-mouthed, scowling fighter from his prime.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been through so many ups and downs since my last fight with Kevin McBride,\u201d Tyson said. \u201cI\u2019ve been in rehab. I\u2019ve been in prison, been locked up. Never in a million years did I believe I\u2019d be doing this.\u201d",
      "According to reports, Paul will get $40 million for the fight, a number he mentioned at another news conference in New York in August.",
      "Tyson, who had two stints in prison over convictions in the 1990s for rape and assault and declared bankruptcy 21 years ago, will get $20 million. Tyson has said he isn't doing the fight for money.",
      "\"That old Mike Tyson ... he doesn\u2019t have no more purpose in my life. He just doesn't exist,\u201d Tyson said. \u201cI\u2019m having a good time in my life. I don\u2019t have much time left, so I\u2019m having the best time of my life.\u201d",
      "Several states wouldn\u2019t sanction the bout. Texas agreed to a fight that was eight rounds instead of 10 or 12, with two-minute rounds instead of three, and heavier gloves designed to lessen the power of punches.",
      "Paul has faced persistent questions about why he would fight someone so much older, regardless of Tyson's pedigree. His answers have been consistent.",
      "\u201cI say talk to Mike and tell Mike that,\u201d Paul said. \u201cHe\u2019s the one that wanted it to be a pro fight and me, as a young person in this sport, is not going to (pass) up the opportunity to fight the GOAT of boxing. It\u2019s like Ja Morant turning down a 1-v-1 against LeBron. It\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d",
      "There is a high-profile championship fight on the card \u2014 the co-main event of Katie Taylor vs. Amanda Serrano.",
      "Paul said he wanted to give the women a spotlight after their slugfest at sold-out Madison Square Garden in 2022. It was the first time women headlined a boxing event at the famous venue.",
      "Taylor won a split decision that many questioned. Bidarian and Paul say the rematch for the undisputed super lightweight title will be the most lucrative women's sporting event in history.",
      "\u201cA lot of people said the real main event is Taylor-Serrano,\u201d Bidarian said. \u201cI'm OK if you feel that way. Jake has said he's more excited about that fight than his own fight. But we wanted to ensure the most eyeballs got to see that fight. To be quite honest with ourselves, Paul-Tyson draws a bigger audience.\""

      "Atlanta was the only franchise whose contract would have been unchanged, but the Braves have agreed to an amended deal, which include streaming rights.",

      "Ed Miller has attended Indiana football and basketball games since the early 1970s, and he's never seen a fall quite like this.",
      "As the leaves change colors and flutter to the ground, and the action ramps up for one of college basketball's true blueblood programs, everyone around Bloomington is focused on what's happening inside the football stadium.",
      "Here, the 70-year-old Miller has been part of three straight home sellouts, seen the spinning towels and decibel levels attain new heights while the favored candy-striped basketball pants have been replaced by the increasingly fashionable candy-striped overalls. Yes, even the start of basketball season cannot tarnish this season's most unthinkable story in college football \u2014 the rise of the Hoosiers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard this time of year usually to keep going to football games, but that has totally flipped,\u201d Miller said. \"And now, honestly, I\u2019m a little disappointed in basketball. I\u2019m more excited about football than basketball, and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever say that.\u201d",
      "For decades, Indiana football was mired in mediocrity or worse \u2014 irrelevance.",
      "Indiana has the most losses (713) and the 10th-lowest winning percentage (.422) in FBS history. The Hoosiers three bowl wins are the fewest of any Power 4 team and the 33-year run between postseason victories still is the second-longest active drought among teams with multiple bowl bids.",
      "How bad had things gotten? When ESPN broadcaster Joe Buck identified an Indiana alum during a Monday Night Football telecast a couple years back, Buck's broadcast partner, Troy Aikman, jokingly asked if the Hoosiers still played football.",
      "Curt Cignetti took the Indiana job to change that image and while fans liked his passion, they were skeptical of his bold, brash promise of immediate success.",
      "\u201cHey, look I'm super fired up about this opportunity,\u201d he shouted at a December basketball game. \u201cI've never taken a backseat to anybody and don't plan on starting now. Purdue sucks. But so does Michigan and Ohio State.\u201d",
      "Nobody's questioning Cignetti now.",
      "Nick Saban's first recruiting coordinator at Alabama is a frontrunner to be this year's national coach of the year, especially after Saturday's 20-15 victory over the defending national champion Wolverines.",
      "Indiana earned just its second series win since 1988 while sealing the first 10-win season in school history, perhaps fittingly, against college football's winningest program.",
      "No. 5 Indiana (10-0, 7-0 Big Ten, No. 5 CFP) now has one more win than its combined total over the previous three seasons and finds itself ditching the half-full stadiums that had become the norm in Octobers and Novembers of seasons past.",
      "\u201cWe were excited to get a new coach. We knew there was going to be a lot of turnover with the football guys, but we never could have imagined 10-0,\u201d said 47-year-old Jennifer Worman, who lives in an Indianapolis suburb. \u201dIt is unreal for IU football.\"",
      "There have been no shortage of milestone moments in 2024.",
      "\u2014 Indiana's 77-3 victory over Western Illinois in Week 2 was the most lopsided in school history and its 56-7 win over Nebraska six weeks later matched the school record for margin of victory in league play.",
      "\u2014 The Hoosiers 42-13 victory over UCLA was their first ever at the Rose Bowl.",
      "\u2014 Indiana became the first bowl eligible in the team with a 41-24 victory at Northwestern.",
      "\u2014 They've scored at least 40 points, seven times, won nine times by 14 or more points and have trailed only twice briefly all season.",
      "\u2014 And if the Hoosiers win at No. 2 Ohio State, something they haven't done since 1987, a win over rival Purdue (1-8, 0-6) could send them to their first Big Ten title game.",
      "It's a season on the brink only this locker room thought possible.",
      "\"We have playmakers all across the board,\u201d sixth-year quarterback Kurtis Rourke said earlier this season. \u201cIt makes my job a lot easier. The O-line is playing great so we can run and pass. We\u2019re just clicking right now.\u201d",
      "Naturally, all these wins have put players such as Rourke, the 2022 Mid-American Conference MVP, in the postseason award debate. Some think Rourke even belongs in the Heisman Trophy race.",
      "He's hardly alone.",
      "Defensive end Mikail Kamara, a transfer from James Madison, leads the conference in sacks (9 1/2) and earned two national defensive player of the week awards following a 2 1/2-sack, 4 1/2-tackle for loss performance as Indiana reclaimed the Old Brass Spittoon at Michigan State.",
      "Elijah Sarratt also played previously for Cignetti at James Madison and now ranks fifth in the Big Ten in catches (38), yards (685) and yards per catch (18.0). He's tied for sixth with six TD receptions.",
      "And while some contend a soft schedule has helped the Hoosiers, it didn't in other years.",
      "Indiana may in fact be the most balanced team in the nation. It's ranked second in scoring offense (43.9 points), seventh in scoring defense (13.8) and among the top 25 nationally in passing offense (23rd, 276.5 yards), run defense (first, 72.7), pass defense (22nd, 183.3), turnover margin (tied for 12th, 1.0 per game) and takeaways (20th, 17).",
      "It's enough to convince Indiana fans the Hoosiers should make the expanded 12-team playoff field \u2014 win or lose at Ohio State. And it's rekindled memories of Bob Knight's three national championship runs and has done what nobody thought possible \u2014 temporarily overshadowed basketball at Indiana while the victory flag at Memorial Stadium flies for a 12th consecutive week.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m checking some boxes off, football-wise, that I never thought I\u2019d be able to see,\u201d said 58-year-old Randy Pruitt of Columbus, Indiana, who has seen the Hoosiers exceed his wildest expectations. \u201cMake a bowl, that\u2019s probably what we thought. No way would we be mentioned in the top 12 teams and the playoffs. Maybe we still get overlooked, I don\u2019t know. But this wasn\u2019t on the radar.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- In their return to the national rankings, Rick Pitino and his St. John's team didn't exactly look ready for prime time.",
      "Not to start, at least. The finish was pretty encouraging.",
      "Deivon Smith drained a 3-pointer midway through the second half to spark an 18-0 spurt that propelled No. 22 St. John's past Wagner 66-45 on Wednesday night for its first victory as a Top 25 team in almost 10 years.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m impressed, even though we\u2019re much more talented than Wagner,\u201d said Pitino, the Hall of Fame coach in his second season with the Red Storm. \u201cThey turned up the heat and made shots, and they were very poised when it counted.\u201d",
      "St. John's (3-0) jumped into the AP Top 25 poll this week for the first time since January 2019. It earned its first win as a ranked squad since topping Tulane on Dec. 28, 2014.",
      "And for Pitino, it was his first game coaching a Top 25 team since 2017 at Louisville.",
      "He didn't think his players thought much about any of that, though.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s nice for the fans. Certainly we\u2019re proud of that,\" Pitino said. \"We need to get the subway alumni back. We\u2019ve got great fans, but we don\u2019t have a lot of them.",
      "\u201cIn New York, there\u2019s a lot to do, so there\u2019s only one way to get fans and that\u2019s to win.\"",
      "Now the schedule gets much tougher, beginning Sunday against New Mexico (3-0) in the first of eight home games at Madison Square Garden this season.",
      "It will be a family affair pitting Pitino against his son, Richard, coach of a Lobos team that reached the NCAA Tournament last season and defeated then-No. 22 UCLA 72-64 in Nevada last week.",
      "\u201cNew Mexico is probably the No. 1 offensive-pace team in the country, and I know it better than anybody,\u201d Rick Pitino said. \u201cSo, we\u2019ve got to get ready for this pace. They\u2019ve got a great guard, they\u2019ve got great support players, they\u2019ve got a terrific inside player. This is a tough, tough test.\"",
      "The elder Pitino is 2-1 in coaching matchups against his son, with both wins coming when he was at Louisville. Richard Pitino beat his dad\u2019s Iona team two years ago at The Pit.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re capable of beating us, I know that,\" Rick Pitino said. \"I never have thought of disowning a son, but it may come to that.\u201d",
      "After that, St. John's faces No. 12 Baylor next Thursday in the Bahamas and either No. 11 Tennessee or Virginia the following day.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how good we are. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a question mark right now,\" Pitino said. \u201cSo, we\u2019re going to find out.\"",
      "\u201cI am excited. I like my team a lot. But it\u2019s the unknown right now,\u201d he added. \"We\u2019re going to be in some very close games. We\u2019re going to have to make free throws and execute.\u201d",
      "Foul shooting was a problem against Wagner (1-2), the Northeast Conference school on Staten Island where Dan Hurley, back-to-back NCAA champion at UConn, got his start as a college head coach from 2010-12.",
      "St. John's finished 18 for 30 (60%) at the free-throw line but held the Seahawks to 29% percent shooting from the field \u2014 including 5 for 24 (21%) from 3-point range.",
      "\u201cWe contested almost every shot. I think we\u2019re ready defensively,\" Pitino said. \u201cI think offensively we\u2019ve just got to get a feel for each other a little bit more.\"",
      "Playing before a crowd of 4,751 at Carnesecca Arena on its Queens campus, St. John\u2019s led just 39-37 before Kadary Richmond blocked a shot and fed Smith for a transition 3 with 9:54 remaining.",
      "\u201cThat was a big play,\" Pitino said. \"I think the shooting at the end when the game was in question was magnificent. The defense was great the whole night, basically.\u201d",

      "The private auction was being held as part of Jones' personal bankruptcy, which resulted from the nearly $1.5 billion in defamation lawsuit judgments a judge and jurors ordered the bombastic internet show and radio host to pay to families of victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting for repeatedly telling his audience that the Connecticut massacre of 20 children and six adults was a hoax staged by crisis actors. Jones, who has since acknowledged that the shooting did happen, is appealing the defamation verdicts.",

They included Roger Stone, an ally of Jones and President-elect Donald Trump, and progressive media groups that have been critical of Jones. He said he could be allowed to stay and keep using Infowars' platforms if allies won the bidding but that he could be kicked out and Infowars shut down if opponents bought it.",
      "Jones, based in Austin, Texas, said he set up a new studio, websites and social media accounts just in case. His personal social media in his name \u2014 including his account on X, with more than 3 million followers \u2014 were not up for sale. Court proceedings on whether they should be auctioned are pending.",
      "Jones revealed Wednesday that he worked with a group that put in a bid, but did not provide any details.",

      "Everything from Jones\u2019 studio desk to Infowars\u2019 name, video archive, social media accounts, and product trademarks and inventory were up for sale. Buyers could even purchase an armored truck and video cameras. . Any unsold items will be auctioned off next month.",
      "Many of Jones\u2019 personal assets, including real estate as well as guns and other personal belongings, also are being sold as part of the bankruptcy.",
      "Prospective buyers submitted sealed bids and confidentiality agreements by last Friday. The bankruptcy trustee, attorney Christopher Murray, appointed by the Justice Department, could have held new rounds of bidding Wednesday to boost prices above the sealed bids.",
      "Jones said Murray decided to choose from among the sealed bids. Jones said he was frustrated with that decision and learned about changes to the auction process only on Monday. A judge's order in September gave the trustee wide authority and said new bidding rounds on Wednesday were optional.",

      "Families sued Jones and his company for defamation and emotional distress for repeatedly saying on his show that the shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, was a hoax staged by crisis actors to spur more gun control. Parents and children of many of the victims testified that they were traumatized by Jones\u2019 conspiracies and threats by his followers."

    "story": [
      "The refugee organization, the International Rescue Committee, is testing some artificial intelligence tools to try to increase the number of displaced people they can reach with critical information",
      "NEW YORK -- As the International Rescue Committee copes with dramatic increases in displaced people in recent years, the refugee aid organization has looked for efficiencies wherever it can \u2014 including using artificial intelligence.",
      "Since 2015, the IRC has invested in Signpost \u2014 a portfolio of mobile apps and social media channels that answer questions in different languages for people in dangerous situations. The Signpost project, which includes many other organizations, has reached 18 million people so far, but IRC wants to significantly increase its reach by using AI tools \u2014 if they can do so safely.",
      "Conflict, climate emergencies and economic hardship have driven up demand for humanitarian assistance, with more than 117 million people forcibly displaced in 2024, according to the United Nations refugee agency. The turn to artificial intelligence technologies is in part driven by the massive gap between needs and resources.",
      "To meet its goal of reaching half of displaced people within three years, the IRC is testing a network of AI chatbots to see if they can increase the capacity of their humanitarian officers and the local organizations that directly serve people through Signpost. For now, the pilot project operates in El Salvador, Kenya, Greece and Italy and responds in 11 languages. It draws on a combination of large language models from some of the biggest technology companies, including OpenAI, Anthropic and Google.",
      "The chatbot response system also uses customer service software from Zendesk and receives other support from Google and Cisco Systems.",
      "If they decide the tools work, the IRC wants to extend the technical infrastructure to other nonprofit humanitarian organizations at no cost. They hope to create shared technology resources that less technically focused organizations could use without having to negotiate directly with tech companies or manage the risks of deployment.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to really be clear about where the legitimate concerns are but lean into the optimism of the opportunities and not also allow the populations we serve to be left behind in solutions that have the potential to scale in a way that human to human or other technology can\u2019t,\" said Jeannie Annan, International Rescue Committee\u2019s Chief Research and Innovation Officer.",
      "The responses and information that Signpost chatbots deliver are vetted by local organizations to be up to date and sensitive to the precarious circumstances people could be in. An example query that IRC shared is of a woman from El Salvador traveling through Mexico to the United States with her son who is looking for shelter and for services for her child. The bot provides a list of providers in the area where she is.",
      "More complex or sensitive queries are escalated for humans to respond.",
      "The most important potential downside of these tools would be that they don't work. For example, what if the situation on the ground changes and the chatbot doesn\u2019t know? It could provide information that's not just wrong, but dangerous.",
      "A second issue is that these tools can amass a valuable honeypot of data about vulnerable people that hostile actors could target. What if a hacker succeeds in accessing data with personal information or if that data is accidentally shared with an oppressive government?",
      "IRC said it's agreed with the tech providers that none of their AI models will be trained on the data that the IRC, the local organizations or the people they are serving are generating. They've also worked to anonymize the data, including removing personal information and location.",
      "As part of the Signpost.AI project, IRC is also testing tools like a digital automated tutor and maps that can integrate many different types of data to help prepare for and respond to crises.",
      "Cathy Petrozzino, who works for the not-for-profit research and development company MITRE, said AI tools do have high potential, but also high risks. To use these tools responsibly, she said, organizations should ask themselves, does the technology work? Is it fair? Are data and privacy protected?",
      "She also emphasized that organizations need to convene a range of people to help govern and design the initiative \u2014 not just technical experts, but people with deep knowledge of the context, legal experts, and representatives from the groups that will use the tools.",
      "\u201cThere are many good models sitting in the AI graveyard,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause they weren\u2019t worked out in conjunction and collaboration with the user community.\u201d",
      "For any system that has potentially life-changing impacts, Petrozzino said, groups should bring in outside experts to independently assess their methodologies. Designers of AI tools need to consider the other systems it will interact with, she said, and they need to plan to monitor the model over time.",
      "Consulting with displaced people or others that humanitarian organizations serve may increase the time and effort needed to design these tools, but not having their input raises many safety and ethical problems, said Helen McElhinney, executive director of CDAC Network. It can also unlock local knowledge.",
      "People receiving services from humanitarian organizations should be told if an AI model will analyze any information they hand over, she said, even if the intention is to help the organization respond better. That requires meaningful and informed consent, she said. They should also know if an AI model is making life-changing decisions about resource allocation and where accountability for those decisions lies, she said.",
      "Degan Ali, CEO of Adeso, a nonprofit in Somalia and Kenya, has long been an advocate for changing the power dynamics in international development to give more money and control to local organizations. She asked how IRC and others pursuing these technologies would overcome access issues, pointing to the week-long power outages caused by Hurricane Helene in the U.S. Chatbots won't help when there's no device, internet or electricity, she said.",
      "Ali also warned that few local organizations have the capacity to attend big humanitarian conferences where the ethics of AI are debated. Few have staff both senior enough and knowledgeable enough to really engage with these discussions, she said, though they understand the potential power and impact these technologies may have.",
      "\u201cWe must be extraordinarily careful not to replicate power imbalances and biases through technology,\u201d Ali said. \u201cThe most complex questions are always going to require local, contextual and lived experience to answer in a meaningful way.\u201d",

    "published": "Wed, 13 Nov 2024 07:14:29 -0500",
    "summary": "Japan&rsquo;s nuclear watchdog has formally disqualified a reactor in the country&rsquo;s north-central region from starting",
    "story": [
      "Japan\u2019s nuclear watchdog has formally disqualified a reactor in the country\u2019s north-central region from starting",
      "TOKYO -- Japan's nuclear watchdog on Wednesday formally disqualified a reactor in the country's north-central region from restarting, the first rejection under safety standards that were reinforced after the 2011 Fukushima disaster. The decision is a setback for Japan as it seeks to accelerate reactor restarts to maximize nuclear power.",
      "The Nuclear Regulation Authority said the Tsuruga No. 2 reactor is \u201cunfit\u201d as its operator failed to address safety risks stemming from the presence of possible active fault lines, which can potentially cause earthquakes, underneath it.",
      "Tsuruga No. 2, operated by the Japan Atomic Power Co., is the first reactor to be rejected under safety standards adopted in 2013 based on lessons from the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi meltdown disaster following a massive earthquake and tsunami.",
      "\u201cWe reached our conclusion based on a very strict examination,\u201d NRA chairperson Shinsuke Yamanaka told reporters.",
      "The verdict comes after more than eight years of safety reviews that were repeatedly disrupted by data coverups and mistakes by the operator, Yamanaka said. He called the case \u201cabnormal\u201d and urged the utility to take the result seriously.",
      "The decision is a blow to Japan Atomic Power because it virtually ends its hopes for a restart. The operator, which is decommissioning its other reactor, Tsuruga No. 1, had hoped to put No. 2 back online, but it would require an examination of dozens of faults around the reactor to prove their safety.",
      "\u201cThe decision is extremely regrettable,\" Japan Atomic Power said in a statement. It said it will continue efforts to restart.",
      "An NRA safety panel concluded three months ago it could not rule out the possibility of active fault lines about 300 meters (330 yards) north of the No. 2 reactor stretching to right underneath the facility, meaning the reactor cannot be operated.",
      "Japan\u2019s government in 2022 adopted a plan to maximize the use of nuclear energy, pushing to accelerate reactor restarts to secure a stable energy supply and meet its pledge to reach carbon neutrality by 2050.",
      "Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters that safety is the prerequisite for nuclear plant operation and that the government respects the scientific and highly technical decision by the watchdog. He said the government's position to promote nuclear energy is unchanged.",
      "Concern about the government\u2019s revived push for nuclear energy grew after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit Japan\u2019s Noto Peninsula on Jan. 1, 2024, killing more than 400 people and damaging more than 100,000 structures. The quake caused minor damage to two nearby nuclear facilities, and evacuation plans for the region were found to be inadequate.",
      "Building key nuclear facilities, such as reactors, directly above active fault lines is prohibited in earthquake-prone Japan.",
      "Yamanaka said the NRA is not immediately ordering a decommissioning because the reactor, which is offline and its spent fuel safely cooled, will not pose a major threat.",
      "If the utility decides to reapply, it must address not only the faults issue but it also must implement adequate safety measures for the entire plant, Yamanaka said. Providing scientific proof of the status of faults underneath key nuclear facilities is difficult, but other operators that obtained restart permits all cleared the requirement, he noted.",
      "The Tsuruga No. 2 reactor first started commercial operation in February 1987 and has been offline since May 2011. The operator rejected the NRA panel's 2013 on-site inspection results, which concluded that the faults under the No. 2 reactor were active, and applied for a restart in 2015.",
      "Of more than 50 commercial reactors, 27 have applied for restarts and 17 of them have been approved so far under the post-Fukushima safety standard."

      "BAKU, Azerbaijan -- For the third straight year, efforts to fight climate change haven't lowered projections for how hot the world is likely to get \u2014 even as countries gather for another round of talks to curb warming, according to an analysis Thursday.",
      "At the United Nations climate talks, hosted in Baku, Azerbaijan, nations are trying to set new targets to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases and figure out how much rich nations will pay to help the world with that task.",
      "But Earth remains on a path to be 2.7 degrees Celsius (4.9 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial times, according to Climate Action Tracker, a group of scientists and analysts who study government policies and translate that into projections of warming.",
      "If emissions are still rising and temperature projections are no longer dropping, people should wonder if the United Nations climate negotiations \u2014 known as COP \u2014 are doing any good, said Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an awful lot going on that\u2019s positive here, but on the big picture of actually getting stuff done to reduce emissions ... to me it feels broken,\u201d Hare said.",
      "The world has already warmed 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. That's near the 1.5-degree (2.7 F) limit that countries agreed to at 2015 climate talks in Paris. Climate scientists say the atmospheric warming, mainly from human burning of fossil fuels, is causing ever more extreme and damaging weather including droughts, flooding and dangerous heat.",
      "Climate Action Tracker does projections under several different scenarios, and in some cases, those are going up slightly.",
      "\u201cThis is driven highly by China,\u201d said Sofia Gonzales-Zuniga of Climate Analytics. Even though China's fast-rising emissions are starting to plateau, they are peaking higher than anticipated, she said.",
      "Another upcoming factor not yet in the calculations is the U.S. elections. A Trump administration that rolls back the climate policies in the Inflation Reduction Act, and carries out the conservative blueprint Project 2025, would add 0.04 degree Celsius (0.07 Fahrenheit) to warming projections, Gonzales-Zuniga said. That's not much, but it could be more if other nations use it as an excuse to do less, she said.",
      "\u201cFossil fuels and emissions are not peaking,\u201d said Sherry Rehman, chair of climate and environment committee in Pakistan\u2019s senate. After 29 years of climate talks, Rehman said countries are \u201cstill talking in bumper stickers.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need a transformative solution. We need strong delivery,\u201d Rehman said.",
      "The major battle in Baku is over how much rich nations will pay for developing countries to decarbonize their energy systems, cope with future harms of climate change and pay for damage from warming's extreme weather.",
      "A special independent group of experts commissioned by United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres issued its own estimate of costs and finances on Thursday, calling for a tripling of the old commitment. It said about $1 trillion a year is needed by developing nations from all outside sources, not just government grants.",
      "\u201cAdvanced economies need to demonstrate a credible commitment\u201d to helping poor nations, the report said.",
      "Negotiations on a grand total and structuring the overall amount have taken \u201ca step back\u201d when a draft of just a few pages that was worked on for a year was rejected and the latest proposal with many options has more than 30 pages, said top European negotiator Veronika Bagi of Hungary. European Commission negotiator Jacob Werksman said there\u2019s a \u201cvery significant gap\u2033 between what rich and poor nations propose.",
      "German climate envoy Jennifer Morgan said \u201cprivate investment has to be brought to the table\u201d in order to fulfill developing countries needs. But Mariana Paoli of Christian Aid said any number that comes out of negotiations that's not based in publicly-financed grants \u201cwill be meaningless.\u201d",
      "Relying on the private sector means climate cash will not be \u201cneeds based, it will be profit-driven,\" she said, adding that crises like the COVID-19 pandemic and bank bailouts proves that public funds are available.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about fairness, it\u2019s about justice,\u201d she said.",
      "Getting climate cash is personal for many activists from vulnerable nations, like Sandra Leticia Guzman Luna, who is from Mexico and the director of the climate finance group for Latin America and the Caribbean. \u201cWe are observing the climate impacts causing a lot of costs, not only economic costs but also human losses,\u201d she said.",
      "Argentina withdrew from the climate talks on Wednesday on the orders of its president, climate skeptic Javier Milei. The Argentine government did not respond to requests from The Associated Press for comment.",
      "Climate activists called the decision regrettable.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to understand how a climate-vulnerable country like Argentina would cut itself from critical support,\" said Anabella Rosemberg, an Argentina native who works as a senior adviser at Climate Action Network International.",

      "Legislating a duty of care would mean services can\u2019t \u201cset and forget.\u201d Instead, their obligations would mean they need to continually identify and mitigate potential risks, as technology and service offerings change and evolve, she said.",

      "Most of the course is comprised of hands-on training focusing on the on-site destruction of unexploded munitions using explosives, the chief training officer told the Associated Press. The officer spoke on condition of anonymity because he\u2019s not authorized to disclose his identity for security reasons.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re trained on ordnance disposal using real explosives,\u201d the officer said. \u201cThat will be the trainees\u2019 primary task when they return.\u201d",
      "Cypriot officials said the Ukrainian trainees did not want to be either interviewed or photographed.",
      "Defusing discarded munitions or landmines in areas where explosive charges can\u2019t be used \u2014 for instance, near a hospital \u2014 is not part of this course because that\u2019s the task of highly trained teams of disposal experts whose training can last as long as eight months, the officer said.",
      "Trainees, divided into groups of eight, are taught how to operate metal detectors and other tools for detecting munitions like prodders \u2014 long, thin rods which are used to gently probe beneath the ground\u2019s surface in search of landmines and other explosive ordnance.",
      "Another tool is a feeler, a rod that\u2019s used to detect booby-trapped munitions. There are many ways to booby-trap such munitions, unlike landmines which require direct pressure to detonate.",
      "\u201cBooby-trapped munitions are a widespread phenomenon in Ukraine,\u201d the chief training officer explained.",
      "Training, primarily conducted by experts from other European Union countries, takes place both in forested and urban areas at different army camps and follows strict safety protocols.",
      "The short, intense training period keeps the Ukrainians focused.",
      "\u201cYou see the interest they show during instruction: they ask questions, they want to know what mistakes they\u2019ve made and the correct way of doing it,\u201d the officer said.",
      "Humanitarian data and analysis group ACAPS said in a Jan. 2024 report that 174,000 sq. kilometers (67,182 sq. miles) or nearly 29% of Ukraine\u2019s territory needs to be surveyed for landmines and other explosive ordnance.",
      "More than 10 million people are said to live in areas where demining action is needed.",
      "Since 2022, Russian forces have used at least 13 types of anti-personnel mines, which target people. Russia never signed the 1997 Ottawa Convention banning the use of anti-personnel mines, but the use of such mines is nonetheless considered a violation of its obligations under international law.",
      "Russia also uses 13 types of anti-tank mines.",
      "The International Campaign to Ban Landmines said in its 2023 Landmine Monitor report that Ukrainian government forces may have also used antipersonnel landmines in contravention of the Mine Ban Treaty in and around the city of Izium during 2022, when the city was under Russian control."

      "Amazon has launched a low-cost online storefront featuring electronics, apparel and other products priced at under $20, an effort to compete with discount retailers that have increasingly encroached on the e-commerce giant's turf.",
      "In a blog post on Wednesday, the company said the new Amazon Haul storefront will mostly feature products that cost less than $10 and offer free delivery on orders over $25. Amazon plans to ship the products to U.S. customers from a warehouse it operates in China, according to documentation the company provided to sellers. Amazon said Haul orders could arrive within one to two weeks.",
      "Many of the available products on the storefront Wednesday resembled the types of items typically found on Shein and Temu, the China-founded e-commerce platforms that have grown in popularity in recent years.",
      "Shein\u2019s core customers are young women enticed by the low-cost apparel sold on the site. Temu offers clothing, accessories, kitchen gadgets and a broad array of other products for bargain-hungry shoppers.",
      "Temu and Shein often get criticism over the environmental impact of the ultra-fast fashion business model the two companies follow. They have also faced scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators in the U.S. and abroad over other issues, including some of the products on their platforms.",
      "Amazon\u2019s new storefront, which is only available on its shopping app and mobile website, features unbranded products, such a phone case and a hairbrush that cost $2.99, and a sleeveless dress that retails for $14.99. The company is seeking to drive home its message on value, with banners on its page advertising \u201ccrazy low prices\u201d and activewear \u201cthat won\u2019t stretch your budget.\u201d",
      "\u201cFinding great products at very low prices is important to customers, and we continue to explore ways that we can work with our selling partners so they can offer products at ultra-low prices,\u201d Dharmesh Mehta, Amazon\u2019s vice president of Worldwide Selling Partner Services, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s early days for this experience, and we\u2019ll continue to listen to customers as we refine and expand it in the weeks and months to come.\u201d",
      "To be sure, importing goods out of China could soon become more expensive for Amazon. In September, the Biden administration said it was cracking down on cheap products sold out of China, a move designed to reduce U.S. dependence on Beijing but could also trigger higher prices for the U.S. consumers who have flocked to Shein and Temu. President-elect Donald Trump has also proposed a 60% tariff on goods from China.",
      "Amazon announced other news this week.",

      "European Union regulators hit Facebook parent Meta with a fine of nearly 800 million euros on Thursday for what it calls \u201cabusive practices\u201d involving its Marketplace online classified ads business",
      "LONDON -- European Union regulators issued their first antitrust fine to Facebook parent Meta on Thursday with a penalty of nearly 800 million euros for what they call \u201cabusive practices\u201d involving its Marketplace online classified ads business.",
      "The European Commission, the 27-nation bloc's executive branch and top antitrust enforcer, issued the 797.72 million euro ($841 million) penalty after its long-running investigation found that the company abused its dominant position and engaged in anti-competitive behavior.",
      "It\u2019s the first time the EU has imposed a fine on the social media giant for breaches of the bloc\u2019s competition law. Brussels has already slapped Big Tech rivals Google and Apple with billions in antitrust penalties.",
      "The commission had accused Meta of distorting competition by tying its online classified ad business to its social network, automatically exposing Facebook users to Marketplace \u201cwhether they want it or not\" and shutting out competitors.",
      "It was also concerned that Meta was imposing unfair trading conditions with terms of service that authorized the company to use ad-related data \u2014 generated from competing classified ad platforms who advertise on Facebook or Instagram \u2014 to benefit Marketplace.",
      "Meta's practices gave it \u201cadvantages that other online classified ads service providers could not match,\u201d Margrethe Vestager, the commission's executive vice-president in charge of competition policy, said in a press release \u201cThis is illegal under EU antitrust rules. Meta must now stop this behaviour.\u201d",
      "Meta said in a statement that the decision fails to prove any \u201ccompetitive harm\u201d to rivals or consumers and \u201cignores the realities of the thriving European market for online classified listing services.\u201d",
      "The company said the Commission's case ignores the fact that Facebook users can choose to \u201dengage with Marketplace, and many don't.\" It said online marketplaces, including global sites like eBay, Europe-wide platforms like Vinted, and national services are continuing to grow.",
      "Meta said it would comply with the Commission's order to end the offending conduct and not repeat it, but also vowed to appeal.",
      "The case dates back to 2021, when European Union regulators and their counterparts in Britain opened dual investigations into the classified business. The British regulator wrapped up its investigation last year after Meta made concessions.",
      "The company continues to face EU scrutiny on other fronts, including investigations into whether Facebook and Instagram child safety and election integrity measures comply with the bloc\u2019s digital rulebook. Meta has previously been hit with a series of fines for breaches of the EU\u2019s stringent privacy laws, including a record 1.2 billion euro penalty last year.",

      "Italy's president has sharply rebuked Elon Musk",
      "ROME -- Italian President Sergio Mattarella sharply rebuked Elon Musk on Wednesday for weighing in on Italian court rulings that have stymied the government\u2019s plans to process some asylum-seekers in Albania.",
      "Musk, who is expected to have a top advisory role in Donald Trump\u2019s new administration, wrote Tuesday on X that \u201cthese judges need to go.\u201d He was referring to the latest Italian court ruling against right-wing Premier Giorgia Meloni\u2019s much-touted Albania immigration deal.",
      "\u201cThis is unacceptable. Do the people of Italy live in a democracy or does an unelected autocracy make the decisions?\u201d he wrote in a subsequent post Wednesday.",
      "The posts concerned a Rome court's refusal to rule on a formal request to detain seven migrants rescued at sea and transferred to Albania for processing. Monday's ruling resulted in the men being brought to Italy for processing.",
      "Mattarella didn\u2019t cite Musk by name but \u2014 in an unusually piqued statement \u2014 made clear on Wednesday that he was referring to him. Italy's head of state demanded respect for the country's sovereignty, especially from other soon-to-be public officials.",
      "\u201cItaly is a great democratic country and \u2026 knows how to take care of itself while respecting its Constitution,\u201d Mattarella said in a statement issued by his spokesman.",
      "\u201cAnyone, particularly if as announced is about to assume an important role of government in a friendly and allied country, must respect its sovereignty and cannot attribute to himself the task of imparting prescriptions,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Trump announced Tuesday that Musk, one of the most influential people around the U.S. president-elect, would help lead a Department of Government Efficiency, essentially an independent advisory panel to eliminate waste and fraud.",
      "Musk is a supporter of Meloni and has met with her in Rome on a few occasions, and in September joined her at an awards ceremony on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. Photos of them together made such news that Musk seemingly felt the need to tamp down speculation by posting \u201cWe are not dating.\u201d",
      "Musk has a history of making provocative statements and sparring with leaders on X. Earlier this year, he posted messages insulting U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and saying the United Kingdom was headed for civil war. He has also clashed with a Brazilian supreme court justice over free speech, far-right accounts and purported misinformation on X, and also accused Venezuela\u2019s socialist president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, of \u201cmajor election fraud\u201d after that country\u2019s disputed election.",
      "Later Wednesday, an Italian representative of X, Andrea Stroppa, tweeted what appeared to be a statement from Musk that said he had spoken during the day with Meloni. According to Stroppa's tweet, Musk \u201cexpresses his respect\u201d for Mattarella and the Italian Constitution but insists on his right to freedom of expression.",
      "The courts\u2019 rulings have raised the ire of Meloni\u2019s far-right-led government, which has been seeking strategies to ease the strain on Italy of the arrival of migrants seeking a better life in Europe. The government had held up the opening of the Albanian centers as a centerpiece of its immigration crackdown, also as a means of deterrence, and said they could be a model for Europe.",
      "In both cases, Italian courts referred the cases to the EU court of justice in Luxembourg to rule if the countries of origin for the migrants are considered safe for repatriation. There is no word on when the European court might rule.",
      "But as a result of the Rome court decisions, no migrant has yet been processed in the Albanian centers, which are budgeted to cost Italy 670 million euros ($730 million) over five years to build and operate.",
      "Italy's opposition says the money could be much better spent on reinforcing Italian-operated migrant processing centers, while human rights groups say the outsourcing of asylum processing contravenes international law.",
      "The centers opened in October after a months-long delay, because crumbling soil at one of the facilities needed to be repaired. They are run by Italy and are under the country's jurisdiction, while Albanian guards provide external security."

      "BANGKOK -- A hacking group that is believed to be Chinese state-sponsored has compromised two websites with ties to the Tibetan community in an attack meant to install malware on users' computers, according to findings released Wednesday by a private cybersecurity firm.",
      "The hack of the Tibet Post and Gyudmed Tantric University websites appears geared toward obtaining access to the computers of people visiting to obtain information on them and their activities, according to the analysis by the Insikt Group, the threat research division of the Massachusetts-based cybersecurity consultancy Recorded Future.",
      "The hackers, known in the report as TAG-112, compromised the websites so that visitors are prompted to download a malicious executable file disguised as a security certificate, Insikt Group said. Once opened, the file loads Cobalt Strike Beacon malware on the user's computer that can be used for key logging, file transferring and other purposes, including deploying additional malware.",
      "\u201cWhile we do not have visibility into the activity that TAG-112 conducted on compromised devices in this campaign, given their likely cyber espionage remit and the targeting of the Tibetan community, it is almost certain that they were engaged in information collection and/or surveillance rather than destructive attacks,\u201d Insikt Group senior director Jon Condra told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cThis behavior aligns with historical targeting of the Tibetan community,\u201d he said.",
      "Chinese authorities have consistently denied any form of state-sponsored hacking, saying China itself is a major target of cyberattacks.",
      "The Chinese Foreign Ministry said it was not aware of the hacking of the two websites reported by the Insikt Group.",
      "\u201cChina's stance on the issue of cybersecurity is consistent and clear,\u201d the ministry said in a faxed reply to a request for comment without elaborating.",
      "According to the Insikt group research, the sites were first compromised in late May and the attacks bear many overlaps with a previously tracked hacker group known as TAG-102, leading analysts to conclude it is a subgroup of the already known group \u201cworking toward the same or similar intelligence requirements,\u201d Insikt Group said.",
      "Overlaps include reuse of specific tactics, techniques and procedures and going after identical targets, Condra said.",
      "\u201cThese two threat clusters are almost certainly interrelated,\u201d he said.",
      "TAG-102, known by multiple names such as Evasive Panda and StormBamboo, has been in operation since as early as 2012, and is widely thought to be a Chinese-sponsored advanced persistent threat, or APT, group, Insikt Group said.",
      "Among other things, it uses custom malware frameworks used by other Chinese APT groups and its targeting \u201caligns with likely Chinese intelligence requirements,\u201d Condra said.",
      "\u201cThe group has engaged in a wide variety of campaigns over the years, with an emphasis on targeting individuals and organizations in opposition to the Chinese government, such as human rights organizations, religious organizations, ethnic minority groups, academic institutions, and supporters of democracy or independence movements in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and even in mainland China,\u201d Insikt Group said.",
      "The university and the news website, which are both located in India, have been informed by Insikt Group of the hack. As of this week, it appears the Gyudmed Tantric University, which is a place of learning about Tibetan Buddhism, language, history and culture, has remediated the problem while the news website remained compromised, Condra said.",
      "The Tibet Post is known for promoting democracy, freedom of speech and for advocating Tibetan independence from China, he said.",
      "China claims Tibet has been part of its territory for centuries, although it only established firm control over the Himalayan region after the Communist Party swept to power during a civil war in 1949.",
      "Many Tibetans' loyalties still lie with the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader who has lived in exile in India since a failed anti-Chinese uprising in 1959.",
      "China has been regularly accused of human rights abuses in Tibet, including earlier this year over its efforts to forcibly urbanize villagers and herders as part of a drive to assimilate rural Tibetans through control over their language and traditional Buddhist culture."

      "In picking billionaire Elon Musk to be \u201cour cost cutter\u201d for the U.S. government, President-elect Donald Trump won't be the first American president to empower a business tycoon to look for ways to dramatically cut federal regulations.",
      "President Ronald Reagan tapped J. Peter Grace to lead a bureaucratic cost-cutting commission in 1982. Still, the chemical business magnate had fewer conflicts of interest than the world's richest man does today.",
      "Musk's SpaceX holds billions of dollars in NASA contracts. He's CEO of Tesla, an electric car business that benefits from government tax incentives and is subject to auto safety rules. His social media platform X, artificial intelligence startup xAI, brain implant maker Neuralink and tunnel-building Boring company all intersect with the federal government in various ways.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s direct conflicts between his businesses and government\u2019s interest,\u201d said Ann Skeet, director of leadership ethics at Santa Clara University's Markkula Center. \u201cHe\u2019s now in a position to try and curry favor for those enterprises.\u201d",
      "Musk is also more influential, having pumped an estimated $200 million through his political action committee to help elect Trump, made himself a fixture at Mar-a-Lago since the presidential election and is on regular speaking terms with like-minded political world leaders, from Argentina\u2019s President Javier Milei to Italy\u2019s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.",
      "Trump has said Musk and former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy will lead a new \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency,\u201d or DOGE, \u2014 a joke name that references the cryptocurrency Dogecoin and appeals to Musk's sense of humor.",
      "\u201cWe finally have a mandate to delete the mountain of choking regulations that do not serve the greater good,\u201d Musk said Wednesday on X.",
      "Trump has said that Musk and Ramaswamy will work from outside the government to offer the White House \u201cadvice and guidance\u201d and will partner with the Office of Management and Budget to drive structural reform \u2014 some of which could only be done through Congress.",
      "\"If it\u2019s a commission, it\u2019s outside the government\u201d and Musk could not have a White House office or official government title, said Richard Painter, a White House ethics lawyer during the George W. Bush administration. \u201cThen, the president takes the advice or doesn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "If it were a true government agency, however, Musk would run afoul of federal conflict of interest laws unless he divested from his businesses or recused from government matters involving them, Painter said.",
      "Trump could grant a rare waiver exempting Musk from those laws, a move that has been politically unpopular in the past, Painter said.",
      "Tesla, SpaceX and X didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday about whether Musk would recuse himself. The Trump transition team also didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "However it is structured, Musk's ideas are expected to have an influence.",
      "Tesla, the electric vehicle company that made Musk the world\u2019s wealthiest person, has had repeated skirmishes with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which regulates vehicle safety. So any cuts to NHTSA funding or staffing could help Tesla.",
      "The agency has forced Tesla to do recalls it didn\u2019t want, and it has opened investigations of Tesla vehicles, some of which raised questions about Musk\u2019s claims that Tesla is close to deploying autonomous vehicles without human drivers. The agency also is working on regulations that cover vehicle automation.",
      "Auto safety advocates are worried that a Department of Government Efficiency co-chaired by Musk could propose draconian cuts at NHTSA.",
      "\u201cThat could be incredibly problematic because that would impact every rule-making from all of the agencies that currently oversee companies that Musk owns,\u201d said Michael Brooks, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety, a watchdog group.",
      "If implemented, Musk\u2019s plan for efficiency at NHTSA could mirror what he did when he took over Twitter \u2014 draconian staff cuts, said Missy Cummings, director of the autonomy and robotics center at George Mason University and a former safety adviser to NHTSA.",
      "While Cummings concedes there is room for much of the federal government to become more efficient, she said that NHTSA is already understaffed and she predicted that Musk would try to slow or stop NHTSA investigations or handicap the agency so it would have trouble enforcing regulations.",
      "\u201cIt would just leave it as a shell of the agency that it was,\u201d she said. \u201cTheir whole job would be to put out commercials reminding people to just wear their seat belts.\u201d",
      "Launching test flights out of South Texas, SpaceX\u2019s mega rocket Starship is how NASA intends to land astronauts on the moon for the first time in more than a half-century. NASA has awarded more than $4 billion to SpaceX for the first two human moon landings coming up later this decade under the Artemis program. Musk has been at odds with the Federal Aviation Administration for slowing Starship over what he contends is excessive bureaucracy.",
      "SpaceX also has racked up multiple contracts with NASA over the past decade for launching supplies and astronauts to the International Space Station. The contracts for crew flights alone from 2020 through 2030 total $5 billion.",
      "More recently, in June, NASA awarded an $843 million contract to SpaceX to provide the vehicle for deorbiting the International Space Station at the end of its lifetime in early 2031, directing it to a fiery re-entry over the Pacific.",
      "SpaceX also has multiple contracts with the Defense Department, some classified and said to be worth billions. In addition, the Pentagon has purchased internet services in Ukraine from SpaceX\u2019s Starlink constellation. The militarized version of Starlink is called Starshield.",
      "The social media platform X is another Musk company that has drawn scrutiny from federal regulators. The Federal Trade Commission has probed Musk\u2019s handling of sensitive consumer data after he took control of the company in 2022 but has not brought enforcement action. The SEC has an ongoing investigation of Musk\u2019s purchase of the social media company.",
      "Musk has been forceful with his political views on the platform, changing its rules, content moderation systems and algorithms to conform with his world view. After Musk endorsed Trump following an attempt on the former president\u2019s life last summer, the platform has transformed into a megaphone for Trump\u2019s campaign, offering an unprecedented level of free advertising that is all but impossible to calculate the value of.",
      "Musk's strong interest in AI is also likely to play a role. He's in the process of building an AI supercomputer in Memphis, Tennessee, for his AI startup xAI.",
      "But environmental groups have raised concerns about pollution generated by the facility's gas turbines and its strain on the local power grid, prompting attention from the Environmental Protection Agency.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Social media site Bluesky has gained 1 million new users in the week since the U.S. election, as some X users look for an alternative platform to post their thoughts and engage with others online.",
      "Bluesky said Wednesday that its total users surged to 15 million, up from roughly 13 million at the end of October.",
      "Championed by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Bluesky was an invitation-only space until it opened to the public in February. That invite-only period gave the site time to build out moderation tools and other features. The platform resembles Elon Musk's X, with a \u201cdiscover\u201d feed as well a chronological feed for accounts that users follow. Users can send direct messages and pin posts, as well as find \u201cstarter packs\u201d that provide a curated list of people and custom feeds to follow.",
      "The post-election uptick in users isn\u2019t the first time that Bluesky has benefitted from people leaving X. Bluesky gained 2.6 million users in the week after X was banned in Brazil in August \u2014 85% of them from Brazil, the company said. About 500,000 new users signed up in the span of one day last month, when X signaled that blocked accounts would be able to see a user's public posts.",
      "Despite Bluesky's growth, X posted last week that it had \u201cdominated the global conversation on the U.S. election\u201d and had set new records. The platform saw a 15.5% jump in new-user signups on Election Day, X said, with a record 942 million posts worldwide. Representatives for Bluesky and for X did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Bluesky has referenced its competitive relationship to X through tongue-in-cheeks comments, including an Election Day post on X referencing Musk watching voting results come in with President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cI can guarantee that no Bluesky team members will be sitting with a presidential candidate tonight and giving them direct access to control what you see online,\u201d Bluesky said.",
      "Across the platform, new users \u2014 among them journalists, left-leaning politicians and celebrities \u2014 have posted memes and shared that they were looking forward to using a space free from advertisements and hate speech. Some said it reminded them of the early days of X, when it was still Twitter.",
      "On Wednesday, The Guardian said it would no longer post on X, citing \u201cfar right conspiracy theories and racism\u201d on the site as a reason. At the same time, television journalist Don Lemon posted on X that he is leaving the platform but will continue to use other social media, including Bluesky.",
      "Lemon said he felt X was no longer a place for \u201chonest debate and discussion.\u201d He noted changes to the site's terms of service set to go into effect Friday that state lawsuits against X must be filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas rather than the Western District of Texas. Musk said in July that he was moving X's headquarters to Texas from San Francisco.",
      "\u201cAs the Washington Post recently reported on X\u2019s decision to change the terms, this 'ensures that such lawsuits will be heard in courthouses that are a hub for conservatives, which experts say could make it easier for X to shield itself from litigation and punish critics,\u2019\u201d Lemon wrote. \u201cI think that speaks for itself.\u201d",
      "Last year, advertisers such as IBM, NBCUniversal and its parent company Comcast fled X over concerns about their ads showing up next to pro-Nazi content and hate speech on the site in general, with Musk inflaming tensions with his own posts endorsing an antisemitic conspiracy theory."

      "Even as Earth sets new heat records, humanity this year is pumping 330 million tons (300 million metric tons) more carbon dioxide into the air by burning fossil fuels than it did last year",
      "BAKU, Azerbaijan -- Even as Earth sets new heat records, humanity this year is pumping 330 million tons (300 million metric tons) more carbon dioxide into the air by burning fossil fuels than it did last year.",
      "This year the world is on track to put 41.2 billion tons (37.4 billion metric tons) of the main heat-trapping gas into the atmosphere. It\u2019s a 0.8% increase from 2023, according to Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists who track emissions. Several United Nations reports say the globe must cut emissions by 42% by 2030 to possibly limit warming to an internationally agreed-upon threshold.",
      "This year's pollution increase isn't quite as large as last year's 1.4% jump, scientists said while presenting the data at the United Nations climate talks in Azerbaijan.",
      "If the world continues burning fossil fuels at today's level, it has six years before passing 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels, the limit agreed to at the 2015 climate talks in Paris, said study co-author Stephen Sitch. The Earth is already at 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 Fahrenheit), according to the United Nations.",
      "\u201cWe clearly are not doing enough on a global scale to reduce emissions. It\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d said study co-author Mike O'Sullivan, a University of Exeter climate scientist. \"We need to massively increase ambition and actually just think outside the box of how we can change things, not be so tied to fossil fuel interests.''",
      "Scientists used reported emissions from rich countries and oil industry data, O\u2019Sullivan said. The 2024 figure includes projections for the last couple months or so. The Global Carbon Project team released figures for the four biggest carbon emitters \u2014 China, the United States, India and Europe. It also produced more detailed and final figures for about 200 countries for 2023.",
      "The continued rise in carbon emissions is mostly from the developing world and China. Many analysts had been hoping that China \u2014 by far the world's biggest annual carbon polluting nation with 32% of the emissions \u2014 would have peaked its carbon dioxide emissions by now. Instead China's emissions rose 0.2% from 2023, with coal pollution up 0.3%, Global Carbon Project calculated. But it could drop to zero in the next two months and is \u201cbasically flat,\u201d O'Sullivan said.",
      "That's nothing close to the increase in India, which at 8% of the globe's carbon pollution is third-largest carbon emitter. India's carbon pollution jumped 4.6% in 2024, the scientists said.",
      "Carbon emissions dropped in both the United States and the European Union. They fell 0.6% in the U.S. mostly from reduced coal, oil and cement use. The U.S. was responsible for 13% of the globe's carbon dioxide in 2024. Historically, it's responsible for 21% of the world's emissions since 1950, a figure that matters since the gas persists in the atmosphere for centuries.",
      "Twenty-two nations have shown steady decreases in emissions, O'Sullivan said, singling out the United States as one of those. The biggest emission drops from 2014 to 2023 were in the United States, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.",
      "Europe, which accounts for 7% of the world's carbon pollution, saw its carbon dioxide output drop 3.8% from last year \u2014 driven by a big cut in coal emissions.",
      "Global carbon emissions are well more than double what they were 50 years ago and 50% than they were in 1999. Emissions have gone up about 6% in the past decade.",
      "\u201cThis is a needed reminder of the urgency with which we need to address the cause of the climate crisis,\" said PowerShift Africa founder Mohamed Adow, who wasn't part of the study. \u201cThe problem is the fossil fuel industry is kicking and screaming for us to slow down and to keep them in business for longer. That\u2019s why they poured money into Donald Trump\u2019s election campaign.\u201d",
      "Carbon dioxide from humanity's burning of coal, oil and natural gas amounts to 2.6 million pounds (nearly 1.2 million kilograms) of the heat-trapping gas every second.",
      "Total carbon emissions \u2014 which include fossil fuel pollution and land use changes such as deforestation \u2014 are basically flat because land emissions are declining, the scientists said. That\u2019s an important and encouraging milestone amid bad news, said University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann",

      "Before deciding to compete against conventional ride-hailing pioneers Uber and Lyft in California, Waymo unleashed its robotaxis in Phoenix in 2020 and has been steadily extending the reach of its service in that Arizona city ever since.",
      "Driverless rides are proving to be more than just a novelty. Waymo says it now transports more than 150,000 weekly trips in its robotaxis, a volume of business numbers that helped the company recently raise $5.6 billion from its corporate parent Alphabet and a list of other investors that included venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and financial management firm T. Rowe Price.",
      "\u201cOur service has matured quickly and our riders are embracing the many benefits of fully autonomous driving,\" Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said in a blog post.",
      "Despite its inroads, Waymo is still believed to be losing money. Although Alphabet doesn't disclose Waymo's financial results, the robotaxi is a major part of an \u201cOther Bets\u201d division that had suffered an operating loss of $3.3 billion through the first nine months of this year, down from a setback of $4.2 billion at the same time last year.",
      "But Waymo has come a long way since Google began working on self-driving cars in 2009 as part of project \u201cChauffeur.\u201d Since its 2016 spinoff from Google, Waymo has established itself as the clear leader in a robotaxi industry that's getting more congested.",
      "Electric auto pioneer Tesla is aiming to launch a rival \u201cCybercab\u201d service by 2026, although its CEO Elon Musk said he hopes the company can get the required regulatory clearances to operate in Texas and California by next year.",
      "Tesla's projected timeline for competing against Waymo has been met with skepticism because Musk has made unfulfilled promises about the company's self-driving car technology for nearly a decade.",
      "Meanwhile, Waymo's robotaxis have driven more than 20 million fully autonomous miles and provided more than 2 million rides to passengers without encountering a serious accident that resulted in its operations being sidelined.",
      "That safety record is a stark contrast to one of its early rivals, Cruise, a robotaxi service owned by General Motors. Cruise's California license was suspended last year after one of its driverless cars in San Francisco dragged a jaywalking pedestrian who had been struck by a different car driven by a human.",
      "Cruise is now trying to rebound by joining forces with Uber to make some of its services available next year in U.S. cities that still haven't been announced. But Waymo also has forged a similar alliance with Uber to dispatch its robotaxi in Atlanta and Austin, Texas next year.",
      "Another robotaxi service, Amazon's Zoox, is hoping to begin offering driverless rides to the general public in Las Vegas at some point next year before also launching in San Francisco."

      "Calls are growing from prominent Republican leaders for the House Ethics Committee to share its report on former Rep.

      "\"We cannot allow this valuable information from a bipartisan investigation to be hidden from the American people,\" Durbin said in the statement. \"Make no mistake: this information could be relevant to the question of Mr. Gaetz's confirmation as the next Attorney General of the United States and our constitutional responsibility of advice and consent.\"",
      "Republican Sen. John Cornyn, a key Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, told ABC News Senior Congressional Correspondent Rachel Scott that it's important that there is access to what the House Ethics Committee has found in its investigation.",

    "summary": "Nathan Hochman, who won the election last week for Los Angeles County district attorney, spoke to ABC News about the Menendez brothers' case.",
    "story": [
      "Lyle and Erik Menendez have spent nearly 35 years in prison for murder.",
      "As calls grow for the Menendez brothers to be released from prison, the incoming Los Angeles County district attorney says he has a lot of evidence to review before showing his support.",
      "Nathan Hochman won last week's election for DA, beating incumbent George Gasc\u00f3n in a landslide, will take office in December. The election came weeks after Gasc\u00f3n announced his recommendation that the Menendez brothers be resentenced and eligible for parole immediately.",
      "Hochman questioned the motivation behind Gasc\u00f3n's decision to support resentencing so close to the election.",
      "\"Part of the problem with the Gasc\u00f3n timing of his decision is there's a cloud over that credibility. Is it a just decision, or was it just a political ploy?\" Hochman said.",
      "\"There will be no cloud over whatever decision I do,\" he added.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n denied his decision was politically motivated, telling ABC News, \"I believe that they should be released and they should be released cleanly within the law.\"",
      "\"I base my decision in the review of 30 years of ... information about their behavior, as well as a very thorough understanding of what they were convicted of and the elements of the crime,\" Gasc\u00f3n said. \"So my decision was appropriately based.\"",
      "The infamous case dates back to 1989, when Lyle Menendez, then 21, and Erik Menendez, then 18, shot and killed their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, in the family's Beverly Hills home. The defense claimed the brothers acted in self-defense after enduring years of sexual abuse by their father, but prosecutors alleged they killed for money.",
      "The first trial, which had separate juries for each brother, ended in mistrials. In 1996, after the second trial -- during which the judge barred much of the sex abuse evidence -- the brothers were convicted and both sentenced to two consecutive terms of life without parole.",
      "As Gasc\u00f3n's appeal for the brothers' resentencing makes its way through the courts, Hochman -- who is set to take office on Dec. 2 -- said he plans to read through the new alleged evidence, trial transcripts, confidential prison files and interviews with family, lawyers and law enforcement.",
      "\"What these files say is too important an issue to delegate to somebody else. I need to actually do the work myself,\" he told ABC News.",
      "The next hearing in the resentencing case is Dec. 11. Hochman, a former federal prosecutor, said he'll \"work as expeditiously as possible,\" adding, \"If we need some additional time to formulate our position, I'll ask the court for it.\"",
      "\"I'm not going to ask for delay, just for delay's sake,\" he added. \"We'll ask for the minimal amount of time necessary to do this work, because we owe it to the Menendez brothers, we owe it to the victim family members, we owe it to the public to get this decision right.\"",
      "The brothers' case was propelled back into the spotlight this fall with Netflix's release of a scripted series and a documentary -- and now a new generation is calling for their release.",
      "\"If you decide this case based on just reviewing a Netflix documentary, you're doing a disservice to the Menendez brothers, to the victims' family members, to the public,\" Hochman said.",
      "The Menendez brothers have three possible paths to freedom.",
      "One path is through resentencing. Gasc\u00f3n announced last month that he was recommending the brothers' sentence of life without the possibility of parole be removed, and they should instead be sentenced for murder, which would be a sentence of 50 years to life. Because both brothers were under 26 at the time of the crimes, with the new sentence, they would be eligible for parole immediately, Gasc\u00f3n said.",
      "The DA's office said its resentencing recommendations take into account factors including the defendants' ages, psychological trauma or physical abuse that contributed to carrying out the crime and their rehabilitation in prison. Gasc\u00f3n praised the work Lyle and Erik Menendez did behind bars to rehabilitate themselves and help other inmates.",
      "The second path is the brothers' request for clemency, which they've submitted to California Gov. Gavin Newsom.",
      "The third path is their habeas corpus petition, which was filed last year for a review of new evidence not presented at trial.",
      "One piece of evidence is allegations from a former boy band member who revealed last year that he was raped by Jose Menendez.",
      "The second piece of evidence is a letter Erik Menendez wrote to his cousin eight months before the murders detailing his alleged abuse. The cousin testified about the alleged abuse at trial, but the letter -- which would have corroborated the cousin's testimony -- wasn't found until several years ago, according to the brothers' attorney.",
      "The next hearing on the habeas corpus petition is set for Nov. 25.",

      "\"First of all, you got to fire the Chairman Joint of the Chiefs and obviously going to bring in a new Secretary of Defense, but any general that was involved -- general, admiral, whatever -- that was involved in, any of the DEI woke s---, has got to go,\" Hegseth said during a recent interview on the \"Shawn Ryan Show\" podcast. \"Either you're in for warfighting, and that's it.

      "Hegseth had preemptively defended the move, saying it would be a return to normalcy for soldiers rather than a \"MAGA takeover.\"",

    "summary": "Donald Trump's announcement that Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will lead a newly formed Department of Government Efficiency has alarmed some government ethics experts.",
    "story": [
      "Experts warn the pair's role could raise possible conflict concerns.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump's announcement Tuesday that tech billionaire Elon Musk and biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy will lead a newly formed advisory Department of Government Efficiency has alarmed some government ethics experts, who say the pair's deep financial interests could lead to potential conflicts of interest.",
      "Some ethics experts are particularly alarmed that Musk and Ramaswamy's roles have been described as \"outside of government\" -- an arrangement that could potentially mean they would not be subject to normal financial disclosure rules, despite the major impact their work could have on the federal government.",
      "\"Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies,\" Trump said of Musk and Ramaswamy, both of whom were vocal supporters of Trump's reelection campaign.",
      "As outside governmental advisers, Musk -- who owns Tesla, X and SpaceX -- and Ramaswamy -- who founded the biotech firm Roivant Sciences -- might not be subject to federal requirements mandating that officials disclose their financial interests to the Office of Government Ethics.",
      "Certain categories of advisers from outside the government can be required to disclose their interests under the Federal Advisory Committee Act -- including if they are classified as a \"Special Government Employee\" -- but ethics experts say that not enough is known about the proposed department to know if they would be covered under that act.",
      "Musk has promised transparency, posting on X shortly after the announcement, \"All actions of the Department of Government Efficiency will be posted online for maximum transparency.\"",
      "\"The transition team will ensure the Department of Government Efficiency and those involved with it are compliant with all legal guidelines related to conflicts of interest,\" Trump transition spokesperson Brian Hughes told ABC News.",
      "Kedric Payne, senior director of ethics at the Campaign Legal Center, told ABC News that the possibility that Musk and Ramaswamy would not have financial disclosure obligations is alarming because their work cutting government regulations or spending could directly impact their business interests without the public knowing.",
      "\"It could be simply an attempt to stop the regulations on their business interest at the expense of government workers and the public,\" said Payne, who added that they could also be in a position to get more government contracts for their businesses.",
      "\"If you eliminate the government from doing certain tasks, then those tasks can go to government contracts for consultants,\" Payne said.",
      "Payne also stressed the highly unusual nature of Musk and Ramaswamy's proposed roles as outside advisers with significant influence.",
      "\"It's extremely rare to do it like this,\" he said. \"It is common to have outside experts give advice to the government ... where it might just be a meeting, or something that's over a period of time. But to have a situation where we have outside entrepreneurs with business interests, possibly changing how they are regulated, and having this much power, that's not common.\"",
      "Payne also said called for transparency regarding who else would be working with Musk and Ramaswamy in the new department, saying their interests would need to be made public as well.",
      "Noah Bookbinder, the president of Citizens for Responsible Ethics in Washington, echoed some of Payne's concerns about potential conflicts of interest given Musk and Ramaswamy's business interests, while emphasizing that more details are necessary to determine whether there would be any violation of federal ethics laws.",
      "\"We don't yet know enough about how these positions will operate to know whether there will, in fact, be conflicts of interest and what those conflicts will be,\" Bookbinder said. \"If Musk and Ramaswamy are in a position where they can influence governmental decisions and if some of those decisions could impact their businesses, then there could be a danger of illegal conflicts of interest. Other laws and rules could also be at issue today depending on what they do and how this 'Department' works.\"",
      "Bookbinder also floated the possibility that others in government could feel pressed to look favorably on Musk's interests given his significant influence over Trump, which sources tell ABC News has recently seen Musk offering input on Trump's staffing decisions and playing a significant role in shaping the future Trump administration.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk have formed a close bond as Trump campaigned for the presidency in 2024.",
      "Musk showed continued support to Trump leading up to Election Day and, as a reward, Trump announced that Musk would lead the newly created \"Department of Government Efficiency,\" or DOGE, also the name of a cryptocurrency backed by Musk.",
      "The two powerful leaders who have redefined the spheres of politics and technology are closer than ever before. Which leaves the question: Will their bromance last?",
      "\"I don't think so,\" Adam Clark Estes, senior technology correspondent at Vox, said. \"I don't think those two personalities can stay friends for too long. Even if he'll last the next two months, I think that he'll leave a tremendous impression on the Trump administration.\"",
      "For now, Musk is becoming one of the president-elect's most trusted advisers, even appearing by his side on Capitol Hill.",
      "This summer, the founder of Tesla and SpaceX endorsed the future president after an assassination attempt on Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania.",
      "Musk, who owns X and has more than 200 million followers on the social media platform, quickly became one of the most prominent and outspoken figures in the Trump campaign. He organized town halls and fielded questions from voters, not shying away from making controversial statements.",
      "\"President Trump is the only one who can save democracy,\" Musk told an Allegheny County audience on Oct. 20, 2024.",
      "Musk's unconventional entrance into Trump's inner circle included a place in the family photo on election night. One of his first ventures was co-founding PayPal during the dot-com boom in the late 1990s, which quickly propelled him to stardom in Silicon Valley.",
      "\"He used to be this true genius and visionary, this technological wunderkind who could think of something that would lead us to a brighter future and take us there,\" Estes said.",
      "In 2002, he founded a private space exploration company, SpaceX. Two years later, his next project was Tesla, a little-known startup that grew into the most valuable car company in the world over two decades.",
      "Tesla and Musk's other companies, such as internet provider Starlink and SpaceX, were transformed into innovative powerhouses thanks to contracts and subsidies from the federal government.",
      "Musk defined himself as apolitical throughout the 2000s. That started to change as Musk became increasingly critical of the government and federal regulation.",
      "\"It's become clear, especially in the past two or three years, that he's taken a sharp turn to the right,\" Estes said. \"And now he's widely viewed as Trump's biggest supporter and a main character in the MAGA sphere.\"",
      "Since then, Musk has promoted conspiracy theories, reposted antisemitic messages, and spread misinformation, such as attempting to downplay the violence that occurred on Jan. 6 at the Capitol.",
      "He invested at least $175 million into his Super PAC, called \"America PAC,\" for the Trump campaign. The billionaire's influence on the Trump agenda is already becoming evident.",

      "\"He is simultaneously being targeted by the federal government and being paid billions of dollars by the federal government,\" New York Times investigative reporter Eric Lipton said. \"He's a guy who just becomes obsessed with getting things done. He wants to basically change the oversight of his company, and who best to ask to help do that than the president of the United States?\"",

      "With a Senate map that was heavily favored to Republicans, the House majority was the top congressional question for much of the 2024 election cycle.",
      "Several first-term Republicans in purple districts were running for their first reelection -- in a presidential year when the White House margin would play an outsized role in helping determine the winners in the down-ballot contests. Democrats had several members running in Trump-friendly territory, though many were battle-tested over the course of multiple reelection efforts.",
      "In the end, both sides saw successes and failures -- though when the races are all said and done, Republicans' margin in the House is anticipated to be narrow once again.",
      "Republicans like Reps. Mike Lawler in suburban New York and David Valadao in California won reelection in tight districts -- missed opportunities for Democrats -- but Reps. Anthony D'Esposito in Long Island and Mike Garcia in Los Angeles fell to Democratic challengers.",

      "Still, with such an expectedly slim margin, Republicans will again be forced to reckon with the same internal divisions that plagued their control of the current Congress -- it took the party more than a dozen rounds of voting to elect Kevin McCarthy as speaker, only to boot him several months later and then endure another grueling process to ultimately hand Johnson the gavel.",
      "Yet through it all, Johnson has maintained his tenuous hold on the speakership.",

      "Gabbard left the Democratic Party in 2022 after representing Hawaii in Congress for eight years and running for the party's 2020 presidential nomination. She was seen as an unusual ally with the Trump campaign, emerging as an adviser during his prep for his debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, who Gabbard had debated in 2020 Democratic primaries.",
      "\"For over two decades, Tulsi has fought for our Country and the Freedoms of all Americans. As a former Candidate for the Democrat Presidential Nomination, she has broad support in both Parties - She is now a proud Republican!\" Trump said in a statement announcing his pick, which will need to be confirmed by the Senate.",
      "Before the announcement, Gabbard said it would be a \"honor\" to serve in a Trump administration as she waited for Trump to make selections for his administration.",
      "\"If there's a way I can help achieve the goal of preventing World War III and nuclear war? Of course,\" she said in an interview with NewsNation on Monday night.",

      "\"Trump ended up with some neocons around him who were trying to undermine his objectives so they could feed their goals of continuing to keep us in a perpetual state of war,\" Gabbard said, discussing his first administration. \"This administration has us facing multiple wars on multiple fronts and regions around the world and closer to the brink of nuclear war than we ever have been before,\" Gabbard said when she endorsed Trump during a campaign event in Michigan.",
      "\"This is one of the main reasons why I'm committed to doing all that I can to send President Trump back to the White House, where he can, once again, serve us as our commander in chief.\"",
      "Gabbard has, in recent years, strengthened her ties with Republicans in the House and the Senate. Two of her closest allies from her early days in Congress are Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat turned independent, and Oklahoma Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin. Gabbard and Mullin even hit the campaign trail together earlier this year, joining \"Team Trump on Tour\" to support Trump's campaign.",
      "Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul has also formed an unlikely alliance with Gabbard, collaborating on the Stop Arming Terrorists Act in both the House and Senate -- a nod to her stance against the \u201cmilitary-industrial complex.\u201d",
      "In 2020, as the Democratic presidential field narrowed to three candidates, Gabbard described her bid as \u201can opportunity to speak to Americans every single day about the sea change we need in our foreign policy.\u201d",
      "Throughout Trump's campaign, Gabbard played an active role, whether it was moderating town halls, touring with the group Women for Trump, or mingling throughout Mar-A-Lago.",
      "Gabbard's appearances highlighted that the coalition of supporters around Trump had shifted. The campaign pointed to Gabbard and former Democratic and independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to signify the change in his upcoming administration.",

How that happens remains to be seen. Obviously, we want to make sure our committees have confirmation hearings like they typically do and these nominees reported out to the floor. But I've said this and I mean it, we expect a level of cooperation from the Democrat to work with us to get these folks installed.\"",

      "Scott made appearances on cable news outlets in recent days and touted his endorsements from a number of Trump-aligned outside influencers, including Elon Musk and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He tried to position himself as the most Trump-aligned candidate.",
      "But Trump did not endorse Scott or any candidate in the leadership race, opting instead to insist that whoever was elected will support his use of recess appointments, which would allow him to temporarily fill federal vacancies without Senate approval.",
      "All three candidates signaled their willingness to use that strategy to quickly fill out Trump's Cabinet.",
      "ABC News Chief Washington Correspondent Jonathan Karl reported that sources said Trump did not endorse Scott because he didn't think he could win.",
      "Ahead of the vote, Republicans gathered behind closed doors for over two hours Tuesday evening to hear arguments from Thune, Cornyn and Scott, as well as other senators who are running for down-ballot leadership positions. Any other candidate who might wish to throw their name in the running for party leadership would have been permitted to do so during the meeting.",

      "\"You never know until the voters vote,\" Thune said.",
      "Cornyn kept quiet leaving the room, \"I'll make my pitch to my colleagues, not to you.\"",
      "Even before the Tuesday meeting, the candidates were beginning to make their closing arguments and working to assert their loyalty to Trump, whose influence could certainly sway the outcome of the race.",
      "Cornyn wrote a letter to colleagues Tuesday, obtained by ABC News, in which he repeatedly touted his commitment to Trump's agenda and confirmation of his Cabinet selections.",
      "\"It's imperative that Republicans hit the ground running to implement President Donald Trump's agenda for the American people,\" Cornyn wrote in the letter, citing GOP success across the House, Senate, an White House.",
      "And Thune, who perhaps has had the iciest relationship with Trump among the contenders, also made clear he's been in regular contact with Trump's team, and he's made public statements supporting Trump proposals, including potential changes to Senate operating procedure."

      "But some visitors to the monument Thursday, as well as housing activists, were skeptical about the value of the arrangement, citing ongoing controversies in many cities over the role of short-term rental platforms in fueling overtourism and limiting affordable housing for residents and students.",
      "Under the deal announced by Airbnb and the Colosseum on Wednesday, the sponsorship by the short-term rental giant will cover the renewal of an educational program inside the ancient Roman amphitheater covering the history of the structure and gladiators.",
      "Eight of the platform's users and their plus-ones will be able to participate in faux gladiator fights after the Colosseum's closing time on May 7-8, taking the same underground route used by gladiators in ancient Rome to reach the arena. People can apply for the experience on Nov. 27 at no cost, and the \u201cgladiators\u201d will be chosen by lottery.",
      "The superintendent of the Colosseum Archaeological Park, Alfonsina Russo, told The Associated Press that the deal is in conjunction with the release of Ridley Scott's new film \u201cGladiators II,\" which opened in Italy on Thursday.",
      "Russo characterized the sponsorship arrangement as one of the many such deals to help finance projects at the park.",
      "The Italian fashion brand Tod's, for example, has funded a multimillion renovation of the Roman monument, including a cleaning, replacing the locking system of arches with new gates and redoing the subterranean areas.",
      "Alberto Campailla, the coordinator of the Nonna Roma nonprofit organization that focuses on housing and food for the poor, called the campaign with Airbnb \u201ca disgrace,\u201d and a form of \u201ctouristification.\u201d",
      "Airbnb and other platforms offering short-term rentals \u201care literally driving people out of not only the city center, but also the outskirts and suburban neighborhoods,\u201d Campailla said.",
      "Tourists from other European cities grappling with overtourism also took issue with the deal.",
      "\u201cIt seems to me that the purpose of the Colosseum today is to be a tourist attraction, but not to create an amusement park within it,\u201d said Jaime Montero, a tourist visiting from Madrid. \u201cIn the end, tourism eats the essence of the cities, here in Rome, as in other capitals.\u201d",
      "Visiting from Naples, Salvatore Di Matteo saw the deal as \u201cyet another takeover of the territory\u201d by big companies.",
      "\"If they start to touch sacred monuments such as the Colosseum here in Rome, it is obviously something that should make us think and is, in any case, a bit worrying,\" he said.",

      "Mayor Sara Funaro\u2019s Cabinet approved a 10-point plan that, among other things, would ban key boxes on buildings in Florence\u2019s historic center as well as the use there of loudspeakers by tour guides, a statement from City Hall said.",
      "The keyboxes \u2014 small boxes with a digital pad that are used by owners of short-term rental apartments to easily leave keys for visitors \u2014 have become something of the symbol of local Florentine anger at tourists, whose numbers have rebounded after COVID-19.",
      "In a recent protest, Florentines taped red Xs over the keyboxes, outraged at the transformation of the city center and its magnificent palazzi and narrow streets into a collection of short-term vacation rentals that have displaced local residents and the long-standing businesses that served them.",
      "According to national statistics bureau ISTAT, 2023 saw the most visitors ever in Italy with 134 million arrivals and 451 million people staying in hotels or other registered lodgings. The number of visitors opting for non-hotel lodging grew nearly 17% compared to 2022, ISTAT said in a June report.",
      "Italy ranks fourth on the U.N. World Tourism Barometer of international tourist destinations, after France, Spain and the United States. The tourism industry contributed some 10.5% of Italy\u2019s gross domestic product in 2023, according to Statista research.",
      "Florence, long run by the center-left, last year announced a ban on new short-term private rentals in the center in hopes of stemming the exodus of locals. It has repeatedly pressed for a special regulation from the national government, currently headed by right-wing Premier Giorgia Meloni, to cap the number of days a property can be rented out at 120.",
      "To date, only Venice has been permitted to limit short-term rentals. The lagoon city has been drowning under overtourism for years and this year began imposing a day-tripper tax to try to regulate tourist flows.",
      "The right-left political divide over Florence and its tourism woes could come to a head precisely as Italy hosts the G7 tourism ministers starting Wednesday in Florence.",
      "At a warm-up event this weekend, Tourism Minister Daniela Santanche acknowledged some art cities were suffering from too many visitors. But she said that overall Italy is hardly taking advantage of its tourism potential and needed 50 million visitors more a year.",
      "Lamenting Italy\u2019s fourth-place position on the list of the world's top destinations, she said Italy needed to sustainably grow its tourism potential with quality offerings.",
      "\u201cWe can grow much more, we can develop much more and the industry of tourism can truly become the leading industry of our nation,\u201d she said.",

      "The park's director Gabriel Zuchtriegel said visitors to the main archaeological site now exceed an average of 15,000 to 20,000 every day, and the new daily cap will prevent the numbers from surging further.",

She claimed he was \u201cclearly politically motivated\u201d and impugned his integrity.

Speaking to reporters, Ms. Harris reacted furiously: \u201cThe way that the president\u2019s demeanor in that report was characterized could not be more wrong.\u201d",
      "Mr. Hur has been repeatedly vindicated during the intervening nine months. The interview transcripts, when they came out, bolstered his conclusions. If anything, the truth was worse than what Mr. Hur described.",
      "It\u2019s now acknowledged almost universally that Mr. Biden should not have sought a second term, but the Democratic establishment denied the obvious and propped him up politically, even as evidence of his decline mounted. Prominent Democratic politicians changed their tune only after a disastrous debate performance in June made it impossible to conceal Mr. Biden\u2019s frailty from the public any longer \u2014 and forced them to confront the possibility of electoral disaster in November.",
      "The credibility problems that Ms. Harris\u2019s repeated defense of Mr. Biden\u2019s sharpness illustrated were part of the reason Democrats met defeat.",
      "Make no mistake: As dissemblers go, President-elect Donald Trump has no equal, and his dishonesty is a continual disgrace. Even his strongest supporters acknowledge he exaggerates for effect and plays fast and loose with facts. But voters obviously see other qualities in him that offset his dishonesty, perhaps drawn from rosy recollections of living under the first Trump presidency.",
      "Democrats tried to make fidelity to science, facts and truth their distinguishing characteristic as a party. The White House\u2019s aggressive coverup of Mr. Biden\u2019s decline undermined that claim. Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minnesota) was the only lawmaker willing to challenge Mr. Biden for the Democratic presidential nomination. He was ostracized and lost his spot in House leadership. Mr. Biden\u2019s allies concocted terms such as \u201ccheap fakes\u201d to dismiss embarrassing video clips in which Mr. Biden appeared dazed, confused, tired and inaudible. Allies of the president frequently labeled content they didn\u2019t approve of as \u201c disinformation,\u201d cheapening the term. When a few journalists reported accurately on Mr. Biden\u2019s decline, the White House fed critical talking points about their stories to others in the media.",
      "The harder they spun, the less believable they became. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said days after the June 27 debate that Mr. Biden was \u201c as sharp as ever.\u201d Eventually, Mr. Biden bowed to reality and stepped aside. But Ms. Harris struggled whenever she was asked to explain her defenses of Mr. Biden. On Oct. 22, NBC\u2019s Hallie Jackson pressed Ms. Harris five times on this topic. The vice president dodged when asked whether she ever saw anything like what happened during the debate behind closed doors. \u201cIt\u2019s a judgment question, that\u2019s why I ask,\u201d Ms. Jackson responded. \u201cCan the American people trust you in these moments, even when it\u2019s maybe uncomfortable?\u201d Ms. Harris did not answer directly.",
      "To the bitter end, Mr. Biden\u2019s team has covered for him. In the last week of the campaign, White House press staff altered the official transcript of a public appearance in which Mr. Biden described Trump supporters as \u201cgarbage.\u201d The Associated Press reported that an apostrophe was added to the initial version prepared by the official White House stenographers so it would appear that he was referring only to a single supporter: the comedian who had joked that Puerto Rico is a \u201c floating island of garbage.\u201d",
      "All of this took a toll on believability. Polls showed more voters believed that Mr. Trump would actually implement his campaign promises than Ms. Harris would hers.",
      "This is not to say that Ms. Harris\u2019s defense of Mr. Biden, or its effect on her credibility, was the decisive factor in this week\u2019s election. Any accounting must include the fact that incumbent parties across the world are losing in a tough post-covid-19 political environment, along with the damage the Democratic Party\u2019s leftward lurch, led by Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts), did to the Democratic label, particularly during the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries.",
      "But the record does highlight one of the things Democrats must do to resuscitate their brand: live up to their billing as truth-tellers.",

The party may be over for the Iranian regime, which took in more than $40 billion in extra oil revenue during the Biden years owing to nonenforcement of U.S. sanctions. The rolling bribe bought America nothing and gave China cheap oil.",

Mr. Hook led the first Trump Administration\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d sanctions campaign against Iran, and he has been living under Iranian threats on his life. His presence is a signal that America means business again.",
      "As Iran weighs striking Israel a third time, it must know that its defenses are down after Israel\u2019s recent retaliation\u2014and not only the Russian equipment. The Biden Administration can no longer protect the Iranian regime. President Biden\u2019s leverage over Israel has largely collapsed, thanks to U.S. voters.",

      "The election also sends a warning to the International Criminal Court, which is abusing its powers to bring up Israel\u2019s leaders on politicized charges. America is next on the ICC\u2019s target list. Tough U.S. sanctions against the ICC are all but guaranteed after Republicans take control of Congress.",
      "President Biden and Sen. Chuck Schumer could stop blocking bipartisan sanctions on the ICC right now. Freed from pandering to voters in Dearborn, Mich., they can head off those ICC arrest warrants, which may be issued shortly. If Democrats don\u2019t, and the court acts first, it will be too late to save the court from the consequences of its overreach.",

      "The pressure is on them to succumb to Israel\u2019s terms. In one of Mr. Trump\u2019s biggest applause lines at the Republican convention, he warned, \u201cWe want our hostages back, and they better be back before I assume office or you will be paying a very big price.\u201d That threat is now operative, and the clock is ticking.",

      "Before last week\u2019s election, voters in six states had either enshrined abortion rights in their state constitutions or defeated ballot measures that would have restricted them.",
      "On Tuesday, that number more than doubled. In seven of the 10 states where abortion rights measures were on the ballot, they prevailed. From the most liberal of those states (New York) to the most conservative (Missouri), and regardless of how they voted in the presidential race, voters asserted the right to control their own bodies. Even in Florida, where an abortion rights measure failed, it won a more decisive majority than Donald Trump. (More about that later.)",
      "Ballot measures in New York, Maryland, Colorado and Montana enshrined abortion rights (and, in New York, other equal rights protections) in the constitutions of states where they are already substantially protected by law. Abortion is legal to the point of fetal viability in Montana, for example, but lawmakers there have repeatedly tried to restrict it.",
      "These measures may be unnecessary in liberal states where abortion remains legal \u2014 and let\u2019s hope they are. But every state that codifies abortion rights in its constitution reinforces them against the whims of elected officials. California voters passed a constitutional amendment bolstering the state\u2019s already strong abortion protections in 2022.",
      "The most important victories Tuesday were for measures in Arizona, which outlawed abortion after 15 weeks, and Missouri, where abortion was illegal with no exceptions for incest or rape. Missouri legislators have hardly missed an opportunity to attack abortion rights: One legislator floated a measure to make it illegal to help someone leave the state for an abortion.",
      "Both of those states now have constitutionally guaranteed rights to abortion up to the point of viability. Although legal or legislative efforts will be necessary to lift their now unconstitutional bans, it\u2019s astonishing progress for those states and the people who live in them.",
      "These election results should send a powerful message to state and federal elected officials and the incoming Trump administration: Americans will not tolerate the trampling of their reproductive rights in blue, purple or red states. Federal officials should keep that in mind as conservative state attorneys general consider trying to block abortion medication from being provided by mail.",
      "Three abortion rights measures did fail last week, all of them in states that could have desperately used constitutional amendments to ensure abortion access.",
      "In Florida, which bans abortion beyond six weeks \u2014 a point when most women don\u2019t even know they\u2019re pregnant \u2014 Amendment 4 would have constitutionally guaranteed a right to an abortion up to the point of fetal viability, which is roughly 24 weeks. The initiative earned a healthy majority of 57.2% but fell 3 points short of the state\u2019s undemocratic 60% threshold for approval of constitutional amendments. Trump carried the state with a smaller majority, 56.1%.",
      "A failed measure in South Dakota, where abortion is banned, would have allowed the procedure up to 12 weeks, which is considered restrictive in other states. Major reproductive rights groups such as the regional Planned Parenthood organization did not believe the measure would adequately restore abortion rights and refused to support it.",
      "And in Nebraska, where abortion is banned after 12 weeks with some exceptions, the presence of two measures on the ballot made for some confusion. The one that failed, Initiative 439, would have guaranteed a right to abortion up to viability and was supported by advocates of abortion access. The one that passed, Initiative 434, bans most abortions after 12 weeks. Under this measure, abortion could remain legal up to 12 weeks, but the Legislature has leeway to further restrict abortion rights, up to a complete ban.",
      "Advocates have more work to do to convince voters in states with abortion bans and restrictions that there is an electoral path to restore reproductive rights. \u201cEvery state that has a citizens\u2019 initiative constitutional process and restrictions on abortion is a place where we will be looking,\u201d said Kelly Hall, the executive director of the Fairness Project, which worked on the ballot measures in Missouri and elsewhere this election season.",
      "In states that don\u2019t allow citizens\u2019 initiatives, progress will be more challenging. But people in all kinds of states, liberal and conservative, have shown that they want to protect their right to control their own bodies.",

      "The Boston Herald on the next step from Democrats and Republicans",
      "The voters have spoken. Former president Donald Trump has not only won a solid majority in the Electoral College, he seems destined to win the popular vote, and by a substantial margin \u2014 the first time he will have accomplished that feat in his three presidential campaigns. Bitterness among Democrats will now confront triumphalism among Republicans, as the country struggles to pick up the pieces after a campaign harshly colored by apocalyptic warnings on both sides.",
      "Once again Trump has proven his political resilience and defied predictions on the left that he could never win a majority of the American electorate. Pundits and historians will wrestle with the forces that led to his victory, but in the broadest of terms, it seems clearly rooted in a post-pandemic unease about the state of the world, the economy, and the nation\u2019s very character.",
      "Despite his strongman bluster and bullying nature, a stubborn majority of voters \u2014 fairly or not \u2014 associated Trump with economic prosperity and global stability. What Democrats viewed as a threat to the nation\u2019s democratic character, Republicans embraced as an unwavering leadership to guide the nation out of chaos and decline.",
      "It will be easy to criticize Vice President Kamala Harris for running a button-downed, cramped campaign that failed to answer voters\u2019 concerns about her abilities and policies. And indeed, perhaps she could have spoken more forcefully about stemming the migrant crisis, about resolving the Middle East war, about acknowledging the shortcomings of the Biden administration, and about the ways she might have done things differently. But it is impossible to know whether any of that would have made a difference.",
      "It seems equally fair to credit her with running a vigorous and mostly uplifting campaign amid the disinformation, bigotry, and character assassination she endured daily. She faced extraordinary headwinds that even the most flawless campaign would have struggled to overcome: a deeply unpopular and visibly frail President Biden who declined to get out of the race until too late, leaving Harris too little time to help Americans know her better; inflation driven mainly by pandemic shutdowns, supply chain bottlenecks, and the war in Ukraine; a broad loss of faith in the assumption that the United States was the dominant power in the world.",
      "For Republicans, this will inevitably be a time of feeling vindication and jubilation against a Democratic Party they have come to view as arrogant, entitled elitists. But they would do well to not overplay their hand. They, as much or more than Democrats, should also be prepared to insist loudly that the president-elect set aside the warlike rhetoric aimed at their fellow Americans, resist calls for political persecution of his enemies, and oppose his gleeful pledges to disregard the law. Whatever deportation policies Trump puts into place, his victory should not open the door to extramural intimidation or even violence against law-abiding immigrants, legal or not.",
      "Urging Republicans to oppose violence against their neighbors and support the Constitution does not seem an unreasonable ask. Neither does holding Trump to his late-campaign pledges to leave abortion to the states and to protect women. Meanwhile, the independent institutions of American democracy \u2014 Congress, the judiciary, the press \u2014 need to be ready to stand up for democratic norms if Trump attacks them, as seems likely.",
      "It would also not be unreasonable for Republicans to insist that Trump start rebuilding faith in the American electoral system that he did so much to undermine. The very same system that he claims was rigged against him when he lost in 2020 this time around elected him with a relative lack of disruption. He should begin telling his supporters that the system worked and resist his party\u2019s temptation to disenfranchise the urban and minority voters who opposed him.",
      "For their part, Democrats should think hard about the substantive reasons Trump prevailed. Filter out, if you can, the bluster and bigotry, and it is possible to discern Trumpian notes that clearly resonated with many voters. The decline in American manufacturing. The need to forcefully counter an assertive China. The frustration of communities struggling with the cost of uncontrolled migration. The futility of trying to exert American military power everywhere in the world. The dismay with a reflexive progressiveness so dominant in American universities and cultural institutions. The feeling that they have been left behind.",
      "This will not be easy to do after an election result that, for many Democrats, seemed a rejection of all that they hold dear about their country: its democratic institutions; its commitment to civil rights; its legacy as a haven for striving immigrants. Overcoming their bitterness in order to see the legitimate hopes, aspirations, and humanity of their Trumpian neighbors is going to be difficult. But they should also recognize that the surest way back to power will be to win over some of those neighbors, not to shun them.",
      "At some point, when both the grieving and elation die down, Americans on both sides will need to decide that they are ready to come together again as a single nation. They will need to relinquish the instinct to retreat into perpetually warring fiefdoms. The genius of the founders was that they created a system meant to accommodate conflicting factions and to bend in the winds of history without snapping. But nothing made by man is unbreakable. The time to prevent the breaking has arrived.",

      "The Guardian on Trump's tariff promises, global fair trade",
      "\u201cTo me, the most beautiful word in the dictionary is tariff,\u201d Donald Trump told business leaders in October. \u201cIt\u2019s my favourite word. It needs a public relations firm.\u201d Now, with his election victory, Mr Trump\u2019s words send a shiver through global capitals. Many fear he may pull a curtain across the US economy, locking them out of the world\u2019s largest market and cutting off access to US technology. These fears are amplified by last year\u2019s contraction in merchandise trade \u2013 which was the first such shrinkage at a time when the global economy was growing.",
      "However, it\u2019s wise to take Mr Trump seriously, not literally. During his last term, he imposed tariffs on more than $400bn in US-China trade and renegotiated the North American free trade agreement (Nafta) in a push to reshore blue-collar jobs. In many ways, Joe Biden continued \u2013 and even accelerated \u2013 these trends. Mr Trump averaged 144,000 reshored jobs a year; in 2022, Mr Biden reached 364,000.",
      "As a self-styled deal-maker, Mr Trump will probably push for better terms for the US economy. German carmakers are concerned; South Korea expects  its companies would need to boost US investments if Mr Trump raises tariffs. The EU, China and Japan watch warily. The difference this time is that Mr Trump\u2019s unpredictable approach seems more erratic and his rightwing rhetoric even more deranged. It could be a bumpy ride.",
      "Britain is in poor shape to deal with global trade wars. The UN points out that its export revenues were down by 4% year-on-year. This is in part due to subdued demand from key partners, such as China. But no one should underestimate the continuing fallout from a disastrous Brexit.",
      "Importantly, a protectionist stance from richer nations isn\u2019t new. In 2022, the EU became the first major economy to legislate a \u201cgreen tariff\u201d on imports. A year later, the UK announced plans to follow suit. By 2027, both will levy charges on goods based on the carbon emitted during production \u2013 a move aimed at preventing \u201cpollution havens\u201d, where emissions are simply offshored to regions with weaker regulations.",
      "This may sound like a positive move, but it disrupts \u201cfree trade\u201d enough that some developing nations have labelled it discriminatory and pledged retaliation. Studies indicate that Africa, home to 33 of the world\u2019s 46 least-developed countries, could lose $25bn annually, at 2021 prices, from green levies. This impact is partly due to the fact that key exports such as fertiliser, cement, iron and steel are more carbon-intensive to produce in Africa than elsewhere.",
      "Stifling the progress of developing nations seems not only unfair but also shortsighted. What\u2019s needed isn\u2019t \u201cfree trade\u201d but fair trade. Perhaps that\u2019s not a phrase that Mr Trump favours, but it should be. African countries must be empowered to develop on terms that suit their needs, enabling them to earn the foreign exchange essential for a green transition. Otherwise, the rich world risks undermining African growth. This would be a loss not only for Africa but for the world.",
      "Wealthy countries didn\u2019t grow using the policies they now push on poorer nations. Almost all relied on tariffs and subsidies to build their industries \u2013 even Britain, despite claims of virtually no state intervention. As global competition intensifies for green tech, AI and robotics, trade policies should be crafted more fairly than they are today.",

Republican activist Loraine Pellegrino also became the first person to be convicted in the Arizona case when she pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge and was sentenced to probation.",

The two had initially been convicted on two counts in 2020, but a federal appeals court vacated those convictions and ordered new trials.",
      "A document signed by Lindberg and government lawyers serving as the factual basis for Tuesday's plea said that from no later than 2016 through at least 2019 Lindberg and others conspired to engage in crimes associated with insurance business, wire fraud and investment adviser fraud. He and others also worked to deceive the state Insurance Department and other regulators by avoiding regulatory requirements, concealing the condition of his companies and using insurance company funds for himself, a news release said.",
      "It all resulted in companies that Lindberg controlled investing more than $2 billion in loans and other securities with his own affiliated companies, and Lindberg and co-conspirators laundering the scheme's proceeds, according to the government. The 2023 indictment alleged that Lindberg personally benefited by \u201cforgiving\u201d more than $125 million in loans to himself from the insurance companies that he controlled, the news release said.",
      "\u201cLindberg created a complex web of insurance companies, investment businesses, and other business entities and exploited them to engage in millions of dollars of circular transactions. Lindberg\u2019s actions harmed thousands of policyholders, deceived regulators, and caused tremendous risk for the insurance industry,\u201d U.S. Attorney Dena J. King for the Western District of North Carolina said. The FBI and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also were involved in the investigation.",
      "There was no immediate response to emails sent Wednesday about Tuesday's plea to a Lindberg attorney and a website associated with Lindberg's wellness and leadership activities.",
      "A sentencing date has not yet been set. Lindberg, who surrendered Tuesday to U.S. marshals, asked that he be held in a halfway house in Tampa before sentencing. Kessler scheduled another hearing on the matter for next week. After his initial conviction on bribery-related counts in 2020, a judge sentenced Lindberg to more than seven years in prison.",
      "Lindberg previously had given more than $5 million to state and federal candidates and committees since 2016, favoring Republicans but also giving to Democrats.",
      "The U.S. Justice Department said one of Lindberg\u2019s top executives still awaits sentencing after pleading guilty in late 2022 in a related case to conspiring with Lindberg and others to defraud the United States related to a scheme to move money between insurance companies and other businesses Lindberg owned.",
      "Some of Lindberg's insurance companies have been placed into liquidation and under a process to regain financial health, the Justice Department said.",
      "North Carolina Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey said in a news release on Wednesday that he and his state agency would keep working with federal prosecutors to ensure that \u201cany money recovered through the restitution and forfeiture process will be used to repay the policyholder victims.\u201d",
      "Jurors determined that Lindberg and a former consultant attempted to bribe Causey in the late 2010s. Causey wasn\u2019t accused of wrongdoing \u2014 he alerted authorities and recorded conversations that served as the basis of 2019 indictments against Lindberg and three others."

      "A federal inspector general has exonerated two U.S. Park Police officers who fatally shot a Virginia man after a highway chase seven years ago",
      "McLEAN, Va. -- A federal inspector general has exonerated two U.S. Park Police officers who fatally shot a Virginia man after a stop-and-go chase on a highway seven years ago.",
      "A report issued Tuesday by the Department of Interior's inspector general found that the officers, Lucas Vinyard and Alejandro Amaya, did not violate procedures when they fatally shot Bijan Ghaisar, 25, of McLean, in November 2017 after a chase on the George Washington Memorial Parkway. It also concluded that they were justified in chasing Ghaisar after receiving a report that he fled the scene of an accident in which his sport utility vehicle had been rear-ended.",
      "The report said the shooting was within police policy because the officers reasonably feared that Amaya's life was in danger when he stood in front of Ghaisar's stopped vehicle and it began to roll forward.",
      "The only policy violation that did occur, according to the report, was when one of the officers used his gun to strike a window on Ghaisar's SUV.",
      "Ghaisar's death and the shooting was the subject of years of legal wrangling, though neither officer was ever convicted of a crime. Ghaisar's family did receive a $5 million settlement from the government last year in a civil lawsuit alleging wrongful death.",
      "On Wednesday, in a written statement, Ghaisar's mother, Kelly Ghaisar, disputed the inspector general's findings.",
      "\u201cThese officers should have never pursued Bijan,\u201d she said. \u201cAlthough they saw Bijan was in distress - probably frightened to death - they did not communicate that with their superior. They pulled Bijan over and drew a weapon, banged on his window, and kicked his tire. They then hunted him and pulled him over and shot him multiple times.\u201d",
      "Federal authorities declined to prosecute the officers after a two-year FBI investigation. At that point, Fairfax County Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney Steve Descano filed manslaughter charges against the officers in state court. That set off a tug-of-war between state and federal officials over who had jurisdiction to prosecute the case.",
      "In October 2021, a federal judge tossed out the manslaughter charges brought by Descano\u2019s office. The judge ruled that the officers were entitled to immunity and that their actions were proper under the circumstances.",
      "The Ghaisar family said the officers violated their own policies by chasing Ghaisar, who was unarmed when officers opened fire.",
      "Dashcam video of the shooting shows the pursuit starting on the parkway, then continuing into a residential neighborhood. It shows the car driven by Ghaisar stopping twice during the chase, and officers approaching the car with guns drawn. In both cases, Ghaisar drives off.",
      "At the third and final stop, the officers again approach with guns drawn, and Amaya stands in front of the driver\u2019s door. When the car starts to move, Amaya opens fire. Seconds later, when the car begins moving again, both Amaya and Vinyard fire multiple shots."

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump has made a victor\u2019s return to Washington",
      "WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump made a victor\u2019s return to Washington on Wednesday, visiting the White House for a nearly two-hour meeting with President Joe Biden and committing to a straightforward transition of power despite actively working to disrupt the same process four years ago.",
      "Sitting in the Oval Office, in front of a strong fire in the fireplace, the former rivals shook hands before Biden called Trump \"Mr. President-elect and former president\u201d and then settled simply on \u201cDonald.\u201d",
      "\u201cCongratulations,\u201d the Democrat told the Republican. \u201cI look forward to having, like they said, a smooth transition. Welcome. Welcome back.\u201d",
      "Trump replied, \u201cThank you very much,\" saying that \u201cpolitics is tough. And it\u2019s, in many cases, not a very nice world. But it is a nice world today, and I appreciate it very much.\u201d",
      "Except for the opening moments, the meeting was private, with Biden and Trump joined by their chiefs of staff. Trump said the transition between the outgoing and incoming administrations \"will be as smooth as it can get and I very much appreciate that, Joe.\u201d",
      "Trump, the winner this time, says he's ready to ensure that there is a seamless move between administrations. But when he lost four years ago, it was a very different story: Trump filed scores of lawsuits falsely claiming widespread voter fraud, refused to actively participate in transition work, denied the election results and helped incite a mob that attacked the U.S. Capitol, trying to stop the certification of Biden\u2019s victory.",
      "He also didn\u2019t invite Biden to the White House, and he refused to attend the inauguration \u2014 the first time that had happened since Andrew Johnson skipped Ulysses S. Grant\u2019s swearing-in 155 years ago.",
      "The new, all-smiles scene at the White House \u2014 despite what occurred four years ago \u2014 put in stark relief the remarkable political rebound for Trump, who departed Washington in 2021 as a diminished, politically defeated leader. Today he's preparing to come back to power with the Republicans having taken back the Senate, on the cusp of clinching a House majority and with what he and his GOP allies see as a mandate for governance.",
      "Neither the president-elect nor Biden answered questions shouted by reporters after their brief remarks. At one point, Biden looked at Trump, who moved his head to the side and gave a small shrug, but did not respond.",
      "Trump later told The New York Post that he and Biden discussed two issues on which they have differed sharply, the war in Ukraine and Israel's ongoing war with Hamas in Gaza.",
      "\u201cI asked for his views and he gave them to me,\u201d Trump told the paper. \u201cAlso, we talked very much about the Middle East, likewise. I wanted to know his views on where we are and what what he thinks. And he gave them to me, he was very gracious.\u201d",
      "It was unclear how long the president-elect's mild attitude toward Biden, set to be both his successor and predecessor at the White House, might last. After his 2016 election win, Trump met with President Barack Obama in the Oval Office and called it \u201ca great honor.\u201d But he soon was back to heaping insults on Obama.",
      "Trump looked at ease in the Oval Office in Wednesday, unlike eight years ago, when he appeared nervous and subdued when meeting with Obama. The president-elect left the White House after his session with Biden without addressing the large contingent of reporters on the driveway, waiting in case he made an appearance.",
      "First lady Jill Biden greeted Trump upon his arrival and gave him a handwritten letter of congratulations for his wife, Melania, who did not make the trip to Washington. The letter also expressed the first lady's team\u2019s readiness to assist with the transition.",
      "As he met with Biden, Trump sent out a fundraising email to supporters saying that he \"is inside the White House right now conducting a very important meeting.\u201d",
      "Trump had flown from Florida in the morning, joining up with billionaire Elon Musk for a morning session with House Republicans, telling them, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to win.\u201d",
      "He received a standing ovation from GOP lawmakers, many of whom took cellphone videos of Trump, as he ran through their party's victories up and down the ballot.",
      "\u201cI suspect I won\u2019t be running again unless you say he\u2019s good, we got to figure something else,\u201d Trump said to laughter from the lawmakers. The Constitution's 22nd Amendment prevents presidents from running for a third term.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said of Trump's arrival, \u201cHe is the comeback king.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe owe him a great debt of gratitude,\" Johnson said.",
      "Trump's reemergence comes amid Republican congressional leadership elections. He's endorsed Johnson's return to the speaker's office, with the president-elect saying he is with Johnson all the way, according to a person familiar with the remarks but not authorized to publicly discuss the private meeting.",
      "Musk joining Trump on the Washington trip came after the Tesla and SpaceX CEO has been spending much of his time at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's Florida estate, and participating in discussions as the incoming Trump administration prepares to transition from Biden's. Trump has named Musk to a government efficiency advisory role in his incoming administration. Some close to the president-elect and his team now see Musk as the second most influential figure in Trump\u2019s immediate orbit, after Susie Wiles, the campaign manager who is Trump's incoming chief of staff.",
      "Biden insists that he'll do everything he can to make the transition to the next Trump administration go smoothly. That's despite having spent more than a year campaigning for reelection and decrying Trump as a threat to democracy and the nation\u2019s core values. Biden then bowed out of the race in July and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to succeed him.",
      "Traditionally, as the outgoing and incoming presidents meet in the West Wing, the first lady hosts her successor upstairs in the residence, But her office said Melania Trump wasn't attending, saying in a statement that \u201cher husband\u2019s return to the Oval Office to commence the transition process is encouraging, and she wishes him great success.\u201d",
      "Wednesday's trip was not the first time Trump has returned to the Capitol area since the end of his first term. Congressional Republicans hosted him over the summer.",
      "Trump left Washington Wednesday without visiting his party's senators. While he was in town, they chose Sen. John Thune of South Dakota in a three-way race to replace outgoing GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. Trump's allies were pushing GOP senators to vote for Sen. Rick Scott of Florida.",

      "Neighbors of a factory in Louisville, Kentucky, where two workers were killed in an explosion say they complained for years about odors coming from the plant",
      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- For years, neighbors who lived near a factory in Louisville, Kentucky, complained amongst themselves and to local officials about a variety of strange smells coming from the plant, which produces colorings for food and drinks.",
      "Some described it as an ammonia-like smell, while others said it was more like burnt sugar or burnt caramel. They worried a bit about living so close to the plant, but never expected what happened Tuesday, when an explosion killed two workers, and blew out windows and ripped pieces off the roofs of nearby homes..",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always thought about it, like this is unsafe \u2014 seems like \u2014 because there was always huge steam coming from the place at night. But I never really thought that this would happen,\" said Shelby Dix, 31, who lives in an apartment in a multifamily home that is separated from the plant property by an alley.",
      "The explosion injured 11 other employees at Givaudan Sense Colour, and caused a partial collapse of the building. Three remained hospitalized Wednesday.",
      "\u201cWe are grieving with the families, friends, and loved ones of those that were lost and injured during this very difficult time,\u201d the Swiss-based company said in a statement.",
      "Amanda Strecker, who lived in a townhouse near the plant from 2018 to 2022, said she had long been concerned about the ammonia-like smell.",
      "\u201cWe felt when we lived there that something was going to happen. It was just a matter of time,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of problems with chemical smells in the air, reporting it locally to the environmental office, and them coming out and not finding anything.\u201d",
      "During the first few years Strecker lived in the neighborhood, the plant was owned by D.D. Williamson & Co. Givaudan acquired the plant in 2021.",
      "\u201cI had the plant manager\u2019s number at one point and I would call and let them know, \u2018Hey, something\u2019s not right.\u2019 They\u2019ve had a lot of issues there,\u201d Strecker said.",
      "In April 2003, while the plant was owned by D.D. Williamson, a tank exploded and killed a worker. Federal investigators determined the tank exploded because it was missing its pressure relief valve, which had been removed when it was moved to the Louisville plant in 1989.",
      "In 2009, D.D. Williamson paid a total of $600,000 in civil fines to the U.S. Department of Justice and the Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District to resolve allegations of Clean Water Act violations at the Louisville plant.",
      "Officials said they have not yet determined what caused the explosion Tuesday. Louisville Fire Chief Brian O'Neill said the building housed hazardous chemicals \u2014 typical for factories of that kind \u2014 and firefighters did not immediately know if any had been compromised. He said monitoring of air and runoff found none.",
      "Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said employees initially told officials \u201ceverything was normal activity when the explosion occurred.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is an incredibly sad and tragic incident,\u201d Greenberg said. \u201cI want the families of the two victims to know that the hearts of all Louisvillians are with them.\"",
      "As of February 2021, the factory made caramel colorings for the food industry by heating sugar and water and adding chemicals such as aqueous ammonia for some products, according to permitting documents filed with the Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District.",
      "At the time of the permits, the plant was still owned by D.D. Williamson & Co., which was founded in 1865 and initially supplied malt to brewing companies, later developed colors for soft drinks and more recently produced natural colors for food and beverage companies.",
      "The Swiss flavor and fragrance company Givaudan acquired D.D. Williamson in 2021. Givaudan Sense Colour offers a range of \u201cnatural colours, caramel colours, burnt sugars, and fruit and vegetable-based browns\u201d for the beverage market, according to its website. Spokespersons for Givaudan did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment Wednesday.",
      "Last year, the air pollution control district cited the plant for failing to notify the district about unspecified excessive emissions. It also was cited for not submitting annual compliance certifications and reports in a timely manner, as well as not abiding by permit requirements concerning monitoring, recording and inspections. The company agreed to pay a $7,500 fine.",
      "Carly Johnson, her husband and their 4-year-old son were at home when they heard a \u201ccrazy loud boom,\u201d felt their house shake and heard things falling off the walls and shelves as if a bomb went off.",
      "During the 12 years the family has lived about a block from the plant, they've smelled what Johnson described as a \u201cweird, burnt sugar smell.\u201d She and her husband had worried about living so close to the plant, knowing about the explosion two decades ago. But she said she thought that since it there had already been such a traumatic event there, \"they would have done everything they could to prevent this from happening again.\u201d",
      "\u201cWindows and everything can be replaced. I\u2019m just mad about my son going through that. That\u2019s what makes me the most mad,\u201d she said.",
      "The Louisville Fire Department is leading the investigation with help from state and federal partners. A reconstruction team from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives was headed to Louisville to help determine the cause of the explosion. Givaudan said in an earlier statement that it is cooperating with authorities.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick for attorney general, Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, was once embroiled in a sex trafficking investigation by the Justice Department he's been tapped to lead, and has been under scrutiny by the House Ethics Committee over allegations including sexual misconduct.",
      "That probe effectively ended Wednesday, though, when Gaetz resigned from Congress.",
      "Gaetz, a staunch Trump defender, has spent years enmeshed in scandals that threaten to derail his confirmation as the nation's top federal law enforcement officer by the Republican-led Senate.",
      "Gaetz has vehemently denied any wrongdoing, and said last year that the Justice Department's investigation into sex trafficking allegations involving underage girls had ended with no federal charges against him.",
      "Trump's attorney general is expected to oversee radical changes to the Justice Department, which has been the target of Trump's ire over two criminal cases it brought accusing him of conspiring to overturn the 2020 election and hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate. Trump, who cast himself as the victim of politically motivated prosecutions, vowed repeatedly on the campaign trail to carry out retribution against his political enemies if returned to the White House.",
      "It\u2019s unlikely Gaetz would be confirmed in time to oversee special counsel Jack Smith, who brought two federal indictments against Trump that are both expected to wind down before the incoming president takes office. Smith is expected to leave his post before Trump takes office, but special counsels are expected to produce reports on their work that historically are made public, and it remains unclear when such a document might be released.",
      "In a statement Wednesday announcing his pick, Trump said Gaetz would root out \u201csystemic corruption\" at the Justice Department and return the department \"to its true mission of fighting crime and upholding our democracy and constitution.\"",
      "In a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, Gaetz wrote, \u201cIt will be an honor to serve as President Trump\u2019s Attorney General!\u201d",
      "Hours before the announcement, Gaetz said in a social media post that there needs to be a \u201cfull court press against this WEAPONIZED government.\u201d He added, \u201cAnd if that means ABOLISHING every one of the three letter agencies, from the FBI to the ATF, I\u2019m ready to get going!\u201d If confirmed as attorney general, he would oversee both the FBI and the ATF, formally known as the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.",
      "Inside a private meeting of House Republicans, the news that Trump had chosen Gaetz to lead the Justice Department sent a shock. Republican Rep. Mike Simpson of Idaho said he has a hard time believing Gaetz will be able to get through the Senate confirmation process. Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said she didn't believe Gaetz was a serious candidate.",
      "Some of Gaetz\u2019 allies in the House defended him as Trump\u2019s pick, pointing to his experience as a member on the House Judiciary Committee. Asked Wednesday whether she thinks Gaetz could be confirmed, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, a fellow Florida Republican, told reporters that many will try to \u201csmear him,\u201d but \u201cthe evidence will speak for itself.\u201d",
      "The federal sex trafficking investigation that began under Attorney General Bill Barr during Trump's first term focused on allegations that Gaetz and onetime political ally Joel Greenberg paid underage girls and escorts or offered them gifts in exchange for sex.",
      "Greenberg, a fellow Republican who served as the tax collector in Florida\u2019s Seminole County, admitted as part of a plea deal with prosecutors in 2021 that he paid women and an underage girl to have sex with him and other men. The men were not identified in court documents when he pleaded guilty. Greenberg was sentenced in late 2022 to 11 years in prison.",
      "Federal investigators scrutinized a trip that Gaetz took to the Bahamas with a group of women and a doctor who donated to his campaign, and whether the women were paid or received gifts to have sex with the men, according to people familiar with the matter who were not allowed to publicly discuss the investigation. Prosecutors also investigated whether Gaetz and his associates tried to secure government jobs for some of the women, and scrutinized Gaetz\u2019s connections to the medical marijuana sector, including whether his associates sought to influence legislation Gaetz sponsored, the people have said.",
      "Gaetz had remained under investigation by the House Ethics Committee over allegations that he was part of a scheme that led to the sex trafficking of a 17-year-old girl.",
      "The committee began its review of Gaetz in April 2021, deferred its work in response to a Justice Department request, and renewed its work shortly after Gaetz announced that the Justice Department had ended a sex trafficking investigation.",
      "Over the summer, the committee provided an unusual public update into its long-running investigation, saying its review now includes whether Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts and sought to obstruct government investigations of his conduct. Gaetz has categorically denied all the allegations before the committee.",
      "Rep. Michael Guest, the Republican chair of the House Ethics Committee, had told The Associated Press that Gaetz's nomination did not change the panel\u2019s ongoing probe. But Gaetz's resignation means the committee will no longer have jurisdiction to continue its probe.",

      "In a press conference, Salazar launched his harshest criticism yet of rampant violence, police corruption and the Mexican government\u2019s mistaken attitude that \u201cthere is no problem.\u201d",

      "Salazar cited violence in recent days in the northern state of Sinaloa as an example. Sinaloa state police chief Gerardo M\u00e9rida said Wednesday authorities found a pile of between five and seven bodies on a roadside there, but were still counting body parts to see how many there were.",
      "\u201cThere is a pile of various bodies, with what we have found we have identified five bodies, but some are in pieces, they have been dismembered, there are mentions of seven,\u201d said M\u00e9rida.",

      "Salazar countered that in Sinaloa \u201cthe dead can be seen everywhere.\u201d",
      "Salazar had previously defended many of the Mexican government\u2019s actions, but he now says former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s \u201chugs not bullets\u201d strategy of not confronting the cartels \u201cdid not work.\u201d",
      "L\u00f3pez Obrador left office on Sept. 30, but his successor, President Claudia Sheinbaum, has pledged to continue the policy, even though under her leadership troops appear more willing to open fire.",
      "Fighting between two factions of the Sinaloa drug cartel broke out after two drug capos \u2014 one from each faction \u2014 flew to the United States and were arrested there on July 25.",
      "Drug lords Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada and Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez were apprehended in the United States after flying there in a small plane.",
      "Zambada later claimed he was kidnapped and forced aboard the plane by Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez, causing a violent battle between Zambada\u2019s faction and the \u201cChapitos\u201d group led by the sons of imprisoned drug lord Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n.",
      "Mexico later blamed the United States for detaining the capos, saying that had caused the outbreak of violence. Salazar said Mexico also shut down anti-drug cooperation after that.",
      "\u201cIt totally accelerated from there, the Mexican government closed its doors,\u201d Salazar said. The ambassador also criticized efforts by both L\u00f3pez Obrador and Sheinbaum to downplay the problem of crime and violence, claiming the problem was being exaggerated and crime statistics were dropping.",
      "Salazar did not clarify why he thought the Mexican government's numbers were untrustworthy, but in recent days the government appears to have changed the way it reports homicide figures.",
      "\u201cThe reality for the Mexican people, and that is for businesspeople, members of the press like you who work on the streets, those who have ranches, like the cattleman killed in Sinaloa over the weekend because he was a leader, they don't live with security,\u201d Salazar said.",
      "The continuing violence \u201cis a very serious problem in Mexico and saying there is no problem, blaming someone else, blaming the United States, obviously is not (the solution)\", he continued.",
      "He also blamed L\u00f3pez Obrador for having refused \u201c$32 million,\" an apparent reference to L\u00f3pez Obrador's decision to drop out of a U.S.-funded program to donate money to train and equip Mexican police.",
      "\u201cIt was rejected for ideological problems, and other explanations,\u201d Salazar said. L\u00f3pez Obrador said at the time he didn't want U.S. helicopters and guns, but by that point most of the U.S. money was going for training, professionalization and legal reform.",
      "After taking office in 2018, L\u00f3pez Obrador also cut funding for police forces and gave the army, navy and militarized National Guard the lead role in law enforcement.",
      "\u201cPolice become corrupt because they don't earn enough to live on,\u201d Salazar said. \u201cYou cannot pay a police officer almost nothing and expect them to do their job.\u201d",
      "Salazar had been previously known for defending L\u00f3pez Obrador despite his constant efforts to militarize law enforcement, concentrate power, eliminate regulatory and oversight bodies and shore up Mexico's government-run companies even at the expense of U.S. firms.",
      "It was unclear if Wednesday's critical turn in his rhetoric was in any way related to the victory of Donald Trump in last week's U.S. presidential elections. Trump has long been fiercely critical of Mexico.",

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- The U.S. Senate election in Pennsylvania between Democratic incumbent Sen. Bob Casey and Republican David McCormick is headed for a statewide recount, as counties continued Wednesday to sort through outstanding ballots and the campaigns jousted over which ones should count.",
      "The Associated Press called the race for McCormick last week, concluding that not enough ballots remained to be counted in areas Casey was winning for him to take the lead.",
      "A noon deadline passed Wednesday for Casey to waive his right to a statewide recount and Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro\u2019s top election official, Secretary of State Al Schmidt, a Republican, announced that preliminary results had triggered a legally required statewide recount.",
      "As of Wednesday, McCormick led by about 28,000 votes out of more than 6.9 million ballots counted \u2014 inside the 0.5% margin threshold to trigger an automatic statewide recount under Pennsylvania law.",
      "Counties must begin the recount no later than Nov. 20 and must finish by noon on Nov. 26. It largely involves running paper ballots through high-speed scanners, a process that former election officials say might not change the outcome by more than a few hundred votes.",
      "\u201dIt is an infinitesimal number, compared to the overall vote totals,\" said Jeff Greenburg, a former Mercer County elections director.",
      "Meanwhile, McCormick was in Washington this week, attending Senate orientation and caucus meetings to pick a new leader after Republicans won control of the U.S. Senate in last week's election that saw Donald Trump win the White House.",
      "Casey hasn't conceded and, while Republicans pressure him on social media, his campaign manager said in a statement Wednesday that \u201cMcCormick and his allies are trying to disenfranchise Pennsylvania voters.\u201d",
      "Adam Bonin, a lawyer representing the Casey campaign in Philadelphia, said Republicans were aggressively and systematically challenging the provisional ballots of registered Democrats, delaying the vote counting process.",
      "\u201cWhat we are seeing this year is more organized, more disciplined, more directed and more comprehensive than what we saw in 2020,\u201d Bonin said.",
      "McCormick's campaign consultant, Mark Harris, said large Democratic-controlled counties were dragging out the process by not adding the results of processed ballots to vote totals.",
      "The McCormick campaign was challenging provisional ballots that it is allowed to challenge under the law, Harris said.",
      "\u201cThis is clearly an effort to use lawfare to chip away at our lead,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThis is not going to work. Dave McCormick is the senator-elect and will be the senator.\u201d",
      "Counties, meanwhile, were busy Wednesday processing tens of thousands of provisional ballots and hearing challenges to some of them by lawyers for Casey, McCormick and the state parties. A provisional ballot is typically cast at a polling place on Election Day and is separated from regular ballots in cases when elections workers need more time to determine a voter\u2019s eligibility to vote.",
      "Litigation is possible. For instance, Bucks County's Democratic-majority election board voted to count more than 400 mail-in ballots that lack a correct handwritten date on the outer envelope \u2014 something that Republicans are challenging and have opposed repeatedly in court.",
      "Bucks County's decision is in line with various decisions in state and federal courts that have deemed it unconstitutional or illegal to throw out such ballots. But higher courts \u2014 including the state Supreme Court most recently on Nov. 1 \u2014 have blocked those decisions, with litigation still pending.",

      "It was the first seriously contested Senate Republican leadership election in decades",
      "WASHINGTON -- It was the first seriously contested Senate Republican leadership election in decades.",
      "Three senators were competing to succeed longtime GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, when he steps down from the post at the beginning of next year and Republicans take back the Senate majority.",
      "Sen. John Thune of South Dakota was elected Wednesday by fellow Republicans in a secret ballot vote.",
      "Thune, along with Sens. John Cornyn of Texas and Rick Scott of Florida, had campaigned furiously for the job. They also tried to differentiate themselves from McConnell, saying they would give rank-and-file senators more power and be more communicative.",
      "Each tried to make the case that he would be the best person to implement President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s agenda.",
      "A look at those three senators:",
      "Thune, 63, defeated then-Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle in 2004 after arguing during the campaign that Daschle had lost his South Dakota roots during his years in Democratic leadership.",
      "Well liked and a respected communicator, Thune had been seen as a front-runner for much of the year. He was the No. 2 Republican in the Senate and took over for McConnell for a few weeks last year when McConnell was on a medical leave. Thune is a former chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee.",
      "As he geared up to run for leader, Thune spent much of the year campaigning for his colleagues. According to his aides, he raised more than $31 million to elect Senate Republicans this cycle, including a $4 million transfer from his own campaign accounts to the Senate\u2019s main campaign arm.",
      "One potential liability for Thune had been his previously rocky relationship with Trump. Thune was highly critical of the then-president as Trump tried to overturn his election defeat in 2020 and after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by Trump\u2019s supporters. Thune said at that time that Trump\u2019s efforts to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power were \u201cinexcusable.\u201d",
      "This year, though, Thune and Trump talked frequently on the phone and Thune visited the then-GOP candidate at his home in Florida. Thune told The Associated Press over the summer that he viewed their potential relationship as a professional one.",
      "Cornyn is a popular and respected member of the Senate GOP conference. A former Texas attorney general and member of the state Supreme Court, much of his work has been on the Senate Judiciary Committee. He was also McConnell\u2019s No. 2, the job Thune now holds, for six years before he was term-limited out of the job.",
      "Cornyn, 72, had also spent much of the year courting his colleagues and fundraising for them around the country. He has long been one of the best fundraisers in the Senate, and his aides say he has raised more than $400 million for party candidates during his 22 years in office.",
      "In 2022, after a gunman stormed a Texas elementary school and killed 19 children and two teachers, Cornyn was tapped by McConnell to lead the GOP in negotiating gun legislation with Democrats. The bill, passed that summer, stepped up background checks for buyers under 21, increased prosecutions for unlicensed gun sellers and put millions of dollars into youth mental health services. While Cornyn has promoted his work on the gun bill, it could cost him some votes with the conference\u2019s most conservative members.",
      "Cornyn also had some past tensions with Trump, including his early suggestions that Trump might not be the best GOP candidate to run in 2024. But the senator, too, has smoothed relations with the incoming president, meeting him when he was in Texas to campaign and visiting him in Florida.",
      "While Thune and Cornyn both have leadership experience and have spent the better part of the year methodically trying to woo individual senators, Scott ran a different kind of campaign. And he believed he had a distinct advantage: his relationship with Trump.",
      "Scott, a former two-term governor of Florida and a successful businessman, was reelected to a second term in the Senate last week, beating Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell by more than 10 percentage points. He is a longtime booster of the incoming president, and positioned himself as a strong ally. Scott traveled to New York to support Trump during Trump\u2019s hush money trial earlier this year, and had said he wanted Trump to endorse him.",
      "Scott won a rush of support on social media over the weekend when he was endorsed by people close to Trump, including Elon Musk.",
      "Scott won 10 votes when he challenged McConnell for the post in 2022.",
      "Scott, 71, is part of a growing group of far-right senators who have criticized McConnell\u2019s tenure and advocated for more power for individual members. Several senators in that group, including Utah Sen. Mike Lee and Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, endorsed him, citing his business experience and relationship with Trump."

      "U.S. and Polish officials have opened a new NATO missile defense base in northen Poland",
      "WARSAW, Poland -- U.S. and Polish officials inaugurated a NATO missile defense base in northern Poland on Wednesday, with Polish officials welcoming it as a significant step in securing the country and the NATO alliance at a time of war in neighboring Ukraine.",
      "The U.S. missile defense base, which is being integrated into NATO's defenses, was originally planned under U.S. President George W. Bush as a way to protect Europe from ballistic threats from Iran. Poland, however, has always seen it as a form of U.S. protection in case of Russia aggression, fears that have grown since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "The Kremlin protested the plan from the start, and on Wednesday denounced the base as a challenge to its own military potential that would require measures \u201cto ensure parity.\u201d",
      "Polish officials, who gathered with the U.S. ambassador and other officials, welcomed it as historic step that increases the U.S. commitment to the security of Europe at a time of uncertainty due to the war in Ukraine. There are also concerns about whether Donald Trump will remain as committed to Europe's security when he returns to the White House in January.",
      "\u201cThe whole world will see clearly that this is not Russia's sphere of interest anymore,\u201d Polish President Andrzej Duda said at the ceremony in Redzikowo. \u201cFrom the Polish point of view, this is strategically the most important thing.\u201d",
      "Poland\u2019s Defense Minister W\u0142adys\u0142aw Kosiniak-Kamysz called the opening of the base with its hundreds of U.S. Navy personnel \u201can extraordinary event in the history of the security of Poland, the U.S. and NATO.\u201d He said the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East are showing the importance of air defenses.",
      "\u201cThe base in Redzikowo means the eternal presence of American and allied troops on the territory of the Republic of Poland and, strategically for Poland, it is one of the most important events in history after 1989,\" he said.",
      "The facility is equipped with the U.S. Navy's modern Aegis Ashore system, which can detect, track and destroy ballistic missiles in the initial phase of their flight. It is the second land element of Aegis Ashore in Europe after the first such installation went into operation in Romania in 2016.",
      "Asked about the base during a news briefing Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russian President Vladimir Putin had expressed his concerns about the U.S. plans even during the Bush administration.",
      "\u201cWe then insisted that the Americans saying all these plans are aimed against the ephemeral Iranian threat are in fact a lie, that all these plans were drawn up from the very beginning as an attempt to militarily contain our potential,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThis is the advancement of American military infrastructure on European territory towards our borders. This is nothing other than an attempt to contain our potential. And, of course, this leads to the adoption of appropriate measures to ensure parity,\u201d Peskov added.",
      "Later in the day, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte visited Warsaw for meetings with Duda and Prime Minister Donald Tusk, another gesture of NATO unity. He praised Poland for its contributions to the alliance, including its high level of defense spending.",
      "\u201cWith this, you are building one of the biggest armies in NATO,\u201d Rutte said at a joint news conference with Tusk.",
      "Tusk, who is preparing for Poland to take over the rotating leadership of the European Union on Jan. 1, said he has been speaking with other European leaders to make sure they remain committed to Ukraine being involved in any future negotiations about its fate.",
      "\u201cThis means that EU member states should ensure that future decisions regarding, God willing, ending the war or freezing the conflict, are made in full agreement and with the participation of the interested states, those from the eastern flank, but above all Ukraine itself,\" Tusk said."

      "Sen. John Thune has won an internal election among Republican senators to become the chamber\u2019s next majority leader",
      "WASHINGTON -- Republicans have elected South Dakota Sen. John Thune as the next Senate majority leader, completing a momentous shift in their leadership that elevates a top deputy of Mitch McConnell into a key position as President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House.",
      "Thune, 63, is in his fourth Senate term and has promised to work closely with Trump, despite differences the two have had over the years, and will be a crucial part of the incoming president\u2019s efforts to push through his policy agenda. The two spoke on the phone shortly after Thune was elected, the senator posted on X Wednesday afternoon, adding that \u201cSenate Republicans are excited and ready to get to work\u201d with the incoming president.",
      "Trump later congratulated Thune on his social media platform, Truth Social. \u201cHe moves quickly, and will do an outstanding job,\" Trump wrote. \"I look forward to working with him.\u201d",
      "Thune beat out two other competitors, Sens. John Cornyn and Rick Scott, by gaining majority support from GOP senators in two rounds of secret ballots behind closed doors. Scott was eliminated on the first round and the final vote between Thune and Cornyn was 29-24, according to several people who requested anonymity to discuss the private meeting.",
      "Republicans are replacing McConnell, the longest serving Senate party leader, as they prepare to take majority control of the Senate with the 53 seats they won in last week\u2019s elections. It was the first competitive election for Republican leader in three decades and Senate Republicans' first regime change since McConnell became GOP leader in 2007.",
      "Thune's election represents a major shift in the upper chamber's GOP conference as many senators have been eager to move on from McConnell's long and powerful reign. But it will also be a complicated test for Thune as he will have to manage a conference that is often divided over policy, navigate Trump's demands of the legislative branch and secure policy wins for the president as he begins his second term.",
      "\u201cIt is a new day in the United States Senate,\u201d Thune told reporters immediately after he was elected. He said his majority will work to toughen border security laws, lower energy costs and overturn regulations they see as burdensome.",
      "\u201cWe are excited to reclaim the majority and to get to work with our colleagues in the House to enact President Trump\u2019s agenda,\u201d Thune said.",
      "As the candidates tried to win over individual senators, all of their pitches centered around how close they would be to Trump. That was a more difficult task for Cornyn and Thune, who broke publicly with the former president over his effort to overturn his defeat in the 2020 presidential election and the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol. At the time, Thune called Trump's actions \u201cinexcusable.\u201d",
      "In recent months, though, Thune has worked to smooth over that relationship, visiting Trump at his Florida home and consulting with him on how to implement the incoming president\u2019s agenda. Thune told The Associated Press over the summer that he views their potential relationship as a professional one. If they both won their elections, Thune said then, \u201cwe\u2019ve got a job to do.\u201d",
      "As he made his case, Thune has made clear that he will listen to Trump's demands. When Trump posted on X Sunday that the new leader \u201cmust agree\u201d to allow him to appoint Cabinet members and others when the Senate is on recess, avoiding confirmation votes, Thune quickly responded in a statement that the Senate must \u201cquickly and decisively\u201d act to get nominees in place and that \u201call options are on the table to make that happen, including recess appointments.\u201d",
      "Speaking to reporters after he was elected, Thune noted that \u201cthe Senate has an advise and consent rule in the Constitution\" but that they will do everything they can to get his nominees in place.",
      "\u201cHow that happens remains to be seen,\u201d Thune said.",
      "Thune\u2019s win is all the more extraordinary because of his 2004 election to the Senate \u2013 defeating then-Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle after arguing during the campaign that Daschle had lost his South Dakota roots during his years in Democratic leadership. Twenty years later, Thune will become majority leader himself.",
      "Well liked and a respected communicator, Thune has been perceived as a front-runner for much of the year. Like McConnell, he hails from the Republican Party\u2019s more traditional wing.",
      "He is a former chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee and has held the Republican whip position \u2014 no. 2 in party leadership \u2014 since 2019. He took over for McConnell for several weeks last year when he was on a medical leave, a move that was widely seen as an audition of sorts as speculation surrounded McConnell's future.",
      "As he geared up to run for leader, Thune spent much of the year campaigning for his colleagues. According to his aides, he raised more than $31 million to elect Senate Republicans this cycle, including a $4 million transfer from his own campaign accounts to the Senate\u2019s main campaign arm.",
      "The election was difficult for many in the conference who saw Thune and Cornyn as similar choices. They are alike on policy, voting generally in step with the conference but working with Democrats at times. Cornyn is a longtime member of the Senate Judiciary Committee who took a leading role on bipartisan gun legislation two years ago.",
      "But the two differed on whether the leader should be term limited \u2014 a key demand from some in the conservative wing. Cornyn pushed for limits, while Thune did not.",
      "Scott, the former governor of Florida, was elected to the Senate in 2018 and quickly positioned himself as a foil to McConnell, running against him for leader in 2022 and aligning with Utah Sen. Mike Lee and others who have been highly critical of the current leadership.",
      "As Thune and Cornyn wooed their colleagues one by one all year, Scott was tied up in his own reelection race. He handily defeated Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell by more than 10 points.",
      "In the week since the election, Scott aggressively stepped up his campaign for GOP leader, campaigning publicly as the candidate closest to Trump and winning endorsements from people who are close to the former and future president, such as billionaire Elon Musk. But some questioned whether that strategy might backfire.",
      "South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds, Thune's home state colleague, said that he prefers the way that Thune and Cornyn have \u201chandled it one-on-one with everybody,\u201d but that he had talked to Scott as well. \u201cWe\u2019ve got three qualified individuals,\u201d he said ahead of the race.",
      "Still, both Thune and Cornyn adopted some of Scott's ideas as they worked to win over voters. Thune told the conference in a candidate forum Tuesday evening that he would allow more amendments on the floor and improve communication from McConnell's regime, addressing frequent complaints from that wing of the conference.",
      "McConnell did not say who he was supporting, but said after the vote that Thune\u2019s victory was a \u201cclear endorsement of a consummate leader.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe American people elected Republicans to restore stability and order after four years of Washington Democrats\u2019 failure,\" McConnell said. \"John Thune will take the reins with a tremendous opportunity to lead this transformation, and Senate Republicans stand behind him, ready to get to work.\u201d"

      "There were no protests on the streets as Donald Trump returned to Washington",
      "WASHINGTON -- The fireplace was crackling in the Oval Office on Wednesday morning as President Joe Biden shook hands with Donald Trump and congratulated him on his election victory.",
      "\u201cWelcome back,\u201d Biden told Trump, who said the transition \u201cwould be as smooth as it can get.\u201d",
      "It was a cordial exchange that was jarringly at odds with the strangeness of the political moment. Here was Biden, who once made it his mission to prevent his predecessor from becoming his successor, preparing to hand over power to Trump, who never conceded his defeat to Biden four years ago.",
      "But official Washington, which still feels the aftershocks of Trump\u2019s chaotic first term, appeared resigned to the potential earthquake of his second. There were no protests on the streets and no surprises during the past-and-future president\u2019s nearly four-hour visit.",
      "It was a far different scene than when Trump visited the city after his shocking victory over Hillary Clinton eight years ago. Back then, the country was still trying to figure out the real estate mogul and former reality television star, and Trump seemed somewhat nervous in his Oval Office meeting with out-going President Barack Obama.",
      "Now, Trump is undeniably triumphant and confident in his return, solidifying his place in American politics by overcoming two impeachments, a criminal conviction and two assassination attempts to win a second term in the White House.",
      "The victory lap began as soon as Trump touched down in his trademark red-white-and-dark-blue plane with his name emblazoned on the side.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s nice to win,\u201d Trump told House Republicans during his first meeting of the day.",

      "The lawmakers laughed. Was it really a joke? Or a suggestion that Trump views the constitutional prohibition on serving more than two terms as malleable?",
      "There was no way to know for sure, an uncertainty that recalled the did-he-really-mean-that tone of Trump\u2019s original stint in Washington. Either way, it seemed unlikely that Trump would face much resistance from a Republican Party that has been remolded in his image and will likely control all branches of the federal government.",
      "\u201cIf Donald Trump says, \u2018Jump three feet high and scratch your head,\u2019 we all jump three feet high and scratch our head,\u201d said Rep. Troy Nehls of Texas. He wore a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d tie and gold Trump sneakers.",
      "As if to demonstrate his dominance, Trump announced a series of loyalists for top administration positions, including Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz for attorney general and former Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard for national intelligence director. Concerns about their lack of qualifications could make it difficult for them to win Senate confirmation \u2014 but only if Senate Republicans decide to cross Trump by opposing them.",
      "The meeting with House Republicans took place in a hotel conference room blocks from the U.S. Capitol, which Trump had urged his supporters to march on Jan. 6, 2021, as Congress was ceremonially certifying Biden's election victory. Fueled by Trump's false claims of voter fraud, rioters smashed windows, fought with police officers and tried to prevent the transfer of power.",
      "They failed, but in subsequent years, Trump convinced Americans to set aside concerns about his attempt to remain in power and trust him to address their economic malaise and concerns about migration.",
      "He won a decisive victory over Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice president who replaced Biden at the top of the ticket after a disastrous debate performance crystallized concerns about his age over the summer.",
      "When Trump finished on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, his motorcade whisked him to the White House for the meeting with Biden. A few dozen Trump supporters stood outside the gate before he arrived, one holding a sign saying, \u201cWelcome back.\u201d",

      "Tenants searching for an apartment in New York City have long been forced to pay thousands of dollars to real estate brokers",
      "NEW YORK -- Mandatory broker fees, an unusual feature of New York City apartment hunting long reviled by renters, will be banned under legislation that passed Wednesday after overcoming fierce backlash from the city's real estate lobby.",
      "Under a system that exists in New York and almost nowhere else in the country, tenants are often forced to pay the commission of a real estate agent before moving into an apartment, even if that agent was hired by the landlord.",
      "The fees are steep, typically totaling as much as 15% of the annual rent, about $7,000 for the average-priced New York City apartment.",
      "The legislation passed by the City Council aims to stop landlords from saddling tenants with those payments \u2014 at least as an up-front fee. Though tenants may hire their own representatives, they will no longer be forced to pay for brokers that solely represent the interests of their landlords.",
      "In a city where two-thirds of households are renters, the bill is widely popular, a rare piece of municipal legislation championed by influencers on TikTok. It has also triggered opposition from brokers and their representatives, who warn it could send shockwaves through an industry that employs 25,000 agents.",
      "\u201cThey spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to lobby our politicians to try to kill this bill and try to force you to pay broker fees,\u201d Councilmember Chi Oss\u00e9, a Democrat who sponsored the the FARE Act, said at a rally Wednesday. \u201cBut you know what we did: We beat them.\u201d",
      "New York\u2019s broker fee arrangement dates back nearly a century to a time when agents played an active role in publishing listings in newspapers and working directly with would-be tenants. The commission structure is also found in Boston, but few other parts of the country.",
      "But with most listings now published online, and virtual or self-guided tours gaining popularity since the COVID-19 pandemic, many New Yorkers have grown increasingly frustrated by the fees.",
      "At a City Council hearing this summer, multiple speakers recalled shelling out thousands of dollars to a broker who seemed to do little more than open a door or text them the code to a lockbox.",
      "\u201cIn most businesses, the person who hires the person pays the person,\u201d Agustina Velez, a house cleaner from Queens, said at that hearing. She recalled paying $6,000 to switch apartments. \u201cEnough with these injustices. Landlords have to pay for the services they use.\u201d",
      "Brokers counter that they do much more than merely holding open doors: conducting background checks, juggling viewings and streamlining communication with landlords in a city where many tenants never meet the owners of their buildings.",
      "\u201cThis is the start of a top-down, government-controlled housing system,\u201d said Jordan Silver, a broker with the firm Brown Harris Stevens. \u201cThe language is so incredibly vague, we actually have no idea what this would look like in the world.\u201d",
      "Others opposed to the bill, including the Real Estate Board of New York, say landlords will bake the added costs into monthly rents.",
      "But some New Yorkers say that would be preferable to the current system of high up-front costs that make it hard to move.",
      "\u201cFrom the perspective of a tech investor and business owner in New York City, the more we can do to make it cheaper and easier for talented young people to come here and stay here, the better off we\u2019ll be,\u201d entrepreneur and bill supporter Bradley Tusk said in a statement. \u201cAnyone who has paid 15% of their annual rent in brokers fees for someone to let you in an apartment for 10 minutes knows the practice is nothing more than legalized theft.\u201d",
      "Mayor Eric Adams, himself a former real estate broker, has raised concerns about the legislation and possible unintended consequences.",
      "\u201cSometimes our ideas are not fleshed out enough to know what are the full long-term ramifications,\u201d he said this week, adding that he would work \u201cto find some middle ground.\u201d",
      "But he will have limited leverage in doing so: The legislation passed by a vote of 42 to 8, a veto-proof margin. It takes effect in six months."

      "The government says the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) can get more from investments - while tackling a \u00a32bn bill for fees - by joining together.",
      "There are 86 local government pension funds in England and Wales, which are mainly paid into by local government workers.",
      "These individually managed funds are divided by local authority, making it more costly, because each fund is paying its own management and administration fees.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 11:20:47 GMT",
    "summary": "The department for rural affairs suggested exempting some older farmers from having to pay, Newsnight is told.",
    "story": [
      "A bid by the department for rural affairs to soften changes to inheritance tax for farms - possibly by exempting some older farmers - has been rejected by the Treasury.",
      "The Treasury said there would be no change or mitigations to the policy, which will see an end to inheritance tax exemption for some farms.",
      "From April 2026, farms worth more than \u00a31m will face an effective inheritance tax rate of 20% - half the usual rate of 40%.",
      "BBC Newsnight understands that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), which represents the interests of farmers in government, believes it was not properly consulted over the change.",
      "How many farms will be affected by Budget tax rises?",
      "Most farmers won't pay inheritance tax, PM insists",
      "Farmers 'betrayed' by \u00a31m inheritance tax relief cap",
      "The department was informed about the policy the night before it was announced in the Budget.",
      "The move has been branded \"disastrous\" by the National Farmers' Union (NFU), with some farmers warning it would decimate the countryside.",
      "Defra suggested softening the policy to exempt some older people, possibly those over the age of 80.",
      "The April 2026 start for the policy means they may not have time to make use of existing rules to skip inheritance tax by passing on an asset seven years before death.",
      "But this suggestion has been dismissed by the Treasury, which said it had taken \"a fair and balanced approach\".",
      "Since its introduction in 1984, agricultural property relief (APR) has allowed small family farms \u2013 including land used for crops or rearing animals, as well as farm buildings, cottages and houses - to be exempt from inheritance tax.",
      "The Treasury said 40% of APR had been going to \"the 7% wealthiest claimants\", and that it had \"made a difficult decision to ensure the relief is fiscally sustainable\".",
      "It put this against a backdrop of \u201cpublic services crumbling [and] a \u00a322bn fiscal hole inherited from the previous government\".",
      "\u201cAround 500 claims each year will be impacted and farm-owning couples can pass on up to \u00a33m without paying any inheritance tax - this is a fair and balanced approach,\" a spokesperson added.",
      "There are divisions in government over the change.",
      "Some ministers believe it will only have an impact on relatively wealthy farmers - a couple using all their inheritance tax benefits will be able to pass on a \u00a33m farm tax free. Any inheritance tax charge on farms can be paid over 10 years.",
      "But other ministers believe the chancellor is in danger of undermining Labour\u2019s relations with rural Britain while raising a relatively small amount of money.",
      "The change could raise around \u00a3560m.",
      "Some sources in government have expressed concerns that the chancellor is creating unnecessary grief over a change that is not, in relative terms, a huge money spinner.",
      "There are concerns that the change - which has proved controversial among farmers since its announcement - could become \u201ctotemic\u201d in rural Britain.",
      "Protests",
      "The NFU warned it would \u201csnatch away the next generation\u2019s ability to carry on producing British food\u201d and see farmers forced to sell land to pay the tax.",
      "A rally to protest against the plan will be held in Whitehall next Tuesday.",
      "There is also a dispute around the figures used to calculate the changes.",
      "Farmers' leaders have been told by Defra that the figures come from the Treasury and not their department.",
      "Tom Bradshaw, the president of the NFU, said that Defra figures showed the changes would have an impact on 66% of estates.",
      "The Treasury said the figure was 28%.",
      "Clive Bailey, founder of the Farming Forum which is also organising a protest in central London next week, said on Thursday that any change to the new rules \u201cwould be a step forward\u201d.",
      "Mr Bailey, who farms in Staffordshire, said the suggested exemption should cover people much younger than 80.",
      "Compared with the wider population, farming sees \"a lot of people who should have retired already still working\u201d, he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme.",
      "He called the inheritance rules \u201cso poorly thought out\u201d.",
      "The cost of running a viable farm exceeded \u00a31m, he said, arguing that the government needed to sit down \"with real family farmers or agricultural economists\".",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not special, but the economic circumstances of farming are very different to other industries.\"",
      "'The policy will not change'",
      "During rural affairs questions in the Commons, Conservative shadow environment minister Robbie Moore accused the government of \"arrogance\" and urged ministers to publish a full impact assessment of the change.",
      "Environment minister Daniel Zeichner reiterated the government's figures that fewer than 500 farms a year would be affected.",
      "He added there were ways the change could \"be managed\" and called on Conservatives to \"join me in reassuring British farmers about their future\".",
      "Another Tory MP, former cabinet minister Sir Jeremy Wright, asked if ministers had considered limiting inheritance tax exemptions to those who could prove a farm had been in family ownership for \"a certain number of years\".",
      "Zeichner replied that the issue was \"complicated\", adding \"in future we will have further discussions\".",
      "Lib Dem environment spokesman Tim Farron said the tax rise would be a \"disaster for family farms\".",
      "\"Rather than blocking pleas from Defra to rethink, the chancellor must urgently meet with the farming community and NFU to better understand their heartfelt concerns and reverse the tax hike\".",
      "A Defra spokesperson said: \u201cWith public services crumbling and a \u00a322bn fiscal hole inherited from the previous government, we have made the difficult decision to reform Agricultural Property Relief in a balanced and fair way.",

    "summary": "With its rich resources, uranium mining companies want Canada to play a key role in fuelling nuclear reactors worldwide.",
    "story": [
      "Uranium is making a comeback thanks to a renewed focus on nuclear energy as a climate crisis solution. Canada, rich with high-grade deposits, could become a nuclear \u201csuperpower\u201d. But can its potential be realised?",
      "Leigh Curyer had been working in uranium mining for nearly two decades when he noticed a striking shift.",
      "In 2011, the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster in Japan badly damaged the world's view of nuclear power, and the price for the heavy metal - a critical component for nuclear fuel - cratered.",
      "But the last five years has seen a reversal, with the global price of uranium spiking by more than 200%, becoming one of this year's top-performing commodities.",
      "Mr Curyer, an Australian-born businessman, credits this to a changing attitude that began soon after Microsoft founder Bill Gates touted nuclear energy as \u201cideal for dealing with climate change\u201d in 2018.",
      "Four years later, then-UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson pushed forward a policy of generating at least 25% of the country\u2019s energy from nuclear.",
      "Shortly after, the European Union voted to declare nuclear energy climate-friendly.",
      "These events were \u201ccatalytic\u201d for the uranium industry and a turning point for Mr Curyer's company NexGen, which is behind the largest in-development uranium mine in Canada.",
      "His phone began to ring with calls from investors worldwide - something that \u201chad never happened in my previous 17 years in the industry\u201d, he said.",
      "NexGen, whose project is located in Canada's remote, uranium-rich Athabasca Basin in northern Saskatchewan, is now worth nearly $4bn (\u00a32.98bn), despite the fact that the mine won\u2019t be commercially operational until at least 2028.",
      "If fully cleared by regulators, NexGen\u2019s project alone could push Canada to become the world\u2019s largest producer of uranium over the coming decade, knocking Kazakhstan out of the number one spot.",
      "Other companies have also rushed to Saskatchewan to capitalise on the boom, starting their own exploration projects in the region, while existing players re-opened dormant mines.",
      "With its rich resources, Canada\u2019s mining companies see the country playing a major role in the future of nuclear energy, meeting a demand for uranium that is poised to rise after nearly two dozen countries committed in COP28 climate conference to tripling their nuclear energy output by 2050.",
      "Nuclear energy is often hailed for its low carbon emissions compared to other sources like natural gas or coal.",
      "The World Nuclear Association estimates that 10% of power generated worldwide comes from nuclear sources, while more than 50% is still generated by gas or coal.",
      "At this year's COP29, the focus has been on ramping up funding for nuclear projects in the wake of a recent UN report indicating that current policies and investments fall short of what is needed to slow global temperature rise.",
      "Canada\u2019s role in supplying the commodity is made more urgent by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, particularly for the US, which had relied heavily on Russian-supplied enriched uranium to fire up its commercial nuclear reactors.",
      "Mr Curyer believes his mine could prove to be \u201cabsolutely critical\u201d to America\u2019s nuclear energy future, as the US is now hunting for alternatives to Russia, including by ramping up exploration on its own soil.",
      "Uranium can be found around the world, though it is heavily present in Canada, Australia and Kazakhstan.",
      "But what makes Canada\u2019s Athabasca Region unique is that its uranium is especially high grade, said Markus Piro, a professor of nuclear engineering at McMaster University.",
      "Canada has set strict rules for the sale of its uranium to other countries, Prof Piro said, and mandates it only be used for nuclear power generation.",
      "The country is also referred to as a \u201ctier-one nuclear nation\u201d, he said, due to its capability to produce nuclear fuel from the mining to the manufacturing stage.",
      "Once mined, uranium is milled to produce what is called calcined yellowcake. It can then be enriched, if needed, at facilities overseas to create fuel for nuclear reactors.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got a one-stop shop here in Canada, not every nation\u2019s like that,\u201d Prof Piro said.",
      "Canada is currently the world\u2019s second largest producer of uranium, accounting for roughly 13% of the total global output, according to the Canadian government. NexGen anticipates that once its mine is operational, it will boost that to 25%.",
      "Meanwhile, Cameco, which has been mining uranium in Saskatchewan since 1988 that supplies 30 nuclear reactors around the world, re-opened two of its mines in late 2022 to increase output.",
      "CEO Tim Gitzel told the BBC that he believes \u201cCanada could be a nuclear superpower around the world\u201d.",
      "But enthusiasm around nuclear energy is not without its critics.",
      "Some environmental groups worry nuclear projects are too costly and come with timelines that do not meet the urgency of the climate crisis.",
      "Data from the UK-based World Nuclear Association shows that 65 nuclear reactors are under construction across 16 countries, most of them in China, and a further 90 are in the planning stages.",
      "Some are expected to come online this year - others won\u2019t be ready until at least the end of the decade.",
      "Meanwhile, more than 100 nuclear plants have been closed in the last two decades around the world, including the sole nuclear power plant near New York City, which was retired in 2021 due to high operating costs and environmental and safety concerns.",
      "Plants were also shuttered in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Quebec, Canada.",
      "And not all of Canada is on board with the country\u2019s uranium industry.",
      "British Columbia sits on its own supply of uranium but has not allowed any nuclear plants or uranium mines to operate in the province since 1980.",
      "Critics have also expressed concern about radioactive waste nuclear reactors leave behind for future generations.",
      "Others fear another Fukushima-scale disaster, where a tsunami disabled three reactors, causing the release of highly radioactive materials and forcing mass evacuations.",
      "\u201cThe risk is not zero, that is for sure\u201d though it can be reduced, said Prof Piro.",
      "\u201cEven though amongst the general public there are mixed feelings about it, the reality is that it has produced very safe, very reliable and affordable electricity worldwide.\u201d",
      "The industry maintains the technology is both promising and viable.",
      "Mr Gitzel of Cameco said the industry has learned from past safety errors.",
      "\u201cAnd the public is buying on,\u201d he said. \u201cI can tell you that we have in Canada great public support for nuclear power.\u201d",
      "A 2023 Ipsos poll indicates that 55% of Canadians support nuclear energy.",
      "Still, past uranium booms in Canada have turned into dramatic busts.",
      "North of NexGen\u2019s proposed mine stands Uranium City, once home to 2,500 residents in its mid-20th Century heyday. In 1982, a major local mining firm shuttered operations over high costs and a soft market for uranium.",
      "Now, Uranium City\u2019s population is 91 people.",
      "But investors argue that there is a true global burgeoning demand for the commodity that poses a golden opportunity for Canada.",
      "NexGen anticipates that construction on its mine - which is awaiting clearance from Canada\u2019s federal nuclear regulator - will begin early next year.",
      "Mr Gitzel says around 100 other companies are now actively exploring Saskatchewan for deposits.",
      "As to when it will be on the market remains unclear.",
      "Mr Gitzel cautioned that some companies have started explorations in the past that never reached production stage. The timeline to get mining projects approved in Canada can also be lengthy.",
      "\u201cBuilding a mine is going to take five to 10 years, and so far, the only ones in operation are ours, so we will wait and see how it plays out,\u201d he said.",
      "For Mr Curyer, it is crucial that his project and others are realised in the next four years, for both Canada and the world.",

      "The Communication Workers Union (CWU) said that for the company to propose the plans as the inquiry into the Horizon IT scandal continues was \"immoral\" and \"tone deaf\".",
      "The government-owned Post Office has 11,500 branches across the UK, most of which are franchises, with 115 Crown Post Offices.",

      "The shake-up aims to put the business on a firmer financial footing, but it comes as the long-running inquiry into the Horizon IT scandal heads into its final stages.",
      "Between 1999 and 2015, hundreds of sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted after faulty computer software made it appear as though money was missing from their accounts.",
      "'A new deal'",

      "Earlier this month, Post Office minister Gareth Thomas said the organisation was at a critical juncture and the government had already commissioned its own review into what the Post Office should look like in the future.",

      "Mr Railton said that conversations with the government on the proposed changes, and funding required, had been \"positive\" so far.",
      "Speaking in front of the inquiry on Monday, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds hinted that Post Office branches could fill a gap left on British High Streets by sweeping bank closures.",
      "But with the rise of mobile banking and contactless payments, there is a question mark over whether this would be a sustainable strategy.",
      "Fujitsu boss 'does not know' if Horizon is reliable",

      "Oil giant Shell has won a landmark case in the Dutch courts, overturning an earlier ruling requiring it to cut its carbon emissions by 45%.",
      "The Hague court of appeal said it could not establish that Shell had a \"social standard of care\" to reduce its emissions by 45% or any other amount, even though it agreed the company had an obligation to citizens to limit emissions.",
      "Three years ago, a court in The Hague backed a case by Friends of the Earth and 17,000 Dutch citizens requiring Shell to reduce its CO2 emissions significantly, in line with the Paris climate accords.",
      "The ruling came as climate talks involving some 200 countries got under way in Azerbaijan.",

      "Shell has argued that it is already taking \"serious steps to reduce emissions\". It complained the original ruling was unfair as it singled out one company for a global issue, and said it was unrealistic to try to hold Shell accountable for its customers' choices.",

      "A judicial review brought jointly by the environment groups Greenpeace and Uplift is being heard at the Court of Session.",

      "Campaigners calling for the projects to be halted held a protest outside the court on Tuesday morning.",
      "What is the judicial review about?",
      "Consent for drilling in the Rosebank field was granted by the regulator, the North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA), in September last year.",
      "Shell\u2019s proposals to develop the Jackdaw field were approved by the NSTA in 2022, after initially being rejected on environmental grounds.",
      "The environment groups say that when consent was granted for the fields, the impact of emissions caused by burning extracted oil and gas was \u201cunlawfully ignored\u201d by regulators.",
      "Uplift accused regulators of \"failing to be transparent\" in granting the consents and said Rosebank would damage marine life in the North Sea.",
      "The UK government said in August that it would not fight any cases over Rosebank and Jackdaw.",
      "It effectively accepted the original decisions were unlawful.",
      "This came after the Supreme Court ruled in June that regulators must consider the total environmental impact of new projects - including the way fossil fuels are used by end consumers.",
      "It is understood that the oil companies will accept that the decisions to give the go-ahead for Rosebank and Jackdaw were unlawful because the emissions they would create were not properly assessed.",
      "They are expected to focus instead on how to move forward with the projects, given that work is already under way.",
      "What do the campaigners say?",
      "Ruth Crawford KC, who is acting for Greenpeace during the case, told the court that the greenhouse gas emissions from Rosebank and Jackdaw would be \u201csizeable and significant\u201d and would have a \u201csubstantial impact\u201d on the environment and human health.",
      "She said the UK government had admitted that it was an \u201cerror of law\u201d to have failed to have taken into account greenhouse gas emissions from the eventual burning of oil and gas extracted from Rosebank and Jackdaw (known as Scope 3 emissions).",
      "Ms Crawford said granting a licence was ultimately a political decision but it must be done only after a lawful consenting process which included an environmental impact assessment taking into account Scope 3 emissions.",
      "She said politicians must not simply consider short-term issues when considering oil and gas projects but also the long-term effect on the climate.",
      "In this case, she argued, they failed to do so (because information about Scope 3 emissions was not available).",
      "To allow these two fields to proceed without a new environmental impact assessment taking into account Scope 3 emissions \u201cwould be to completely ignore that a crucial part of the decision making has not happened and will never happen.\u201d",
      "Greenpeace, she said, was not asking for oil rigs and drilling equipment to be removed. It was only asking that the oil and gas companies involved \u201cdo no further work to get petroleum from the fields.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe work must stop. No more. No less,\u201d she concluded.",
      "Alastair Duncan KC, for Uplift, echoed or endorsed many of the submissions made on behalf of Greenpeace.",
      "He also addressed written submissions made on behalf of oil and gas companies, whose lawyers are expected to address the court later this week.",
      "These, he said, amounted to the companies arguing that they were \u201can innocent third party\u201d who had reasonably relied on what appeared to be a \u201cstable legal landscape\u201d when making multi-million pound investment decisions.",
      "On the contrary, argued Mr Duncan, the legal landscape had been far from stable and Rosebank\u2019s developers Equinor and Ithaca were now \u201cthe beneficiaries of an unlawful decision,\u201d who wanted the court \u201cto allow them to continue to be the beneficiaries of an unlawful decision.\u201d",
      "Mr Duncan went on to outline another objection to the granting of consent for Rosebank.",
      "He argued that, in approving the field, the Oil and Gas Authority (now known as the North Sea Transition Authority) had unlawfully and irrationally failed to give reasons for its decision.",
      "Uplift has a third objection to the decision, claiming that the previous government and the regulator failed to adequately assess the marine impacts of Rosebank.",
      "What do the oil companies say?",
      "Norwegian energy giant Equinor and British firm Ithaca Energy jointly own the Rosebank field.",
      "They have said it would create about 1,600 jobs during its construction and support about 450 UK-based jobs during its lifetime.",
      "Equinor declined to comment while the court challenge was ongoing, but said it was continuing to \"work closely with all relevant parties to progress the project\".",

      "Backers of the digital currency are celebrating, and wondering how much more valuable it could become - with some suggesting it could reach $100,000 per coin.",
      "Its price is rocketing because the president-elect has vowed to make the US \"the crypto capital of the planet\" - a remarkable turnaround given as recently as 2021 he was calling Bitcoin a \"scam.\"",
      "He even started accepting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as donations to his election campaign and raised millions from the industry.",
      "But that is just one of the many twists and turns in the jaw-dropping story of Bitcoin, which continues to captivate people worldwide and has seen the making - and losing - of huge fortunes.",
      "Here's the BBC's list of the seven wildest moments - so far - in Bitcoin's tumultuous history.",
      "1. The mysterious creator of Bitcoin",
      "Despite its enormous profile, no-one actually knows for sure who invented Bitcoin. The idea for it was posted on internet forums in 2008 by someone calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto.",
      "They explained how a peer-to-peer digital cash system could work to enable people to send virtual coins over the internet, just as easily as sending an email.",
      "Satoshi created a complex computer system that would process transactions and create new coins using a huge network of self-appointed volunteers around the world who used special software and powerful computers.",
      "But he - or they - never revealed their identity, and the world has never worked it out.",
      "In 2014, Japanese-American man Dorian Nakamoto was pursued by reporters who thought he was the elusive Bitcoin creator, but it proved to be false lead caused by some mistranslated information.",
      "Australian computer scientist Craig Wright said it was him in 2016 - but after years of legal battles, a High Court judge concluded he was not Satoshi.",
      "Earlier this year, a Canadian Bitcoin expert called Peter Todd strongly denied being Satoshi, while in London this month a British man, Stephen Mollah, claimed he was - but no-one believed him.",
      "2. Making history with pizza",
      "Bitcoin now underpins a two trillion-dollar cryptocurrency industry - but the first recorded transaction using it was the purchase of pizza.",
      "On 22 May 2010, Lazlo Hanyecz, offered $41 worth of Bitcoin on a crypto forum in return for two pizzas.",
      "A 19-year-old student obliged and the day went down in history for fans of the currency as #BitcoinPizza day.",
      "A source of memes for those in crypto community, it also showcased the power of Bitcoin - an internet money that could genuinely buy items online.",
      "Criminals must have been watching too, because within a year the first darknet marketplace was launched selling drugs and other illegal goods in exchange for Bitcoin.",
      "The deal looks pretty bad for Lazlo now too. If he had held onto those coins they would now be worth hundreds of millions of dollars!",
      "3. Becoming legal tender",
      "In September 2021, President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, central America, made Bitcoin legal tender.",
      "Hairdressers, supermarkets and other shops had to accept Bitcoin by law, alongside its main currency, the US dollar.",
      "Many Bitcoin enthusiasts and reporters visited the area, briefly boosting tourism to the country.",
      "While President Bukele hoped the move would increase investment in his country and cut costs for citizens exchanging money, it did not become as popular as he hoped.",
      "He is still hoping it will take off but for now the US dollar still remains king in the country.",
      "As well as the huge amount of public money President Bukele spent on trying to make people embrace Bitcoin he also, controversially, bought more than 6,000 bitcoins over the past few years.",
      "The president spent at least $120m buying up bitcoins at various prices in the hope of making a profit for his cash-strapped country.",
      "It started to look good for him in December 2023 when, for the first time, his stash skyrocketed in value.",
      "A website built by Dutch software engineer Elias Zerrouq is tracking the country's Bitcoin holdings and currently estimates that the coins have risen 98% in value.",
      "4. Kazakhstan's crypto boom and bust",
      "In 2021, Kazakhstan became a hotspot for Bitcoin mining - the process of crunching through the complex calculations that underpin crypto transactions.",
      "These days it takes warehouses full of the latest computers running all day and all night, but the reward is brand new bitcoins for those companies that take part.",
      "Warehouses of computers require lots of power - and many businesses moved to Kazakhstan where electricity was abundant thanks to huge coal reserves.",
      "At first the government welcomed them with open arms as they brought investment.",
      "But too many miners arrived and put huge strain on the electricity grid, putting the country at risk of blackouts.",
      "Within a year, Kazakhstan's Bitcoin mining industry went from boom to bust as the government imposed restrictions and increased taxes to curb the growth.",
      "Around the world it is estimated that the Bitcoin network uses as much electricity as a small country, raising concerns about its environmental impact.",
      "5. Bitcoins in the rubbish dump",
      "Imagine having a crypto wallet worth more than $100m (\u00a378m) - and then  accidentally throwing away a hard drive containing the login details.",
      "That's what James Howells, from south Wales, says happened to him",
      "The very nature of crypto means that recovery is not as easy as resetting your password. With no banks involved - there is no customer support helpline.",
      "Unfortunately for him, his local council in Newport refused to let him access the landfill site where he says the device ended up - even after he offered to donate 25% of his Bitcoin stash to local charities if they let him.",
      "He told the BBC: \"It was a penny dropping moment and it was a sinking feeling.\"",
      "6. Crypto King fraudster",
      "No one has lost as much Bitcoin as former billionaire crypto mogul, Sam Bankman-Fried. The founder of the massive crypto firm FTX was nicknamed the Crypto King and loved by the community.",
      "FTX was a cryptocurrency exchange that allowed people to trade normal money for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.",
      "His empire was worth an estimated $32bn and he was flying high until everything came crashing down within days.",
      "Journalists had discovered that Bankman-Fried's company was financially shaky and had been illegally transferring FTX customer funds to prop up his other company, Alameda Research.",
      "Just before his arrest at his luxury apartment complex in the Bahamas in December 2022 he spoke to reporters. He told the BBC: \"I don't think I committed fraud. I didn't want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was.\"",
      "After being extradited to the US he was found guilty of fraud and money laundering and was jailed for 25 years.",
      "7. Investment bank boom",
      "Despite all the turmoil, Bitcoin continues to attract attention from investors and big companies.",
      "In fact, in January 2024, some of the biggest financial firms in the world added Bitcoin to their official asset lists as Spot Bitcoin ETFs. These are like stocks and shares, linked to the value of Bitcoin but you don't have to personally own any.",
      "Customers have been pouring billions into these brand new products. Companies including Blackrock, Fidelity and GrayScale, have also been buying up Bitcoins in their thousands, pushing up its value to record highs.",
      "It is a huge milestone for crypto with some fans believing that Bitcoin is finally being taken as seriously as the mysterious Satoshi imagined.",
      "Nonetheless, few would back against more wild moments as the Bitcoin story continues to unfold."

      "Fujitsu Europe's boss has admitted he \"does not know\" if the Post Office Horizon IT system at the heart of hundreds of sub-postmasters' wrongful convictions is reliable.",
      "Paul Patterson told the inquiry into the scandal there \"have been bugs errors and defects\" in the accountancy system and it is clear \"that there is a level of unreliability\".",
      "He agreed that this would be an issue for sub-postmasters currently using Horizon.",
      "In his second appearance in front of the inquiry, Patterson also admitted that he did not know whether Fujitsu had done an independent report into the software system.",
      "Though he added that he would welcome a third-party investigation.",
      "Between 1999 and 2015, hundreds of sub-postmasters and postmistresses were wrongly prosecuted after Horizon made it look like money was missing from their branches.",
      "Fujitsu's Horizon contract is up for renewal early next year and could be extended for a further five years.",
      "Patterson said he was \"very worried\" about what might happen if this happens because of how unreliable Horizon is.",
      "\"In my experience... if you don\u2019t keep [IT systems] upgraded, I cannot determine what will or will not happen, which is part of my nervousness of it being extended,\" he said.",
      "Monday marked the start of the final week of evidence at the inquiry, more than two and a half years since it started hearing evidence in public.",
      "Mr Patterson said Fujitsu was committed to paying out compensation to the victims of the scandal, calling it a \u201cmoral obligation\u201d, but said the firm was waiting until the end of the inquiry before actually doing so.",
      "In a heated exchange with Sam Stein KC, who represented some of the victims, Mr Patterson was pushed on why this was.",
      "\u201cYou already accept that there is a need for Fujitsu to put its money where its mouth is,\u201d said Mr Stein.",
      "Mr Patterson said the company wanted to hear all the evidence before going ahead. \u201cThese are complex matters and we need to understand all the components,\u201d he said.",
      "Earlier in the day, Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch gave evidence - as the former business secretary, the government-owned Post Office came under her remit.",
      "Mr Bates v The Post Office",
      "She said that the airing of the TV drama into the Post Office scandal \"brought the urgency\" to speed up compensation pay outs for sub-postmasters.",
      "The government needed to be \"seen to be doing the right thing\", said Badenoch.",
      "She accepted at the inquiry into the scandal that it was \"extremely disappointing\" that it took the ITV drama to escalate the issue.",
      "But she said her row with the Treasury over the time it was taking to issue compensation last August was not just a case of her \"posturing\".",
      "Badenoch said Mr Bates vs The Post Office, which was broadcast in January, raised awareness of the issue, turning compensation from \"a value for money perception to a public perception question\".",
      "She insisted work was being done on the issue by the previous government, but admitted it was \"too slow\" and criticised the whole \"government machine\" for slowing down compensation.",
      "The inquiry heard how Badenoch told the Treasury she wanted to give \u00a3100,000 \"flat offers\" to all sub-postmasters with a claim, with the inquiry to the counsel Jason Beer KC describing her mention of \"ministerial direction\" as a threat.",
      "He said this could be seen as \"soft power\" or \"posturing\".",
      "But Badenoch denied the claim, saying: \"It was signalling the direction I wanted the department to take to make it very clear.\"",
      "She said she believed speed should triumph over accuracy, and admitted that this might not have represented value for money from a taxpayer point of view.",
      "'Vanilla updates'",
      "Badenoch was also questioned over her sacking of former Post Office chairman Henry Staunton.",
      "She said she was not aware of how serious concerns were about him because of \"vanilla updates\" from civil servants.",
      "Her evidence statement provided her reasons for Staunton's dismissal, which included the former chairman attempting to shut down a whistleblowing probe into his conduct, behaving in an aggressive, intimidating and disrespectful manner, and having a poor understanding of Post Office's work.",
      "Staunton has previously defended himself after a report found he used derogatory language during a meeting about recruiting a board member. He has also refuted Badenoch's claim that he was under a \"formal investigation\" for \"serious matters such as bullying\".",
      "'Nothing should be off the table'",
      "Earlier on Monday, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said ownership of the Post Office could be handed over to its thousands of sub-postmasters across the UK.",
      "\"Nothing should be off the table for the future of the Post Office,\" he said, adding that the organisation's future will be set out in the first half of next year.",

      "Motorists who bought a car on finance could share in billions of pounds in compensation following a landmark test case.",
      "When Marcus Johnson, 34, from Cwmbran, Torfaen, bought his first car - a Suzuki Swift - in 2017, he was not informed the car dealership was being paid 25% commission, which was added on to what he had to pay back.",
      "In a landmark case with two other claimants, the Court of Appeal ruled in October that the finance company should pay the hidden commission plus interest back to Mr Johnson, and he is now due to receive just over \u00a33,200.",

      "Mr Johnson said he was \u201cfurious\u201d when he found out what had happened, adding: \u201cI paid \u00a31,650 for what I can only describe as showing me around the showroom for 10 minutes and then printing off a bit of paper.",
      "\"I signed a few documents and then drove away in the car.\"",
      "He said he had no option but to use finance when he bought the car, describing it as \"heartbreaking\" to find out so much extra money had been taken.",
      "\"Someone in my situation at that time, not being able to buy that kind of age car with cash, you would use finance,\" he added.",
      "\"And for companies to be able to be allowed to charge these ridiculous amounts of commission without disclosing it, without me being made aware of it at all, myself and thousands of other people.\"",
      "Mr Johnson bought the car from dealership Trade Centre Wales for \u00a34,600, and the company arranged finance with Cardiff-based MotoNovo Finance.",
      "He was not informed that the dealership was receiving commission of \u00a31,650, which amounted to about 25% of the total he borrowed.",
      "The car finance industry is now setting aside huge amounts of money to settle similar possible claims in the future.",
      "How can you claim?",
      "It is important to log your claim as soon as possible, according to Martin Lewis of Money Saving Expert.",
      "He said claimants did not necessarily need to go via a claims management firm, which would take a cut of any payout.",
      "Mr Lewis advised people first determine whether their finance agreements included a discretionary commission arrangement and, if it did, lodge a time-stamped complaint to the company.",
      "This was echoed by Rip-Off Britain's legal expert Gary Rycroft, who told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast the legal precedent set by the Court of Appeal ruling meant \"secret commission\" was deemed unlawful.",
      "He said it was important to check your contracts and ask your car finance company whether it had been disclosed if unsure.",
      "He said non-disclosure made for a clearer case but arrangements \"buried in the small print\" could still be worth making a claim against.",
      "But he added that, while getting your ducks in a row early was a good thing, there was a good chance lenders would be lodging a Supreme Court appeal, so claims may not be able to be acted upon for some time yet.",
      "Mr Johnson sold his Suzuki Swift in 2020, but after three years of regular payments, he still owed \u00a33,500 which he assumed then was due to the interest on the loan for the car.",
      "\u201cWith paying off the agreement for three years, I had only scratched the surface,\" he said.",
      "Dealerships were not acting outside of the rules and regulations of the industry by taking this sort of commission at that time, but they had a duty to inform their clients.",
      "The court of appeal said \u201cburying such a statement in the small print which the lender knows the borrower is highly unlikely to read will not suffice\u201d.",
      "There have been changes in the rules governing commission since 2021, when the Financial Conduct Authority banned discretionary commission arrangements.",
      "Kevin Durkin, from HD Law, who represented Mr Johnson in the test case, said: \u201cAs a financial reward for them being chosen, FirstRand Bank paid Trade Centre Wales a commission which Marcus knew nothing about.",
      "\"There was only a vague reference to this arrangement in the paperwork which the court of appeal found was buried.",
      "\"As such it meant that Marcus paid more than he necessarily needed to.\u201d",
      "He added it was far from being an isolated case, with many car dealerships and finance companies having operated in this way.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s completely widespread,\" he added.",
      "\"Almost all cars that are purchased on finance through a dealer or credit broker are sold in this way.",

      "Mr Johnson said he would never use a finance agreement again, but was delighted when the Court of Appeal found in his favour.",
      "\u201cIt was a big moment of relief and excitement and obviously  happiness all at the same time \u2013 especially with how tough things are at the moment,\" he said.",
      "He said he hoped others would also get money back, adding: \u201cI\u2019m so happy that my case and the decision that was made could potentially help thousands of other families, to me that\u2019s worth more than the money that I reclaimed in a way.\"",

      "\u201cThe whole question of how to better insulate the house is a real mystery to me,\u201d says Mr Duffy, a director of sustainability think-tank Citizen Network. \u201cI don\u2019t know where the expertise for that is.\u201d He also adds that he\u2019s also not sure whether he could install solar panels, given that he lives in a conservation area.",
      "Millions of homeowners across the country could be facing the same dilemma.",
      "Around 29 million British homes require retrofitting by 2050, according to the UK Green Building Council, an industry body.",
      "Retrofitting might involve measures such as improving your home\u2019s insulation, upgrading the heating system, or installing energy-generating devices such as solar panels, or even a private wind turbine.",
      "These adjustments can cost thousands of pounds up front, but, if properly executed, they could improve comfort and reduce people\u2019s bills in the long-run.",
      "Plus, increased energy efficiency ought to cut carbon emissions from homes, especially if property owners switch away from gas or oil-fired boilers, for example.",
      "Roughly one fifth of the UK\u2019s total emissions comes from residential buildings.",
      "Amy Peace and her husband live in the northwest of England, near Warrington. The pair both work in sustainability, advising businesses on their path to net zero.",
      "They were keen to improve the quality of their home and apply the principles they promote at work to their own lives \u2013 but they too faced challenges when deciding on how to go about it.",

      "Perseverance during the past three years paid off, however, and the couple\u2019s 1930\u2019s detached house now has improved insulation, a heat pump, and an electric car charging point. Solar panels and battery will follow shortly, if all goes to plan.",
      "Conscious of the confusion around approaches to retrofit, some organisations are moving to improve the advice available to homeowners. Among them is Ecofurb.",

      "There are many other organisations that offer to help homeowners plan a retrofit.",
      "The work often involves carrying out a heat-loss survey, to spot cold areas that require insulation, and to better understand a property\u2019s heating demand. Experts might also advise on the suitability of solar panels for your home, for example.",
      "There\u2019s the Get a Heat Pump website, launched by the charities Nesta and The MCS Foundation, which explains what heat pumps are and how they might fit into a home renovation plan.",

      "Improving the energy efficiency of homes is \u201cessential\u201d for decarbonisation, says Gerald Charles, head of housing retrofit at the Centre for Sustainable Energy, but he adds that the current lack of good advice remains a genuine problem.",

      "Through an initiative called MyHubb, Mr Major is now offering architects detailed reports that estimate the carbon reduction potential and payback period on retrofitted measures - such as heat pump-based heating systems or solar panels, for instance.",

      "They\u2019re all over your TikTok and Instagram \u2013 people unboxing the latest extravagant beauty advent calendar.",
      "Influencers excitedly wonder what eyeliner, serum or hand cream will be behind door one, and gush over the beautiful box it has come in.",
      "But are these products, which can cost hundreds of pounds, actually worth the money?",
      "Yes, says TikToker Cissy Jones from Manchester.",
      "We\u2019re just over a week into November and the 27-year-old, who is a social media manager at fashion brand PrettyLittleThing but also makes TikToks on her personal account, has already posted a dozen advent calendar videos. Everything from chocolate, to beauty products and wine, and even a Pets At Home calendar for her dog.",
      "\"There\u2019s one - the Harrods 12-day one \u2013 where every product in it is something that I would buy,\" she says. \"So I\u2019m saving money.\"",
      "That idea of saving money is something that brands latch on to with their marketing. A calendar may cost \u00a3250 but it\u2019s actually \"worth \u00a31,000\", they say, if you add up all the individual items.",
      "\"But you do have to want the actual products,\" says Cissy. \"Otherwise, it\u2019s a bit of a waste of money.\"",
      "Retailers can afford to make such seemingly good offers because there\u2019s a lot of margin built into beauty products, analysts say.",
      "And rather than aiming to make a big profit on them, they view advent calendars as a marketing tool to get you to buy more products afterwards.",
      "\"A lot of retailers recognise advent calendars are a great way of getting new products to the consumer and a way to get them to convert,\" says Natalie Berg from NBK Retail.",
      "However, Sarah Johnson from Flourish Retail says that while there are many lovely bespoke calendars out there, \"a lot [of companies] just use advent calendars to shift stock that may not be popular, rather than having to discount it\".",
      "Shoppers warned over luxury advent calendar scams",
      "The size of the items in advent calendars can vary \u2013 with some offering full-sized bottles, some smaller versions, and some a mix of the two.",
      "But smaller sizes may be what people want, says Ms Berg, as it's common to want to try something out before fully committing.",
      "Holly May Arnott agrees. \"They\u2019re a fantastic way to try new and trending products that I might have seen previously on social media,\" she says.",
      "The 26-year-old has been buying beauty calendars for several years now. It's something she and her mum do together.",
      "\"It\u2019s like prolonging that Christmas morning thrill,\" she says, adding a sense of excitement throughout December.",
      "The most expensive one she's bought was from Selfridges, which was \"such a luxury\".",
      "But she says while beauty calendars \"can feel like a bit of an investment, they\u2019re worth it for us\".",
      "With so many products out there, Cissy Jones\u2019s advice is to look for a brand you like and to look for value for money, in terms of the total cost of all the items individually versus the price of the calendar.",
      "However, even if a product may seem like good value for money, for some, spending more than \u00a3200 on an advent calendar is simply a luxury they cannot afford.",
      "As a result, many scam websites have sprung up, trying to take advantage of people looking for a good deal on an expensive item.",
      "Emma Jones and Nihal, who did not want us to use her last name, got in touch with the BBC after falling for fake adverts claiming to sell the Space NK \u00a3250 advent calendar for \u00a328.99. Both women were attracted by the apparent discount, and say they would not pay full price.",
      "\"I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable spending that amount of money, mainly because I wouldn\u2019t have that amount of spare cash,\" says Emma.",
      "\"They can be very expensive \u2013 I\u2019m not the type that would pay full price,\" Nihal says.",
      "\"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it. If you\u2019re going to use every single product then maybe yes. But sometimes in these prepacked stuff, you\u2019ll probably only use two or three of these products.\"",
      "But part of the reason beauty advent calendars are so popular is because shoppers still want to treat themselves, says Natalie Berg.",
      "And many are willing to pay full price \u2013 and beyond.",
      "The likes of Space NK, Harrods and Sephora have all sold out of their main calendars already.",
      "The Harrods beauty calendar was priced at \u00a3250 but claimed to include items worth \u00a31,600, while Sephora\u2019s \u00a3199 calendar said it included items worth \u00a31,000.",
      "But you can find people selling them on eBay, asking for as much as \u00a3550 for the Harrods one and \u00a3399 for the Sephora one.",
      "\"It goes back to supply and demand - dynamic pricing,\" says Sarah Johnson.",
      "It might make sense to buy it even at an overinflated price, she says, if the retailer is sold out and you can\u2019t get it anywhere else, especially if you perceive it as still making a saving on the total value of all the items.",
      "This begs the question though of why firms don't just make more.",
      "Ms Johnson points out that it's a seasonal product and they don't want to over-order and be left with surplus stock that they would then have to discount.",
      "Space NK told the BBC that it produced 30% more stock this year than last year but due to \"unprecedented\" demand still sold out within two and a half weeks. It plans to increase production next year.",
      "Despite the expensive nature of beauty calendars, Ms Johnson says there is a \"value perception\" there.",
      "\"People could buy it to break it out and give [individual items] as gifts. There\u2019s an element of people treating themselves and also being quite savvy and saving themselves money in the long run.\"",
      "With more and more of these calendars on sale now, there was a thought a few years ago that we might have reached \"peak\" advent calendar.",
      "But Cissy Jones disagrees \u2013 and thinks the opposite is the case.",
      "\"They always sell out every year, so I feel like there\u2019s room for more.\""

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 00:03:51 GMT",
    "summary": "Big mining firms are switching to driverless trucks and other autonomous equipment.",
    "story": [
      "It doesn't get much more remote than this. I'm in inland Western Australia, at Rio Tinto\u2019s Greater Nammuldi iron ore mine.",
      "It's about a two-hour flight north from Perth in a region called the Pilbara.",
      "No-one lives permanently here. Around 400 workers are on the site at any one time, and they are flown in, working between four and eight days, depending on their shift pattern, before flying home.",
      "Giant trucks the size of townhouses, capable of hauling 300 tonnes, criss-cross red-earth roads in various sections of this open-pit mine complex.",
      "For an outsider like me their size is intimidating enough, but multiplying that feeling is the knowledge that there's no driver at the wheel.",
      "During a tour of the site in a normal-sized company vehicle, one of the trucks comes into view, approaching from a side road.",
      "I sigh with relief as it deftly turns and continues in the direction we have just come. \u201cDid it make you feel uncomfortable?,\u201d asks the vehicle\u2019s driver Dwane Pallentine, a production superintendent.",
      "Greater Nammuldi has a fleet of more than 50 self-driving trucks that operate independently on pre-defined courses, along with a handful that remain manually driven and work separately in a different part of the mine.",
      "Being trialled is also an autonomous water cart affectionately known as Henry, which, along with manually driven ones, sprays the mine roads to keep the dust down.",
      "The company vehicle I am in is able to operate alongside the autonomous trucks only because it has been fitted with high-accuracy GPS, which allows it to be seen within a virtual system.",
      "Before entering the mine\u2019s gated autonomous zone, we logged onto this system and a controller verified over the radio that we were visible.",
      "It has encased our vehicle in a virtual bubble that the self-driving trucks \"see\" and which causes them to manage their proximity by slowing or stopping as necessary.",
      "A touch screen in our cabin displays all the staffed and autonomous vehicles and other equipment in the vicinity, along with \"permission lines\" that show the immediate routes the self-driving trucks are intending to take. Had I looked at the screen instead of fretting I would have seen that truck was going to turn.",
      "In addition to all vehicles being fitted with a big red emergency button that can stop the system, the autonomous trucks have lasers and radars front and rear to detect collision risks.",
      "The sensors also detect obstacles. If a large rock fell off the back of a truck, the sensors on the next truck along would notice it and the vehicle would stop.",
      "However, some trucks seem extra sensitive \u2013 on my tour I see a couple foiled simply by rough roads.",
      "Co-ordinating and monitoring these robots is Rio Tinto\u2019s Operations Centre (OC) in Perth, about 1,500km (930 miles) to the south.",
      "It\u2019s the nerve centre for all the company\u2019s Pilbara iron ore operations, which span 17 mines in total, including the three making up Greater Nammuldi.",
      "Guided from here by controllers, include more than 360 self-driving trucks across all the sites (about 84% of the total fleet is automated); a mostly autonomous long-distance rail network to transport the mined ore to port facilities; and nearly 40 autonomous drills. OC staff also remotely control plant and port functions.",
      "Autonomy isn\u2019t new to Rio\u2019s Pilbara operations: introduction began in the late 2000s.",
      "Nor is it unique: Australia has the greatest number of autonomous trucks and mines that use automation of any country, and other mining companies in the Pilbara also use the technology.",
      "But the scale Rio has grown its operations to here, including at Greater Nammuldi \u2013 which has one of the largest autonomous truck fleets in the world \u2013 gives it global significance.",
      "And it's a global trend. According to GlobalData the number of self-driving haul trucks worldwide has roughly quadrupled over the past four years to more than 2,000, with most made by either Caterpillar or Komatsu.",
      "The biggest reason for introducing the technology has been to improve the physical safety of the workforce, says Matthew Holcz, the managing director of the company\u2019s Pilbara mines.",
      "Mining is a dangerous occupation: heavy machinery can be unpredictably operated by people who can also become fatigued. \u201cThe data clearly shows that, through automation, we've got a significantly safer business,\u201d says Mr Holcz.",
      "It has also improved productivity \u2013 to the tune of about 15%, he estimates. Autonomous equipment can be used more because there are no gaps due to shift changes or breaks. And autonomous trucks can also go faster when there is less staff-operated equipment on the scene.",
      "Such automation does not come cheap. Rio won\u2019t disclose what it has spent in total on its Pilbara automation journey to date, but observers put it at multiple billions of dollars.",
      "Meanwhile, employment opportunities have evolved. The narrative might be one of robots taking jobs, but that doesn\u2019t seem the case here so far.",
      "While the OC has about one controller for every 25 autonomous trucks \u2013 according to Rio, no one has lost their job because of automation.",
      "Instead, there have been redeployments: truck drivers have joined the OC as controllers themselves, been reskilled to operate different pieces of equipment, such as excavators, loaders and dozers, or gone to drive manual trucks at different sites.",
      "On the OC\u2019s large open plan floor, amid the banks of monitors arranged in clusters for the different mines, I meet Jess Cowie who used be a manual driller but now directs autonomous ones from the central drill pod. \u201cI still put holes in the ground\u2026just without the dust, the noise and being away from the family,\u201d she says.",
      "Automation is delivering a \u201cstep change\u201d in terms of safety in the mining industry says Robin Burgess-Limerick, a professor at the University of Queensland in Brisbane who studies human factors in mining. But it doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t room for improvement.",
      "Professor Burgess-Limerick has analysed incidents involving autonomous equipment reported to regulators.",
      "As he sees it, the interfaces used by staff both in the field and in control centres to gain information aren\u2019t optimally designed. There have been situations where field staff have lost awareness of the situation, which better screen design may have prevented. \u201cThe designers of the technology should put a bit more effort into considering people,\u201d he says.",
      "And there is also a risk that controllers\u2019 workloads can be overwhelming - it is a busy, high stakes job.",
      "Over-trust, where people become so confident the autonomous equipment will stop that they start putting themselves at risk, can also be an issue, and he notes effort needs to be directed into improving the ability of trucks themselves to detect moisture. There have been incidents where wet roadways have caused them to lose traction.",
      "There can be legitimate safety concerns with autonomous equipment, says Shane Roulstone, co-ordinator for the Western Mine Workers Alliance, which represents mining-related workers in the Pilbara.",
      "He points to a serious incident this May where an autonomous train slammed into the back of a broken-down train, which workers at the front end were repairing (they evacuated before it hit but were left shaken).",
      "But Mr Roulstone also praises Rio generally for having, over time, developed \u201csome good strategies, procedures and policies\u201d around how people interact with automated vehicles.",
      "Mr Roulstone expects that at some point options for redeployment will lessen and there will job losses. \u201cIt is just the mathematics of it,\u201d he says.",
      "Meanwhile, Rio\u2019s automation journey in the Pilbara continues with more trucks, drills and Henry the water cart. It is also closely watching work by Komatsu and Caterpillar to develop un-staffed excavators, loaders and dozers.",
      "Late in the afternoon, waiting at Greater Nammuldi\u2019s airport for the last flight back to Perth, the announcement comes that it has been cancelled due to an issue with the plane. That\u2019s 150 extra people who will now need to be fed and accommodated. It is nothing for Rio, but I can\u2019t help but think we humans are complicated compared to robots.",

      "Speaking exclusively to the BBC, Sir David Behan, the regulator\u2019s chairman, called for radical change, saying course closures and university mergers might be needed for financial stability.",
      "The government is considering the long-term funding and reform of universities.",
      "Tuition fees in England will rise for current and existing students by \u00a3285 to \u00a39,535 a year for those on full-time degrees, in autumn 2025.",
      "Even so, new analysis by the OfS, the independent regulator of higher education in England, will show a worsening position for universities, the BBC understands.",
      "The regulator had said it expected 40% of universities to be in financial deficit in 2023-24.",
      "Now the OfS says by 2025-26, 72% could be spending more money than they have coming in and may have to use an overdraft or financial reserves.",
      "In 40% of institutions, cash flow may become so tight there will only be enough money in the bank to cover one month at a time of bills including salaries.",
      "Radically reimagined",
      "Sir David Behan, the OfS chairman, says a university going bust \u201cisn\u2019t imminent now\u201d, but to reduce the risk higher education needs to be \u201cradically reimagined\u201d.",
      "He suggests universities should think about \u201ca transformation of their offer\u201d, looking closely at the length and range of courses, and how to increase degree apprenticeships where tuition fees are covered mainly through the levy on larger employers.",
      "Apprentices are paid to work while they study, so students end up with less debt.",
      "Sir David says universities also need to collaborate more, and should consider mergers or whether courses at nearby institutions are too similar.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense for universities in the same city - or the same region - to compete in terms of the courses being offered,\u201d Sir David says.",
      "But, he says, as some universities reduce the number of courses on offer he doesn\u2019t want to see \u201ccold spots\u201d where students in more rural locations don\u2019t have a choice of courses at their nearest university.",
      "Why tuition fees are set to rise - and what this means for students",
      "'My 12 hours of uni each week are incredible value'",
      "Why are university tuition fees going up?",
      "The outlook has worsened for universities because they have recruited fewer UK and international students than predicted.",
      "For home students the OfS thinks the numbers accepted have increased by around 1.3% this year, compared with the optimistic 5.8% universities had predicted.",
      "Universities that traditionally required higher entry grades have fared better, because they have simply taken a bigger share by accepting some students with lower results.",
      "This has led to lower recruitment and increased pressure in universities that accept middling grades, and some smaller institutions.",
      "International recruitment has also fallen, with overall visa applications down by about 16% this year, and 20% fewer applications from India alone.",
      "Since January, most international students have been banned from bringing family members to live with them in the UK.",
      "The rule was introduced last year by Rishi Sunak's government, which committed to bringing immigration numbers down.",
      "Difficult decisions",
      "All of this comes as the government considers what to do about university funding in England from 2026, in a review likely to conclude next year.",
      "Vivienne Stern, chief executive of Universities UK, which represents 140 institutions, says universities are already \"making tough choices to control costs\", adding that the sector \"needs to continue evolving\".",
      "The University of East Anglia (UEA) in Norwich has cut \u00a330m in the last 18 months - almost 10% of its annual spending.",
      "Prof David Maguire, the vice chancellor, says \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d have led to a 20% reduction in the number of courses, increased lecture group sizes, less one-to-one contact between academics and students, and fewer staff in student support including in mental health and counselling.",
      "Unlike big city universities, there are no nearby institutions to collaborate with, so remaining financially sustainable is crucial, especially for the many local students who live at home.",
      "Prof Maguire says universities need to know what tuition fees or direct funding they will get through to the next election.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want boom and bust, where one year we\u2019re up, the next year we\u2019re down. That doesn\u2019t help anybody.\u201d",
      "The increase in National Insurance contributions the university has to pay as an employer will more than wipe out the increase in tuition fees next year, he adds.",
      "As universities cut back there is a risk to the student experience - this year the largest annual study of undergraduates found only 36% in England thought their course was good or very good value for money.",
      "Sir David says he expects \u201cabsolute transparency\u201d about what students are getting in return for fees, whether on contact hours or important services such as mental health support.",
      "He suggests business degrees are one area that might need more scrutiny to demonstrate which offer the best outcomes for students.",

      "The forecasts published on Friday will also form part of the public debate, and private negotiations between universities and ministers considering whether tuition fees should rise further in the future.",
      "The heat is now on universities to bring down costs, with renewed scrutiny from ministers and the regulator over how they spend money.",

      "Moreover, the Save the Student money advice website said the latest rise in tuition fees would make \"little difference to overall levels of student debt, and will have no impact whatsoever on the amount a graduate repays each month\".",
      "But borrowing more will, inevitably, mean students leave university with more debt.",
      "The government's latest announcement also only stipulates fees and loans in the 2025-26 academic year. Vice-chancellors and students alike will want to know what the government\u2019s plans are beyond that.",

      "Over time Infowars was increasingly embraced by Donald Trump\u2019s allies and his supporters. During his first run for president, Trump appeared on Infowars and told Jones: \u201cYour reputation is amazing. I will not let you down.\u201d",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 03:48:22 GMT",
    "summary": "Williams was fined $5m in a plagiarism lawsuit, but a film about his life doesn't touch on the issue.",
    "story": [
      "Piece By Piece, the new documentary about musician Pharrell Williams, is unusual in many respects - not least because it is entirely animated with Lego.",
      "Critics have welcomed the film's unique visual style, calling it \"disarmingly joyous\" and \"oddly charming\" - but they've also questioned one of the film's big omissions.",
      "Robin Thicke's Blurred Lines, which Williams co-wrote, is heard briefly on the soundtrack, without referencing the song's infamous plagiarism trial, which left the musician owing $5m to the estate of Marvin Gaye.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, director Morgan Neville said he had wanted to address the controversy, but the sequence ultimately derailed the story he was trying to tell.",
      "\"I definitely thought about it. I even interviewed Robin Thicke,\" he said. \"And as a documentary filmmaker, I'm obsessed with copyright law.",
      "\"But every time I looked at trying to work it in, a scene about copyright law, it felt like it belonged in a different movie.\"",
      "The Blurred Lines trial was hugely consequential for the music industry, after a jury ruled that Williams and Thicke had copied the sound and \"feel\" of Marvin Gaye's Got To Give It Up - rather than plagiarising a specific melody.",
      "The general consensus among music lawyers and songwriters is that the verdict failed to distinguish between influence and theft.",
      "It has now become common practice for musicians to assign a share of their royalties to songs that directly inspired them.",
      "\"My take on the Blurred Lines case is that it's one of the worst judicial decisions about creativity in history,\" Neville told the BBC. \"I think Pharrell was in the right on it, and I think most creatives agree with him.\"",
      "Ultimately, that led to him omitting the story from the documentary.",
      "\"It's not like Pharrell learned a big lesson from the case. I don't know if it actually changed him in any way, which is what I'm looking for, when I'm looking at a story.\"",
      "Williams has been contacted for comment.",
      "Neville previously won an Oscar for 20 Feet From Stardom - a documentary about the forgotten lives of backing singers who feature on some of rock's biggest songs.",
      "His other documentary subjects include Keith Richards, Brian Wilson, Johnny Cash and, as a producer, Taylor Swift.",
      "With Piece By Piece hitting cinemas this month, Neville told us about the film's unexpected genesis, how he convinced Lego to come on board, and the stars who had notes about their Lego minifigures.",
      "In the film, you dramatise the moment Pharrell asked you to make the film in Lego, and your response is \u201cLego? Seriously?\u201d How true to life was that?",
      "The main difference is that when Pharrell said \u201cLego movie\u201d, I thought, \u201cHell, yeah!\u201d",
      "I knew it was a crazy idea, but an exciting idea. I think it took me five minutes to fully buy into it.",
      "Can you break it down for me? What was Pharrell\u2019s pitch?",
      "He basically said, \"People have always wanted me to tell my story, and I've never been that interested, but I love your films, and I had the idea that you could make a documentary about me, and when you were done with it, you could throw away the visuals and do it again as Lego.\"",
      "That\u2019s almost exactly what he said to me \u2013 but beyond that, he had no sense of what that meant, or what his story was. So I really had to think, what does that mean?",
      "And one thing I instantly I realised is that it's not just about taking the real-life documentary footage and making it Lego. It's using what animation can do, which is time travel and go to outer space and all kinds of things that you can't normally do in a documentary.",
      "How quickly did it go from a crazy idea to reality?",
      "It took us about a year from when we first met to starting production, because we had to meet with Lego and tell them about it.",
      "How did the conversation with Lego go?",
      "I said, \"Look, it's not a G-rated movie, but I get that it can't be R-rated [either]. It's something that has to have a little edge, and it's going to get into questions of race and other things\".",
      "And Lego, to their complete credit, said, \"Those are conversations that are good for us to have.\"",
      "They knew it would push them, but in ways that they thought were good.",
      "But they didn\u2019t fund it, they don't own it, they're just partners.",
      "What was the moment you knew it would work?",
      "Well, we had to figure out how to get somebody to pay for it, so we did a 90 second proof of concept.",
      "I interviewed Pharrell, and I cut together a scene of him listening to Stevie Wonder as a boy, on his parents' stereo \u2013 and his synaesthesia kicks in. Suddenly there's lots of colour and you can almost see what's going on in his mind. That convinced me it would work.",
      "I love the way you visualise Pharrell\u2019s beats as Lego sculptures, each with its own unique shape. It really helps illustrate the abstract concept of songwriting.",
      "Do you know, what was interesting about the beats? Pharrell, in his mind, can tell you the colour and the shape of every beat he's made. So for each of those Lego pieces, we actually worked with Pharrell to make sure they looked like what he saw in his head.",
      "When you interviewed other people for the film \u2013 Missy Elliot, Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg \u2013 did you tell them it was going to be rendered in Lego?",
      "We didn\u2019t, partly because we filmed those interviews five years ago and we wanted to keep it on the down low.",
      "Then, cut to a couple years later, and I started sending out 3D renders of their characters, like, \"Here you go. This is what you're gonna look like\".",
      "It was a bit of a roll of the dice, but everyone was really excited about it.",
      "Did anyone ask for changes?",
      "Missy had a comment on her earrings, so one of the few bespoke [Lego] pieces that we made for the film were Missy's earrings.",
      "The Lego characters have a limited range of facial expressions. Did that pose a problem?",
      "The face stuff was the thing I was most worried about, because when you have close up shots of a Lego minifig crying, is that going to be emotional? I didn't know.",
      "But there were a few animators on our team who were really good at facial animation, and we gave them the most emotional scenes, the close-up scenes. And oftentimes, if something wasn't quite right, we would send them videos.",
      "Somewhere in the world, there are a whole lot of clips me and Pharrell making very strange faces!",
      "The arc of the film is Pharrell re-discovering his muse after a period where he gets lost, creatively. Why did you focus on that aspect of his story?",
      "Without a doubt, the film reflects a lot of questions I've had about my own career.",
      "To me, the story about this black nerd from the projects of Virginia who sees the world differently... and it makes him an outcast for a long time. Then he finds a fellow outcast in Chad Hugo [Williams' co-writer in The Neptunes] and they start making music.",
      "But their beats were just too weird for people. The signature Neptunes sound was very unorthodox. Nobody got it until everybody got it. Then you end up in this hall of mirrors \u2013 where the thing that makes you different becomes the sound of the mainstream. When that happens, how do you stay true to yourself?",
      "Your film comes out at the same time as the Robbie Williams biopic Better Man, where he's played by a CGI monkey. Do you think music biopics had become too formulaic?",
      "I do. There's so many tropes of music films, and I think we need to do more to help people identify with the people and with their characters.",
      "I haven\u2019t seen Better Man yet but the idea's perfect because, in a way, Robbie Williams is the performing monkey. He wants the attention. He's always lived that life.",
      "And Pharrell is the Wizard of Oz. He's like, \"I want to be the guy behind the curtain.\""

      "Ensuring that the exam runs smoothly is a nationwide effort. Shops and the stock market opened late on Thursday to reduce traffic congestion, and authorities adjusted public transport operating hours and put more than a dozen spare trains on standby in case of breakdowns.",
      "More than 10,000 police officers were deployed, including some tasked to ferry students to school during emergencies.",
      "Besides grounding planes to minimise noise disturbances during the 20-minute English listening test, authorities have also asked bus and taxi drivers to refrain from honking while the tests are taking place.",

      "The charitable foundation represents the late British businessman, who collected the items in Europe, Japan, Hong Kong and China, before his death in 1964.",
      "The director of the British Museum, Dr Nicholas Cullinan, said it was an \"incomparable private collection\".",

      "The donation will take the number of Chinese ceramics held by the British Museum to 10,000 pieces, making it one of the most important collections of such items of any public institution outside the Chinese-speaking world.",
      "Highlights from the foundation's donation include the David vases from 1351, which revolutionised the dating for blue and white ceramics with their discovery.",
      "The collection also includes a chicken cup used to serve wine for the Chenghua emperor and Ru wares made for the Northern Song dynasty court around 1086.",

      "He said these were to: \"Preserve intact his unique collection, to keep every single piece on public display together, and to ensure the collection would remain an inspiration and education for future generations.\"",
      "Arts minister Sir Chris Bryant added: \"I am thrilled these world-famous Chinese ceramics will now be displayed permanently in the British Museum, where the collection will educate and enlighten future generations for many years to come.",
      "\"I am immensely grateful for this phenomenal act of generosity and very much hope it will help set a trend for others.\"",

      "The fashion industry \"should be concerned\" by a trend back to using more skinny models, the editorial director of British Vogue has said.",
      "Chioma Nnadi suggested the change, following recent progress in body diversity, had been partly fuelled by the rise in popularity of weight-loss drugs.",
      "\"I do think maybe perhaps Ozempic has something to do with it,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.",
      "\"We're in this moment where we're seeing the pendulum sort of swing back to skinny being 'in' and often these things are treated like a trend and we don't want them to be.\"",
      "Asked by presenter Emma Barnett what was fuelling the trend, Nnadi said: \"I don't think we can pin it on any one thing.",
      "\"I do think that Ozempic has something to do with it because we're seeing a lot of celebrities who are using it, and I think there's this shift in the culture around how we think about our bodies and how we address our bodies.\"",
      "Nnadi said she thought it was \"important that all bodies are represented\" in fashion, adding that it was an issue she and her colleagues were mindful of.",
      "\"Thinking about the models that we can have in our [photo] shoots is very important,\" she continued.  \"And it was very important that we included models who were not sample size.",
      "\"But I think it's not something that we, as a magazine, can change on our own, because obviously the designers are making clothes that are sample size.\"",
      "Referring to last season's fashion weeks, where designers showcase their new collections, Nnadi said: \"I didn't think there was enough representation as far as body diversity.",
      "\"And it felt almost like, at certain shows, the models were especially thin.",
      "\"Hopefully the season will be a wake-up call and it won't be that we see that kind of negative trend [and] that we see that progress.\"",

      "\"Removing the varnish will reveal The Night Watch's eventful history. It will be a unique experience for the public to follow this process up close.\u201d",
      "The varnish, applied during a 1975-76 restoration, will be removed using microfibre cloths and cotton swabs.",
      "The process follows years of scientific research, trials on other paintings, and tests on The Night Watch itself.",
      "Made for Amsterdam's Arquebusiers Guild Hall, Rembrandt van Rijn's 1642 oil painting is one of the earliest to portray a group in action.",
      "A captain, dressed in black, is telling his lieutenant to start the company marching. And the guardsmen are moving into formation.",

      "The painting\u2019s original name is Militia Company of District II under the Command of Captain Frans Banninck Cocq - but it became known as The Night Watch, in the 18th Century.",
      "The artwork was coated with a dark varnish and accumulated dirt over the years, giving the false impression it depicts a night scene.",
      "Sprayed acid",
      "The Night Watch has been attacked with a knife - in 1911 and again in 1975, when the attacker slashed 12 cuts into the canvas.",
      "And in 1990, a man sprayed acid on to the painting - although, this time, thanks to a guard's rapid intervention, only the varnish was damaged.",

    "title": "Glastonbury 2025: 11 tips for getting festival tickets",
    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 12:43:50 GMT",
    "summary": "Tickets go on sale this week, so here are some tips to maximise your chances of securing entry.",
    "story": [
      "Tickets for the Glastonbury Festival go on sale this week, with millions of fans expected to fight it out for a chance to attend the event, which will run from 25-29 June 2025.",
      "No headliners have been announced yet, but demand is expected to be higher than ever because the festival will take a year off in 2026.",
      "Last year, all 210,000 tickets sold out in just 58 minutes as more than 2.5 million people tried to log on and secure a place.",
      "\"There aren't enough tickets for everybody,\" organiser Emily Eavis told the BBC's Sidetracked podcast earlier this year. \"It's one of the worst parts of the job [because] we can't do anything about it. We definitely can't do two weekends.",
      "\"But a lot of the time,\" she added, \"people who really, really want to come often get tickets through volunteering or through competitions.\"",
      "So there's always hope... But if you're brave enough to run the gauntlet of the online ticketing system, here are a few tips that might (might) help improve your chances.",
      "1) Check your registration",
      "As part of an ongoing (and successful) campaign to stop touts, anyone who wants to attend Glastonbury has to be registered in advance.",
      "The registration window closed on Monday, 11 November - so if you're not on the list already, it's too late.",
      "Everyone else is urged to check their details in advance, to make sure everything is up to date.",
      "You will need to have the registration number and postcode for each person you are buying a ticket for when the sale begins.",
      "2) Decide between coach or general entry",
      "Glastonbury tickets come in two flavours - standard weekend tickets and coach weekend tickets.",
      "Weekend tickets mean you can arrive under your own steam by train or car - although beware Glastonbury's legendary tailbacks, and how depleted your energy levels might be on the way home.",
      "Coach tickets are more environmentally friendly and, according to some, increase your chances of success, depending on how remote your starting point is. However, it's important to note that festival tickets are distributed on the coach itself, so you can't cheat the system.",
      "Ticket and coach packages will go on sale at 18:00 GMT on Thursday, 14 November.",
      "General admission tickets will go on sale at 09:00 on Sunday, 17 November.",
      "3) Team up with your friends",
      "You can purchase up to six tickets once you reach the booking stage, as long as you have the registration details for each attendee.",
      "Logically, the more people trying for tickets, the better the chances are of securing a space - so make sure all six of you are trying to log on when tickets go on sale (NB not in the same house... see below for why).",
      "Your syndicate doesn't have to be formed of people you're physically going to the festival with. It can be friends, colleagues, aunts, uncles, neighbours or Chris Martin from Coldplay. The point is that you're working together.",
      "Make a group chat so you can co-ordinate your efforts and, most importantly, put all of your registration numbers and postcodes in a shared document so the first person to reach the front of the queue is ready.",
      "4) Don't fall for scam websites",
      "The demand for Glastonbury tickets inevitably attracts scam artists and fraudsters, who prey on people's desperation to separate them from their money.",
      "Tickets are sold exclusively at glastonbury.seetickets.com. Avoid the temptation of buying from elsewhere.",
      "5) Log on early",
      "This year, Glastonbury has introduced a new queueing system that requires you to log on in advance.",
      "That way, when the ticket sale starts, you will be randomly assigned a place in the queue.",
      "People who join later will automatically be placed at the back of the line, so it pays to be punctual.",
      "Also, 09:00 on Sunday isn't the most sociable time of the week. Set an alarm. Set multiple alarms. Get an insomniac friend to come over to your house and poke you with a stick. Whatever works.",
      "If it's possible (and I apologise for this in advance), you could even drag yourself into work. No matter how good your wifi is at home, a work computer could have a more stable connection.",
      "6) Don't use multiple devices",
      "Using multiple devices and browser tabs can result in errors and may even get you kicked out of the queue, which you definitely don't want.",
      "Sticking to one device per household also makes the process more fair, according to the Glastonbury website.",
      "\"Whilst we understand that everyone wants to have the best possible chance of booking a ticket, running multiple devices simultaneously to attempt to access the website is a waste of valuable resources, and doesn\u2019t reflect the ethos of the festival.",
      "\"Please stick to one device and one tab, so that you can focus on entering your details without confusing your browser and help us make the ticket sale as quick and stress free as possible for all.\"",
      "7) Familiarise yourself with the booking process",
      "A limited number of people will be given access to the booking system at any one time. Before that, you will be held in a queue.",
      "When (or if) you get through, you will be asked to enter the registration number and postcode for the lead booker and up to five other people. Copy and paste them, instead of entering manually, to avoid errors.",
      "When you proceed, the next page will summarise the details you entered. Check them carefully because they cannot be changed.",
      "If you are booking a coach package, the next step will be to choose the time, date and place you will depart from. It is only possible to book tickets from one departure town in a single transaction.",
      "Once that's all confirmed, you will be asked to enter payment details.",
      "8) Have your payment information ready",
      "This year, Glastonbury tickets cost \u00a3375.50 each plus a \u00a35 booking fee - but at the check-out you will only pay a deposit of \u00a375, with the balance due in the first week of April. (Children under the age of 12 go free, and do not need to be registered.)",
      "Make sure you have enough money in your account (\u00a3450 if you're buying for six people) and, crucially, keep your card details to hand.",
      "When the time comes, enter these details exactly as you see them because a mistake could result in the purchase being declined. In some cases, that could leave your registration details being frozen for up to 10 minutes.",
      "Finally, make sure your phone is charged and notifications aren't silenced, in case your bank contacts you for verification.",
      "9) Check your email",
      "Once you've made the booking, be sure to check your email for confirmation - including the junk folder.",
      "If you don't receive an email within three hours, ticket-holders are urged to contact See Tickets on their customer service portal.",
      "10) Don't despair",
      "If you're not one of the lucky ones, there's still hope.",
      "It's possible to get into the festival as a volunteer - typically working three eight-hour shifts in return for a ticket.",
      "And in April, a number of returned or unwanted tickets will be put up for sale. At which point, you can go through the stress of applying all over again.",
      "11) Indulge in wild speculation about the line-up",
      "This won't help you get tickets, but is an essential part of the annual routine.",
      "Nobody except Emily Eavis knows who'll be headlining next year - but rumours are rumours, and everybody enjoys speculating about the line-up.",
      "Oasis, whose reunion tour takes place next summer, have already ruled themselves out. But current contenders for the top slots include Sam Fender, who put on an incredible Pyramid Stage performance two years ago; and Olivia Rodrigo, who's already headlining the BST Festival in London on Glastonbury weekend.",
      "Eminem and Rihanna are among the perennial will-they/won't-they headliners, while Billy Joel and Stevie Wonder are supposedly in the running for the legend slot.",
      "In previous years, piecemeal confirmation of the line-up has started in November, but the full rundown is typically kept under wraps until March.",

    "published": "Wed, 13 Nov 2024 03:55:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Before Tupac's murder, producer Quincy Jones brought stars together to try to end violence in hip-hop.",
    "story": [
      "Before the east and west coast rap beef of the 1990s boiled over with the murders of Tupac Shakur and Notorious BIG, legendary producer Quincy Jones called a secret meeting at which he appealed for an end to the violence.",
      "As hip-hop rose from the streets to the mainstream in the 90s, the rappers and hustlers that broke through had few role models who had trodden that path before them.",
      "There was one man, though, who had been there, and done pretty much everything.",
      "Quincy Jones had been in gangs and had been stabbed at the age of seven in 1930s Chicago, before becoming a major force in American music thanks to his work with legends like Ray Charles, Frank Sinatra and Michael Jackson.",
      "He was at the heart of revolutions in jazz, swing, soul, funk, disco and pop - but one aspect of his career that got less attention when he died last week at the age of 91 was his place in hip-hop.",
      "Jones was revered in all corners of music, including rap. Unlike most in the old guard and the media, he immediately realised the scene's artistic and cultural importance.",
      "Hip-hop reminded him of the bebop jazz of his youth. \"I feel a kinship there because we went through a lot of the same stuff,\" he said.",
      "\"Quincy understood it and got it right away,\" says pioneering artist, rapper and presenter Fab 5 Freddy.",
      "Jones worked with leading rappers in the 80s, and in the 90s he recognised risks including a volatile rivalry that had begun to erupt between competing labels and stars.",
      "So he brought artists, executives and elder black American statesmen together for a secret summit in 1995, hoping it would be a turning point.",
      "The east coast was hip-hop's spiritual home. In 1992, Sean Combs - then known as Puffy and later as P Diddy - launched his Bad Boy record label in New York with artists including Notorious BIG, aka Biggie Smalls.",
      "Meanwhile, across America, Los Angeles was coming into its own as the capital of gangsta rap, led by menacing mogul Suge Knight's Death Row Records, which had Dr Dre and Tupac.",
      "In 1994, Tupac was shot and injured during a robbery in the lobby of a studio. He later implied that his former friend Biggie may have known about the attack in advance. Biggie then released the track Who Shot Ya?, which Tupac thought was about him.",
      "The beef continued at the Source magazine awards on 3 August 1995, when Knight goaded Combs and Bad Boy Records from the stage.",
      "Jones, who had his own magazine, Vibe, held his summit three weeks later.",
      "Quincy Jones: From 'street rat' to music mastermind",
      "Quincy Jones: His brilliance explained in 10 songs",
      "'He changed my life': Stars remember Quincy Jones",
      "The brewing east-west beef wasn't the only reason Jones called it - it was mainly intended to discuss the state of hip-hop and let the new generation hear life and business advice from a group of highly successful black executives.",
      "But rap's negative image and the burgeoning tensions were a big talking point.",
      "\"He knew this was a bubbling issue, and so his idea was to bring together a symposium,\" says Fab 5 Freddy, who was hosting Yo! MTV Raps at the time and was the event's moderator.",
      "Jones told the summit: \"The thing that really provoked me to say it's time to pay attention now is Tupac.\"",
      "Tupac was missing, however - he was in jail for sexual assault at the time. Suge and Dre were there, as were Combs and Biggie.",
      "Jones had already experienced his own beef with Tupac - the rapper criticised the producer in a 1993 edition of Source for marrying white women.",
      "\"We finally hooked up, even though it was tension conditions in the beginning,\" Jones said at the event.",
      "\"We finally talked to each other, and he said nobody had talked to him like that before.",
      "\"And I said, I can't take it any more. Because we can no longer afford to be non-political, and I'm talking to the hip-hop nation now.\"",
      "About 50 influential artists and executives were in the room, including Public Enemy's Chuck D, members of A Tribe Called Quest, MC Lyte, Kris Kross, Jermaine Dupri and Boyz n the Hood film-maker John Singleton.",
      "Jones wrote in his now-out-of-print 2001 autobiography: \"I had been concerned about the potentially volatile diversity of a group who'd never been in the same room together.\"",
      "They were joined by veteran executives Clarence Avant and Ahmet Ertegun, plus Colin Powell, the former national security adviser and head of the US military who would go on to become the first African-American secretary of state.",
      "Powell had presidential ambitions - that was why the summit was held in secret. Jones wanted to save Powell from being associated with the negative publicity that surrounded rap music.",
      "He switched venues at the last minute to throw press off the scent, and confiscated the recordings.",
      "\"Rest assured that my discretion is based on a deep respect for you and a valued friendship,\" Jones wrote to Powell in an unpublished letter held at Indianapolis University Library.",
      "\"I know that we are going to make a difference at this conference. Thanks for the way you handled the situation. Maybe we can turn the battleship an inch or two.\"",
      "Jones later wrote in his book: \"Some of the younger rappers didn't even know who he was. When addressing some of the more confrontational comments from the floor, Powell maintained his South Bronx demeanour and authoritative cool throughout.\"",
      "Fab 5 Freddy remembers one exchange between Powell and Knight. \"There was an encounter where he [Knight] had something to say, and Colin Powell responded.",
      "\"Here you have this guy who was a four-star general talking to Suge Knight, and he pretty much put Suge in his place.\"",
      "Jones finally released a clip of the event for a 2018 Netflix documentary about his life.",
      "\"We've got to seriously talk about what you are going to deal with,\" he is seen telling the assembled attendees.",
      "\"They are not playing, there's real bullets out there, believe me. Maybe literally and figuratively.",
      "\"It's a very emotional thing,\" he added, his voice cracking. \"I want to see you guys live to at least my age.\"",
      "\"Quincy did get emotional,\" Fab 5 Freddy recalls, \"because he sensed what could happen.",
      "\"And the worst, unfortunately, did happen.\"",
      "Who was Tupac Shakur?",
      "Ex-gang leader pleads not guilty to Tupac murder",
      "Diddy accused of 'revenge' rape over Tupac claims",
      "Jones had ended up reconciling with Tupac. After Tupac's 1993 comments, Jones's 17-year-old daughter Rashida - who would go on to star in US sitcom The Office - wrote an irate letter to Source attacking the rapper.",
      "When Tupac bumped into one of Jones's other daughters, Kidada, he apologised, thinking she was Rashida. But Tupac and Kidada hit it off and began a relationship.",
      "\"Though we got off to a rocky start, as I came to know and feel him I saw his enormous potential and sensitivity as an artist and as a human being,\" Quincy Jones wrote.",
      "There have also been claims that Tupac was planning to leave Death Row for Jones's record label.",
      "But in September 1996, a year after the summit, Tupac was shot and killed.",
      "A former gang leader, Duane \"Keffe D\" Davis, was charged with his murder last year. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Then in 1997, Notorious BIG was shot dead outside a party thrown by Jones's record label and magazine. No-one has ever been charged.",
      "Meanwhile, today Knight is in prison for a hit-and-run, while Combs is awaiting trial on charges of racketeering and sex trafficking, which he denies.",
      "The violence in the 90s \"wasn't necessary\" and was caused by \"wannabes and gang-related troublemakers\" on the edges of the music industry, according to Fab 5 Freddy.",
      "\"Also, the east/west coast beef was mainly ignited by jealousy. It was an ashtray fire fanned into a big deal by media outlets that led to Biggie and Tupac getting killed.\"",
      "Despite his stature, not even Jones could alter the forces of power and pride that were at work and prevent the bloodshed.",
      "Freddy believes some lessons were learned at the summit, however, and that it deserves a place in hip-hop history.",
      "\"It was incredible and electric to be in that room.",
      "\"It was a thrilling moment. And then it became even more legendary because it was never released, so the only people that really knew about it were the people that were there.\""

      "\u201cAnd I was like 'OK, let's record the whole album and we'll go on tour as soon as you want!\u2019\" she jokes. \u201cBut I did say, \u2018this is going to be difficult, I'm not a singer'. But the team in the film, they worked with me incredibly, they really helped me with all the songs and made it so that we could do the best work possible.\u201d",
      "Asked about Gasc\u00f3n's casting, Audiard adds simply: \u201cWithout her, there would be no film.\u201d",
      "Interestingly, Gasc\u00f3n campaigned to play both the male and female roles \u2013 in other words, the character both before and after transition.",
      "Audiard had originally intended for a different actor to play the male drug lord Manitas, because, the director explains, he was \"uncomfortable asking [Gasc\u00f3n] to revisit something she was moving away from\".",
      "But, Gasc\u00f3n recalled: \u201cI said to Jacques, I want to play this role in the complete arc, because for me it is important to do the full part. It wouldn't be the same film if another actor played [Manitas].\"",
      "That meant using effects and make-up such as a fake beard, so she could play the drug baron in the first section of the musical.",
      "\"This film is this film because the same actress played the complete performance,\" Gasc\u00f3n continues. \"It's that kind of role you have once in your life and I didn't want to lose the opportunity to play this.\u201d",
      "The ongoing debate about whether actors should have lived experience of characters they play is complex, and Gasc\u00f3n herself says: \"I prefer that all actors have the full opportunities. When you chose this career, it's because you want to express another life that's not like your life.",
      "\"But,\" she continues, \"obviously when you are closer to the role of the character, it's better. In this case, I think it's beautiful, because I give all of myself to this role.\"",
      "Gasc\u00f3n has been described as a \"wonderful discovery\" by the Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney, who said she gives \"a magnificent performance\".",
      "\"The warmth, the joyous self-realisation, the complexity and authenticity... that illuminate her characterisation no doubt owe much to the parallels in the Spanish star\u2019s life - in her own words, she was an actor before becoming an actress, a father before becoming a mother.\"",
      "Gomez plays the drug lord's wife, who is kept in the dark about her former lover's new identity, while Paz portrays Emilia's new romantic interest after transitioning.",
      "Reviews of Emilia P\u00e9rez, which is released on Netflix next month, have been generally positive so far.",
      "\"It's a wild, gritty, glitter-soaked ride that defies convention and classification,\" said Entertainment Weekly's Maureen Lee Lenker.",
      "She praised the film's performances, commenting: \"Selena Gomez is a welcome surprise, shedding any remaining hints of her Disney Channel origins in her portrayal of a hard-loving wife of a narco.",
      "\"The film's climax in particular allows Gomez to shine as a dramatic actress in new ways. She conveys heartache and anguish through a tortured physicality that propels her into the unpredictable state of a woman on the verge of something dangerous.\"",
      "Asked by the BBC's Graham Norton if it was comfortable going back to the world of singing and dancing for the musical, Gomez said: \"No, because this was completely different.",
      "\"It was intricate dance moves I never knew my body could do, and it was also me playing a character so if anything I tried to avoid what I was comfortable with.\"",
      "The Telegraph's Tim Robey described the film as \"amazingly confident \u2013 it\u2019s clever, earnest, ridiculous, knowing, forceful and absolutely bonkers\", while Hoai-Tran Bui of Inverse said it was \"an emotionally fulfilling triumph\".",
      "Not all critics were as enthusiastic about the film, however.",
      "\"Emilia P\u00e9rez was originally intended to be an opera, which perhaps partly explains its saccharine sentimentality, repetitive lyrics, and diverging story branches. But that doesn\u2019t excuse its almost random, whiplash-inducing tonal pivots,\" said Slant's Kyle Turner.",
      "However, Lauren Bradshaw of Fangirl Freakout said: \"Emilia P\u00e9rez is a magnificent, genre-bending thrill ride that transcends the typical movie construct, breathing a fresh burst of excitement into the way we think about film.\"",
      "As an actress, Gomez is best known for starring in Only Murders in the Building, but also has a successful singing career with hits including Back To You, Wolves and Love You Like a Love Song.",
      "Her co-star Salda\u00f1a, meanwhile, has starred in a large number of blockbusters in the last two decades, with roles in the Avatar and Guardians of the Galaxy franchises.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Emilia P\u00e9rez could be a big awards player, but Academy voters may see an opportunity to recognise Salda\u00f1a's box office success via this more critically acclaimed work.",
      "Their co-star Adriana Paz is a Mexican actress whose credits include Not Forgotten, Hilda and La Caridad, while Gasc\u00f3n also had a successful acting career before transitioning in 2018.",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez has already been selected as France's entry for the best international feature category at the Oscars, which take place in March.",
      "But despite the film's awards traction, Paz tells BBC News: \u201cI never think about that, really. I get into a project because I'm interested in the topic, character, director or actors, you do it because it really matters to you.\u201d",
      "She adds that the attention in recent months is unlike anything she's experienced in her career. \"It's been a lot,\" she says, \"because I've been working in Spain and have a long career in Mexico, and people have a recognition of my work, but not like [it's been] since Cannes.",
      "\"In my country they feel very proud of me, and there was a lot of people that didn't know about my work, and now thanks to Emilia they are getting to know my work... and they see 'we feel so proud as Mexicans that you won this award.'\"",
      "After the success of Emilia Perez, Paz says she would \"love to\" appear in more musicals in future, and loves singing.",
      "But Gasc\u00f3n has a slightly different take. \"I don't like musicals!\" she laughs, adding that she hopes casting directors aren't too enthusiastic about her performance.",
      "\"I don't like to sing, I don't want to be compared to Shakira or something like that, and I don't like dancing, so please don't call me!\"",

      "One of its pundits, Micah Richards (see below), has separately described Scott as the \"glue\" that keeps the controlled chaos of the show together; balancing frolics (such as being teased into revealing her first kiss) with genuine analysis from the panel.",
      "As young audiences increasingly turn their back on terrestrial TV, the BBC is under pressure to adapt - particularly as individual match highlights now appear on YouTube long before Match of the Day's 10:30pm time slot.",
      "There's no doubt the new-age formula has worked for CBS, but it is a far cry from the traditions of Match of the Day. Could it work on the BBC? And would Scott want to risk jeopardising CBS' popular dynamic?",
      "Alan Shearer",
      "Alan Shearer, alongside Lineker, is one of England's all-time great goal-scorers. Despite retiring in 2006, he still holds the Premier League goal record and remains top scorer for Newcastle United.",
      "This pedigree helped him become a mainstay pundit on the BBC and Match of the Day. He also formed a strong trio with Lineker and Richards, first on the BBC's Match of the Day podcast and latterly The Rest is Football - produced independently on Lineker's hugely successful Goalhanger podcast company. These have allowed him to show off more of his personality.",
      "Now almost 20 years into his media career, Shearer is however yet to host a show - could that step up to becoming Match of the day anchor finally be on the horizon?",
      "Micah Richards",
      "The ex-Manchester City and England defender burst onto the footballing scene as a teenager, but, after an on-pitch career curtailed by a knee injury, Richards has blossomed as the ever-animated pundit with a mega-watt personality to boot.",
      "He embodies the modern take on the role, engaging viewers not only with analysis but also fun-loving camaraderie shared between analysts and presenter.",
      "His media career blossomed as a jovial foil to the tough-talking, former Manchester United captain Roy Keane on Sky Sports' Super Sunday.",
      "Similar roles have followed on Match of the Day and for CBS' Champions League coverage - where humorous off-script moments between presenter Abdo, Richards himself and Premier League legends Jamie Carragher and Thierry Henry regularly trend on social media.",
      "Asking Richards to make the step up to presenting duties on a show as prestigious as Match of the Day would represent a risk from bosses, but certainly mark a fresh start and shift in tone.",
      "He also has the backing of Lineker, who, when discussing the speculation over his future on The Rest is Football, told Richards: \"I'd love to see you take over. I think you'd be brilliant in the chair.\"",
      "Colin Murray",
      "Beginning his career in music as a fun-loving, noughties upstart on BBC Radio 1, Colin Murray soon moved into sport broadcasting.",

      "Murray is certainly a tried, tested and trusted football anchor with appeal spanning all age groups.",
      "Dan Walker",
      "Prior to quitting the BBC for Channel 5 in 2022, Dan Walker shared his high-profile  BBC Breakfast presenting role with 12 years as the host of Football Focus.",
      "Walker would offer bosses a clean cut image and a safe pair of hands were he to take the role, having previously also covered Olympics and football World Cups for the BBC. He has also recently covered games for Amazon Prime.",
      "But questions remain over Walker's own interest - he is on a bumper contract at Channel 5 and has persistently batted away suggestions of a return to the BBC.",
      "Laura Woods",
      "Laura Woods made her name on TalkSport, receiving plaudits for her relatable style as a host and interviewer.",

      "After an early career on BBC children's TV, by 2006 he had started working with BBC Sport, presenting Formula 1, Football Focus, Final Score and becoming the youngest ever host in Match of the Day's history.",
      "Since stepping back from BT Sport, Humphrey has focused on his successful High-Performance podcast, exploring the lives of high-achieving individuals. However, Humphrey remains a fan of Match of the Day, previously telling The Express he would \"never say never\" to hosting the \"legendary show\".",
      "Kelly Cates",

      "The broadcaster has hosted BBC Radio 5 Live's 606 football phone-in and, more recently, the station's Football Daily podcast, in amongst numerous other roles at major tournaments.",
      "But she is best-known in front of the camera as part of the presenting roster for Sky Sports' Premier League coverage - including its flagship Super Sunday programme.",
      "Cates, like Logan, brings both pedigree and gender diversity - but it remains to be seen if she could be tempted away from Sky.",
      "Correction 12 November 2024: An earlier version of this article incorrectly suggested that Colin Murray left the BBC over a controversy on Fighting Talk. It has been amended to make clear he left to take a presenting job at Talk Sport Radio."

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 00:17:43 GMT",
    "summary": "The South Korean hit drama returns for a second season in December.",
    "story": [
      "When I ask the creator of the hit Korean drama Squid Game about reports that he was so stressed while shooting the first series he lost six teeth, he quickly corrects me. \u201cIt was eight or nine,\u201d he laughs.",
      "Hwang Dong-hyuk is speaking to me on set as he films the second series of his dystopian Netflix thriller, which sees hundreds of debt-laden contestants fight it out for a whopping cash prize, by playing a string of life-or-death children\u2019s games.",
      "But another series was not always on the cards. At one point, he swore against making one.",
      "Given the stress it has caused him, I ask what changed his mind.",
      "\u201cMoney,\u201d he answers, without hesitation.",
      "\u201cEven though the first series was such a huge global success, honestly I didn\u2019t make much,\u201d he tells me. \u201cSo doing the second series will help compensate me for the success of the first one too.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t fully finish the story,\u201d he adds.",
      "The first series was Netflix\u2019s most successful show to date, thrusting South Korea and its home-grown television dramas into the spotlight. Its dark commentary on wealth inequality touched a nerve with audiences around the globe.",
      "But having killed off almost every character, Hwang has had to start from scratch, with a new cast and set of games, and this time audience expectations are sky high.",
      "\u201cThe stress I feel now is much greater,\u201d he says.",
      "Three years after the first series aired, Hwang is even more pessimistic about the state of the world.",
      "He points to current wars, climate change and a widening global wealth gap. Conflicts are no longer confined between the rich and poor, they are playing out intensely between different generations, genders and political camps, he says.",
      "\u201cNew lines are being drawn. We\u2019re in an era of us vs them. Who\u2019s right and who\u2019s wrong?\u201d",
      "As I toured the show\u2019s playful set, with its distinctive brightly-coloured staircase, I picked up a few clues as to how the director\u2019s despair will be reflected this time around.",
      "In this series, the previous winner, Gi-hun, re-enters the game on a quest to bring it down and save the latest round of contestants.",
      "According to Lee Jung-jae, who plays the leading character, he is \"more desperate and determined\u201d than before.",
      "The floor of the dormitory, where the contestants sleep at night, has been divided in two.",
      "One half is branded with a giant red neon X symbol, the other with a blue circle.",
      "Now, after every game, the players must pick a side, depending on whether they want to end the contest early and survive, or keep playing, in the knowledge all but one of them will die. The majority decision rules.",
      "This, I am told, will lead to more factionalism and fights.",
      "It is part of director Hwang\u2019s plan to expose the dangers of living in an increasingly tribal world. Forcing people to pick sides, he believes, is fuelling conflict.",
      "For all those who were captivated by the shocking storytelling of Squid Game, there were others who found it gratuitously violent and difficult to watch.",
      "But it is clear from talking to Hwang, that the violence is fully thought out. He is a man who thinks and cares deeply about the world and is motivated by a mounting unease.",
      "\u201cWhen making this series, I constantly asked myself \u2018do we humans have what it takes to steer the world off this downhill path?\u2019. Honestly, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he says.",
      "While viewers of the second series might not get the answers to these big life questions, they can at least be comforted that some plot holes will be filled in \u2013 like why the game exists, and what is motivating the masked Front Man running it.",
      "\u201cPeople will see more of the Front Man\u2019s past, his story and his emotions,\u201d reveals the actor Lee Byung-hun, who plays the mysterious role.",
      "\u201cI don't think this will make viewers warm to him, but it may help them better understand his choices.\u201d",
      "As one of South Korea\u2019s most famous actors, Lee admits that having his face and eyes covered and his voice distorted throughout the first series, was \u201ca little bit dissatisfying\u201d.",
      "This series he has relished having scenes without a mask, in which he can fully express himself \u2013 a chance he nearly did not get.",
      "Hwang tried for 10 years to get Squid Game made, taking out large loans to support his family, before Netflix swooped in.",
      "They paid him a modest upfront amount, leaving him unable to cash in on the whopping \u00a3650m it is estimated to have made the platform.",
      "This explains the love-hate relationship South Korea\u2019s film and television creators currently have with international streaming platforms.",
      "Over the past few years, Netflix has stormed the Korean market with billions of dollars of investment, bringing the industry global recognition and love, but leaving creators feeling short-changed.",
      "They accuse the platform of forcing them to relinquish their copyright when they sign contracts \u2013 and with it, their claim to profit.",
      "This is a worldwide problem.",
      "In the past, creators could rely on getting a cut of box office sales or TV re-runs, but this model has not been adopted by streaming giants.",
      "The issue is compounded in South Korea, creators say, due to its outdated copyright law, which does not protect them.",
      "This summer, actors, writers, directors and producers teamed up to form a collective, to fight the system together.",
      "\u201cIn Korea, being a movie director is just a job title, it\u2019s not a way to earn a living,\u201d the vice-president of the Korean Film Directors Guild, Oh Ki-hwan, tells the audience at an event in Seoul.",
      "Some of his director friends, he says, work part-time in warehouses and as taxi drivers.",
      "Park Hae-young is a writer at the event. When Netflix bought her show, 'My Liberation Notes', it became a global hit.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been writing my whole life. So, to get global recognition when competing with creators from across the world, has been a joyful experience,\u201d she tells me.",
      "But Park says the current streaming model has left her reluctant to \u201cpour her all\u201d into her next series.",
      "\u201cUsually, I\u2019ll spend four or five years making a drama in the belief that, if it's successful, it could somewhat secure my future, that I'll get my fair share of compensation. Without that, what's the point of working so hard?\u201d",
      "She and other creators are pushing the South Korean government to change its copyright law to force production companies to share their profits.",
      "In a statement, the South Korean government told the BBC that while it recognised the compensation system needed to change, it was up to the industry to resolve the issue. A spokesperson for Netflix told us it offers \u201ccompetitive\u201d compensation, and guarantees creators \u201csolid compensation, regardless of the success or failure of their shows\u201d.",
      "Squid Game\u2019s Hwang hopes his candor over his own pay struggles will initiate that change.",
      "He has certainly sparked the fair pay conversation, and this second series will surely give the industry another bump.",
      "But when we catch up after filming has wrapped, he tells me his teeth are aching again.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t seen my dentist yet, but I\u2019ll probably have to pull out a few more very soon.\u201d",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:05:39 GMT",
    "summary": "Everything we learned on the red carpet and behind the scenes of the MTV Europe Music Awards.",
    "story": [
      "The MTV Awards came to Manchester for the first time in their 30-year history on Sunday night, but somehow didn't feel very Mancunian.",
      "There was no sign of Take That or Aitch, or Liam Gallagher - even though he won best rock star.",
      "Organisers made a few subtle nods to the city: The stage was framed in the black and yellow stripes of Factory Records, and New Order's Blue Monday pumped through the speakers every time nominees were announced.",
      "But the show took a more global perspective, highlighting acts from Mexico, South Korea, South Africa and America - including a predictable victory for Taylor Swift in the night's two biggest categories, best artist and video of the year.",
      "She only appeared by video, choosing instead to spend the night watching her boyfriend, American Football player Travis Kelce, lead the Kansas City Chiefs to victory against the Denver Broncos.",
      "But there were plenty of other stars at the show and on the red carpet. Here's some of the gossip we picked up along the way.",
      "1) Raye gave an update on her missing song books",
      "Two weeks ago, Raye told fans her second album had been delayed by thieves who stole her car and, with it, several notebooks full of lyrics and song ideas.",
      "On the red carpet, she confirmed the police hadn't been able to track them down, saying: \"I've just had to let it go.\"",
      "The singer said she couldn't recreate a lot of the ideas, because the act of writing them down freed her mind to work on other things.",
      "\"You let it go, because you think you can come back to it - and now there are so many ideas that are just gone. It's so sad.\"",
      "But the singer, who won best UK artist, maintained a positive outlook.",
      "\"Everything happens for a reason. I'll have to start again and maybe it's a blessing in disguise.\"",
      "2) Busta Rhymes revealed his unlikely comedy hero",
      "The decision to bring rap legend Busta Rhymes to Manchester to receive a global icon award wasn't as random as it sounded.",
      "Before he developed his rapid-fire rap delivery, an 11-year-old Rhymes spent two summers living with his Aunt Velma in Morecambe.",
      "\"I went to karate school, and we illegally went into nightclubs, to make a little money break-dancing,\" he told us.",
      "\"I remember Boy George was cool, Wham was cool,\" he continued.",
      "\"But our favourite was Benny Hill. Benny Hill is still our favourite to this day. I don't think anybody has as ever been as funny or as charismatic as Benny Hill.\"",
      "So, during those halcyon days of watching smutty comedy in Morecambe, did he ever think he'd be back, winning a lifetime achievement prize?",
      "\"You can never foresee something like that,\" he said. \"When we first got involved with hip-hop, we didn't do it for none of the accolades. We just did it because we loved it.",
      "\"But with that being said, tonight is a dream come true.\"",
      "To honour that moment, he gave a nine-minute acceptance speech thanking everyone from his mother to an art teacher he'd met backstage.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never got an award from MTV before. Thirty four years of professionally recording [and] this is the first time I\u2019m getting an award from MTV. It feels incredible.\"",
      "3) Olly Alexander had advice for next year's Eurovision contestant",
      "Olly Alexander played a pre-show party on Saturday night, and couldn't quite believe the reception for Dizzy - the song which earned him 18th place at this year's Eurovision Song Contest.",
      "\"That went down a lot better than it did in Eurovision,\" he laughed, shortly before Jedward invaded the stage and caused utter chaos.",
      "At the main ceremony, Alexander was there to award song of the year to Sabrina Carpenter's Espresso. But he also had a few words for anyone considering representing the UK at next year's contest.",
      "\"I would say to them, whoever it is, 'Call me, and we will have a serious conversation about it',\" he said with the haunted look of a man who has seen some things.",
      "4) Benson Boone has a new fan: Bez",
      "In addition to winning best new artist, US singer Benson Boone opened the ceremony with a spectacular performance that saw him suspended mid-air on a grand piano, before pulling off a spectacular front flip from a platform at the side of the stage.",
      "\"The insurance is always crazy,\" he laughed, \"but I love to perform.\"",
      "One person who couldn't believe his eyes was Happy Mondays star Bez, who accosted Boone during an interview with Rita Ora.",
      "\"I was so blown away by that performance, mate,\" he told the singer.",
      "\"When you came down on that shiny piano, I thought, 'Elton John is going to be so gutted.'\"",
      "5) Le Sserafim escaped to Manchester's Christmas market",
      "Manchester is home to the UK's biggest K-Pop shop and, on Sunday morning, the staff couldn't quite believe one of the genre's biggest girl bands had landed in their city.",
      "\"Le Sserafim were posting pictures from the Christmas market,\" one of them told me. \"That's only five minutes from here!\"",

      "Alison Kerry, head of communications at Scope, told the BBC \"these kinds of ableist trends are deeply harmful. They don\u2019t exist in a vacuum, so a social media trend can quickly turn into someone facing abuse in their everyday life.\u201d",

      "Oliver Kemp, head of the charity Prostate Cancer Research, said the current system is not working.",

      "The BBC's Inside Health has been looking at the issue.",
      "More men dying",
      "The debate around prostate screening revolves around an imperfect test and the trade-off between finding some men\u2019s aggressive cancers earlier and the harms of diagnosing and treating slow-growing tumours that would never have affected a man\u2019s health or lifespan.",
      "The case for and against is constantly reviewed in the UK, with the most recent report from the National Screening Committee, in 2020, saying the harms were too great.",
      "Further updates are expected this year.",
      "Despite more men dying from prostate cancer than women from breast cancer, there is no reliable test for the disease.",
      "The blood test men over 50 can request from their GP measures prostate-specific antigen (PSA), released by the prostate, a small gland located below the bladder involved in the production of semen.",

      "\"And then you have a small number of very aggressive prostate cancers which do move quickly and cause harm,\" Dr McCartney says.",
      "Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and a tissue biopsy can help  narrow down which men have cancer and need treatment - but some still end up being treated for something that would never cause a problem.",
      "\"Far more men have tests done to try to work out what kind of prostate cancer it is, than are going to benefit from it - there's the problem,\" Dr McCartney says.",
      "Conflicting results",
      "Clinical trials have produced conflicting results about screening.",
      "One, in Europe, says it saves lives.",

      "Screening means aggressive cancers can be treated before symptoms appear.",
      "But trials show there are harms to testing large numbers of healthy men - and once a cancer is spotted, even a low-risk one, it needs to be followed up.",
      "Many men with a low-risk cancer are simply monitored or begin \u201cwatchful waiting\u201d - but a cancer diagnosis and the invasive tests it involves have a psychological impact.",
      "One in 10 of these men opts for radical surgery rather than live with the anxiety of wondering whether their cancer will grow, Prof Ahmed says.",
      "But this can leave them unable to maintain an erection - and a third spend the rest of their life needing a pad because they leak urine.",
      "\u201cAt the age of 47-48, if we're talking about testing and diagnosing men at that age, that's two or three decades of those kinds of symptoms,\" Prof Ahmed told BBC Radio 4's Inside Health programme.",
      "\"So I would rather avoid finding low-risk disease.\u201d",
      "Much research in the field has focused on refining the process to minimise the harms of screening.",

      "In the meantime, Prostate Cancer Research's report says, screening 45-69-year-olds at high risk - black men and those with a family history of the disease or particular gene mutations - would deliver an economic benefit, after factoring in the cost of treatment and the impact on working lives and carers.",

    "summary": "NHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard says the decision, in July 2020, was very disappointing.",
    "story": [
      "Boris Johnson\u2019s government blocked a request to fund another 10,000 hospital beds at the height of the Covid pandemic, the chief executive of NHS England has said.",
      "Amanda Pritchard told the UK Covid-19 Inquiry the decision, made by the Treasury in July 2020, had been \u201cvery disappointing\u201d.",
      "Extra beds and staff would have been used to cut waiting lists for planned care and \u201cbuild resilience\u201d going into a second winter wave of the pandemic, she said.",
      "The government has said it cannot comment while the inquiry is in progress.",
      "Health ministers from the time are expected to give evidence later this month, to the third section of the inquiry, looking at Covid's impact on the NHS and healthcare systems across the UK.",
      "Ms Pritchard served as NHS England\u2019s chief operating officer from 2019 until she was promoted to chief executive, in August 2021.",
      "In her evidence, she said a request had been made to the government, for 10,000 extra permanent, staffed hospital beds, in July 2020.",
      "\u2018Very disappointing\u2019",
      "The demand had been based on modelling the spread of the virus, along with the need to deal with other pressures that coming winter and resume more planned, or elective, surgery and other treatments for non-Covid patients.",
      "But the inquiry heard the Treasury and the prime minister\u2019s private office had refused the request, saying they wanted more use made of temporary Nightingale hospitals along with the private sector.",
      "And Ms Prichard had been told the decision would be looked at again as part of a wider spending review expected in the autumn of 2021.",
      "She called the decision \u201cvery disappointing\u201d, saying waiting lists for planned NHS treatment in England would be in \u201cquite a different position\u201d today had the extra funding been agreed.",
      "\u201cIf we had had that capacity, we could certainly have treated thousands more patients\u2026 as well as being more resilient going into the second wave of the pandemic and into winter more generally,\u201d Ms Prichard said.",
      "In the summer of 2020, the NHS in England had a total permanent bed capacity to treat about 95,000 patients in acute hospitals.",
      "That was increased by another 4,000 from winter 2023, under a recovery plan agreed by then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.",
      "\u2018Completely overwhelming\u2019",
      "Later in her evidence, Ms Pritchard said the health service had faced a period of \u201cextreme pressure\u201d in the winter of 2020-21, as another wave of Covid spread across the country.",
      "By that point, new treatments had been discovered, including the cheap steroid dexamethasone, and the first Covid vaccines were starting to be rolled out in small numbers.",
      "But the level of community transmission at the time meant some intensive-care units were still being pushed \u201cto the brink\u201d and were \u201cright on the edge\u201d of running out of bed space.",
      "Nationally, the health service had never had to \u201csystematically limit\u201d access to treatments because hospitals could not cope with demand, Ms Pritchard said.",
      "\u201cThat does not mean, though, that it did not feel completely overwhelming to staff at this time in those places - and it does not mean that the kind of care that was being provided was anything like normal,\u201d she added.",
      "'Field hospitals'",
      "Ms Pritchard was also asked about the seven temporary Nightingale hospitals built quickly, in March and April 2020, across England to treat Covid patients.",
      "Data seen by the inquiry shows the total cost to the taxpayer, including setting up and decommissioning, is now estimated at \u00a3358.5m.",
      "The hospitals \u2013 in Birmingham, Bristol, Exeter, Harrogate, London, Manchester and Sunderland \u2013 treated 141 Covid patients in the first wave of the virus and 1,097 Covid and other patients in the second wave.",
      "In total, \u00a350.4m was spent on one site, Birmingham, which was never used by patients in the pandemic.",
      "The site in Bristol also carried out 6,554 assessments for patients from the eye hospital in the city.",
      "Ms Pritchard told the inquiry the programme had still been \u201cuseful\u201d, as the sites had been envisaged as \u201cmilitary field hospitals\u201d at the time.",
      "\u201cWe thought we were doing it to avoid a northern Italy situation,\u201d she said, referring to scenes in Lombardy, where intensive-care units had been overwhelmed.",

      "The Treasury said there would be no change or mitigations to the policy, which will see an end to inheritance tax exemption for some farms.",
      "From April 2026, farms worth more than \u00a31m will face an effective inheritance tax rate of 20% - half the usual rate of 40%.",

      "Defra suggested softening the policy to exempt some older people, possibly those over the age of 80.",
      "The April 2026 start for the policy means they may not have time to make use of existing rules to skip inheritance tax by passing on an asset seven years before death.",
      "But this suggestion has been dismissed by the Treasury, which said it had taken \"a fair and balanced approach\".",
      "Since its introduction in 1984, agricultural property relief (APR) has allowed small family farms \u2013 including land used for crops or rearing animals, as well as farm buildings, cottages and houses - to be exempt from inheritance tax.",

      "Some ministers believe it will only have an impact on relatively wealthy farmers - a couple using all their inheritance tax benefits will be able to pass on a \u00a33m farm tax free. Any inheritance tax charge on farms can be paid over 10 years.",

      "The Treasury said the figure was 28%.",

      "Sir Keir said the government would ensure GPs \"have got the resources we need\" and that funding arrangements would be set out \"later this year\".",

    "summary": "The PM insists the government will not \"tell people how to live their lives\" in achieving the aim.",
    "story": [
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has announced fresh climate change targets at a global summit, saying he wants the UK to lead on cutting emissions.",
      "The UK will now aim for an 81% cut in its emissions by 2035, he told the UN conference of parties (COP29) in Azerbaijan.",
      "The target updates a 78% pledge by 2035 under the previous Conservative government, although that also included international aviation and shipping emissions, and goes beyond another pledge of a 68% reduction by 2030.",
      "Sir Keir insisted the government would not \"tell people how to live their lives\" but the target was vital to the UK's future prosperity and energy security.",
      "Climate talks open in shadow of Trump victory",
      "What is COP29 and how will Trump\u2019s election affect the climate talks?",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "The prime minister said the new target was based on recommendations from the UK's independent climate change committee (CCC) aimed at limiting global warming to 1.5C compared to levels in 1990.",
      "He was one of only seven G20 leaders attending the summit, with 13 absentees including the premiers of the US, China, France and Germany.",
      "Sir Keir would not be drawn on his views about president-elect Donald Trump, who has promised to cut climate rules during his election campaign.",
      "He said: \"Make no mistake, the race is on for the clean energy jobs of the future, the economy of tomorrow, and I don't want to be in the middle of the pack - I want to get ahead of the game\".",
      "The target will be included in papers to go before Parliament before February and, although Sir Keir did not announce any new policies, he did commit to continuing to provide \u00a311.6bn of climate finance until March 2026, a pledge made under the previous government.",
      "Announcing a \u00a31bn investment in a wind turbine project in Hull, which he said would create 1,300 local jobs, Sir Keir said the world was standing at a \"critical juncture in the climate crisis\".",
      "The UK has called for other countries to match the new target, following stark warnings from the United Nations that the world is on course for a 3.1C rise without further cuts.",
      "The latest target is broadly in line with the UK\u2019s legally-binding carbon-cutting path towards net zero emissions by 2050, contained in the 2015 Paris Agreement.",
      "That international agreement ties the UK to ratcheting up new \"nationally determined contributions\" (NDCs) for carbon reduction every five years, which has seen the a 68% cut by 2030 increase to an 81% cut by 2035.",
      "The Climate Change Act 2008 also set legally-binding domestic agreements on carbon budgets in five year chunks until 2050, which unlike the NDC targets also include international aviation and shipping emissions.",
      "The latest of these is the sixth carbon budget, which runs between 2033-2037, and has already been set at 78%.",
      "Since taking power in July, Labour has ended an effective ban on new onshore wind projects and pledged not to issue any new oil and gas exploration licenses in the North Sea, as well as closing the UK's last coal power plant in September.",
      "The switch towards greener energy has already halved the UK's annual greenhouse gas emissions since 1990 - but the CCC has previously said further reductions will be difficult without lifestyle changes.",
      "The government advisers said taxes on meat and dairy might be needed if people do not voluntarily reduce their consumption of the products, and there should be moves to phase out the use of petrol cars.",
      "Speaking at the summit, Sir Keir said the new UK target would be \"difficult\" but \"achievable\", and he wanted government to \"tread lightly on people's lives\".",
      "\"It\u2019s not about telling people how to live their lives \u2013 I\u2019m not interested in that,\" he added.",
      "\"I am interested in making sure their energy bills are stable, that we\u2019ve got energy independence, and that we also along the way pick up the next generation of jobs.\"",
      "However, shadow energy secretary Claire Coutinho claimed the new target would lead to \"hardship\" for the British people.",
      "During energy questions in the Commons, Coutinho said making \"already stringent carbon emission targets even higher\" would require a \"shift away from meat and dairy\" and \"less travel\".",
      "The Conservative MP claimed the approach would \"see our reliance on Chinese imports - a country which is 60% powered by coal - go through the roof\".",
      "In response, energy minister Kerry McCarthy said: \"It's really important that we are stepping up and showing global ambition.",
      "\"Reaching net zero in this country and getting to clean power by 2030 is a massive opportunity - it is not a cost.\"",
      "The interim chair of the CCC, Professor Piers Forster, welcomed the new target and said it was feasible based on the latest science, technological developments, and the UK\u2019s national circumstances.",
      "\"Our analysis shows that this is a feasible target that will support jobs and investment,\" he said, adding the UK was currently running behind schedule on delivering its 2030 target of 68% cuts.",
      "He added: \"A target is only as meaningful as the delivery against it.",
      "\"The UK needs to get back on track to deliver against our existing 2030 NDC commitment.",
      "\"We need to see further urgent action to speed up deployment of low-carbon solutions such as electric vehicles, heat pumps, and tree planting.\"",
      "All countries who have signed up to the Paris Agreement should submit their latest carbon reduction targets by a deadline of February next year and a copy of that memo, known as the Information to facilitate Clarity, Transparency and Understanding (ICTU), will be presented to MPs before then."

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 18:42:29 GMT",
    "summary": "The council claims it was given bad advice over solar investments that left it with a \u00a31.5bn debt.",
    "story": [
      "Financially troubled Thurrock Council is considering legal claims against more than 20 other local authorities.",
      "The unitary council in south Essex became effectively bankrupt two years ago after it borrowed and invested hundreds of millions and racked up a \u00a31.5bn debt.",
      "It received valuations for its solar investments from the Association for Public Service Excellence (APSE), which is owned by local councils.",
      "Thurrock \"believes that valuations of the solar assets undertaken by APSE, which they allowed the council to rely on, were negligent and overvalued those assets\". APSE said it \"entirely rejected\" Thurrock's statement that valuations \"led to significant financial losses to Thurrock with negative impact on taxpayers\".",
      "The councils that face being sued include Luton, Southampton, Cardiff, South Tyneside, Preston, Wolverhampton and Hertfordshire, according to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (full list at the bottom of this story).",
      "Mo Baines, chief executive of APSE, said this would lead to \"significant legal costs on other councils which we believe has no merit\".",
      "APSE provides advice to local authorities and warned if Thurrock proceeded it could end up affecting all 250 councils in the UK as co-defendants. Seeking independent legal advice could cost each council around \u00a325,000, according to APSE.",
      "Ms Baines said she \"remains hopeful there is a positive resolution\" but told the BBC that Thurrock's action would mean \"other councils become embroiled\" in paying for their financial failure.",
      "She questioned whether \"council taxpayers of Norwich to Northumberland take a hit for the losses of a council they have had nothing to do with?\".",
      "Recovering money",
      "Thurrock Council told the BBC the claim was \"against a representative group\" of councils who are APSE members \"to reduce the impact and cost of the legal action for all the councils involved\".",
      "\"Under the court procedure, the presumption is that a claim against the representative councils will be binding against all 250 APSE member councils,\" a Thurrock spokesperson said.",
      "High Court proceedings have begun against businessman Liam Kavanagh and Rockfire Group, who Thurrock invested hundreds of millions with.",
      "Last year, a government commissioned report concluded Thurrock, which at the time was run by a Conservative administration, lost \"substantial sums of public money\" because of systemic weaknesses and a \"dereliction\" in leadership.",
      "John Kent, who has been the leader of the council since Labour resumed control in May 2024, said \"we have a duty to consider all lines of recovery\".",
      "Thurrock Council managed to claw black \u00a3513m last year from divestments which was used to pay back loans.",
      "A further \u00a390m is expected to be recouped this year.",
      "Its current debt level is understood to be about \u00a31bn. The council's annual budget for 2024-25 was set at \u00a3172.4m.",

    "story": [
      "Plans for a major shake-up of pension funds have been announced by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves.",
      "She wants to create pension \"megafunds\" by merging the UK's 86 council schemes, using the set-up in Canada and Australia as a model.",
      "Other proposals suggest pension schemes need to reach a certain size or pool together. Larger funds could then be invested in UK infrastructure projects, the government says.",
      "So, will this affect people with pension savings?",
      "Which pension funds are involved?",
      "The government says the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) can get more from investments - while tackling a \u00a32bn bill for fees - by joining together.",
      "There are 86 local government pension funds in England and Wales, which are mainly paid into by local government workers.",
      "These individually managed funds are divided by local authority, making it more costly, because each fund is paying its own management and administration fees.",
      "Between them, they have 6.5 million members and manage assets worth \u00a3354bn.",
      "The schemes are all part of the LGPS which is the seventh-largest in the world, according to the UK government.",
      "Most of its participants are low-paid women.",
      "Under Reeves\u2019 plans, the funds would be consolidated in some way, although at present it is unclear exactly how.",
      "She may ask them to pool their assets and resources, or she may ask them to merge with one another to create a smaller number of larger funds, which would benefit from greater financial firepower and fewer costs.",
      "The LGPS is a defined benefit scheme which means that, when it is time to draw their pensions, its savers get an agreed amount based on their salary, no matter what the fund is worth at the time.",
      "So drawing scheme into \"megafunds\" will make little, or no, difference to what they receive.",
      "That is different to private pension pots, which rise and fall in value depending on how investments perform.",
      "Why copy Canada and Australia?",
      "The \u201cMaple 8\u201d is a group of vast Canadian pension funds, including the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, which manages assets worth C$247.5bn (\u00a3141.8bn), and the Canada Pension Plan, whose assets are worth C$409.6bn.",
      "While UK pension schemes tend to invest more in assets like equities and bonds, their Canadian rivals focus more on private markets.",
      "The Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, for example, only has 7% of its assets in listed equities, compared with 60% for traditional pension funds.",
      "Instead, it skews its investments towards private markets, including infrastructure (including a 25% stake in British energy giant SSE), real estate and private equity deals.",
      "This kind of model is not without risk, however.",
      "The Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System is the largest investor in the troubled Thames Water, which has been highlighted by those questioning Reeves' plans.",
      "Why is bigger supposed to be better?",
      "Individually, the UK\u2019s 86 local government pension schemes vary in size, from Greater Manchester\u2019s massive \u00a330bn fund all the way down to several schemes which are \u201csub-\u00a31bn\u201d, according to Joanne Donnelly, board secretary at the Local Government Pension Scheme Advisory Board.",
      "Running these schemes costs money. Each one must pay administration, governance and management costs, which can build up \u2013 last year, they increased by \u00a328m.",
      "Like her predecessor, Jeremy Hunt, who also announced plans for a Canadian-style model, the chancellor believes consolidation would save money.",
      "That would in turn \u201cdeliver better returns for savers and unlock billions of pounds of investment\u201d.",
      "Other chancellors have aimed to make similar moves, including George Osborne who, in 2015, set out plans for local government schemes to pool resources,",
      "Does everyone agree with the idea?",
      "Tracy Blackwell, chief executive of Pension Insurance Corporation, told the BBC: \"I think by having the scale and the right expertise internally to invest in a wide range of assets, they'll be able to invest in a lot more than what they can invest in now.\"",
      "However, some argue megafunds would not invest so much in smaller projects while some claim the changes could bring risks for pension savers.",
      "\"Conflating a government goal of driving investment in the UK and people\u2019s retirement outcomes brings a danger because the risks are all taken with members\u2019 money,\" said Tom Selby at investment platform AJ Bell.",
      "He said the current system encourages trustees to deliver the best outcome for members rather than focus on UK-wide economic growth, which might mean investing outside the UK.",
      "Others question whether there are enough big UK projects to invest in.",
      "\"Large funds need substantial, reliable projects to generate returns, but the market may struggle to offer enough of these opportunities, especially in the infrastructure sector,\" said Jon Greer, head of retirement policy at wealth manager Quilter."

    "published": "Sun, 10 Nov 2024 07:43:38 GMT",
    "summary": "The Labour government is expected to make major changes to the Right To Buy scheme launched in the 1980s.",
    "story": [
      "When Harold Wilson was Labour prime minister in the late 1960s, up to a third of people in England lived in a council house or flat.",
      "But by the time Keir Starmer became prime minister in July this year, the proportion of people in England living in social housing had fallen to about 16% of the population \u2013 about four million.",
      "About two million council-built properties have been sold to their tenants at significantly discounted prices under the Right To Buy (RTB) scheme since it was introduced by Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Conservative government in the early 1980s.",
      "Michael Heseltine described the advent of RTB as \"laying the foundations of one of the most important social revolutions of the century\", but was selling off council houses more cheaply than new ones could be built simply laying the foundations of a housing crisis?",
      "Waiting lists",
      "Historically, money raised from selling off council houses has not gone far towards building new ones - new ones desperately needed, considering about 1.3 million people are on waiting lists for them in England.",
      "Across the north-west of England, for example, about 4,350 council houses have been sold off in the last 10 years, with the money made from the sales going towards building or buying just over 1,400 others, according to government data.",
      "While the \u00a3336,612,000 raised from those sales may sound a reasonable sum, it works out on average at about \u00a377,000 per house. And, generally, councils have not been allowed to keep the whole amount, instead having to hand a sizeable chunk back to the government.",
      "About 200,000 people are on waiting lists for social housing in the region.",
      "While housing associations may have built homes, and there may have been schemes funded by cash from other government pots, the fact that the money raised from selling off homes is nowhere near enough to rebuild or buy like-for-like has been a long-standing concern.",
      "And it would seem Labour deputy prime minister and minister for housing Angela Rayner \u2013 who famously bought her own council house in Stockport under RTB \u2013 has taken on board the views of RTB critics.",
      "Rayner has said recently she may impose restrictions so that people who move into newly built council houses will not be able to buy them in the future.",
      "It is a decision that is likely to be welcomed by Labour politicians in regions where the need for social housing is arguably as great as ever, but the amount of it available is very low.",
      "The Labour metro-mayors of both Liverpool and Manchester regions have both said they want to see more social housing built in their regions.",
      "In May, Andy Burnham, leader of Greater Manchester, called on the-then Conservative government to pause RTB on new builds after losing 500 social homes to the scheme in 2022.",
      "He argued that if planned homes could be bought by their tenants, it would be \"like trying to fill a bath without the plug in\".",
      "On Merseyside, virtually all former council housing stock was transferred to housing associations over the last two decades.",
      "But metro mayor Steve Rotheram says registered social landlords (RSLs) have inherited some of the problems that came with RTB.",
      "He says one Merseyside RSL had lost about a third of its homes through sales to tenants in the decade since the housing stock was transferred.",
      "People who are tenants of RSLs can buy their homes under \u201cpreserved\u201d RTB if they lived in their homes when the council owned them.",
      "And once someone has lived in an RSL property for three years, they can apply for the Right To Acquire.",
      "Rotheram says cheaper borrowing rates for RSLs and a moratorium on sales would help boost growth in social housing.",
      "\"You are not going to build a lot of houses for someone to come along in three or four years and buy it below market value,\" he says.",
      "\"How we deal with this is part of our growth plan going to the government, and we are now trying to see if we can work with [Rayner] to come up with proposals.\"",
      "Blackpool Council\u2019s cabinet member for economy and the built environment, Mark Smith, is clear that while the money generated from RTB sales is used to support various investments in housing, the RTB receipts his council receives are \"not sufficient to replace lost social rent housing\".",
      "And he says even with changes such as the government giving councils more flexibility to allow RTB receipts to be used alongside cash from other streams such as funds given by developers who get planning permission for private schemes, there is still some red tape in the way of using different types of funding together to build council housing.",
      "\"We do the best we can within the parameters of the policy as it exists currently but there is always room for improvement,\" he says.",
      "Under the new Labour government policies, councils and housing associations are being given \u201cmore freedom\u201d to decide how to use their RTB money.",
      "Previously, only 50% of the money a council received from a sale could go towards building or buying a new house.",
      "But in future councils will be able to use all that money, and put money received from private developers handed over as part of planning agreements into projects as well.",
      "These deals, known as Section 106 agreements, see developers give money to councils to mitigate any negative impacts their private schemes might have on local communities or housing markets.",
      "Sources within the social housing sector say that in the past the \"policy has never achieved anything like a one-for-one replacement ratio\".",
      "\"If it had then there would be a lot less concern about the policy,\" one says.",
      "\"Yes, a Right To Buy home continues to be a home after it\u2019s sold, but it contributes to a huge loss of social housing stock and contributes to housing waiting lists, or people having to live in unsuitable accommodation.\"",
      "'Serious shortage'",
      "The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils, says there is a \"serious housing shortage in this country\" and \"record numbers of people living in temporary accommodation\".",
      "Adam Hug, the LGA\u2019s housing spokesman, says: \u201cWhile the Right To Buy can and has delivered home ownership for many the scheme in its current form does not work.",
      "\"Rising discounts, alongside other measures that restrict councils\u2019 use of Right To Buy receipts, mean that the money raised from the sale of property is usually not sufficient to cover the building costs of replacing the property.",
      "\"We have long called for the removal of rules and restrictions which disincentivise local authorities from building social homes, at risk of losing them.",
      "\"Councils must be given the control, power and flexibility to use receipt monies in a way that works best for their local areas, which includes retaining 100 per cent of the receipts permanently.\"",
      "'Scandal'",
      "In 2012, the Conservative-led government increased the discount a tenant could receive when buying their home.",
      "Since coming to power, Labour has said the discount will be reduced to between \u00a316,000 and \u00a338,000, depending on the location \u2013 a significant reduction from the \u00a3136,000 discount currently available in London and the discount of just over \u00a3100,000 elsewhere.",
      "Rayner, who bought her Stockport council house under a RTB discount in 2007 and sold it several years later for \u00a348,000 more than she paid for it, said she wanted to see a \u201cfairer\u201d system.",
      "Her department says it is a \"scandal\" that only about one third of homes lost to RTB have been replaced since 2012, and that it was \"working at pace to reverse the continued decline of social rented homes\".",
      "But while the government stresses there are \"no plans to abolish the RTB\", the \"social revolution\" Lord Heseltine heralded nearly 45 years ago is clearly facing a radical change to everything but its name.",

    "summary": "Marine scientist uncovers the story behind Andruha's escape from Russian military training programme.",
    "story": [
      "The mystery as to why a beluga whale appeared off the coast of Norway wearing a harness may finally have been solved.",
      "The tame white whale, which locals named Hvaldimir, made headlines five years ago amidst widespread speculation that it was a Russian spy.",
      "Now an expert in the species says she believes the whale did indeed belong to the military and escaped from a naval base in the Arctic Circle.",
      "But Dr Olga Shpak does not believe it was a spy. She believes the beluga was being trained to guard the base and fled because it was a \"hooligan\".",
      "Seeking sanctuary for whale dubbed a Russian spy",
      "Russia has always refused to confirm or deny that the beluga whale was trained by its military.",
      "But Dr Shpak, who worked in Russia researching marine mammals from the 1990s until she returned to her native Ukraine in 2022, told BBC News: \u201cFor me it\u2019s 100% (certain).\u201d",
      "Dr Shpak, whose account is based on conversations with friends and former colleagues, features in a BBC documentary, Secrets of the Spy Whale, which is now on BBC iPlayer and being shown on BBC Two on Wednesday at 21:00 GMT.",
      "Secrets of the Spy Whale",
      "The mysterious whale first came to public attention five years ago when it approached fishermen off the northern coast of Norway.",
      "\u201cThe whale starts rubbing against the boat,\u201d Joar Hesten, one of the fishermen, says. \u201cI heard about animals in distress that instinctively knew that they need help from humans. I was thinking that this is one smart whale.\u201d",
      "The sighting was unusual because the beluga was so tame and they're rarely seen as far south. It was also wearing a harness, which had a mount for a camera, and bore the words, in English, \u201cEquipment St Petersburg\u201d.",
      "Mr Hesten helped to remove the harness from the whale, which then swam to the nearby port of Hammerfest, where it lived for several months.",
      "Seemingly unable to catch live fish to eat, it charmed visitors by nudging at their cameras and even on one occasion returning a mobile phone.",
      "\u201cIt was very obvious that this particular whale had been conditioned to be putting his nose on anything that looked like a target because he was doing it each time,\u201d says Eve Jourdain, a researcher from the Norwegian Orca Survey.",
      "\u201cBut we have no idea what kind of facility he was in, so we don\u2019t know what he was trained for.\u201d",
      "Captivated by the whale's story Norway made arrangements for the beluga to be monitored and fed. The name it was given \u2013 Hvaldimir - is a nod to hval which is Norwegian for whale, and the name of Russia's President, Vladimir Putin.",
      "Dr Shpak did not want to name her sources in Russia for their own safety but said she had been told that when the beluga surfaced in Norway, the Russian marine mammal community immediately identified it as one of theirs.",
      "\u201cThrough the chain of vets and trainers the message came back \u2013 that they were missing a beluga called Andruha,\u201d she says.",
      "According to Dr Shpak, Andruha/Hvaldimir had first been captured in 2013 in the Sea of Okhotsk in Russia's Far East. A year later it was moved from a facility owned by a dolphinarium in St Petersburg to the military programme in the Russian Arctic, where his trainers and vets remained in contact.",
      "\u201cI believe that when they started to work in open water, trusting this animal (not to swim away), the animal just gave up on them,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cWhat I've heard from the guys at the commercial dolphinarium who used to have him was that Andruha was smart, so a good choice to be trained. But at the same time, he was kind of like a hooligan - an active beluga - so they were not surprised that he gave up on (following) the boat and went where he wanted to.\u201d",
      "Satellite images from near the Russian naval base in Murmansk show what could have been Hvaldimir/Andruha\u2019s old home. Pens can clearly be seen in the water with what appear to be white whales inside.",
      "\u201cThe location of the beluga whales very close to the submarines and the surface vessels might tell us that they are actually part of a guarding system,\u201d says Thomas Nilsen, from Norwegian online newspaper The Barents Observer.",
      "Russia, for its part, has never officially addressed the claim that Hvaldimir/Andruha was trained by its army. But it does have a long history of training marine mammals for military purposes.",
      "Speaking in 2019, a Russian reserve colonel, Viktor Baranets, said: \"If we were using this animal for spying, do you really think we'd attach a mobile phone number with the message 'Please call this number'?\"",
      "Sadly, Hvaldimir/Andruha\u2019s incredible story does not have a happy ending.",
      "Having learned to feed himself, it spent several years travelling south along Norway\u2019s coast and in May 2023 was even spotted off the coast of Sweden.",
      "Then on September 1 2024 its body was found floating at sea, near the town of Risavika, on Norway's south-western coast.",
      "Had the long arm of Putin\u2019s Russia caught up with the reluctant beluga?",
      "It appears not. Despite some activist groups suggesting that the whale had been shot, that explanation has been dismissed by the Norwegian police.",
      "They say there was nothing to suggest that human activity directly caused the beluga\u2019s death. A post-mortem examination revealed that Hvaldimir/Andruha died after a stick became lodged in his mouth."

      "The planet Uranus and its five biggest moons may not be the dead sterile worlds that scientists have long thought.",
      "Instead, they may have oceans, and the moons may even be capable of supporting life, scientists say.",
      "Much of what we know about them was gathered by Nasa\u2019s Voyager 2 spacecraft which visited nearly 40 years ago.",
      "But a new analysis shows that Voyager's visit coincided with a powerful solar storm, which led to a misleading idea of what the Uranian system is really like.",
      "Uranus is a beautiful, icy ringed world in the outer reaches of our solar system. It is among the coldest of all the planets. It is also tilted on its side compared to all the other worlds \u2013 as if it had been knocked over \u2013 making it arguably the weirdest.",
      "We got our first close-up look at it in 1986, when Voyager 2 flew past and sent back sensational pictures of the planet and its five major moons.",
      "But what amazed scientists even more was the data Voyager 2 sent back indicating that the Uranian system was even weirder than they thought.",
      "The measurements from the spacecraft\u2019s instruments indicated that the planets and moons were inactive, unlike the other moons in the outer solar system. They also showed that Uranus\u2019s protective magnetic field was strangely distorted. It was squashed and pushed away from the Sun.",
      "A planet\u2019s magnetic field traps any gases and other material coming off the planet and its moons. These might be from oceans or geological activity. Voyager 2 found none, suggesting that Uranus and its five largest moons were sterile and inactive.",
      "This came as an enormous surprise because it was unlike the solar system\u2019s other planets and their moons.",
      "But the new analysis has solved the decades-long mystery. It shows that Voyager 2 flew past on a bad day.",
      "The new research shows that just as Voyager 2 flew past Uranus, the Sun was raging, creating a powerful solar wind that might have blown the material away and temporarily distorted the magnetic field.",
      "So, for 40 years we have had an incorrect view of what Uranus and its five largest moons are normally like, according to Dr William Dunn of University College London.",
      "\u201cThese results suggest that the Uranian system could be much more exciting than previously thought. There could be moons there that could have the conditions that are necessary for life, they might have oceans below the surface that could be teeming with fish!\u201d.",
      "Linda Spilker was a young scientist working on the Voyager programme when the Uranus data came in. She is now still serving as the project scientist for the Voyager missions. She said that she was delighted to hear about the new results, which have been published in the Journal Nature Astronomy.",
      "\u201cThe results are fascinating, and I am really excited to see that there is potential for life in the Uranian system,\u201d she told BBC News.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m also so pleased that so much is being done with the Voyager data. It\u2019s amazing that scientists are looking back at the data we collected in 1986 and finding new results and new discoveries\u201d.",
      "Dr Affelia Wibisono of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, who is independent of the research team, described the results as \u201cvery exciting\u201d.",
      "\u201cIt shows how important it is to look back at old data, because sometimes, hiding behind them is something new to be discovered, which can help us design the next generation of space exploration missions\u201d.",
      "Which is exactly what Nasa is doing, partly as a result of the new research.",
      "It has been nearly 40 years since Voyager 2 last flew past the icy world and its moons. Nasa has plans to launch a new mission, the Uranus Orbiter and Probe, to go back for a closer look in 10 years\u2019 time.",
      "According to Nasa\u2019s Dr Jamie Jasinski, whose idea it was to re-examine the Voyager 2 data, the mission will need to take his results into account when designing its instruments and planning the scientific survey.",
      "\u201cSome of the instruments for the future spacecraft are very much being designed with ideas from what we learned from Voyager 2 when it flew past the system when it was experiencing an abnormal event. So we need to rethink how exactly we are going to design the instruments on the new mission so that we can best capture the science we need to make discoveries\u201d.",
      "Nasa\u2019s Uranus probe is expected to arrive by 2045, which is when scientists hope to find out whether these far-flung icy moons, once thought of as being dead worlds, might have the possibility of being home to life."

      "Someone moved the UK's oldest satellite and there appears to be no record of exactly who, when or why.",
      "Launched in 1969, just a few months after humans first set foot on the Moon, Skynet-1A was put high above Africa's east coast to relay communications for British forces.",
      "When the spacecraft ceased working a few years later, gravity might have been expected to pull it even further to the east, out over the Indian Ocean.",
      "But today, curiously, Skynet-1A is actually half a planet away, in a position 22,369 miles (36,000km) above the Americas.",
      "Orbital mechanics mean it's unlikely the half-tonne military spacecraft simply drifted to its current location.",
      "Almost certainly, it was commanded to fire its thrusters in the mid-1970s to take it westwards. The question is who that was and with what authority and purpose?",
      "It's intriguing that key information about a once vital national security asset can just evaporate. But, fascination aside, you might also reasonably ask why it still matters. After all, we're talking about some discarded space junk from 50 years ago.",
      "\"It's still relevant because whoever did move Skynet-1A did us few favours,\" says space consultant Dr Stuart Eves.",
      "\"It's now in what we call a 'gravity well' at 105 degrees West longitude, wandering backwards and forwards like a marble at the bottom of a bowl. And unfortunately this brings it close to other satellite traffic on a regular basis.",
      "\"Because it's dead, the risk is it might bump into something, and because it's 'our' satellite we're still responsible for it,\" he explains.",
      "Dr Eves has looked through old satellite catalogues, the National Archives and spoken to satellite experts worldwide, but he can find no clues to the end-of-life behaviour of Britain's oldest spacecraft.",
      "It might be tempting to reach for a conspiracy theory or two, not least because it's hard to hear the name \"Skynet\" without thinking of the malevolent, self-aware artificial intelligence (AI) system in The Terminator movie franchise.",

      "\"The first Skynet satellite revolutionised UK telecommunications capacity, permitting London to securely communicate with British forces as far away as Singapore. However, from a technological standpoint, Skynet-1A was more American than British since the United States both built and launched it,\" remarked Dr Aaron Bateman in a recent paper on the history of the Skynet programme, which is now on its fifth generation.",
      "This view is confirmed by Graham Davison who flew Skynet-1A in the early 70s from its UK operations centre at RAF Oakhanger in Hampshire.",
      "\"The Americans originally controlled the satellite in orbit. They tested all of our software against theirs, before then eventually handing over control to the RAF,\" the long-retired engineer told me.",
      "\"In essence, there was dual control, but when or why Skynet-1A might have been handed back to the Americans, which seems likely - I'm afraid I can't remember,\" says Mr Davison, who is now in his 80s.",
      "Rachel Hill, a PhD student from University College London, has also been scouring the National Archives.",
      "Her readings have led her to one very reasonable possibility.",
      "\"A Skynet team from Oakhanger would go to the USAF satellite facility in Sunnyvale (colloquially known as the Blue Cube) and operate Skynet during 'Oakout'. This was when control was temporarily transferred to the US while Oakhanger was down for essential maintenance. Perhaps the move could have happened then?\u201d Ms Hill speculated.",
      "The official, though incomplete, logs of Skynet-1A\u2019s status suggest final commanding was left in the hands of the Americans when Oakhanger lost sight of the satellite in June 1977.",
      "But however Skynet-1A then got shifted to its present position, it was ultimately allowed to die in an awkward place when really it should have been put in an \"orbital graveyard\".",
      "This refers to a region even higher in the sky where old space junk runs zero risk of running into active telecommunications satellites.",
      "Graveyarding is now standard practice, but back in the 1970s no-one gave much thought to space sustainability.",
      "Attitudes have since changed because the space domain is getting congested.",
      "At 105 degrees West longitude, an active satellite might see a piece of junk come within 50km of its position up to four times a day.",
      "That might sound like they\u2019re nowhere near each other, but at the velocities these defunct objects move it\u2019s starting to get a little too close for comfort.",
      "The Ministry of Defence said Skynet-1A was constantly monitored by the UK's National Space Operations Centre. Other satellite operators are informed if there's likely to be a particularly close conjunction, in case they need to take evasive action.",

      "Initially, Soltanov suggested the potential sponsor might be interested in investing in some of the \"green transitioning projects\" Socar was involved in - but then spoke of opportunities related to Azerbaijan's plans to increase gas production, including new pipeline infrastructure.",
      "\"There are a lot of joint ventures that could be established,\" Soltanov says on the recording. \"Socar is trading oil and gas all over the world, including in Asia.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 12:05:38 GMT",
    "summary": "The Northern Taurids are at their peak on 11-12 November - but will the clouds part to let us see them?",
    "story": [
      "Shooting stars may be spotted tonight as the Northern Taurid meteor shower peaks",
      "Published9 November 2024",
      "Published9 November 2024",
      "Sky watchers will be looking out for the Northern Taurids meteor shower which will peak overnight on Monday (11-12 November).",
      "The meteors can be seen from virtually anywhere on Earth but sightings will be affected by the phase of the Moon and the weather conditions.",
      "These showers, known for their slow-moving, long-lasting meteors, are linked to Comet Encke.",
      "There are two streams to the Taurids with the Southern Taurids having peaked earlier in the month.",
      "What is the Taurid meteor shower?",
      "The Taurid meteor shower is caused by the debris - ice and dust - from Comet Encke as it passes through our solar system.",
      "Each time Encke returns to the inner solar system, its nucleus sheds ice and rock into space into a vast debris stream. When Earth passes through this debris the \"comet crumbs\" heat up as they enter our atmosphere and burn up in bright bursts of light.",
      "Taurid meteors tend to be larger than other meteors and can survive for longer periods as they pass through Earth's atmosphere. They also travel relatively slowly, crossing the sky at about 17 miles (27km) per second. This is about half the speed of the Perseids.",
      "A recent theory as to why Encke has such a large debris stream is that it was once part of a larger comet that broke up about 20,000 years ago. It has the shortest orbital period of any known comet within our solar system, taking just 3.3 years to orbit the Sun.",
      "When is the peak?",
      "Encke's debris stream is so large and spread out that it takes Earth a rather long time to pass through it. This is why we experience two separate parts to the shower - the Southern Taurids and the Northern Taurids.",
      "The Southern Taurids run from about 23 September to 12 November and peaked earlier this month. Northern Taurids stem from a nearby but slightly different stream and are active from about 13 October to 2 December, peaking around 11-12 November.",
      "The Taurids are not very prolific, tending to produce only five meteors per hour but they can be very bright. The showers sometimes produce fireballs \u2013 a perfect target for astrophotography.",
      "There seems to be a seven-year cycle with these fireballs. There were lots of sightings of them in 2022 and the next best opportunity may be in 2029.",
      "How do I watch?",
      "You do not need any equipment such as telescopes or binoculars as the secret is to take in as much sky as possible and allow about 30 minutes for your eyes to adjust to the dark.",
      "The best time to view is around midnight when the shower's radiant (the spot in the sky from which the meteors appear to emanate), the Taurus constellation, is high in the sky.",
      "To find Taurus, look for the constellation Orion and then peer to the north-east to find the red star Aldebaran, the star in the bull's eye. Shooting stars will be visible all over the night sky so move your gaze around the nearby constellations.",
      "Skies have been clearing over the past 24 hours, leading to improved viewing conditions.",
      "Will I be able to see them?",
      "Viewing the Taurids may be affected by the illumination of the Moon, which could obscure some of the fainter meteors. The Moon will be in a waxing gibbous phase \u2013 going from half moon to full moon.",
      "However, the weather is looking much more favourable for stargazing now. The recent blanket of cloud we have had for several weeks has moved off, leaving a clearer air mass and a much better view of the night sky.",
      "Fog patches may obscure the sky for some - especially across southern Scotland, Northern Ireland, north-west England and north Wales. Any fog will tend to sit in the valleys though, so head for higher ground in these regions to have a better chance of spotting some spectacular shooting stars.",
      "If you do miss this meteor shower you won't have long to wait until the next one, as the Leonid meteor shower is expected to peak next week on the morning of 18 November.",
      "Keep across your local forecast on the BBC Weather website or app.",

      "The ruling is the result of an investigation which the Commission opened in 2021, after Meta's rivals complained that Facebook Marketplace gave it an unfair advantage.",
      "Fine, fine, fine",
      "Meta has not previously faced a fine from the EU over competition rules - though it was told to pay \u20ac110m in 2017 for not handing over correct information when it purchased WhatsApp.",
      "The Irish Data Protection Commissioner has also previously fined Meta more than \u20ac1bn over mishandling people's data when transferring it between Europe and the United States.",
      "And it also had to pay a comparatively tiny \u00a350m in 2021, when the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) accused it of deliberately breaking rules over its attempt to acquire Gif-maker Giphy - and ultimately demanded it sell the company altogether.",

Architects don\u2019t always have the latest information about how to incorporate energy-saving technologies into their designs, notes Mr Major.",
      "\u201cClean tech isn\u2019t part of what they do or what they should know \u2013 that\u2019s an engineering function,\u201d he says. And yet architects\u2019 clients increasingly ask about such tech when planning a new home or an extension.",
      "Through an initiative called MyHubb, Mr Major is now offering architects detailed reports that estimate the carbon reduction potential and payback period on retrofitted measures - such as heat pump-based heating systems or solar panels, for instance.",
      "He says these reports cost around \u00a31,000, though he adds that this price is not yet finalised.",
      "Mr Duffy says he will keep looking for solutions to his own retrofit conundrum. But he makes another point. So much of the currently available technology and advice is tailored to individual homeowners.",
      "He suggests that neighbourhood-scale schemes, for example to provide solar power to a whole street, might make more sense and could include more people in one go.",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 00:03:51 GMT",
    "summary": "Big mining firms are switching to driverless trucks and other autonomous equipment.",
    "story": [
      "It doesn't get much more remote than this. I'm in inland Western Australia, at Rio Tinto\u2019s Greater Nammuldi iron ore mine.",
      "It's about a two-hour flight north from Perth in a region called the Pilbara.",
      "No-one lives permanently here. Around 400 workers are on the site at any one time, and they are flown in, working between four and eight days, depending on their shift pattern, before flying home.",
      "Giant trucks the size of townhouses, capable of hauling 300 tonnes, criss-cross red-earth roads in various sections of this open-pit mine complex.",
      "For an outsider like me their size is intimidating enough, but multiplying that feeling is the knowledge that there's no driver at the wheel.",
      "During a tour of the site in a normal-sized company vehicle, one of the trucks comes into view, approaching from a side road.",
      "I sigh with relief as it deftly turns and continues in the direction we have just come. \u201cDid it make you feel uncomfortable?,\u201d asks the vehicle\u2019s driver Dwane Pallentine, a production superintendent.",
      "Greater Nammuldi has a fleet of more than 50 self-driving trucks that operate independently on pre-defined courses, along with a handful that remain manually driven and work separately in a different part of the mine.",
      "Being trialled is also an autonomous water cart affectionately known as Henry, which, along with manually driven ones, sprays the mine roads to keep the dust down.",
      "The company vehicle I am in is able to operate alongside the autonomous trucks only because it has been fitted with high-accuracy GPS, which allows it to be seen within a virtual system.",
      "Before entering the mine\u2019s gated autonomous zone, we logged onto this system and a controller verified over the radio that we were visible.",
      "It has encased our vehicle in a virtual bubble that the self-driving trucks \"see\" and which causes them to manage their proximity by slowing or stopping as necessary.",
      "A touch screen in our cabin displays all the staffed and autonomous vehicles and other equipment in the vicinity, along with \"permission lines\" that show the immediate routes the self-driving trucks are intending to take. Had I looked at the screen instead of fretting I would have seen that truck was going to turn.",
      "In addition to all vehicles being fitted with a big red emergency button that can stop the system, the autonomous trucks have lasers and radars front and rear to detect collision risks.",
      "The sensors also detect obstacles. If a large rock fell off the back of a truck, the sensors on the next truck along would notice it and the vehicle would stop.",
      "However, some trucks seem extra sensitive \u2013 on my tour I see a couple foiled simply by rough roads.",
      "Co-ordinating and monitoring these robots is Rio Tinto\u2019s Operations Centre (OC) in Perth, about 1,500km (930 miles) to the south.",
      "It\u2019s the nerve centre for all the company\u2019s Pilbara iron ore operations, which span 17 mines in total, including the three making up Greater Nammuldi.",
      "Guided from here by controllers, include more than 360 self-driving trucks across all the sites (about 84% of the total fleet is automated); a mostly autonomous long-distance rail network to transport the mined ore to port facilities; and nearly 40 autonomous drills. OC staff also remotely control plant and port functions.",
      "Autonomy isn\u2019t new to Rio\u2019s Pilbara operations: introduction began in the late 2000s.",
      "Nor is it unique: Australia has the greatest number of autonomous trucks and mines that use automation of any country, and other mining companies in the Pilbara also use the technology.",
      "But the scale Rio has grown its operations to here, including at Greater Nammuldi \u2013 which has one of the largest autonomous truck fleets in the world \u2013 gives it global significance.",
      "And it's a global trend. According to GlobalData the number of self-driving haul trucks worldwide has roughly quadrupled over the past four years to more than 2,000, with most made by either Caterpillar or Komatsu.",
      "The biggest reason for introducing the technology has been to improve the physical safety of the workforce, says Matthew Holcz, the managing director of the company\u2019s Pilbara mines.",
      "Mining is a dangerous occupation: heavy machinery can be unpredictably operated by people who can also become fatigued. \u201cThe data clearly shows that, through automation, we've got a significantly safer business,\u201d says Mr Holcz.",
      "It has also improved productivity \u2013 to the tune of about 15%, he estimates. Autonomous equipment can be used more because there are no gaps due to shift changes or breaks. And autonomous trucks can also go faster when there is less staff-operated equipment on the scene.",
      "Such automation does not come cheap. Rio won\u2019t disclose what it has spent in total on its Pilbara automation journey to date, but observers put it at multiple billions of dollars.",
      "Meanwhile, employment opportunities have evolved. The narrative might be one of robots taking jobs, but that doesn\u2019t seem the case here so far.",
      "While the OC has about one controller for every 25 autonomous trucks \u2013 according to Rio, no one has lost their job because of automation.",
      "Instead, there have been redeployments: truck drivers have joined the OC as controllers themselves, been reskilled to operate different pieces of equipment, such as excavators, loaders and dozers, or gone to drive manual trucks at different sites.",
      "On the OC\u2019s large open plan floor, amid the banks of monitors arranged in clusters for the different mines, I meet Jess Cowie who used be a manual driller but now directs autonomous ones from the central drill pod. \u201cI still put holes in the ground\u2026just without the dust, the noise and being away from the family,\u201d she says.",
      "Automation is delivering a \u201cstep change\u201d in terms of safety in the mining industry says Robin Burgess-Limerick, a professor at the University of Queensland in Brisbane who studies human factors in mining. But it doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t room for improvement.",
      "Professor Burgess-Limerick has analysed incidents involving autonomous equipment reported to regulators.",
      "As he sees it, the interfaces used by staff both in the field and in control centres to gain information aren\u2019t optimally designed. There have been situations where field staff have lost awareness of the situation, which better screen design may have prevented. \u201cThe designers of the technology should put a bit more effort into considering people,\u201d he says.",
      "And there is also a risk that controllers\u2019 workloads can be overwhelming - it is a busy, high stakes job.",
      "Over-trust, where people become so confident the autonomous equipment will stop that they start putting themselves at risk, can also be an issue, and he notes effort needs to be directed into improving the ability of trucks themselves to detect moisture. There have been incidents where wet roadways have caused them to lose traction.",
      "There can be legitimate safety concerns with autonomous equipment, says Shane Roulstone, co-ordinator for the Western Mine Workers Alliance, which represents mining-related workers in the Pilbara.",
      "He points to a serious incident this May where an autonomous train slammed into the back of a broken-down train, which workers at the front end were repairing (they evacuated before it hit but were left shaken).",
      "But Mr Roulstone also praises Rio generally for having, over time, developed \u201csome good strategies, procedures and policies\u201d around how people interact with automated vehicles.",
      "Mr Roulstone expects that at some point options for redeployment will lessen and there will job losses. \u201cIt is just the mathematics of it,\u201d he says.",
      "Meanwhile, Rio\u2019s automation journey in the Pilbara continues with more trucks, drills and Henry the water cart. It is also closely watching work by Komatsu and Caterpillar to develop un-staffed excavators, loaders and dozers.",
      "Late in the afternoon, waiting at Greater Nammuldi\u2019s airport for the last flight back to Perth, the announcement comes that it has been cancelled due to an issue with the plane. That\u2019s 150 extra people who will now need to be fed and accommodated. It is nothing for Rio, but I can\u2019t help but think we humans are complicated compared to robots.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 13:57:52 GMT",
    "summary": "John Smyth, a known child abuser in the UK, went to Zimbabwe and set up Christian holiday camps.",
    "story": [
      "The sister of a 16-year-old boy who drowned while swimming naked at a Christian holiday camp in Zimbabwe run by child abuser John Smyth blames the Church of England for his death.",
      "\"The Church knew about the abuses that John Smyth was doing. They should have stopped him. Had they stopped him, I think my brother [Guide Nyachuru] would still be alive,\" Edith Nyachuru told the BBC.",
      "The British barrister had moved to Zimbabwe with his wife and four children from Winchester in England in 1984 to work with an evangelistic organisation.",
      "This was two years after an investigation revealed he had subjected boys in the UK, many of whom he had met at Christian holiday camps run by a charity he chaired that was linked to the Church, to traumatic physical, psychological and sexual abuse.",
      "The 1982 report, prepared by Anglican clergyman Mark Ruston, about the canings said \"the scale and severity of the practice was horrific\", with accounts of boys beaten so badly they bled, with one describing how he needed to wear nappies until his wounds scabbed over.",
      "Despite these shocking revelations, mainly involving boys from elite British public schools, the Ruston report was not widely circulated.",
      "A decade on, aged 50, Smyth had established himself as a respected member of the Christian community in Zimbabwe. He had set up his own organisation, Zambesi Ministries, with funding from the UK - and was meting out similar punishments at camps that he marketed at the country\u2019s top schools.",
      "Ms Nyachuru says her brother\u2019s trip had been an early Christmas present from one of his other sisters, who had picked up one of Smyth\u2019s brochures and been impressed with all the activities on offer for the week.",
      "As she looks at an old photograph of Guide, she says he was the youngest of seven siblings, and the only boy: \"He was very loved by everyone.",
      "\"A lovely boy... Guide was due to be made head boy the following year,\" she remembers, adding that he was \"an intelligent boy, a good swimmer, strong, healthy with no known medical conditions\".",
      "But within 12 hours of him being dropped at the camp at Ruzawi School in Marondera, 74km (46 miles) from the capital, Harare, on the evening of 15 December 1992, the family received a call to say he had died.",
      "Witnesses say that like all the boys, Guide had gone swimming naked in a pool before bed - a camp tradition. The other boys returned to the dormitory, but Guide\u2019s absence was not noticed - which his sister finds surprising - and his body was found at the bottom of the pool the next morning.",
      "His family rushed to the mortuary but Ms Nyachuru\u2019s shock was compounded by confusion when she was stopped by officers from viewing his body: \"They told me: 'You can\u2019t go in there because he is indecently dressed.'",
      "\"It was only my father, my brother-in-law and our pastor who went in and put him in the coffin.\"",
      "Nakedness appears to be something Smyth was fixated on at his camps. Camp attendees have told of how he would often parade around without clothes in the boys\u2019 dormitories - where he also slept, unlike other staff members.",
      "He would also shower naked with them in the communal showers and the boys were ordered not to wear underpants in bed.",
      "\"He promoted nakedness and encouraged the boys to walk around naked at the summer camp,\" a former student who attended a camp at Ruzawi in 1991 told the BBC.",
      "But his jocular manner put many of them at ease, he said.",
      "\"Smyth was very friendly, laid-back, approachable, he was really fun, always joking.",
      "\"Smyth would also walk the dorms and shower area wearing nothing but a towel slung over his shoulder.\"",
      "The reason given for the no-underwear-in-the-evening rule was \"because it would make them grow\", he recalled.",
      "Smyth gave talks on masturbation, would sometimes lead prayers in the nude and encouraged naked trampolining, an activity he described as \"flappy jumping\" - all behaviour noted in an investigation by Zimbabwean lawyer David Coltart that was launched in May 1993.",
      "It was the thrashings that Smyth was giving boys with a notorious table tennis bat, dubbed \"TTB\", that led a parent to the door of Coltart, who worked at a law practice in Zimbabwe's second city, Bulawayo.",
      "She wanted to know why one of her sons had returned from a holiday camp with bruises on his buttocks so severe that she took him to a doctor, who found a \"12cm x 12cm bruise\".",
      "\"She saw these and demanded to know what happened and then it came out that her son had been badly beaten in the nude, and she came to me for advice,\" Coltart, now mayor of Bulawayo, told the BBC.",
      "\"When I heard that this was a Christian organisation - I\u2019m an elder in the Presbyterian Church - I got hold of my pastor and we got hold of the Baptist Church, Methodist Church and two other churches in the city and then I was instructed by those churches to investigate the matter,\" he said.",
      "Forty-four-year-old Jason Leanders, who went on the camp that immediately followed Guide\u2019s death, said he was beaten three to four times a day by Smyth, who would put his hands into his pants to check he had not put on extra layers to cushion his buttocks.",
      "\"My bum was black,\" he told the BBC. \"But being a boy, you act tough.\"",
      "For many boarding school students, corporal punishment was regarded as \"normal\", former Zimbabwean cricketer Henry Olonga, who was attending the camp the night Guide died, said in his 2015 autobiography.",
      "But after Coltart managed to track down the Ruston report, the severity of the problem became apparent. He wrote to Smyth instructing him to immediately stop the Zambesi Ministries camps.",
      "\"It was calculated, he focused on boys. He groomed young men. He encouraged them to take showers in the nude with him. There was a pattern of violence,\" he said.",
      "But Coltart\u2019s dealings with Smyth proved difficult.",
      "\"He was a highly articulate man and quite aggressive in the meetings that I had with him. He employed all his skills as a barrister to seek to intimidate. He was older than me. I was then a relatively young lawyer in my 30s. He exploited the fact that he was an English QC [Queen's Counsel].\"",
      "Rather than comply with Coltart\u2019s various requests, he doubled down and in a letter to parents ahead of the August 1993 camps, described himself as \"a father figure to the camp\" and defended the nudity and corporal punishment, writing: \"I never cane the boys, but I do whack with a table tennis bat when necessary\u2026 although most regard TTB (as it is affectionately known) as little more than a joke.\"",
      "This time there appears to have been no cloaking of the beatings as \"spiritual discipline\" as had been the case in the UK. He also admitted to Coltart that he took photographs of naked boys, but said they were \"from shoulders up\" for publicity purposes.",
      "Coltart contacted two psychologists with his findings, both of whom advised that Smyth should stop working with children.",
      "His 21-page report was then published in October 1993, and circulated to head teachers and church leaders in Zimbabwe.",
      "\"The report was never published widely, conscious of the dangers of a defamation suit,\" Coltart said.",
      "However it \"basically stopped him in his tracks in Zimbabwe\" as the private schools were his harvesting ground, he said. Zambesi Ministries camps did continue in some guise, but not at schools or under Smyth\u2019s leadership",
      "Coltart then instructed another law firm to pursue a legal case against Smyth who was eventually charged with culpable homicide over Guide\u2019s death, as well as charges relating to the beatings.",
      "But, according to former BBC TV producer Andrew Graystone in his 2021 book about the abuse, the case was bedevilled with problems, police documents were missing and Smyth\u2019s legal prowess led to the prosecutor being removed - another one was never appointed, so the case was essentially shelved in 1997.",
      "Ms Nyachuru says no post-mortem was carried out at the time - Guide was buried on the day he drowned in the family's home village, with Smyth presiding over the funeral.",
      "Following the Coltart report, Smyth faced deportation from Zimbabwe but Graystone says he used his significant connections to avoid this, lobbying various cabinet ministers - some of whose sons had attended his camps - with suggestions that even then-President Robert Mugabe was approached by one of Smyth\u2019s associates.",
      "But from the time of Smyth\u2019s prosecution, the family were given temporary residency permits, which had to be renewed every 30 days.",
      "In 2001, having spent too long out of the country on a trip, Smyth and his wife Anne were refused re-entry, prompting their move to South Africa\u2019s coastal city of Durban and then a few years later to Cape Town, where the couple were living when the Church of England became fully aware in 2013 of the abuses he had committed in the UK.",
      "\"The Anglican church in Cape Town in which John Smyth worshipped\u2026 has reported that it never received any reports suggesting he abused or groomed young people,\" Thabo Makgoba, the archbishop of Cape Town, said in statement responding to this week's resignation of Justin Welby as Archbishop of Canterbury.",
      "Smyth was only excommunicated by his local church the year before his death in 2018, after he was named publicly as an abuser in a Channel 4 News report.",
      "Ms Nyachuru told the BBC it was not until 2021 that she received a written apology from Welby about the death of her brother, in which he admitted that Smyth was responsible and the church had failed her family.",
      "She wrote back describing the apology as \"too little, too late\" and is now calling for other senior church leaders who failed to intervene to prevent Smyth's abuse to resign: \"I just think people of the church, if they see something not going in the right direction, if it needs the police they should go to the police.\"",
      "Coltart feels it is not just the Church that is to blame, and suggests other institutions in the UK need to face up to their failure to warn people in Zimbabwe.",
      "He commended the Church of England\u2019s recent Makin report, saying it \"left no stone unturned\". The report estimates that around \"85 boys and young men were physically abused in African countries, including Zimbabwe\".",
      "Coltart urged the Church to reach out to them.",
      "\"I think possibly there are still victims in Zimbabwe, perhaps in South Africa, who are suffering from PTSD and I think the Anglican church has a responsibility to identify those individuals and to supply them with the medical assistance that they might require,\" he said.",
      "Mr Leanders says many of his friends are still \"so traumatised by the beatings they are not even prepared to talk about it\".",
      "\"Smyth was protected in England and he was protected in Zimbabwe. The protection went on for so long it robbed victims the chance to confront Smyth as adults.\"",

      "HRW\u2019s report says this amounts to \u201cforcible transfer\u201d and that \u201cevidence shows it has been systematic and part of a state policy\u201d. It also says Israeli actions appear to \u201cmeet the definition of ethnic cleansing\u201d.",
      "Israel has said the report is \"completely false and detached from reality\".",
      "\"Contrary to claims in HRW's report, Israel's efforts are directed solely at dismantling Hamas's terror capabilities and not at the people of Gaza,\" Oren Marmorstein, a spokesperson of Israel's ministry of foreign affairs posted on X.",

      "HRW has also accused Hamas of using civilians as human shields by operating inside homes and civilian infrastructure.",

    "story": [
      "New Zealand's parliament was brought to a temporary halt by MPs performing a haka, amid anger over a controversial bill seeking to reinterpret the country's founding treaty with M\u0101ori people.",
      "Opposition party MP Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke began the traditional ceremonial group dance after being asked whether her party supported the bill, which faced its first vote on Thursday.",
      "At the same time, a h\u012bkoi - or peaceful protest march - organised by a M\u0101ori rights group is continuing to make its way towards the capital, Wellington.",
      "Thousands have already joined the 10-day march against the bill, which reached Auckland on Wednesday, having begun in the far north of New Zealand on Monday.",
      "The country is often considered a leader in indigenous rights, but opponents of the bill fear those same rights are being put at risk by this bill.",
      "Act, the political party that introduced the bill, argues there is a need to legally define the principles of the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi, which has been fundamental to race relations in New Zealand.",
      "The core values of the treaty have, over time, been woven into New Zealand's laws in an effort to redress the wrong done to M\u0101ori during colonisation.",
      "But Act -  a minor party in the ruling centre-right coalition - say this has resulted in the country being divided by race, and the bill will allow the treaty to be interpreted more fairly through parliament, rather than the courts. The party's leader, David Seymour, has dismissed opponents as wanting to \"stir up\" fear and division.",
      "Critics, however, say the legislation will divide the country and lead to the unravelling  of much-needed support for many M\u0101ori.",
      "The first reading passed on Thursday after a 30-minute break, backed by all parties from the ruling coalition. Maipi-Clarke was suspended from the house.",
      "It is unlikely to pass a second reading, as Act's coalition partners have indicated they will not support it.",
      "But this has not placated those worried about the bill, and its impact, with the hikoi still making progress along its 1,000km (621-mile) route.",
      "In Auckland, it took an estimated 5,000 marchers two hours to cross the harbour bridge. Officials had closed two lanes, the New Zealand Herald reported, to allow them to continue along the route.",
      "Danielle Moreau, who is M\u0101ori, walked over the Harbour Bridge with her two sons, Bobby and Teddy, and told the BBC she \"was hoping it [the h\u012bkoi] would be big but it was much more epic than I expected\".",
      "\"I marched to make the point that Te Tiriti [the Treaty of Waitangi] is very important to our national identity,\" said Winston Pond, who also took part in the march on Wednesday.",
      "\"We are a multi-cultural society built on a bicultural base - something that cannot be altered.\"",
      "Juliet Tainui-Hern\u00e1ndez, from the M\u0101ori tribe Ng\u0101i Tahu, and her Puerto Rican partner Javier Hern\u00e1ndez, brought their daughter Paloma to the h\u012bkoi.",
      "Ms Tainui-Hern\u00e1ndez said those who turned out in support did so \"for the respectful and inclusive nation we want Aotearoa [New Zealand] to be for our tamariki mokopuna - our children and grandchildren\".",
      "Kiriana O\u2019Connell, who is also M\u0101ori, said that the current treaty principles were already a compromise for her people, and she would not support a \"rewrite\".",
      "Under the proposed legislation, the treaty principles that would be defined in law are:",
      "that the government has a right to govern and that parliament has the full right to make lawsthat the rights of M\u0101ori are respected by the Crown that everyone is equal before the law and is entitled to equal protection under it.",
      "that the government has a right to govern and that parliament has the full right to make laws",
      "that the rights of M\u0101ori are respected by the Crown",
      "that everyone is equal before the law and is entitled to equal protection under it.",
      "Act leader Seymour - who is also New Zealand's associate justice minister - argues that because the principles have never been properly defined legally, the courts \"have been able to develop principles that have been used to justify actions that are contrary to the principle of equal rights\".",
      "He says these include \"ethnic quotas in public institutions\" that go against the spirit of fairness for all New Zealanders.",
      "Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, however, has called the bill \"divisive\" - despite being part of the same coalition.",
      "Meanwhile, the Waitangi Tribunal, which was set up in 1975 to investigate alleged breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi, notes the bill \"purposefully excluded any consultation with M\u0101ori, breaching the principle of partnership, the Crown\u2019s good-faith obligations, and the Crown\u2019s duty to actively protect M\u0101ori rights and interests\".",
      "It also said that the principles of the bill misinterpreted the Treaty of Waitangi and that this \"caused significant prejudice to M\u0101ori\".",
      "The tabling of the Treaty Principles Bill comes following a series of measures introduced by the government that have affected M\u0101ori.",
      "They include the closure of the M\u0101ori Health Authority, which was set up under Jacinda Ardern's Labour government to help create health equity, and reprioritising English over M\u0101ori when it comes to the official naming of government organisations, for example.",
      "While roughly 18% of New Zealand's population consider themselves to be M\u0101ori, according to the most recent census, many remain disadvantaged compared with the general population when assessed through markers such as health outcomes, household income, education levels and incarceration and mortality rates. There remains a seven-year gap in life expectancy.",
      "The Treaty of Waitangi is an agreement between the British and many, but not all, M\u0101ori tribes, which was signed in 1840.",
      "It is contentious as it was written in both English and M\u0101ori - which had only been a spoken language until colonisation - and the two versions contain fundamental differences when it comes to issues such as sovereignty.",
      "While the treaty itself is not enshrined in law, its principles have been adopted over time into various pieces of legislation.",
      "The bill will now be sent to a select committee for a six-month public hearing process.",

      "A brief yearly silence has once again enveloped South Korea, as half a million students across the country sit for the most important test of their lives.",
      "Planes were grounded, construction work halted, and car honking discouraged as the Suneung, an eight-hour university placement exam billed as one of the toughest in the world, kicked off on Thursday.",
      "But this year, there was one sound that students were especially scared of: \"APT\".",
      "The global hit by Blackpink's Ros\u00e9 and Bruno Mars emerged as a \"forbidden\" song among students who feared that its catchiness could cause them to lose focus during the test.",
      "No distractions are too minor when it comes to the Suneung, which many see as a culmination of years of formal education - and a turning point that determines their university placements, careers, and social statuses.",
      "\"I\u2019m worried that the song will play in my head even during the exam,\" one student told Yonhap News of the chart-topper. \"Adults might laugh and say, 'Why stress over something like that?' But for us, with such an important test ahead, it can feel unsettling.\"",
      "Suneung students have previously been encouraged to avoid other so-called earworms, with songs such as \"Go Go\" by BTS and \"Ring Ding Dong\" by SHINee repeatedly cited online as tracks that should be forbidden.",
      "Ensuring that the exam runs smoothly is a nationwide effort. Shops and the stock market opened late on Thursday to reduce traffic congestion, and authorities adjusted public transport operating hours and put more than a dozen spare trains on standby in case of breakdowns.",
      "More than 10,000 police officers were deployed, including some tasked to ferry students to school during emergencies.",
      "Besides grounding planes to minimise noise disturbances during the 20-minute English listening test, authorities have also asked bus and taxi drivers to refrain from honking while the tests are taking place.",
      "Disruptions to the Suneung are treated as a serious matter. Last December, dozens of students sued the government after teachers accidentally cut their test short by 90 seconds.",
      "There are a record number of candidates retaking the exam this year, after authorities announced they would expand enrolment in medical schools - a move that was met with widespread protests among trainee doctors while being welcomed by aspiring medical students."

    "summary": "The four men had been in unmarked graves after they were killed in the Korean War.",
    "story": [
      "From his wheelchair, Michael Northey watches quietly over his father\u2019s grave, and lays a flower for the very first time.",
      "\u201cThis is the closest I\u2019ve been to him in 70 years, which is ridiculous,\u201d he jokes poignantly.",
      "Born into a poor family in the backstreets of Portsmouth, Michael was still a baby when his father, the youngest of 13 children, left to fight in the Korean War. He was killed in action, his body never identified.",
      "For decades, it lay in an unmarked grave in the UN cemetery in Busan, on Korea\u2019s south coast, adorned with the plaque \u2018Member of the British Army, known unto God\u2019.",
      "Now it bears his name \u2013 Sergeant D. Northey, died 24 April 1951, age 23.",
      "Sergeant Northey, along with three others, are the first unknown British soldiers killed in the Korean War to be successfully identified, and Michael is attending a ceremony, along with the other families, to rename their graves.",
      "Michael had spent years doing his own research, hoping to find out where his father was buried, but had eventually given up.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m ill and don\u2019t have a lot of time left myself, so I\u2019d written it off. I thought I\u2019d never find out,\u201d he says.",
      "But a couple of months ago, Michael received a phone call. Unknown to him, researchers at the Ministry of Defence had been conducting their own investigation. When he heard the news, he \u201cwailed like a banshee for 20 minutes\u201d.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t describe the emotional release,\u201d he says, smiling. \u201cThis had haunted me for 70 years. The poor lady who phoned me, I felt sorry for her!\u201d",
      "The woman on the other end of the phone was Nicola Nash, a forensic researcher from the Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre in Gloucester, who ordinarily works to identify victims from the First and Second World Wars.",
      "Tasked for the first time with finding the Korean War dead, she had to start from scratch - by first compiling a list of the 300 British soldiers still missing, of whom 76 were buried in the cemetery in Busan.",
      "Nicola went through their burial reports, and found just one man had been buried wearing sergeant stripes from the Gloucester Regiment, as well as one major.",
      "After trawling the national archives and cross referencing eyewitness accounts, family letters and war office reports, Ms Nash was able to identify these men as Sergeant Northey and Major Patrick Angier.",
      "Both were killed in the famous Battle of Imjin River, in April 1951, as the Chinese Army - which had joined the war on the North Korean side - tried to push the allied forces down the peninsula to retake the capital Seoul.",
      "Despite being hugely outnumbered, the men held their position for three days, giving their comrades enough time to retreat and successfully defend the city.",
      "The issue at the time, Ms Nash explains, is that because the battle was so bloody, most of the men were either killed or captured, leaving no one to identify them.",
      "The enemy had removed and scattered their dog tags. It was not until the prisoners of war were released that they were able share their accounts of the battle. No one had thought to go back and piece the puzzles together \u2013 until now.",
      "For Ms Nash, this has been a six-year \u201clabour of love\u201d, made slightly easier, she admits, by having some of the men\u2019s children still alive to draw on, something that has also made the process more special.",
      "\u201cThe children have spent their whole lives not knowing what happened to their fathers, and for me to be able to do this work and bring them here to their graves, to say their goodbyes and have that closure, means everything,\" she says.",
      "At the ceremony, the families sit on chairs amidst the long rows of small stone graves which mark the thousands of foreign soldiers who fought and died in the Korean War. They are accompanied by serving soldiers from their loved ones\u2019 former regiments.",
      "Major Angier\u2019s daughter, Tabby, now 77, and his grandson Guy, stand to read excerpts of letters he wrote from the front line.",
      "In one of his final letters, he writes to his wife: \u201cLots of love to our dear children. Do tell them how much Daddy misses them and will come back as soon as he has finished his work.\"",
      "Tabby was three years old when her father left for the war, and her memories of him are fractured: \u201cI can remember someone standing in a room and canvas bags piling up, which must have been his equipment to go to Korea. But I can\u2019t see his face,\u201d she says.",
      "At the time of her father\u2019s death, people didn\u2019t like to talk about wars, Tabby says. Instead, people in her small Gloucestershire village used to remark: \u201cOh, those poor children, they\u2019ve lost their father.\"",
      "\u201cI used to think that if he\u2019s lost, they\u2019re going to find him,\u201d says Tabby.",
      "But as the years passed, and she learnt what had happened, Tabby was told her father\u2019s body would never be found. The last record of his whereabouts suggested his body had been left under an upturned boat on the battlefield.",
      "Tabby had twice previously visited the cemetery in Busan, in an attempt to get as close to her father as she thought possible - not knowing his actual grave was here all along.",
      "\u201cI think it will take some time to sink in,\u201d she says, from his newly-adorned graveside.",
      "The shock has been even greater for 25-year-old Cameron Adair, from Scunthorpe, whose great, great uncle, Corporal William Adair, is one of two soldiers from the Royal Ulster Rifles identified by Ms Nash. The other is Rifleman Mark Foster, from County Durham.",
      "Both men were killed in January 1951 as they were forced to retreat by a platoon of Chinese soldiers.",
      "Corporal Adair did not have children, and when his wife died so did his memory, leaving Cameron and his family unaware of his existence.",
      "Finding out his relative \u201chelped bring freedom to so many people\u201d has brought Cameron \u201ca real sense of pride,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cComing here and witnessing this firsthand has really brought it home\u201d.",
      "Now a similar age to his uncle when he was killed, Cameron feels inspired and says he would like to serve should the need arise.",
      "Ms Nash is now gathering DNA samples from the relatives of the other 300 missing soldiers, in the hope she can give more families the same peace and joy she has brought to Cameron, Tabby and Michael.",
      "\u201cIf there are still British personnel missing, we will keep trying to find them,\u201d she says."

    "summary": "New trenches and berms are being constructed along the frontier in the occupied Golan Heights.",
    "story": [
      "The United Nations says Israeli construction along a demilitarised buffer zone with Syria has led to \u201csevere violations\u201d of a 50-year-old ceasefire agreement, which risk increasing tensions along their shared frontier in the occupied Golan Heights.",
      "Satellite photographs show new trenches and earth berms dug over the past few months along the length of what is known as the Area of Separation (AoS).",
      "The BBC has filmed construction taking place alongside a military vehicle near the town of Majdal Shams, and fresh earthworks in rural land further south. The work in both locations is believed to lie within Israeli-controlled areas.",
      "The UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) says most of the Israeli construction does not breach the AoS, but that some trenches - dug under protection from military vehicles including tanks - do cross into it, and that Israeli army vehicles and personnel have also entered the buffer zone.",
      "Beneath the watchtower at UNDOF\u2019s Camp Ziouani base, the Israeli fence snakes towards a line of volcanic mountains; a Syrian flag flutters in the trees beyond the post, marking the other side of the separation zone.",
      "UNDOF observers monitor the 80km (50-mile) long strip of land 24 hours a day.",
      "Chief of Mission Bernard Lee told the BBC that two major lines of trenches had been dug, along with three more limited ones, each some 6m (20 ft) wide.",
      "He estimated that trenches crossed into the AoS in a handful locations, by a couple of metres in each case, but said he had not visited the sites himself.",
      "UNDOF was not able to immediately share visual evidence of the reported incursions, and permission for the BBC to view or film the locations from a nearby observation post has so far not been granted.",
      "Initial searches of satellite photographs have not produced images in enough detail to independently confirm the UN allegations.",
      "The AoS was set up as part of Israel\u2019s ceasefire agreement with Syria in 1974, following Israel\u2019s earlier occupation of the Golan Heights.",
      "Israeli forces are required to be west of the so-called Alpha Line, while Syrian forces must be east of the Bravo Line, which runs along the other side of the AoS.",
      "Israel unilaterally annexed the Golan in 1981. The move was not recognised internationally, although the US did so unilaterally in 2019.",
      "Israeli settlers there live alongside about 20,000 Syrians, most of them Druze, who stayed on in the Golan after it was captured.",
      "Despite the presence of Iran-backed militia groups in Syria, this frontier has remained relatively calm, as Israeli ground forces have battled Iranian allies in Gaza and Lebanon over the past 13 months.",
      "But UNDOF said in a statement that the Syrian authorities had \u201cstrongly protested\u201d the ongoing Israeli work. And that the UN itself had \u201crepeatedly\u201d taken its concerns over the Israeli violations to Israel\u2019s military authorities.",
      "Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) spokesman Lt Col Nadav Shoshani told the BBC that the trenches were designed to protect against infiltration by Iran-backed groups in Syria - and did not break the ceasefire agreement.",

      "Of all the president-elect\u2019s picks for his administration so far, this is easily the most controversial - and sends a clear message that Trump intends to shake up the establishment when he returns to power.",
      "The shockwaves were still being felt on Thursday morning as focus shifted to a looming fight in the Senate over his nomination.",

Joe Biden\u2019s attorney general, Merrick Garland, was a senior federal appellate court judge. Trump in his first term picked US Senator Jeff Sessions, and later Bill Barr, who had decades of experience in Republican presidential administrations.",
      "The Senate will be responsible for confirming Gaetz\u2019s nomination, and the Florida congressman has ruffled more then a few feathers in that chamber \u2013 including among Republicans. While his party has a majority, it would only take four \u201cno\u201d votes, joined by unified Democratic opposition, to sink his chances.",

      "For now, Mike Huckabee seems to be keeping his cards close to his chest.",
      "Shortly after being announced as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for US ambassador to Israel, the former Republican governor of Arkansas said: \u201cI won't make the policy. I will carry out the policy of the president.\u201d",
      "But he did give an indication of what he expected that policy to be, citing the previous Trump administration\u2019s decision to move the US embassy to Jerusalem and to recognise the occupied Golan Heights as Israeli territory \u2013 decisions as warmly welcomed by the Israeli right wing as they were categorically rejected by Palestinians.",
      "\u201cNo-one has done more,\u201d he told an Israeli radio station. \u201cPresident Trump and I fully expect that will continue.\u201d",
      "What approach Trump will take to the Israel-Gaza war is still unclear. But the right wing of Israeli politics has welcomed the president-elect\u2019s appointment of Huckabee, seeing it as predicting another term of American policy highly favourable to their longstanding aims of holding on to territory in the West Bank and expanding settlements.",
      "The appointment was greeted with joy by two far-right ministers in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government. On the social media platform X, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich messaged his congratulations to \u201ca consistent and loyal friend\", while Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national security minister, wrote \"Mike Huckabee\" with heart emojis.",

      "Why is Elon Musk Trump's efficiency tsar?",
      "Smotrich and Ben-Gvir have reason to be cheered by Huckabee\u2019s appointment. He has been a consistent supporter of many Israelis\u2019 ambitions to expand into territories that would form part of any future Palestinian state.",
      "Holding a press conference in 2017, shortly after a cornerstone-laying ceremony at one of the biggest Israeli settlements in the West Bank, Huckabee said: \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a settlement. They\u2019re communities, they\u2019re neighbourhoods, they\u2019re cities.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as an occupation.\u201d",
      "The following year, he said: \u201cI think Israel has title deed to Judea and Samaria,\u201d using the name used by many in Israel for the area which became the occupied West Bank when it was captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.",
      "The previous Trump administration declared in 2019 that it did not consider Israeli settlements illegal under international law, contradicting decades of US policy. Other decisions, including a 2020 peace plan greenlighting the annexation of Israeli settlements, were seen as more favourable to the settlers than any previous administration.",
      "The Israeli far right has indicated that it sees Huckabee\u2019s appointment as a sign that it will be able to further advance its agenda, including annexation of the West Bank, during the next Trump term.",
      "On Monday, Smotrich said that 2025 would be \"the year of sovereignty\" in the West Bank, adding that he had instructed Israeli authorities to begin preparatory work for annexation of the occupied territory.",
      "That happening is a genuine fear for Mustafa Barghouti, a West Bank-based veteran Palestinian politician who is leader of the Palestinian National Initiative political movement.",
      "\u201cYou can imagine the reaction of other powerful countries in the world would be, when the idea of annexing occupied territories, obtained by war, becomes legal and acceptable,\" he says. \"So it's not just about Palestinians and our suffering, it's about the international order.\u201d",
      "Whether Smotrich will get his wish remains to be seen. Tal Schneider, a political correspondent at the Times of Israel, says it is not a foregone conclusion that a pro-settler US ambassador will result in pro-settler policies in Washington.",
      "\u201cFour years ago, some of the people that surrounded Trump were very much pro-settlements and pro-annexing, but it didn't work like that last time. I predict it's not going to work like that this time around.\u201d",
      "Huckabee was not the only appointee announced on Tuesday. The president-elect also said Steve Witkoff would serve as his special envoy to the Middle East.",
      "As well as being a real estate developer, Witkoff is also a longtime golf buddy of Trump\u2019s. The pair were playing together at the time of a second failed assassination attempt in September.",
      "It is not clear what foreign policy experience Witkoff brings to the role, but he has previously praised Trump\u2019s dealings with Israel.",
      "In July, he argued that Trump\u2019s \u201cleadership was good for Israel and the entire region\u201d.",
      "\u201cWith President Trump, the Middle East experienced historic levels of peace and stability. Strength prevents wars. Iran\u2019s money was cut off which prevented their funding of global terror,\u201d he said.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s decision to nominate a hardline settler leader for Israeli ambassador to Washington three days after Trump\u2019s election also indicates that the prime minister believes the next administration will be receptive to right-wing arguments.",
      "US-born Yechiel Leiter, who was Netanyahu\u2019s chief of staff when he was finance minister, supports the annexation of the West Bank. According to the Haaretz newspaper, he was once active in the US-based Jewish Defence League, the organisation founded by far-right rabbi Meir Kahane. His son was killed fighting in Gaza.",
      "He was also reported to support the Abraham Accords, Trump\u2019s efforts to normalise relations between Israel and Arab states, which had some success. However, advancing that process has been derailed by the ongoing war in Gaza and Arab anger over the suffering of the Palestinians.",
      "Palestinians, already disillusioned with the US over Joe Biden\u2019s support for Israel during the war in Gaza, say Trump\u2019s pick for ambassador suggests the next president will make the prospect of an eventual two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict even more remote.",

      "But with some members of his own party resistant to his surprise ascent to the top in 2016, he struggled with other aims.",
      "His plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act (known as Obamacare) failed when a senator from his own party, John McCain, refused to vote for it. He also failed to pass an infrastructure bill as he had promised.",
      "In his first two years, when the Democrats controlled the House and the Senate, Biden succeeded in passing the American Rescue plan, the Investment and Jobs Act, and the Chips and Science Act. But he, too, had to significantly scale back his spending and investment plans - touted as the Build Back Better package - after opposition from one of his own senators.",
      "A major impediment to total control for either party is that Senate bills require a three-fifths majority, or 60 votes, to bypass the filibuster, which enables senators to delay legislation by keeping debate open-ended. That means that when a party has a simple majority in the Senate, it needs to reach across the aisle to get a bill passed.",
      "Even with a healthy majority in the Senate this time around, Trump will not have the magic 60 seats that would allow him to overcome opposition attempts to delay legislation.",
      "And on Wednesday, Republicans in the Senate selected John Thune as their majority leader over Florida's Rick Scott, the clear favourite in the Trump camp, in a sign some lawmakers may be reasserting their independence (Trump did not officially endorse Scott).",
      "That said, a trifecta, if astutely managed, does open the way for the possibility of major legislative initiatives.",
      "Trump's power advantage could be key in pushing through his big promises such as the largest deportation of migrants in history, sweeping tariffs on foreign imports, and the rolling back of environmental protections.",
      "Using legislation to achieve these ends will make such plans much harder to overturn in the courts - something Donald Trump was plagued by in his first term when he extensively used executive orders that were regularly and often successfully challenged.",
      "The judicial landscape also has changed in Trump's favour.",
      "The signature achievement of his first term was putting three conservatives on the Supreme Court - cementing a two-thirds majority for possibly decades to come.",
      "He also named more than four dozen judges to the federal appeals courts, flipping several circuits to a more conservative bent.",
      "The majority Republicans have in the Senate also provides a key advantage.",
      "Trump will be able to get his nominees for administration posts approved more easily, something he struggled with back in 2017 when internal resistance to him in the Republican Party was still significant.",
      "All this bodes for a busy and possibly turbulent next two years. But, as recent history indicates, these trifectas don't last all that long. The incoming administration will want to get a move on.",

      "After the hearing, the committee votes on the nomination. If it approves the candidate, the full Senate then votes on the nominee.",
      "Historically, the upper chamber has approved cabinet positions quickly - sometimes with little or no debate.

      "It is also supposed to be a temporary appointment and expires at the end of a congressional session - at most, one year.",
      "Some past presidents have employed the method liberally, often as a way of circumventing political divides that would slow nominations.",

    "story": [
      "Billionaire Elon Musk has been tasked with leading incoming President Donald Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).",
      "In a statement on social media, the US president-elect said Musk - along with former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy - would \"dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure federal agencies\".",
      "It is a role that the tech entrepreneur has arguably prepared for through his business leadership, and one he has spent months pushing for.",
      "But it is also one that is expected to garner him influence over government policy - and the regulatory environment facing his enterprises.",

      "What top team picks tell us about Trump 2.0",
      "Will Trump be sentenced over hush money case?",
      "Second-term priorities take shape",
      "Musk told a Trump rally in October that he believed the US government's budget could be cut by \"at least\" $2tn from about $6.5tn. He has also frequently suggested the number of government employees could be significantly reduced.",
      "Ramaswamy, meanwhile, has put forward plans to scrap a number of federal departments including the Department of Education, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Internal Revenue Service and the FBI.",
      "Railing against regulation",
      "Musk has cast his plans to optimise government efficiency in heroic terms, pointing to his hopes of one day colonising Mars, while arguing that the feat would only be possible \"so long as it is not smothered by bureaucracy\".",
      "At the time, he said creating the new Doge was \"the only path to extending life beyond Earth\".",
      "Any major cuts to government agencies could also have potentially significant implications for his business interests, which are closely entwined with the government.",
      "Rocket firm SpaceX alone has more than $8bn-worth of ongoing contracts with the US government, according to public contracting sites, and could stand to benefit further from closer government ties.",
      "Meanwhile, his electric car company Tesla is facing investigations from numerous government agencies over issues such as the safety of its self-driving features. His desire to cut regulation could affect such probes.",
      "In recent years, Musk has repeatedly accused regulators of launching trivial probes and standing in the way of his companies.",
      "In September he threatened to sue the Federal Aviation Administration over its plans to fine his SpaceX company $633,000 for alleged licence infringements related to some of its rocket launches from Cape Canaveral in Florida. He accused the agency of \"regulatory overreach\".",
      "Musk \"stands to benefit personally from a lot of the deregulation that he touts,\" says Christopher Phelps, a professor of modern US political history, adding: \"I think putting someone who is a billionaire and runs major corporations in charge of a federal project of deregulation is innately full of conflicts of interest.\"",
      "Others said Musk, who has long described himself as having a libertarian bent, appeared to be a true believer in the benefits of smaller government.",
      "\"There\u2019s no doubt that Musk has significant vested interests in the US regulatory landscape as a result of his many business enterprises,\" says Thomas Gift, a political science professor and director of the Centre on US Politics at University College London.",
      "\"At the same time, it\u2019s hard to make the case that this is the only impetus driving him.",
      "\"Musk has undertaken huge personal and political risks in coming out for Trump, and many of his activities and rhetoric seem to reflect an individual ideologically committed to causes he believes in.\"",
      "\"Clearly he has got skin in the game and there\u2019s a self-interest, but equally you can have a sincere belief that there is too much government regulation and too much government bureaucracy,\" says Alex Waddan, a professor of US politics at the University of Leicester.",
      "Reward for loyalty",
      "For years, Musk did not play a big role in politics, despite his large fortune, now worth more than $300bn, according to Forbes estimates.",
      "But he spoke out against the pandemic lockdowns of 2020. His criticism of the Biden administration mounted after the White House did not invite Tesla to an electric car summit in 2021.",
      "He formally endorsed Trump this year after an assassination attempt, ultimately donating more than $100m (\u00a379m) to Trump's 2024 presidential campaign and appearing at numerous rallies.",
      "Prof Phelps describes Musk's relationship with Trump as \"transactional\", adding that the new role \"gives him a lot of symbolic clout - and possibly the clout to get the things that matter most to him done\".",
      "As the South African-born billionaire is not a US citizen by birth, Musk cannot become president - something that has frustrated other famous faces who became involved in politics in the past.",
      "But he can have an influence on US policy, and Trump will have a sympathetic adviser to call upon.",
      "\"Trump is looking to surround himself with loyalists in his new administration, and there\u2019s no-one who\u2019s been more loyal than Musk since he announced his endorsement for Trump,\" says Prof Gift.",
      "\"Not only did Musk go 'all in' in supporting Trump personally and financially during the campaign, but he\u2019s also evolved into a trusted adviser on topics as diverse as technology policy to the war in Ukraine.\"",
      "In an early sign of the influence the tech entrepreneur may be rewarded with for his loyalty, Musk was party to a call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky following the election. The war in Ukraine will be a major foreign policy concern when Trump takes office.",
      "\"That is actually quite extraordinary,\" says Prof Waddan. \"Normally, even your biggest donors wouldn\u2019t get that kind of access.\"",
      "What is the Department of Government Efficiency?",
      "Musk first raised the idea of a cost-cutting effort while hosting Trump on X this summer. The official name is a winking reference to a meme featuring a Shiba Inu dog, which then gave its name to the cryptocurrency Dogecoin, a favourite of Musk that has seen its value soar since the election.",
      "Prof Phelps says the name is \"a nod to crypto deregulation being part of what they\u2019ll do\".",
      "But it is not clear how much of Musk's talk of cutting might actually become reality.",
      "For one thing, the new department will not have an official role, but provide \"advice and guidance from outside government\", according to the announcement.",
      "Experts have also warned that cuts of the scale discussed could be enormously disruptive - and face pushback in Congress - depending on how rapidly they are implemented.",
      "Musk himself acknowledged the risks, saying Americans should be ready to stomach temporary hardship for long-run gain.",
      "The way he has run his own firms may hint at what Americans can expect.",
      "After his October 2022 takeover of the social media platform Twitter - which he branded as X - Musk introduced radical changes, including the reduction X's workforce from around 8,000 to 1,500 in a matter of weeks.",
      "\"His idea of efficiency was to let a lot of people go,\" says Alex Waddan, a professor of US politics at the University of Leicester.",
      "Musk also loosened content moderation, stopped verifying accounts and welcomed users back to the platform who had been banned for violating its rules on hate speech and disinformation.",
      "Among the users he reinstated was Trump, who had been banned following the Capitol riot in January 2021 after continuing to claim the 2020 election had been rigged against him.",
      "Critics argue his changes have given prominence to hate-speech and misinformation - though Musk maintains the site is politically neutral.",
      "The overhaul also prompted an exodus of advertisers - the main way the site has made money. Though Musk has introduced new ways to raise revenue, such as paid subscriptions, the company today is worth far less than the $44bn Musk paid for it just two years ago.",
      "His record at his other big companies - Tesla and SpaceX - is stronger.",
      "Among car companies, Tesla stands out for making electric vehicles at a large profit, thanks in part to streamlined operations. His rocket firm SpaceX is credited with enabling rocket launches at significantly lower cost.",
      "\"As a serial entrepreneur, Musk has been relentless in trying to improve institutional efficiency at his own enterprises,\" Prof Gift says.",
      "He adds that though Musk's primary role will be \"slashing through the thicket of red tape that is the US federal government\", his position will also give him influence in the new administration.",
      "\"While his role in the Department of Government Efficiency will be a more informal one, there\u2019s no doubt that he\u2019s got Trump's ear - at least for the moment.\"",

      "A week after Donald Trump won a second-term in the White House, the contours of his new presidency have started taking shape.",
      "The president-elect has announced nearly a dozen appointees, the first steps toward filling out his White House staff and key government departments. He also made comments to the media and on social media that highlight what his priorities will be upon taking office in January, with a special focus on immigration and foreign policy.",
      "After a sometimes chaotic start to his first term, Trump is laying the groundwork for his next administration with a more clearly defined plan - and personnel ready to enact it.",

      "A hard-line immigration team in place",
      "Some of Trump\u2019s newly revealed appointments suggest that the president-elect\u2019s campaign promise to deport millions of undocumented migrants living in the US is no exaggeration.",
      "Stephen Miller, who has been Trump\u2019s close adviser and speechwriter since 2015, is Trump\u2019s choice for White House deputy chief of staff for policy.  He will likely shape any plans for mass deportations - and pare back both undocumented and legal immigration. During Trump's first term, Miller was involved in developing some of the administration's strictest immigration policies.",
      "Thomas Homan, acting director of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency in Trump\u2019s first term, supported the president\u2019s policy of separating undocumented families detained at the US-Mexico border. Now he\u2019s back with an even broader portfolio, as Trump\u2019s \u201cimmigration tsar\u201d.",
      "\u201cI will run the biggest deportation force this country has ever seen,\u201d Homan said at a conservative conference in July.",
      "Critics have warned that Trump\u2019s mass deportation plan could cost upwards of $300bn. In an interview with NBC News last week, however, the president-elect said cost was not an issue.",
      "\u201cWhen people have killed and murdered, when drug lords have destroyed countries, and now they\u2019re going to go back to those countries because they\u2019re not staying here,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no price tag.\u201d",

      "How would Trump\u2019s promise of mass deportations of migrants work?",
      "China hawks take flight",
      "Many conservatives believe that China poses the single greatest threat to continued US global dominance, both economically and militarily. While Trump has been more circumspect, limiting most of his China critiques to the realm of trade, he is filling his foreign policy team with vocal China critics.",
      "The president-elect picked Florida Congressman Mike Waltz, a retired Army colonel, as his national security adviser \u2013 a key foreign policy post within the White House. Waltz has said the US is in a \u201ccold war\u201d with China and was one of the first members of Congress to call for a US boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.",
      "In October, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, Trump\u2019s pick for US ambassador to the UN, accused China of \u201cblatant and malicious election interference\u201d amid reports that China-backed hackers attempted to gather information from the former president\u2019s phones.",
      "While Trump has yet to officially name his choice for secretary of state, Florida Senator Marco Rubio \u2013 another China hawk \u2013 appears to be the leading contender for the top diplomatic job. In 2020, Rubio was sanctioned by the Chinese government after he pushed measures to punish the nation for its crackdown on pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong.",
      "US-China relations were often rocky during Trump's first term, amidst trade disputes and the Covid pandemic. The Biden administration, which kept many of Trump's China tariffs and imposed some new ones, only somewhat calmed the waters. Now it looks like the next Trump administration will pick up where the last one left off.",

      "Musk's new role",
      "While the list of Trump\u2019s political appointees grows, there\u2019s another group that stays small \u2013 and exceedingly influential.",
      "Elon Musk, the wealthiest man in the world, has been a full-time presence at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago transition headquarters. According to media reports, he is advising the president-elect on cabinet nominees and even joined a conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week.",
      "On Tuesday night, Trump announced that he was assigning Musk to work with tech entrepreneur and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy in a \"department of government efficiency\" tasked with identifying new budget cuts.",
      "Musk has regularly offered his political opinions on his social media platform X, including endorsing Florida Senator Rick Scott\u2019s bid to be the next Senate majority leader.",
      "Musk\u2019s political action committee spent around $200m to help Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, and he promises to continue to fund the group\u2019s efforts to advance the president-elect\u2019s agenda and help Republican candidates in upcoming congressional elections.",
      "Meanwhile, it remains to be seen where Robert F Kennedy Jr, another key figure, lands. Trump has said that he plans to give the former Democrat and vaccine sceptic, who abandoned his independent bid and endorsed the Republican, a role in making America \u201chealthy\u201d again.",
      "\u201cHe wants to do some things, and we\u2019re going to let him go to it,\u201d Trump said in his election victory speech.",
      "Prioritising presidential power over Congress",
      "As Trump takes office, Republicans have control of the Senate and could still take the House, albeit by a slim margin. However, the president-elect\u2019s early actions suggest he is more concerned with exercising his presidential power than working with the legislative branch.",
      "Last week, he posted on social media that the Senate\u2019s Republican leadership should smooth the way for more presidential \u201crecess appointments\u201d \u2013 allowing him to fill top administration jobs without Senate approval when Congress is not in session. The move would strengthen presidential power by undercutting the chamber\u2019s constitutional role to \u201cadvise and consent\u201d on political appointees.",
      "Meanwhile, the president-elect keeps chipping away at those narrow congressional majorities. Senators who move to administration roles can quickly be replaced by appointment from the governor of their home state. But any House vacancies \u2013 such as ones created by Stefanik and Waltz\u2019s departures \u2013 require special elections that can take months to schedule.",
      "Some of Trump\u2019s advisers, including Musk, have warned that the president-elect could be endangering his legislative agenda if he plucks too many more Republicans from the chambers.",
      "Even in the best of circumstances, congressional legislation takes time, effort and compromise. Executive action, such as new immigration enforcement, can be done with the stroke of a presidential pen.",
      "Trump\u2019s actions indicate he is, at least at the moment, more focused on the latter.",
      "Rewarding loyalists",
      "Trump has only just begun filling out the thousands of jobs that open up with a new presidential administration, not including the senior-level career bureaucrats he has said he will replace.",
      "In 2016, as a political newcomer, he had to rely on more establishment Republicans for key roles. This time, he has a wealth of prospective candidates with proven track records of supporting him and after eight years, Trump loyalists are the Republican establishment.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump named South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem as homeland security secretary, and Fox News host and conservative author Pete Hegseth as defence secretary.",
      "The latter has been particularly controversial, given his lack of experience navigating the sprawling US military bureaucracy and penchant for inflammatory remarks. For Trump, however, status as an outsider and a willingness to lean into hot-button cultural issues are a strength, not a flaw.",
      "And above all else, Hegseth and Noem have been fierce Trump defenders from the start.",
      "Some of Trump\u2019s other picks, like Rubio and Stefanik, were critics of Trump early in his first presidential bid, but they have now spent years demonstrating that their harsh words are a thing of the past.",
      "Rubio, who ran for president against Trump in 2016, may still have White House ambitions, however. Trump often soured on appointees who seemed drawn to the limelight during his first term, and even the warmest of relationships could go bad.",

Instead, they were convicted of seditious conspiracy and other felonies for organising the melee.",

      "With some states still tabulating their results, Trump currently has improved on his electoral margins in at least 2,367 US counties, while slipping in just 240.",
      "It wasn\u2019t just the number of counties that Trump won that made a difference, either. Kamala Harris needed to post significant margins in the cities to offset Republican strength in rural areas. She consistently fell short.",
      "In Detroit\u2019s Wayne County, for example, which the latest US Census reports is 38% black, Harris won 63% of the vote \u2013 significantly lower than Joe Biden\u2019s 68% in 2020 and Obama\u2019s 74% in 2008.",
      "Polls consistently suggested that the economy, along with immigration, were the two issues of highest importance to voters - and where polls indicated Trump had an advantage over Harris.",
      "His economic message cut across racial divides.",
      "\u201cWe're just sick of hearing about identity politics,\" said Nicole Williams, a white bartender with a black husband and biracial children in Las Vegas, Nevada \u2013 one of the key battleground states that Trump flipped this year.",
      "\u201cWe're just American, and we just want what's best for Americans,\" she said.",
      "The Democratic blame game begins",
      "Democrats are already engaged in considerable soul-searching, as they come to grips with an election defeat that has delivered the White House, the Senate and, perhaps, the House of Representatives to Republican control.",
      "Various elements within the party are offering their own, often conflicting, advice on the best path from the wilderness back to power.",
      "Left-wing Senator Bernie Sanders, who twice ran for the Democratic presidential nomination, also criticised identity politics and accused the party of abandoning working-class voters.",
      "Some centrist Democrats, meanwhile, have argued that the struggle to connect with voters goes beyond the economy and immigration. They point to how the Trump campaign was also able to use a cultural message as a wedge to fracture the Democratic coalition.",
      "Pelosi blames Biden for election loss as finger pointing intensifies",
      "Who's in the frame to join Trump's new top team?",
      "Among the positions that Republicans targeted in this year\u2019s election were calls to shift funding away from law enforcement, decriminalise undocumented border-crossings and minor crimes like shoplifting, and provide greater protections for transgender Americans.",
      "Many arose after the murder of George Floyd in 2020 and the resulting rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, as well as other efforts to advance social justice and acknowledge darker parts of American history.",
      "Within a few years, however, some of those positions proved a liability for Democrats when trying to win over persuadable voters and keep their coalition from fraying. Harris, for example, backed away from some positions she\u2019d taken when she first ran for president in 2019.",
      "In the last month of the presidential campaign, the Trump team made the vice-president\u2019s past support for taxpayer-funded gender transition surgeries for federal prisoners and detained immigrants a central focus.",
      "One advert ended with the line: \u201cKamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.\u201d",
      "The Trump campaign spent more than $21m on transgender issue ads in the first half of October \u2013 about a third of their entire advertising expenditures and nearly double what they spent on spots on immigration and inflation, according to data compiled by AdImpact.",
      "It\u2019s the kind of investment a campaign makes if it has hard data showing an advert is moving public opinion.",
      "After Trump\u2019s convincing win, Congressman Seth Moulton, a moderate from Massachusetts, said his party needed to rethink its approach on cultural issues.",
      "\u201cDemocrats spend way too much time trying not to offend anyone rather than being brutally honest about the challenges many Americans face,\u201d Moulton told the New York Times. \u201cI have two little girls, I don\u2019t want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete, but as a Democrat I\u2019m supposed to be afraid to say that.\u201d",
      "Progressive Democrats, meanwhile, reject that characterisation, and argue that standing up for the rights of minorities has always been a core value of the party. Congressman John Moran wrote on X in response: \"You should find another job if you want to use an election loss as an opportunity to pick on our most vulnerable.\u201d",
      "Mike Madrid, the political strategist, has a brutal assessment of where the Democratic coalition is today.",
      "\u201cThe Democratic Party was predicated on what really is an unholy alliance between working-class people of colour and wealthier white progressives driven and animated by cultural issues,\u201d Madrid said. \u201cThe only glue holding that coalition together was anti-Republicanism.\u201d",
      "Once that glue came unstuck, he said, the party was ripe for defeat.",
      "Future elections are sure to be held in a friendlier political environment for Democrats. And Trump, who has shown a unique ability to attract new and low-propensity voters to the polls, has run his last campaign.",
      "But 2024\u2019s results will provide plenty of fuel for Democratic angst in the days to come.",
      "The Harris campaign itself believes she lost to Trump because she was facing a restive public angry over the economic and social turbulence in the aftermath of the Covid pandemic.",
      "\u201cYou stared down unprecedented headwinds and obstacles that were largely out of our control,\u201d campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon wrote in a letter to her staff. \u201cThe whole country moved to the right, but compared to the rest of the country, the battleground states saw the least amount of movement in his direction. It was closest in the places we competed.\u201d",
      "Moses Santana, a Puerto Rican living in Philadelphia, is from a demographic which seemed reliably Democratic a decade or so ago. But when he spoke to the BBC this week, he was not so convinced the Democrats had delivered when in power - or that their message today connected with Americans like him.",
      "\u201cYou know, Joe Biden promised a lot of progressive things, like he was going to cancel student debt, he was going to help people get their citizenship,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd none of that happened. Donald Trump is bringing [people] something new.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Forty years after they began the task \u2013 and nearly four hundred years after receiving their first commission \u2013 sages in Paris have finally produced a new edition of the definitive French dictionary.",
      "The full ninth edition of the Dictionnaire de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise was formally presented to President Macron this afternoon in the plush surroundings of the 17th century Coll\u00e8ge des Quatre-Nations on the left bank of the Seine.",
      "This is where the 40 wise men and women of the French Academy \u2013 so-called immortels (immortals) chosen for their contributions to French language and literature \u2013 have met since the body was first created by Cardinal Richelieu in 1635.",
      "Their task at the start was to \u201cgive certain rules to our language, to render it pure and eloquent\u201d \u2013 to which end they set about writing their first dictionary.",
      "However, the job has proved so slow \u2013 the first book was not produced until 1694 and today it takes more than a year to get through a single letter of the alphabet \u2013 that the relevance of the enterprise is increasingly in question.",
      "\u201cThe effort is praiseworthy, but so excessively tardy that it is perfectly useless,\u201d a collective of linguists wrote in the Liberation newspaper on Thursday.",
      "This ninth edition replaces the eighth, which was completed in 1935.  Work started in 1986, and three previous sections \u2013 up to the letter R \u2013 have already been issued.",
      "Today the end section (last entry Zzz) has been added, meaning the work is complete.",

      "But many of the \u201cmodern\u201d words added in the 1980s or 90s are already out of date.  And such is the pace of linguistic change, many words in current use today are too new to make it in.",
      "Thus common words like tiktokeur, vlog, smartphone and \u00e9moji \u2013 which are all in the latest commercial dictionaries \u2013 do not exist in the Acad\u00e9mie book.  Conversely its \u201cnew\u201d words include such go-ahead concepts as soda, sauna, yuppie and sup\u00e9rette (mini-supermarket).",
      "For the latest R-Z section, the writers have included the new thinking on the feminisation of jobs, including female alternatives (which did not exist before) for positions such as ambassadeur and professeur. However print versions of the earlier sections do not have the change, because for many years the Acad\u00e9mie fought a rear-guard action against it.",
      "Likewise the third section of the new dictionary \u2013 including the letter M \u2013 defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman, which in France it no longer is.",

      "Among the \u201cimmortals\u201d is the English poet and French expert Michael Edwards, who told Le Figaro newspaper how he tried to get the Academy to revive the long-forgotten word improfond (undeep).",

    "published": "Wed, 13 Nov 2024 03:55:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Before Tupac's murder, producer Quincy Jones brought stars together to try to end violence in hip-hop.",
    "story": [
      "Before the east and west coast rap beef of the 1990s boiled over with the murders of Tupac Shakur and Notorious BIG, legendary producer Quincy Jones called a secret meeting at which he appealed for an end to the violence.",
      "As hip-hop rose from the streets to the mainstream in the 90s, the rappers and hustlers that broke through had few role models who had trodden that path before them.",
      "There was one man, though, who had been there, and done pretty much everything.",
      "Quincy Jones had been in gangs and had been stabbed at the age of seven in 1930s Chicago, before becoming a major force in American music thanks to his work with legends like Ray Charles, Frank Sinatra and Michael Jackson.",
      "He was at the heart of revolutions in jazz, swing, soul, funk, disco and pop - but one aspect of his career that got less attention when he died last week at the age of 91 was his place in hip-hop.",
      "Jones was revered in all corners of music, including rap. Unlike most in the old guard and the media, he immediately realised the scene's artistic and cultural importance.",
      "Hip-hop reminded him of the bebop jazz of his youth. \"I feel a kinship there because we went through a lot of the same stuff,\" he said.",
      "\"Quincy understood it and got it right away,\" says pioneering artist, rapper and presenter Fab 5 Freddy.",
      "Jones worked with leading rappers in the 80s, and in the 90s he recognised risks including a volatile rivalry that had begun to erupt between competing labels and stars.",
      "So he brought artists, executives and elder black American statesmen together for a secret summit in 1995, hoping it would be a turning point.",
      "The east coast was hip-hop's spiritual home. In 1992, Sean Combs - then known as Puffy and later as P Diddy - launched his Bad Boy record label in New York with artists including Notorious BIG, aka Biggie Smalls.",
      "Meanwhile, across America, Los Angeles was coming into its own as the capital of gangsta rap, led by menacing mogul Suge Knight's Death Row Records, which had Dr Dre and Tupac.",
      "In 1994, Tupac was shot and injured during a robbery in the lobby of a studio. He later implied that his former friend Biggie may have known about the attack in advance. Biggie then released the track Who Shot Ya?, which Tupac thought was about him.",
      "The beef continued at the Source magazine awards on 3 August 1995, when Knight goaded Combs and Bad Boy Records from the stage.",
      "Jones, who had his own magazine, Vibe, held his summit three weeks later.",
      "Quincy Jones: From 'street rat' to music mastermind",
      "Quincy Jones: His brilliance explained in 10 songs",
      "'He changed my life': Stars remember Quincy Jones",
      "The brewing east-west beef wasn't the only reason Jones called it - it was mainly intended to discuss the state of hip-hop and let the new generation hear life and business advice from a group of highly successful black executives.",
      "But rap's negative image and the burgeoning tensions were a big talking point.",
      "\"He knew this was a bubbling issue, and so his idea was to bring together a symposium,\" says Fab 5 Freddy, who was hosting Yo! MTV Raps at the time and was the event's moderator.",
      "Jones told the summit: \"The thing that really provoked me to say it's time to pay attention now is Tupac.\"",
      "Tupac was missing, however - he was in jail for sexual assault at the time. Suge and Dre were there, as were Combs and Biggie.",
      "Jones had already experienced his own beef with Tupac - the rapper criticised the producer in a 1993 edition of Source for marrying white women.",
      "\"We finally hooked up, even though it was tension conditions in the beginning,\" Jones said at the event.",
      "\"We finally talked to each other, and he said nobody had talked to him like that before.",
      "\"And I said, I can't take it any more. Because we can no longer afford to be non-political, and I'm talking to the hip-hop nation now.\"",
      "About 50 influential artists and executives were in the room, including Public Enemy's Chuck D, members of A Tribe Called Quest, MC Lyte, Kris Kross, Jermaine Dupri and Boyz n the Hood film-maker John Singleton.",
      "Jones wrote in his now-out-of-print 2001 autobiography: \"I had been concerned about the potentially volatile diversity of a group who'd never been in the same room together.\"",
      "They were joined by veteran executives Clarence Avant and Ahmet Ertegun, plus Colin Powell, the former national security adviser and head of the US military who would go on to become the first African-American secretary of state.",
      "Powell had presidential ambitions - that was why the summit was held in secret. Jones wanted to save Powell from being associated with the negative publicity that surrounded rap music.",
      "He switched venues at the last minute to throw press off the scent, and confiscated the recordings.",
      "\"Rest assured that my discretion is based on a deep respect for you and a valued friendship,\" Jones wrote to Powell in an unpublished letter held at Indianapolis University Library.",
      "\"I know that we are going to make a difference at this conference. Thanks for the way you handled the situation. Maybe we can turn the battleship an inch or two.\"",
      "Jones later wrote in his book: \"Some of the younger rappers didn't even know who he was. When addressing some of the more confrontational comments from the floor, Powell maintained his South Bronx demeanour and authoritative cool throughout.\"",
      "Fab 5 Freddy remembers one exchange between Powell and Knight. \"There was an encounter where he [Knight] had something to say, and Colin Powell responded.",
      "\"Here you have this guy who was a four-star general talking to Suge Knight, and he pretty much put Suge in his place.\"",
      "Jones finally released a clip of the event for a 2018 Netflix documentary about his life.",
      "\"We've got to seriously talk about what you are going to deal with,\" he is seen telling the assembled attendees.",
      "\"They are not playing, there's real bullets out there, believe me. Maybe literally and figuratively.",
      "\"It's a very emotional thing,\" he added, his voice cracking. \"I want to see you guys live to at least my age.\"",
      "\"Quincy did get emotional,\" Fab 5 Freddy recalls, \"because he sensed what could happen.",
      "\"And the worst, unfortunately, did happen.\"",
      "Who was Tupac Shakur?",
      "Ex-gang leader pleads not guilty to Tupac murder",
      "Diddy accused of 'revenge' rape over Tupac claims",
      "Jones had ended up reconciling with Tupac. After Tupac's 1993 comments, Jones's 17-year-old daughter Rashida - who would go on to star in US sitcom The Office - wrote an irate letter to Source attacking the rapper.",
      "When Tupac bumped into one of Jones's other daughters, Kidada, he apologised, thinking she was Rashida. But Tupac and Kidada hit it off and began a relationship.",
      "\"Though we got off to a rocky start, as I came to know and feel him I saw his enormous potential and sensitivity as an artist and as a human being,\" Quincy Jones wrote.",
      "There have also been claims that Tupac was planning to leave Death Row for Jones's record label.",
      "But in September 1996, a year after the summit, Tupac was shot and killed.",
      "A former gang leader, Duane \"Keffe D\" Davis, was charged with his murder last year. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Then in 1997, Notorious BIG was shot dead outside a party thrown by Jones's record label and magazine. No-one has ever been charged.",
      "Meanwhile, today Knight is in prison for a hit-and-run, while Combs is awaiting trial on charges of racketeering and sex trafficking, which he denies.",
      "The violence in the 90s \"wasn't necessary\" and was caused by \"wannabes and gang-related troublemakers\" on the edges of the music industry, according to Fab 5 Freddy.",
      "\"Also, the east/west coast beef was mainly ignited by jealousy. It was an ashtray fire fanned into a big deal by media outlets that led to Biggie and Tupac getting killed.\"",
      "Despite his stature, not even Jones could alter the forces of power and pride that were at work and prevent the bloodshed.",
      "Freddy believes some lessons were learned at the summit, however, and that it deserves a place in hip-hop history.",
      "\"It was incredible and electric to be in that room.",
      "\"It was a thrilling moment. And then it became even more legendary because it was never released, so the only people that really knew about it were the people that were there.\""

    "story": [
      "The mystery as to why a beluga whale appeared off the coast of Norway wearing a harness may finally have been solved.",
      "The tame white whale, which locals named Hvaldimir, made headlines five years ago amidst widespread speculation that it was a Russian spy.",
      "Now an expert in the species says she believes the whale did indeed belong to the military and escaped from a naval base in the Arctic Circle.",
      "But Dr Olga Shpak does not believe it was a spy. She believes the beluga was being trained to guard the base and fled because it was a \"hooligan\".",
      "Seeking sanctuary for whale dubbed a Russian spy",
      "Russia has always refused to confirm or deny that the beluga whale was trained by its military.",
      "But Dr Shpak, who worked in Russia researching marine mammals from the 1990s until she returned to her native Ukraine in 2022, told BBC News: \u201cFor me it\u2019s 100% (certain).\u201d",
      "Dr Shpak, whose account is based on conversations with friends and former colleagues, features in a BBC documentary, Secrets of the Spy Whale, which is now on BBC iPlayer and being shown on BBC Two on Wednesday at 21:00 GMT.",
      "Secrets of the Spy Whale",
      "The mysterious whale first came to public attention five years ago when it approached fishermen off the northern coast of Norway.",
      "\u201cThe whale starts rubbing against the boat,\u201d Joar Hesten, one of the fishermen, says. \u201cI heard about animals in distress that instinctively knew that they need help from humans. I was thinking that this is one smart whale.\u201d",
      "The sighting was unusual because the beluga was so tame and they're rarely seen as far south. It was also wearing a harness, which had a mount for a camera, and bore the words, in English, \u201cEquipment St Petersburg\u201d.",
      "Mr Hesten helped to remove the harness from the whale, which then swam to the nearby port of Hammerfest, where it lived for several months.",
      "Seemingly unable to catch live fish to eat, it charmed visitors by nudging at their cameras and even on one occasion returning a mobile phone.",
      "\u201cIt was very obvious that this particular whale had been conditioned to be putting his nose on anything that looked like a target because he was doing it each time,\u201d says Eve Jourdain, a researcher from the Norwegian Orca Survey.",
      "\u201cBut we have no idea what kind of facility he was in, so we don\u2019t know what he was trained for.\u201d",
      "Captivated by the whale's story Norway made arrangements for the beluga to be monitored and fed. The name it was given \u2013 Hvaldimir - is a nod to hval which is Norwegian for whale, and the name of Russia's President, Vladimir Putin.",
      "Dr Shpak did not want to name her sources in Russia for their own safety but said she had been told that when the beluga surfaced in Norway, the Russian marine mammal community immediately identified it as one of theirs.",
      "\u201cThrough the chain of vets and trainers the message came back \u2013 that they were missing a beluga called Andruha,\u201d she says.",
      "According to Dr Shpak, Andruha/Hvaldimir had first been captured in 2013 in the Sea of Okhotsk in Russia's Far East. A year later it was moved from a facility owned by a dolphinarium in St Petersburg to the military programme in the Russian Arctic, where his trainers and vets remained in contact.",
      "\u201cI believe that when they started to work in open water, trusting this animal (not to swim away), the animal just gave up on them,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cWhat I've heard from the guys at the commercial dolphinarium who used to have him was that Andruha was smart, so a good choice to be trained. But at the same time, he was kind of like a hooligan - an active beluga - so they were not surprised that he gave up on (following) the boat and went where he wanted to.\u201d",
      "Satellite images from near the Russian naval base in Murmansk show what could have been Hvaldimir/Andruha\u2019s old home. Pens can clearly be seen in the water with what appear to be white whales inside.",
      "\u201cThe location of the beluga whales very close to the submarines and the surface vessels might tell us that they are actually part of a guarding system,\u201d says Thomas Nilsen, from Norwegian online newspaper The Barents Observer.",
      "Russia, for its part, has never officially addressed the claim that Hvaldimir/Andruha was trained by its army. But it does have a long history of training marine mammals for military purposes.",
      "Speaking in 2019, a Russian reserve colonel, Viktor Baranets, said: \"If we were using this animal for spying, do you really think we'd attach a mobile phone number with the message 'Please call this number'?\"",
      "Sadly, Hvaldimir/Andruha\u2019s incredible story does not have a happy ending.",
      "Having learned to feed himself, it spent several years travelling south along Norway\u2019s coast and in May 2023 was even spotted off the coast of Sweden.",
      "Then on September 1 2024 its body was found floating at sea, near the town of Risavika, on Norway's south-western coast.",
      "Had the long arm of Putin\u2019s Russia caught up with the reluctant beluga?",
      "It appears not. Despite some activist groups suggesting that the whale had been shot, that explanation has been dismissed by the Norwegian police.",
      "They say there was nothing to suggest that human activity directly caused the beluga\u2019s death. A post-mortem examination revealed that Hvaldimir/Andruha died after a stick became lodged in his mouth."

      "Now, Republicans have officially taken control of Congress and his \"promises\" are a whole lot easier to keep.",
      "In Washington political parlance, it's called \"a governing trifecta\", when the president's party also controls both chambers of Congress - the House of Representatives and the Senate.",
      "That control is what Donald Trump's Republican Party now has.",
      "Single-party control was once common, but in recent decades it has become rarer and shorter.  Often, the party in power loses seats when midterm congressional elections roll around two years later.",
      "Both Trump and Joe Biden enjoyed trifectas for their first two years in the White House, but they also saw that having such control is no guarantee a president can get their way.",

      "In his first two years, Trump passed a signature tax bill - reducing corporate taxes from 35% to 21%, and cutting some taxes on individuals.",
      "But with some members of his own party resistant to his surprise ascent to the top in 2016, he struggled with other aims.",
      "His plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act (known as Obamacare) failed when a senator from his own party, John McCain, refused to vote for it. He also failed to pass an infrastructure bill as he had promised.",
      "In his first two years, when the Democrats controlled the House and the Senate, Biden succeeded in passing the American Rescue plan, the Investment and Jobs Act, and the Chips and Science Act. But he, too, had to significantly scale back his spending and investment plans - touted as the Build Back Better package - after opposition from one of his own senators.",
      "A major impediment to total control for either party is that Senate bills require a three-fifths majority, or 60 votes, to bypass the filibuster, which enables senators to delay legislation by keeping debate open-ended. That means that when a party has a simple majority in the Senate, it needs to reach across the aisle to get a bill passed.",
      "Even with a healthy majority in the Senate this time around, Trump will not have the magic 60 seats that would allow him to overcome opposition attempts to delay legislation.",
      "And on Wednesday, Republicans in the Senate selected John Thune as their majority leader over Florida's Rick Scott, the clear favourite in the Trump camp, in a sign some lawmakers may be reasserting their independence (Trump did not officially endorse Scott).",
      "That said, a trifecta, if astutely managed, does open the way for the possibility of major legislative initiatives.",
      "Trump's power advantage could be key in pushing through his big promises such as the largest deportation of migrants in history, sweeping tariffs on foreign imports, and the rolling back of environmental protections.",
      "Using legislation to achieve these ends will make such plans much harder to overturn in the courts - something Donald Trump was plagued by in his first term when he extensively used executive orders that were regularly and often successfully challenged.",
      "The judicial landscape also has changed in Trump's favour.",
      "The signature achievement of his first term was putting three conservatives on the Supreme Court - cementing a two-thirds majority for possibly decades to come.",
      "He also named more than four dozen judges to the federal appeals courts, flipping several circuits to a more conservative bent.",
      "The majority Republicans have in the Senate also provides a key advantage.",
      "Trump will be able to get his nominees for administration posts approved more easily, something he struggled with back in 2017 when internal resistance to him in the Republican Party was still significant.",
      "All this bodes for a busy and possibly turbulent next two years. But, as recent history indicates, these trifectas don't last all that long. The incoming administration will want to get a move on.",

      "PREFACE",
      "Los Angeles, Summer 1956",
      "Staring at the television open-mouthed, I let my peanut butter and jelly sandwich drop onto the plate in my lap as chills ran up and down my body.",
      "Home alone after school, I was sitting cross-legged (my favorite position, still) on the floor in front of the TV enjoying the peace and quiet and watching my favorite show, American Bandstand. \"And now, ladies and gentlemen, Ray Charles,\" Dick Clark announced as the camera panned to a handsome man in sunglasses sitting at a piano.",
      "\"Georgia, Georgia . . . ,\" he began, and I burst into tears. I couldn't believe he was singing a song about my mom. As tears dripped onto my sandwich, I'd never felt more connected to anything in my life. Ray Charles's voice and the melody seemed to express exactly how I felt.",
      "It took me weeks to get over seeing him sing, and in some ways, I never did, but then someone whose songs I first heard on the radio blew a hole in my understanding of the world and I was never, ever the same. As I stared at the TV with my mom watching The Ed Sullivan Show, a popular young singer named Elvis Presley filled the screen. Mom and I were two of the sixty million Americans who witnessed that historic performance in September 1956.",
      "Even though Elvis was dressed quite traditionally that Sunday night, he looked and moved differently than any performer I'd ever seen. He began by singing \"Don't Be Cruel,\" and by the time he broke into \"Love Me Tender,\" I felt as if he was singing only to me. I wanted to jump right into the TV and be Elvis.",
      "When I heard a year later that he was giving a concert at the Pan-Pacific Auditorium in Los Angeles, I rushed home with stars in my eleven-year-old eyes. \"Mom, Mom! Elvis is going to be at the Pan-Pacific! Can we go? . . . Please?\" I was convinced that I had to be there. Secretly, I thought that he would spot me in the crowd and pick me, although I'm sure that's what every girl thought.",
      "Luckily for me, my thirty-one-year-old mother was as crazy about Elvis as I was, a fact that impressed my friends because their moms didn't approve of his raw sexuality. To this day I don't know where she found the money, but somehow Georgia did. Mom and I dressed up and made our way into town, more like sisters than mother and daughter. Feeling the tension grow the closer we got to the Fairfax District, we soon found ourselves caught up in a pulsing mob of nine thousand noisy girls.",
      "We were swept inside the auditorium on a wave of pure adrenaline. Our folding seats were about halfway back in the audience, but that was fine by me. Looking around at all the girls gazing in anticipation at the darkened stage, I could feel my heart pounding inside my flat little chest\u2014a sensation I was to become all too familiar with later in life.",
      "The stage was dark, but when the spotlights hit him, Elvis was there and he was magic. There was a roar from the crowd that was like nothing I had ever heard. An explosion of flashbulbs went off. I only wished I'd brought our little Kodak Brownie. Elvis was standing there in his famous gold suit, which was shimmering and changing color in the spotlights.",
      "He was so handsome with that amazing smile and lustrous black hair, exactly the same color as mine. Everyone around us jumped to their feet and started screaming so hysterically that we could hardly hear a word of \"Heartbreak Hotel.\" But, boy, we could see his moves\u2014the way he gyrated his hips and shook his legs so that they quivered. Not content with making as much noise as they could, the girls began jumping up onto their chairs for a better view, which meant that from then on, we could only see Elvis's head and shoulders.",
      "Being in the middle of that shrieking crowd was like being caught up in a massive swivel-hipped tidal wave, swept along with the hysteria toward the stage. I had no idea why everyone was acting so insane. I was too young to get that part of it, truthfully (but if I had been three years older and my mom had been three years younger, we would have fainted). It was the most exciting experience I'd ever had because I knew that I wanted to be on that stage in the spotlight one day too.",
      "When I looked over at my mother, she was down for the count. We were both mesmerized. She looked so beautiful dressed in some amazing outfit that of all the girls in the place, including me, I felt sure that Elvis would have picked her.",

      "The honorees rose to the top in voting by a panel of experts and the public from among 12 finalists. This year's field included: the party game Apples to Apples, balloons, \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" gamebooks, Hess Toy Trucks, Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game, remote-controlled vehicles, Sequence, the stick horse and trampoline.",
      "\"These are three very deserving toys that showcase the wide range of how people play,\" Christopher Bensch, vice president for collections and chief curator, said in a statement. \"But for My Little Pony in particular, this year is extra validating. The beloved toy was a finalist seven times before finally crossing the finish line!\"",
      "Hasbro's mini-horses, distinguishable by different \"cutie marks\" on their haunches, were introduced in the 1980s and reintroduced in 2003, outselling even Barbie for several years.",
      "The collectibles were recognized for encouraging fantasy and storytelling \u2014 the kind of creative play the Hall of Fame demands of inductees \u2014 along with popularity over time.",
      "\"The My Little Pony line has endured for decades because it combines several traditional forms of doll play with children's fascination with horses,\" said Michelle Parnett-Dwyer, curator of dolls and toys. \"The variety of figures promotes collecting as a pastime, too.\"",
      "Transformers",
      "Transformers came along in the 1980s, when Hasbro bought the rights to several existing Japanese toy lines featuring transforming robots. They were first marketed with a cartoon and have since graduated to a series of live-action films. Social media sites allow for debates over which figures are must-haves, as well as demonstrations of the sometimes complex process of manipulating them from robot to vehicle or other alternate form.",
      "Regular new Transformers characters keep collectors coming back, Bensch said, \"but the toys are also popular because they are so suited to the ways kids play. The toy line feeds kids' imaginations and fantasy play.\"",
      "Phase 10",
      "Also inducted was Phase 10, which was introduced by inventor and entrepreneur\u00a0Ken Johnson\u00a0in 1982. Today, Mattel sells 2 million decks of the card game annually in 30 countries and more than 20 languages. That makes it one of the bestselling card games in the world, according to the Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester, where the Toy Hall of Fame is housed.",
      "In the style of rummy, the game challenges players to collect groups of cards to complete 10 phases in sequential order before their opponents.",
      "\"Whether played in its original form or in one of its variations, Phase 10 has become an iconic game title that continues to encourage multigenerational social and competitive play,\" said Mirek Stolee, the museum's curator of board games and puzzles.",
      "Anyone can nominate a toy for the Hall of Fame. Museum staff narrows the field to 12 finalists each year. Fans can cast votes online for their favorites and their results are counted alongside ballots from a national advisory committee of historians, educators and others with industry expertise.",

    "published": "Sun, 10 Nov 2024 10:06:56 -0500",
    "summary": "The \"Cheers\" actor's new series is the Netflix comedy \"A Man on the Inside,\" in which he plays a retired widower-turned-investigator who goes undercover in a nursing home.",
    "story": [
      "Sitting down to talk about his new TV show, Ted Danson admits he is nervous. Why? \"Because I want people to see it, I really do,\" he said. \"I think it's an important conversation.\"",
      "It's strange to think of Danson as nervous about anything, but in this case, it's not hard to see why: his latest project means a lot to him, about a subject that touches everyone. In the new Netflix series \"A Man on the Inside,\" Danson is a recently-retired widower without much to do, until he answers an ad from a private investigator, and becomes a mole inside a nursing home.",
      "Like a lot of TV series, the premise seems a little far-fetched, but this one's true: it's based on \"The Mole Agent,\" a 2020 documentary about a real-life 83-year-old who goes undercover in a Chilean nursing home looking for signs of patients being mistreated. What the documentary found was a group of elderly people fighting loneliness and loss with heart and humor.",
      "\"A Man on the Inside\" is no different, says series creator Mike Schur. \"I would say the purpose of this show is simply to discuss a subject that very few people discuss, which is aging,\" said Schur. \"It's this subject that we just don't like to talk about. It's thought of in this country (I think more than other countries) as something almost shameful or embarrassing.\"",
      "\"If you're dying, you somehow made a mistake,\" said Danson.",
      "\"You screwed up! Yeah, you screwed up, you got old, you know?\" Schur said. \"And I think that's weird, because this is what happens if we're lucky. If we're lucky, we get old!\"",
      "At 76, Danson himself is aging gracefully, with an attitude inspired by a Hollywood legend: Jane Fonda. \"She was turning 80, and at 70 I was starting to go, 'Well, I'd better look for a nice place to land, you know, this life plane,' or whatever,\" he said. \"And I looked at her and it was like, no. She has her foot on the gas pedal! She's, like, doing a 12-hour day, shooting her show, jumping on a bus to go, you know, support the service industry in Sacramento with a handful of women.",
      "\"Don't slow down, just keep going, keep living your life. I think that's one of the things our elders can pass on to us. This is how you live life right up until the end.\"",
      "Seems like Danson's elders set a good example: his parents wouldn't allow a TV in their home. \"My mother didn't like them,\" he said. \"She'd rather you read, or go out and play, or be creative.\"",
      "But then, Danson got famous, on TV. \u00a0His parents finally got one. \"But they put kind of this beautiful tapestry over the front of it, so when you walked in their house, you didn't see a TV, you saw this beautiful tapestry with a candle on top, and they would take it off and watch 'Cheers,'\" he said.",
      "Danson still credits his success today to that one show about a Boston bar. But since he hung up his bartender apron in 1993, he's been in hit after hit. He was the title character in \"Becker.\" In \"Damages,\" he held his own with Glenn Close. He went to heaven and hell in \"The Good Place.\" And he's even played himself in \"Curb Your Enthusiasm.\"",
      "Along the way Danson has used his fame to draw attention to his passion project, Oceana, an organization dedicated to preserving the world's oceans. Asked if he feels they have made progress, he replied, \"Yes. I mean, our focus is fishing, over-fishing, making sure that the fisheries of the world are healthy. Because if done right, you could feed a billion people a fish meal every day.\"",
      "That sounds a little like a miracle \u2013 something he touches on in his new show, and something he says he lives with every day.",
      "Asked what are the miracles in his life, Danson replied, \"Mary Steenburgen is, you know, literally heaven-sent. I did some work on myself for about a year before I met her, after 'Cheers,' becoming emotionally mature and real. And I worked hard at it. And then along came Mary Steenburgen. \u2026 We are so blessed. To love somebody and to be loved, is just one of those heaven-on-earth miracles, you know? And that came with Mary.\"",
      "And the idea Ted Danson is hoping to share with his latest project is that miracles can be found in any life, right up until the very end. \"This is your life,\" he said, \"not just up to, you know, 65 and then you retire and are going down. No, you get to live right up until you don't live. And it's your life. It's such a gift. Explore it, and be excited about it. Yes, it hurts. Yes, it's sad. Yes, there's grief. Yes, there's all of that. But embrace it. Embrace it, is kind of what I think the message of the show is. It's what I hope I live with.\"",
      "He got emotional sharing that. \"I'm just emotional 'cause I finally said something I wanted to say!\" he laughed.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 10:11:06 -0500",
    "summary": "Allowing enhanced subsidies for health insurance bought through ACA marketplaces to expire would cause premiums to soar, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "With Republicans edging closer to gaining control of Congress, millions of Americans may be at risk of losing enhanced subsidies that currently underwrite the cost of health insurance bought through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces, according to industry experts and the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The November 5 election gave control of the Senate to Republicans, while control of the House remains in limbo Monday as votes in several critical races continue to be tallied. Currently, Democrats are projected to win at least 210 House seats and Republicans 215 seats, with a party needing 218 seats in order to have the majority.",
      "If Republicans gain control of Congress, they are widely expected to allow the enhanced ACA subsidies to expire at the end of 2025, depriving many people who buy coverage through the ACA and who currently receive these subsidies of that financial assistance, according to health care policy experts.",
      "So-called enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, which lower the cost of health plans for millions of Americans and were passed under the Biden administration, will expire unless lawmakers renew them. During his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump backed efforts by Republican lawmakers to repeal the ACA, but hasn't yet revealed his plans for the program, commonly known as Obamacare, for his second term in office.",
      "Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a campaign stop last week just before the Nov. 5 election that \"the ACA is so deeply ingrained, we need massive reform to make this work, and we've got a lot of ideas on how to do that.\"",
      "Who is eligible for enhanced ACA subsidies?",
      "Americans with incomes over 400% of poverty \u2014 those who make just above four times the poverty level, or $103,280 for a family of four \u2014 are eligible for the enhanced ACA insurance subsidies. They also increase financial help for those who were already eligible for assistance under the ACA.",
      "KFF, an independent health policy nonprofit, estimates\u00a0the subsidies have cut premiums for eligible enrollees by 44%, or $705 annually. The organization says that if the tax credit expires, average premiums for subsidized enrollees in 12 states would at least double.",
      "In 2024, of the 21.6 million Americans who purchased health insurance plans from ACA marketplaces, 20.1 million received enhanced subsidies,\u00a0according\u00a0to the CBO.",
      "People most at risk of losing ACA coverage if the enhanced subsidies lapse are those who live in states where health insurance premiums are particularly high, including in rural parts of the U.S. Middle-income households that depend on the enhanced subsidies could see a sharp rise in premiums, Cynthia Cox, vice president and ACA policy researcher at KFF, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"They could go from paying no more than 8.5% of their income to easily paying 20% or more,\" she said. \"I imagine a lot of those folks would drop coverage.\"",
      "Without enhances subsidies, many middle income ACA Marketplace enrollees with incomes just above four times poverty would be priced out of health insurance coverage, according to Cox.",
      "Subsidies remain for 2025",
      "Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at\u00a0healthinsurance.org, noted that 93% of people who buy health insurance through ACA marketplaces receive enhanced subsidies. A sharp increase in their premiums would lead many to drop their coverage, leaving them uninsured, she said.",
      "The CBO\u00a0estimates\u00a0that 22.8 million total Americans will enroll in ACA marketplace health insurance plans in 2025. The agency expects enrollment to drop sharply, from 22.8 million to 18.9 million, in 2026 if the subsidies are not renewed. By 2030, enrollment could dip to 15.4 million people without the enhanced subsidies.",
      "For now, the subsidy enhancements will remain in place through the end of 2025.",
      "\"If people are signing up now during open enrollment, their coverage will take effect in January, and it will cover them for the whole year. Their premiums won't change \u2014 they're good for 2025,\" Norris said.",
      "The enhanced subsidies, which were first passed in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, will have been in place for roughly five years when they expire in 2025, or about half as long as the ACA marketplace has existed, Cox said.",
      "Enrollment in ACA plans has roughly doubled since the enhance subsidies have been in place, she noted, with most of that growth coming from low-income enrollees. \"That's one group you might expect to see, if they have to start making a higher premium payments, would drop their coverage,\" she said.",
      "Making the enhanced subsidies permanent would cost $335 billion over 10 years,\u00a0according to\u00a0the CBO.",

    "summary": "Overdose deaths have slowed 18% since a peak last year, the CDC estimates.",
    "story": [
      "Opioid overdose deaths have now slowed to the lowest levels nationwide since 2020, according to new estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This marks the 12th straight month of decline since a peak last year.",
      "Around 70,655 deaths linked to opioids like heroin and fentanyl were reported for the year ending June 2024, the CDC now estimates, falling 18% from the same time in 2023.",
      "Almost all states, except for a handful in the West from Alaska through Nevada, are now seeing a significant decrease in overdose death rates. Early data from Canada also suggests overdose deaths there might now be slowing off of a peak in 2023 too.",
      "\"While these data are cause for optimism, we must not lose sight of the fact that nearly 100,000 people are still estimated to be dying annually from drug overdose in the U.S.\" said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, in a statement.",
      "Other types of drug overdoses beyond opioids are also slowing. While they make up a smaller share of overall deaths, overdoses linked to drugs like methamphetamine and cocaine are also showing signs of dropping nationwide following a peak last year.",
      "\"We are encouraged by this data, but boy, it is time to double down on the things that we know are working. It is not a time to pull back, and I feel very strongly, and our data shows, that the threat continues to evolve,\" Dr. Allison Arwady, head of the CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, told CBS News.",
      "Arwady pointed to a long list of factors that officials hope are contributing to the decline, ranging from broader availability of the overdose reversing spray naloxone, also known as Narcan, to efforts to ease gaps in access to medications that can treat opioid use disorder.",
      "Trends in what health officials call \"primary prevention\" have also improved in recent years \u2014 meaning fewer people using the drugs to begin with. As an example, Arwady cited CDC surveys showing a clear decline in high school students reporting that they have tried illegal drugs.",
      "The CDC and health departments have also gotten faster at gathering and analyzing data to respond to surges in overdoses, Arwady said, often caused by new so-called \"adulterants\" that are mixed in. Health authorities study this by testing blood and drug samples taken in the wake of surges, in search of potential emerging drug threats.",
      "Agency researchers are now looking closer at what could be behind gaps in communities that are still not seeing slowdowns, Arwady said.",
      "\"Unfortunately, for the most affected groups, namely Native Americans and Black American men, the death rates are not decreasing and are at the highest recorded levels,\" said Volkow.",
      "Why are drug overdose deaths declining?",
      "In the months since CDC data first began showing real signs of a nationwide change to the deadly record wave of opioid overdose deaths, experts have floated a number of theories to explain what caused the change.",
      "\"We had been seeing the numbers go down, on the national aggregate level, since last April, and we were skeptical and kind of holding our tongues. Then we started hearing from a lot of folks on the ground, frontline providers,'\" said Nabarun Dasgupta, a senior scientist at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill who studies opioid overdose deaths.",
      "Dasgupta led an analysis in September by the university's Opioid Data Lab illustrating the nationwide scope of the downturn and probing a number of theories that might explain it.",
      "Some explanations they dismissed as unlikely, like stepped-up law enforcement operations. Other ideas they judged as plausible, but complicated to prove, like a so-called \"depletion of susceptibles\" \u2014 essentially the epidemic burning itself out, as users either found ways to survive the influx of fentanyl or died \u2014 or the wider availability of naloxone.",
      "Dasgupta said they received a flood of interest since their initial post proposing more theories, like new scanners that were deployed on the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "There are likely a number of factors all playing a role in the shift, Dasgupta says. But he said early data from research they are wrapping up now supports one leading explanation: a shift in the illegal drug supply.",
      "\"Our hypothesis is that something has changed in the drug supply. This kind of pronounced shift, something that happens suddenly, if numbers had suddenly shot up, we would definitely be pointing to a change in the drug supply to explain it,\" said Dasgupta.",
      "Amid its downsides, xylazine's rise might have led to less injection drug use, they speculate. Its longer high could also be reducing the number of times people use fentanyl each day.",
      "\"We're not in our offices celebrating. We're still losing too many people that we love. So I just want it to be very clear that with like a hundred thousand people still dying, that's obscenely high,\" he said.",

Its stock price has since plunged, prompting speculation that the company could be acquired by another buyer and sparking concern among customers about the security of their genetic information.",

      "Customer data collected from its genetic testing tools makes up the company's most valuable asset. Because 23andMe is not a health care company, health privacy laws don't apply, raising questions about what the business might opt to do with its 15 million users' personal genetic data.",
      "Under 23andMe's current user agreement, users must opt-in to allow the company to share their personal DNA or data. The agreement states that if the company is acquired, customers' data may be accessed or sold as part of such a transaction.",
      "23andMe told CBS MoneyWatch correspondent Kelly O'Grady that while there are no plans for a sale, the current privacy agreement would apply.",
      "Meanwhile, at least 11 states have passed privacy laws that would require customers' consent before their genetic data is transferred.",
      "Still, experts say a new owner could change 23andMe's privacy terms following a sale, potentially putting the onus on consumers to push back against any move to share their data.",
      "23andMe said that roughly 80% of its customers consent to participate in the company's research program, which it said has generated more than 270 peer-reviewed publications uncovering new genetic insights into disease. Any data that shared is anonymized and cannot be traced back to individual customers, according to the company.",
      "Still, users can can take additional steps to protect their data, including deleting their 23andMe accounts \u2014 a process that is automated and straightforward.",
      "\"If, at any time, you are no longer interested in participating in our Services, you may delete your 23andMe account directly within your Account Settings,\" the company states on its website.",

    "summary": "One couple took out a loan to cover the out-of-network costs of an abortion and drove eight hours to a hospital in the neighboring state.",
    "story": [
      "Four women suing over Idaho's strict abortion bans told a judge Tuesday how excitement over their pregnancies turned to grief and fear after they learned their fetuses were not likely to survive to birth \u2014 and how they had to leave the state to get abortions amid fears that pregnancy complications would put their own health in danger.",
      "\"We felt like we were being made refugees, medical refugees,\" said Jennifer Adkins, one of the plaintiffs in the case.",
      "The women, represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, aren't asking for the state's abortion ban to be overturned. Instead, they want the judge to clarify and expand the exceptions to the strict ban so that people facing serious pregnancy complications can receive abortions before they are at death's door.",
      "Currently, the state's near-total ban makes performing an abortion a felony at any stage of pregnancy unless it is \"necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.\"",
      "Adkins' fetus had a severe medical condition that meant the fetus would not survive the pregnancy. The illness also put Adkins at risk of developing \"mirror syndrome,\" a dangerous syndrome that can cause fatally high blood pressure and other issues, she said.",
      "Adkins and her husband, John, decided to seek an abortion, and learned, after another ultrasound showed the fetus still had a heartbeat, that they would have to go out of state to get one.",
      "Idaho law prohibits a woman from getting an abortion when a fetal heartbeat is detected, with the exception of cases of rape, incest or a \"medical emergency,\" defined by the law as \"a condition that, in reasonable medical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death or for which a delay will create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\"",
      "\"No parent wants to wish that when they look at an ultrasound they don't see their baby's heartbeat, yet here I was hoping that I wouldn't,\" Adkins said. \"I wanted the decision to be made for us, and I wanted to end her suffering, so it was really hard to see that and know that we had the challenges ahead of us that we did.\"",
      "\"I was not willing to watch my son suffer\"",
      "Kayla Smith cried as she told the judge how she found out she was pregnant for a second time on Mother's Day of 2022, and how she and her husband chose the name \"Brooks\" for their son. She was around 18 or 20 weeks along in her pregnancy when the sonographer grew quiet during a routine anatomy scan, Smith said.",
      "Brooks' heart had fatal anomalies, and the young family could not find a pediatric cardiologist willing to attempt an operation. The veins supplying Brooks' lungs were also abnormal, Smith said, and he would not survive birth.",
      "Smith had developed dangerously high blood pressure during a previous pregnancy, and she was at risk of developing the condition called preeclampsia again.",
      "\"If I were to continue pregnancy not only would I risk my life with preeclampsia, I was not willing to watch my son suffer and potentially gasp for air,\" Smith said, crying.",
      "Idaho's abortion ban went into effect two days before Brooks' diagnosis, she said, making it impossible for her to get an abortion in her home state.",
      "\"We wanted to meet our son \u2014 that was really important to us \u2014 so we needed to do it in a hospital,\" she said.",
      "They took out a loan to cover the estimated $16,000 to $20,000 out-of-network cost for the procedure and drove more than eight hours to a hospital where doctors induced labor.",
      "\"All four of these women were overjoyed to be pregnant with their second child and all four of them received the worst news a mother can imagine,\" attorney Gail Deady, with the Center for Reproductive Rights, told 4th District Judge Jason D. Scott during opening arguments. All of them sought abortions \"to protect their health, to spare their babies from pain and suffering, and to remain alive and healthy to protect their young children.\"",
      "James Craig, a division chief with the Idaho Attorney General's office, said the women and their attorneys are relying on hypotheticals rather than concrete facts to make their case. Under their proposal, a pregnant woman could receive her abortion for something as minor as stepping on a rusty nail \u2014 even though the risk of infection in that scenario could be easily treated by receiving a tetanus booster shot, Craig said.",
      "\"Unborn children have a fundamental right to life, and protecting the lives of children is a legitimate and fundamental government interest,\" Craig said.",
      "The state also has the same interest in protecting the lives of women, Craig said \u2014 and the abortion ban laws do both, he contended.",
      "In the \"rare circumstances where abortion is necessary\" to prevent the death of the mother, Idaho law allows that to occur, Craig said. The women suing are trying to \"usurp the role of the Legislature\" by asking the judge to rewrite the law, he said, and that is not the proper role of the court.",
      "Dr. Emily Corrigan, an ob-gyn who works in emergency medicine at Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center who is also a plaintiff in the case, told the judge how Idaho's multiple abortion bans have created confusion for physicians and made it difficult to treat pregnant patients who need emergency care.",
      "Doctors have had to \"basically guess which pregnancy conditions would fall under the state medical exception,\" Corrigan said.",
      "\"I have had other hospital staff refuse to participate in the care of my patients because of the lack of understanding of the laws, and this has caused patient care delays,\" she said. \"I have personally cared for several patients who have been denied stabilizing abortion care at other hospitals in Idaho. By the time they arrive at my institution, their conditions have deteriorated and have lead to increased complications that I need to manage.\"",
      "Several conditions can put the health of pregnant people at risk, she said. Some are caused by pregnancy like preeclampsia, and others \u2014 including some chronic illnesses and cancers \u2014 can be made worse by pregnancy, she said. In those cases, delaying an abortion might not cause immediate death but can cause a shortened life span or have dramatic effects on a person's health, Corrigan said.",

    "summary": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has vowed to combat \"the chronic disease epidemic in this country\" in the Trump administration, with the slogan \"Make America Healthy Aagain.\"",
    "story": [
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has outlined a number of promises to \"Make America Healthy Again\" under President-elect Donald Trump, vowing to combat an \"epidemic\" of chronic diseases that he has described as an \"existential\" threat to America's future.",
      "All are under the banner of fighting what Kennedy sees as a common thread behind a broad swath of ailments: that Americans have been \"mass poisoned by big pharma and big food,\" and that federal agencies have failed to stop it. In response, he has also floated a number of specific policy ideas to remake the federal government's public health institutions.",
      "\"[Trump] asked me to end the chronic disease epidemic in this country. And he said, I want to see results, measurable results in the diminishment of chronic disease within two years. And I said, Mr. President, I will do that,\" Kennedy said on Nov. 2.",
      "Authority for a MAHA agenda",
      "Kennedy's allies say Trump's election is also a mandate for their platform of health proposals, which they say delivered key votes for the president-elect. Trump has promised to let Kennedy \"go wild\" on health issues.",
      "\"The American people re-elected President Trump by resounding margins because they trust his judgement and support his policies, including his promise to Make America Healthy Again alongside well-respected leaders like RFK Jr.,\" Karoline Leavitt, Trump-Vance Transition spokeswoman, told CBS News in a statement.",
      "Some ideas in Kennedy's wide-ranging platform have evolved since his original longshot\u00a0presidential campaign. He has acknowledged Trump does not agree with him on every policy.",
      "The president-elect has listed oil and gas as one off-limits issue for Kennedy. In the past, Kennedy has been critical of \"big oil\" and natural gas, over the fatal toll of fossil fuel pollution and climate change.",
      "Several of Kennedy's ideas would require presidential or congressional action to implement, though it is possible that they could be supercharged by emergency powers.",
      "\"I'm going to urge President Trump on day one to do the same thing they did in COVID, which is to declare a national emergency, but not for infectious disease, but for chronic disease,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 26.",
      "Staff changes at federal agencies",
      "Kennedy claims a number of health issues have worsened due to federal inaction, including autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, sleep disorders, infertility rates, diabetes and obesity.",
      "He aims to address that by replacing many staff throughout the agencies, which Kennedy has accused of being too sympathetic to large food and drug companies. As a co-chair of Trump's transition, Kennedy has been vetting a slate of staffers who could fill top positions throughout the Trump administration.",
      "Kennedy has said Trump tasked him with returning agencies \"to their rich tradition of gold-standard, evidence-based science.\" He has also said \"medical expertise\" is not the priority for all staff picks.",
      "\"What we don't really need at HHS is more medical expertise. What we need is an expertise on decoupling the agency from institutional corruption. Because it's the corruption that has distorted the science,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 30.",
      "Kennedy has said he hopes \"to have every nutritional scientist\" across the Department of Health and Human Services and U.S. Department of Agriculture \"fired on Day One.\"",
      "Kennedy himself has been floated to head the Department of Health and Human Services, though some allies say he could be more effective in a \"czar\" type role out of the White House.",
      "\"Get the chemicals out\" of food",
      "When talking about his platform, Kennedy often lampoons products like McDonald's French fries or Fruit Loops cereal as examples of how foods sold in the U.S. are made with ingredients that are banned or discouraged abroad, or have changed for the worse.",
      "\"It's easy to fix. We have a thousand ingredients in our foods that are illegal in Italy and other countries in Europe,\" he said on Oct. 29.",
      "Trump agrees with his plans to \"get the chemicals out\" of America's food supply, Kennedy says, which also includes upending the use of common pesticides and herbicides by American farmers.",
      "Kennedy has described the food in the U.S. as \"just poison,\" citing his own anecdotal experience with his son struggling with eczema while eating pasta in the U.S.",
      "\"When he ate any kind of pasta in this country, he would get these terrible, terrible outbreaks, you know, really agonizing. And he moved to Italy and he lived off of pasta for a year and a half and he never got a case,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 19.",
      "Kennedy suspects that was caused by glyphosate, used in Roundup brand weed-killers, which Italy moved to start restricting in 2016. Italy's decision was over worries that it could pose a cancer risk, and some advocacy groups in the U.S. have also voiced similar concerns.",
      "Agricultural trade associations have defended glyphosate as \"one of the safest, most effective\" tools farmers have to manage weeds and support \"important conservation practices.\"",
      "Kennedy's plea to crack down on food additives and chemicals comes as the FDA is in the middle of launching its own new effort \u2014 and is calling on Congress to step up funding for \u2014 scrutinizing chemicals currently allowed in foods.",
      "Food industry groups have generally voiced support for the FDA to step up its vetting of chemicals in food, in hopes that it \"negates the ill advised and disruptive state by state patchwork\" of legislatures drawing up their own restrictions.",
      "Reducing unhealthy and processed foods in federal programs",
      "Kennedy has also promised to \"get processed food out of school lunch immediately\" and voiced frustration over the amount of federal food assistance for low-income Americans that goes towards sugary drinks and processed food.",
      "One way Kennedy could try to get at this issue is through the federal dietary guidelines process, jointly run by the USDA and HHS, which is in the final stages of crafting the next edition of recommendations that influence a broad range of government nutrition programs.",
      "\"Kids shouldn't be eating grains. They should definitely not be eating seed oils. And they for sure should not be eating sugar. And yet that is what we're forcing them to eat,\" he said on Sept. 26.",
      "On seed oils, Kennedy has claimed that the switch away from oils like beef tallow which were high in saturated fats in favor of vegetable oils was a mistake, and is to blame for a rise in obesity rates. That puts him at odds with longstanding recommendations to limit saturated fats.",
      "\"The guidance around this has been reviewed many times since, and has only become stronger in its conclusion for the role of saturated fat, particularly in its relationship with higher risks of cardiovascular disease,\" Deirdre Tobias, a researcher on this year's Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, said last month.",
      "Grains have been more divisive at this year's committee and the broader scientific community, which has debated setting lower limits to overall grain consumption alongside recommendations to switch from refined to whole grains.",
      "Setting new limits is difficult, scientists on the panel have said, because the only source of some key nutrients for many Americans is cereals and breads fortified with vitamins.",
      "Kennedy has also been critical of the panel of outside researchers put together to create the scientific report underpinning the recommendations, but acknowledges broader changes will also be needed to move the needle.",
      "While Kennedy says he personally would \"never eat anything in a package\" as a rule of thumb, he acknowledges \"most people don't have access to the resources I have.\"",
      "\"We need to start forcing these companies to internalize their costs. So the illusion of cheap food goes away, right? Because if you're drinking Coke and it seems cheap and it gives you diabetes over the long run, that's not very cheap,\" he said on Sept. 30.",
      "Curbing the influence of drugmakers",
      "Kennedy has called for a \"review\" of guidelines that govern advertising by pharmaceutical companies.",
      "The FDA currently regulates advertising about prescription drugs, going after drugmakers that misrepresent their products. Responsibility for some other medical products is shared between the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "Kennedy has urged Trump to go further, saying he is advising the president-elect to \"ban pharmaceutical advertising on TV\" over concerns that it is influencing news coverage of health issues.",
      "He has also urged reform of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, which charges pharmaceutical companies millions of dollars for the cost of the FDA vetting their applications to decide whether to approve new drugs.",
      "\"We need to end the corruption. 50% of FDA's budget comes not from the taxpayer, but from the pharmaceutical industry,\" he said on Sept. 26.",
      "Kennedy has not said how Congress or the Trump administration would make up the difference from the fees if they were cut, which amount to around $3 billion out of FDA's budget.",
      "Undoing the fees could leave taxpayers effectively subsidizing a hefty bill previously paid for by drugmakers \u2014 or a return to the significant delays for new medications that initially spurred the creation of the fees.",
      "Promoting alternatives to drugs",
      "Kennedy has accused the FDA of waging a \"war on public health\" which he says includes \"aggressive suppression\" of anything \"that advances human health and can't be patented by Pharma.\"",
      "In his view, that includes treatments like psychedelics, which recently fell short of FDA approval, and foods like raw milk, which officials have stepped up warnings against amid this year's unprecedented bird flu outbreak on dairy farms.",
      "Kennedy has also praised the dietary supplement industry for a court win against the FDA, after the agency tried to take action against what it said was an illegally marketed anti-aging drug.",
      "Also on Kennedy's list are things like \"clean foods\" and exercise, which he wants to allow Medicare and Medicaid to cover.",
      "The promise has echoes of the \"food is medicine\" initiative, which has called for the health care system to offer more financial support for healthier lifestyle habits.",
      "\"If a doctor's patient has diabetes or obesity, the doctor ought to be able to say, I'm going to recommend gym membership, and I'm going to recommend, good food and Medicaid ought to be able to finance those things the same as they would Ozempic,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 30.",
      "Kennedy has also promised to promote healthier lifestyles in other ways, ranging from requiring nutrition classes in federally funded medical schools to reviving the presidential fitness test in schools.",
      "\"Informed choices\" on vaccines",
      "Kennedy has a long record criticizing the safety of vaccines, including recent misleading claims that shots have an \"exemption from pre-licensing safety testing\" before they are approved.",
      "In fact, the FDA requires new vaccines be studied for their safety and efficacy in large trials, results of which are published in peer-reviewed journals and publicly disclosed.",
      "His activism on the issue dates back decades, including a now-retracted article he published in Rolling Stone in 2005 claiming a link between autism and an ingredient called thimerosal that had been used in vaccines before 2001 \u2014 which medical research has disproven. His focus has broadened since then.",
      "\"This doesn't mean vaccines is the only cause of autism. Our kids today are swimming around in a toxic soup coming mainly from their foods that operate along the same biological pathways. But some of it's coming from pharmaceutical drugs,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 19.",
      "Kennedy has insisted that is not \"anti-vaccine\" and would not seek to ban them under Trump, instead saying he wants to \"restore the transparency\" around them \u2014 echoing lawsuits by the group he chaired, Children's Health Defense, over its Freedom of Information Act requests.",
      "\"[Trump] doesn't want me to take vaccines away from people. If you want to take a vaccine, you ought to be able to take it. We believe in free choice in this country. You ought to know the risks and benefits of everything you take,\" Kennedy said on Nov. 2.",
      "But Kennedy has also asserted \"there's no vaccine that is safe and effective,\" and encouraged people to \"resist\" CDC guidelines on vaccines for kids \u2014 raising concern among public health officials, who point to the success of vaccination in saving millions of children worldwide from debilitating illness or premature death from preventable diseases.",
      "Opposing water fluoridation",
      "Ahead of the election, Kennedy said one of Trump's first acts in the White House would be to \"advise all U.S. water systems to remove fluoride from public water.\"",
      "While a number of health risks have been tied to higher levels of fluoride, most are extremely rare in the U.S. and involve far greater exposure than what is added to drinking water.",
      "Fluoride has been incorporated into a majority of U.S. water systems for decades. The American Dental Association estimates that the practice has reduced tooth decay by about 25%, though some research suggests modern use of toothpaste with fluoride has reduced the policy's benefits.",
      "Kennedy's announcement does come as the Environmental Protection Agency is now under a federal court order to take action over one specific risk: the concern that fluoride might lower children's IQ \"at dosages that are far too close to fluoride levels in the drinking water of the United States,\" stemming in large part from a report published by the National Institutes of Health.",
      "Beyond influencing what rule the Trump administration's EPA ends up pursuing in response to the order, Kennedy could also take aim at fluoride through another route: changing the CDC's widely-cited statement about the practice, which hails water fluoridation as one of the greatest \"public health achievements of the 20th century.\"",
      "Kennedy himself has described fluoride as \"a poison\" and praised the nonprofits for suing over the issue.",
      "\"The simple answer is I don't like it,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 30.",

      "Idit Negrin would try anything to beat the trauma haunting her since attending the Nova Music Festival on October 7th, when Hamas massacred hundreds of civilians. \"We saw the terrorists, and they started shooting at us,\" she said. She ran for her life.",
      "Afterwards, \"I woke up every night, every night around 3 o'clock screaming and sweating and shaking. I think after a day, or two days after, I felt that I'm falling down, crying.\"",
      "We met her this summer as she was two-thirds of the way through her 60-session course of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). It's a treatment long used to combat compression sickness in divers, and wounds that will not heal. But at the Sagol Center for Hyperbaric Medicine and Research, in Be'er Ya'akov, Israel, they're now also treating a very different malady: post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.",
      "Negrin described her experiences with PTSD: \"You feel like you're going crazy. I call people and scream, 'There is a terror attack again!' And then you understand that you have no control of your brain.\"",
      "Negrin is trying to regain that control, along with about 650 other October 7th survivors suffering from PTSD who are being treated, for free, alongside military veterans at the Sagol Center \u2013 currently the largest hyperbaric center worldwide.",
      "Dr. Shai Efrati runs this clinic, where they're treating up to 350 patients a day, and are on the forefront of this sort of medicine. \"What we are doing is actually tricking the body,\" Efrati said. \"Hypoxia, lack of oxygen, is the most powerful trigger to induce all the repair mechanism cascade.\"",
      "Efrati says they're inducing repair mechanisms in the body and brain inside these pressurized chambers, where it feels like you're scuba diving down to 30 feet. Patients breathe in pure oxygen, which under such high-pressure conditions the body can absorb at up to 16 times the normal level. Then, masks are removed for five-minute intervals.",
      "Efrati said, \"The decline from very high back to the normal is being interpreted at the similar level as hypoxia, as lack of oxygen. That causes the body to trigger the stem cells, and for the first time even in humans, we can see generation of new neurons, generation of new blood vessels in the brain. And this is mind-blowing.\"",
      "The treatment has been described as \"unapproved\" and \"not proven.\" \"When we speak about hyperbaric oxygen therapy, this is how it should look like,\" Efrati said.",
      "\"You're saying there are a lot of frauds out there?\" asked Doane.",
      "\"Indeed. And this is not only not good, it can be even dangerous.\"",
      "Dr. Efrati is constantly experimenting with new ways to use this treatment. At his clinic near Tel Aviv, we got to see how they're catering hyperbaric medicine to athletes (\"If we can shorten the recovery period, you can push harder doing the exercises\"), and helping patients with brain injuries regain movement through the growth of new neurons and blood vessels in the brain.",
      "\"It's not that we are fixing his running,\" Efrati said about one athlete's performance. \"We are fixing the brain.\"",
      "They've published several studies, looking at PTSD in veterans. One, out today, found that 68% of patients showed significant improvement. Another reported that PTSD remission lasted at least two years, which is higher than other established treatments. \"We want to evaluate everything objectively,\" said Efrati.",
      "It's conclusive enough for the Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, to ask Efrati's team to stop testing and start treating. The doctor says that while you can always ask for more data, \"You see the evidence in front of you.\"",
      "Shachar Mizrhai was one of those IDF veterans referred in 2018 for the initial clinical trial. He was a soldier during a 2014 Israeli offensive in Gaza and was in an armored vehicle when it was ambushed. In the short term, he was thinking about survival; the suffering came later. \"I can't sleep at night,\" he said. \"In the moment I put [on] the uniform, I feel like I want to die. I smell blood. I smell war.\"",
      "He'd tried drugs, therapy and sleeping pills. He contemplated suicide. \"Nothing really helped to get back to life,\" he said. \"And I heard that this might be help, and maybe this is my last chance before I finish my life.\"",
      "Dr. Keren Doenyas-Barak, who heads the PTSD program at the Sagol Center, followed Mizrhai through his 60 sessions, and showed us his brain scans from June 2018, and March 2019, highlighting activation of areas used to effectively regulate emotion, or process information. The later brain scan images were lighting up; that wasn't happening before the treatment.",
      "\"Many people tend to look at PTSD as a psychological phenomenon, not as a biological phenomenon,\" Doenyas-Barak said. \"So, we treat PTSD very similar to other brain conditions.\"",

      "That's a question Murphy \u2013 a member of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs \u2013 is raising in the halls of Congress. One in 10 of his constituents is a veteran. \"I love our VA,\" he said. \"But we're not reaching a certain segment of our veterans if we're having 22 commit suicide every day. And if we're doing something and there is a treatment that has shown definitive results, I believe it's medical malpractice not to offer that to our veterans.\"",

    "summary": "Republicans' newly won control of the Senate may have buoyed Kennedy's odds of a role in the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is now on a short list being floated by some Trump allies to serve as the next head of the Department of Health and Human Services, multiple people close to the president-elect's campaign say.",
      "Hopes among Kennedy's backers that he could be nominated to lead the department have risen in recent days, after Republicans cemented their majority in the Senate.",
      "Kennedy's odds of clearing a Senate led by Democrats would have been low, given his long record of what the party called \"anti-science, fringe public health stances\" that outraged Trump's opponents and a broad array of health experts during the campaign.",
      "That includes\u00a0a comment\u00a0that \"there's no vaccine that is safe and effective\" and his chairmanship of the group Children's Health Defense, which has claimed that the \"parallel between rising disease rates and the increasing number of childhood vaccines is hard to ignore.\" Doctors argue statements like these mislead about the safety of immunizations and threaten to erode hard-fought improvements in U.S. vaccination rates against preventable diseases.",
      "Kennedy himself has been noncommittal when asked publicly about the possibility he could be picked to head the sprawling HHS umbrella of agencies, which includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institutes of Health, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Ahead of the election, Kennedy told Fox News he was \"confident that if I wanted to do HHS secretary, the president would fight like hell to make that happen,\" but also said that he was unsure if that would be \"the most effective\" role for him.",
      "In a CNN interview last month, Trump transition co-chair Howard Lutnick, was asked whether Kennedy would be in charge of HHS.",
      "\"Of course not,\" he replied.",
      "But two people close to the campaign say the election results have played a big role in changing the thinking on whether Kennedy could clear a steep and often painful Senate confirmation process that can bog down nominees.",
      "Kennedy's supporters argue that the election offers a mandate not just for Trump's platform overall but for Kennedy and his \"Make America Healthy Again\" proposals to combat chronic disease, citing the votes Kennedy may have delivered in Trump's favor.",
      "As one example, podcast host Joe Rogan initially voiced support for Kennedy and his ideas before later endorsing Trump.",
      "\"We have not yet decided exactly what that strategy is going to be, but that is a possibility,\" Kennedy told NPR in an interview after the election, asked if he would be named to a Senate-confirmed position.",
      "As to the question of whether Kennedy is now in serious contention for the HHS secretary role, Trump-Vance transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that Americans reelected Trump \"by resounding margins because they trust his judgement and support his policies, including his promise to Make America Healthy Again alongside well-respected leaders like RFK Jr.\"",
      "Other potential HHS secretary picks",
      "However, Kennedy is not the only name that has been floated by Republicans for the top job at HHS.",
      "Florida Governor Ron DeSantis suggested Wednesday his top health official, state surgeon general Dr. Joseph Ladapo, could be a candidate. Under Ladapo, the state's health department has warned some against getting COVID-19 booster shots, citing claims that federal health authorities and outside experts criticized as unproven or misleading.",
      "Other names floated by Trump allies in Washington include former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former deputy HHS secretary Eric Hargan, who supporters think could be effective because he knows how to navigate the department's bureaucracy.",
      "But people close to the campaign say few Trump surrogates and supporters have spent as much time with the president-elect as Kennedy or plotted as ambitious an agenda.",
      "The two spent hours flying together in the final stretch of the campaign. Kennedy was also in Florida after the election, huddling with the president-elect's top ranks to weigh potential candidates to fill the administration.",
      "\"He's going to help make America healthy again. And he's a great guy and he really means it. He wants to do some things, and we're going to let him go to it,\" Trump said on Wednesday morning after the election.",
      "Trump has previously said he's been friends with Kennedy \"for a long time\" and would let him \"go wild\" on many of his policy priorities, except for curbing fossil fuels.",
      "\"I'm going to let him go wild on health. I'm going to let him go wild on the food. I'm going to let him go wild on medicines. The only thing I don't think I'm going to let him even get near is the liquid gold that we have under our feet,\" Trump said in New York on Oct. 27.",
      "Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" platform",
      "Kennedy's nomination would come at a key time for many of the issues he campaigned on, which he says underpin \"the chronic-disease crisis.\"",
      "Kennedy has accused the FDA of \"aggressive suppression\" of a range of products, including psychedelics \u2014 after MDMA failed to earn the agency's approval earlier this year \u2014 and raw milk, which officials have discouraged amid the ongoing bird flu outbreak on dairy farms.",
      "Other proposals include restricting pharmaceutical advertising and rewriting the laws that currently rely on drugmakers paying fees to fund most FDA approvals. Ahead of the election, he warned FDA officials who \"are part of this corrupt system\" to \"pack your bags.\"",
      "In the days ahead of the election, Kennedy said Trump had asked him to \"root out the corruption and the conflicts of interests\" in agencies that oversee drugs and vaccines, pledging to \"restore transparency\" and stop \"hiding science.\"",
      "\"He doesn't want me to take vaccines away from people. If you want to take a vaccine, you ought to be able to take it. We believe in free choice in this country,\" Kennedy said in remarks posted on Nov. 2.",
      "His call for stopping water fluoridation comes as the Environmental Protection Agency is now facing a court order to take action against the practice.",
      "That ruling was driven in part by a review released by the NIH earlier this year, examining the risk it might lower children's IQ, and comes as critics have called on the CDC to revise its statement backing fluoridation. The NIH review found that concentrations of fluoride in drinking water higher than recommended levels were associated with lower IQ in children, but more studies were needed on the effect of lower concentrations of fluoride.",
      "But were he to end up HHS secretary, some of Kennedy's aims would fall outside of his jurisdiction, like the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Other responsibilities under the broad HHS umbrella could consume much of Kennedy's time, some allies worry, distracting from his priorities.",
      "\"Bobby is very action-oriented, brilliant, an excellent communicator, has a great grasp of details, and is a transformational leader. He is not, his skillset is not, as a bureaucrat administrator,\" said Dr. Robert Malone, a longtime Kennedy ally who was with him and Trump on election night.",
      "Malone said he had spoken with many of the aides from some of the \"at least four different HHS transition teams\" under Trump, but not personally with Kennedy, in recent weeks about the future of the department.",
      "He said he thought Kennedy would likely do better in a role at the White House, serving as a czar who could target specific issues across different departments.",
      "\"Make no mistake, what is being discussed is a major reimagining of the entire federal health research and promotion and protection infrastructure. That includes very significant reforms and changes in business practice,\" said Malone.",

    "title": "What to know about Trump's DOGE, led by Musk and Ramaswamy",
    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 13:45:39 -0500",
    "summary": "Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will head an effort, dubbed DOGE, to reduce wasteful federal spending. Here's what it's about.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump is vowing to reduce wasteful federal spending by tapping two billionaires \u2014 Tesla CEO Elon Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy \u2014 to spearhead the initiative, which the president-elect is calling the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.",
      "The appointments, announced by Trump on Tuesday, raise a host of questions about the effort, including whether Musk and Ramaswamy will have the authority to make changes in federal outlays, given that Congress authorizes the nation's spending, as well as where the businessmen might look to cut spending. Under the plan, meanwhile, DOGE is not an official government department, raising questions about its powers and how it will operate.",
      "The announcement comes a week after Trump won a second term\u00a0as president, with voters expressing their dissatisfaction with the economy under the Biden administration. As part of his campaign vows, Trump promised to slash government spending. Musk's bio on X, the social media platform he bought in 2022, now reads, \"The people voted for major government reform.\"",
      "\"Frankly, it does need to be done again, so every few decades you really need to look at everything,\" Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution who managed the Clinton Administration's National Performance Review, an effort to cut government spending in the 1990s, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "But Kamarck harbors reservations about Musk and Ramaswamy's mandate, especially after the former recently suggested he could find more than $2 trillion in savings \u2014 almost one-third of the federal government's $6.7 trillion in annual spending. Two-thirds of that spending is mandatory through programs including Social Security and Medicare, while discretionary spending is largely spent on defense.",
      "\"This is the first warning sign that this is going to be a failed operation,\" Kamarck said. \"That's insane.\"",
      "Speaking on transformational change within government and organizations, Michael Morris, a professor at Columbia University's Columbia Business School, noted there are two models: a bottom-up, grassroots effort and a top-down strategy \u2014 sometimes called a shock-change approach. DOGE likely belongs to the latter, according to Morris, who is also author of the nonfiction book \"Tribal,\" about how people form and relate to each other through group dynamics.",
      "\"Unless you have a new leader with incredible legitimacy and the status quo with no legitimacy, you rarely have people responding well to shock therapy,\" he said. \"It's hard to see it happening in this case \u2014 I don't think Musk is going to be able to form a deep knowledge of government.\"",
      "The Trump campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "What is the Department of Government Efficiency?",
      "Trump announced the DOGE in a statement on Tuesday, describing it as an effort to \"slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies.\"",
      "The name is a nod to Musk's support for a cryptocurrency called dogecoin, which was created as a joke by two software engineers and uses the image of a smiling Shiba Inu dog. (Dogecoin has more than tripled in price during the last month, and now trades at 38 cents.)",
      "Trump said Musk and Ramaswamy's work \"will conclude no later than July 4, 2026,\" or by the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Trump only outlined the initiative's contours and didn't disclose how it will be staffed or funded. The Trump campaign didn't respond to a request about the DOGE's funding or whether Musk or Ramaswamy will be paid for their work on the effort.",
      "Can the DOGE actually cut federal spending?",
      "At the moment, that appears unlikely given that the DOGE isn't a real government department, which would need to be created by congressional approval. Federal spending is authorized by Congress, and senators and House representatives may hesitate to support cuts to major programs like Social Security or Medicare, which are popular with millions of voters, or to the nation's military.",
      "It's also not clear how the organization will operate. It could come under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which dictates how external groups that advise the government must operate and be accountable to the public.",
      "Trump described Musk and Ramaswamy's role as providing \"advice and guidance from outside of government.\"",
      "That doesn't amount to much, Kamarck said.",
      "\"They have no authority \u2014 none whatsoever,\" she added, while noting that the backing of the president can help convince lawmakers to throw their support behind efficiency efforts.",
      "However, Trump's aides are reportedly working on a way to enact some of DOGE's spending recommendations without requiring congressional approval, the Washington Post reported.",
      "What have Musk and Ramaswamy said about federal spending?",
      "Musk, the world's richest person with a net worth of $319 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, has described the U.S. government as bloated and said it its spending is unsustainable. The Tesla founder also said he wants to reduce the number of federal agencies to 99, down from more than 400.",
      "\"There are so many [agencies] that people have never heard of, and that have overlapping areas of responsibilities,\" Musk\u00a0said earlier this month.",
      "While on the campaign trail with Trump, Musk also\u00a0said\u00a0he could cut \"at least $2 trillion\" from the annual budget. \"Your money is being wasted, and the Department of Government Efficiency will fix that,\" Musk said.",
      "Musk is known for cost-cutting at his own companies, slashing\u00a0most of X's workforce after he bought the business two years ago as well as focusing on manufacturing costs at Tesla. Even so, those efforts have had mixed results, with X's valuation falling by about 80% since his purchase. Tesla's stock price, meanwhile, has surged 48% in the past year, bumping its value above $1 trillion.",
      "Ramaswamy, whom Forbes says has a net worth of about $1 billion, dropped out of the presidential race in January after running on an \"anti-woke\"\u00a0campaign. He also advocated for government cuts by eliminating the Department of Education, a goal shared by President-elect Trump.",
      "Have administrations previously tried to cut costs?",
      "Yes, both Republican and Democratic presidents have created efforts to cut government spending.",
      "In 1982, President Ronald Reagan created the Grace Commission, led by wealthy businessman J. Peter Grace, the CEO of W. R. Grace & Company, a chemicals business. About 150 business people volunteered for the commission, which ultimately recommended 2,500 reforms, according to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.",
      "\"Most of the recommendations, especially those requiring legislation from Congress, were never implemented,\" the library notes. \"However, the Commission's work provided a starting point for many conservative critiques of the federal government.\"",
      "In the 1990s, President Bill Clinton created the National Performance Review with the goal to create a government that would work better and cost less, Kamarck said. The group was staffed with civil servants who understood the bureaucracy, and many of whom had frustrations with it, she added.",
      "The group had some successes in streamlining operations and paring costs, eventually cutting more than 300,000 jobs, according to a study from the Congressional Research Service. Kamarck noted that the group also focused on integrating technology into departments at a time when the internet was just emerging, leading to efficiencies such as online tax filing.",
      "Where could the Trump administration cut spending?",
      "While experts are skeptical of Musk's claim he can cut $2 trillion in spending, they also point out there are opportunities to look at efficiencies.",
      "Eliminating Medicare fraud is one area that could result in savings, according to the Citizens Against Government Waste, a nonpartisan group that looks at government spending. Its recommendations also include reducing the nation's contributions to the U.N. and ending subsidies for some agricultural products, like dairy and sugar. Its projected savings: $377 billion in the first year, or about 19% of the $2 trillion that Musk is eyeballing.",
      "But efficiency goes beyond cost-cutting, Kamarck noted. It's also about understanding how the bureaucracy works.",
      "\"Every single thing in the federal government is big and complicated, and there are layers and layers of complexity,\" she noted. \"Al Gore and I relied on hundreds of experienced civil servants to tell us how this worked \u2014 and if you don't do this, which I suspect they won't because Musk is an arrogant billionaire, you will fail.\"",
      "Does Musk have conflicts of interest?",
      "Yes, as Musk's SpaceX works with the Department of Defense and NASA, with the federal government pledging $3 billion to his companies last year, according to the New York Times. Tesla, meanwhile, has been investigated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, as well as by other agencies.",
      "Federal employees are generally required to disclose their financial assets and entanglements to ward off any potential conflicts of interest, and to divest significant holdings relating to their work. Because Musk and Ramaswamy would not be formal federal workers, they would not face those requirements or ethical limitations.",
      "Then there's also the question of Musk's ability to juggle another major role, given that he is also running several businesses, from Tesla to SpaceX, Columbia Business School's Morris noted.",
      "\"The whole question of Elon coming into government, that he's going to be this sort of roving efficiency expert, like a McKinsey consultant looking over the shoulders of the entire government \u2014 it's absurd on so many levels,\" Morris said. \"He's already the CEO of companies that are very demanding of his time.\"",
      "He added, \"To do work in government of this sort, you have to be process-oriented in a way that he has never been before.\"",
      "The Associated Press\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

The recall follows the death of a 66-year-old man who became trapped between a mattress and a bed rail in November at a residential care facility in South Carolina.",
      "The recall involves three models of Medical King Bed Assist Rail with Adjustable Heights (model numbers 7007 and 7057) and the Bed Assist Rail Without Legs (model number 7037). The recalled rails sold online for about $40 on Amazon.com, eBay, Kohls.com, medicalkingusa.com and Target Plus from January 2020 through March 2024.",
      "People who purchased the products, which are made in China, should stop using them and contact Medical King for a repair kit or replacement bed rail, depending on the model.",

      "CPSC data shows that 92% of fatalities associated with adult portable bed rails are from entrapment, usually of the head or neck.",
      "The agency issued new mandatory safety standards for adult portable bed rails in January 2023.",
      "Often purchased for sick or frail older people, the side rails or metal bars are used on hospital beds and in home care with the idea of helping patients pull themselves up or to keep them from falling out of bed. But these products \u2014 which are marketed as safety devices and sold by retailers including\u00a0Amazon\u00a0and\u00a0Walmart, as well as by\u00a0medical supply\u00a0stores \u2014 have shown to be unsafe for many, with thousands of elderly and disabled patients injured by them.",

      "Sealed bids were opened Wednesday at the auction, which had been\u00a0approved by a bankruptcy court earlier this year to allow the Sandy Hook families to receive payments from Jones. The conspiracy theorist and his company filed for bankruptcy in 2022 after losing defamation and emotional distress lawsuits by Sandy Hook families after he repeatedly called the Connecticut school shooting a hoax staged by \"crisis actors.\"",
      "The purchase was confirmed by conspiracy theorist Jones, who posted a video on X saying that The Onion bought his company. \"The Connecticut Democrats with the Onion newspaper bought us,\" he said in the post, describing the bidding as \"competitive.\"",

      "The auction house said the necklace, composed of three rows of diamonds finished with a diamond tassel at each end, had emerged \"miraculously intact\" from a private Asian collection to make its first public appearance in 50 years.",

    "story": [
      "With Republicans edging closer to gaining control of Congress, millions of Americans may be at risk of losing enhanced subsidies that currently underwrite the cost of health insurance bought through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces, according to industry experts and the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The November 5 election gave control of the Senate to Republicans, while control of the House remains in limbo Monday as votes in several critical races continue to be tallied. Currently, Democrats are projected to win at least 210 House seats and Republicans 215 seats, with a party needing 218 seats in order to have the majority.",
      "If Republicans gain control of Congress, they are widely expected to allow the enhanced ACA subsidies to expire at the end of 2025, depriving many people who buy coverage through the ACA and who currently receive these subsidies of that financial assistance, according to health care policy experts.",
      "So-called enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, which lower the cost of health plans for millions of Americans and were passed under the Biden administration, will expire unless lawmakers renew them. During his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump backed efforts by Republican lawmakers to repeal the ACA, but hasn't yet revealed his plans for the program, commonly known as Obamacare, for his second term in office.",
      "Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a campaign stop last week just before the Nov. 5 election that \"the ACA is so deeply ingrained, we need massive reform to make this work, and we've got a lot of ideas on how to do that.\"",
      "Who is eligible for enhanced ACA subsidies?",
      "Americans with incomes over 400% of poverty \u2014 those who make just above four times the poverty level, or $103,280 for a family of four \u2014 are eligible for the enhanced ACA insurance subsidies. They also increase financial help for those who were already eligible for assistance under the ACA.",
      "KFF, an independent health policy nonprofit, estimates\u00a0the subsidies have cut premiums for eligible enrollees by 44%, or $705 annually. The organization says that if the tax credit expires, average premiums for subsidized enrollees in 12 states would at least double.",
      "In 2024, of the 21.6 million Americans who purchased health insurance plans from ACA marketplaces, 20.1 million received enhanced subsidies,\u00a0according\u00a0to the CBO.",
      "People most at risk of losing ACA coverage if the enhanced subsidies lapse are those who live in states where health insurance premiums are particularly high, including in rural parts of the U.S. Middle-income households that depend on the enhanced subsidies could see a sharp rise in premiums, Cynthia Cox, vice president and ACA policy researcher at KFF, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"They could go from paying no more than 8.5% of their income to easily paying 20% or more,\" she said. \"I imagine a lot of those folks would drop coverage.\"",
      "Without enhances subsidies, many middle income ACA Marketplace enrollees with incomes just above four times poverty would be priced out of health insurance coverage, according to Cox.",
      "Subsidies remain for 2025",
      "Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at\u00a0healthinsurance.org, noted that 93% of people who buy health insurance through ACA marketplaces receive enhanced subsidies. A sharp increase in their premiums would lead many to drop their coverage, leaving them uninsured, she said.",
      "The CBO\u00a0estimates\u00a0that 22.8 million total Americans will enroll in ACA marketplace health insurance plans in 2025. The agency expects enrollment to drop sharply, from 22.8 million to 18.9 million, in 2026 if the subsidies are not renewed. By 2030, enrollment could dip to 15.4 million people without the enhanced subsidies.",
      "For now, the subsidy enhancements will remain in place through the end of 2025.",
      "\"If people are signing up now during open enrollment, their coverage will take effect in January, and it will cover them for the whole year. Their premiums won't change \u2014 they're good for 2025,\" Norris said.",
      "The enhanced subsidies, which were first passed in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, will have been in place for roughly five years when they expire in 2025, or about half as long as the ACA marketplace has existed, Cox said.",
      "Enrollment in ACA plans has roughly doubled since the enhance subsidies have been in place, she noted, with most of that growth coming from low-income enrollees. \"That's one group you might expect to see, if they have to start making a higher premium payments, would drop their coverage,\" she said.",

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump claims he can unilaterally impose sweeping tariffs on U.S. imports. The reality is more complicated, according to trade experts.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump, who recently described \"tariff\" as\u00a0\"the most beautiful word in the dictionary,\" has proposed a range of taxes on imports from other countries. The president-elect's stated aim: to reduce American companies' use of foreign goods and parts by raising their cost, a policy he contends would strengthen the U.S.' international trade position and boost job growth at home.",
      "Trump has also claimed that he doesn't need Congress' support to impose sweeping tariffs. The reality is more complicated, according to economists and foreign trade experts.",
      "What has Trump proposed?",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump proposed tariffs of up to 60% on Chinese goods. He's offered few additional details, however, such as whether the tariffs would apply to all goods or just certain categories of products.",
      "He's also proposed much broader tariffs of 10% to 20% on all imports, including those from key allies and trade partners, and has promised retaliatory levies on any country that imposes taxes on American-made goods.",
      "Can Trump unilaterally impose tariffs?",
      "Once he takes office, President-elect Trump has several possible pathways for implementing tariffs.",
      "The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the authority to impose tariffs in Article 1, Section 8, which states that \"The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties\u2026To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.\" But Congress can also selectively delegate tariff-setting authority to the president, which it has done for decades.",
      "In his first term as president from 2017-2021, Trump freely exercised this presidential authority to increase tariffs: Total duties paid on U.S. imports doubled from roughly $37 billion in 2015 to $74 billion in 2020, according to the\u00a0Congressional Research Service.",
      "\"Looking at his previous four years in office, he seems to believe he has the authority to impose tariffs,\" said Jake Colvin, president of the National Foreign Trade Council, a group dedicated to advocating for U.S. companies in international commerce. \"If they decide on day one that they want to use executive authority to put tariffs on Chinese goods, they could probably go ahead and do that.\"",
      "Colvin added that it will be important for the incoming Trump administration to provide businesses with more specifics so that companies can plan accordingly. \"A lot has been proposed in the course of the campaign, so it's important for the administration to give a signal about the path it intends to pursue, for clarity and planning purposes for American businesses,\" he said.",
      "How fast is Trump likely to move?",
      "The president has authority to impose a range of trade restrictions on foreign nations, said Inu Manak, a trade policy fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "\"It seems pretty clear that he would pursue tariffs soon after taking office. During his last term, tariffs were a tool of choice in the trade war against China and against allies, too. So I believe that is a strategy he'll replicate in his next term,\" Manak told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Manak added that he would likely be able to do so without support from Congress. \"The president has quite a bit of discretion to do what he wants,\" she said.",
      "Legal powers at Trump's disposal include Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, under which the president may impose retaliatory tariffs when \"an act policy, or practice of a foreign country \u2026 violates, or is inconsistent with, the provisions of, or otherwise denies benefits to the United States under, any trade agreement, or \u2026 is unjustifiable and burdens or restricts United States commerce.\"",
      "Trump previously\u00a0invoked\u00a0Section 301 to impose tariffs on China in 2018 and 2019 \u2014 many of which have been continued under the Biden administration \u2014 and he could simply expand upon existing tariff actions he's already taken, according to Manak.",
      "\"That would require no action from Congress because they are already in place,\" she said.",
      "What other power Trump does have?",
      "In his previous term as president, he also made use of\u00a0Section 232\u00a0of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. It grants the president the authority to adjust imports, including by imposing tariffs, when they are deemed a threat to national security.",
      "There's also the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), although it hasn't used to restrict trade since President Richard Nixon was in office. The act says: \"Any authority granted to the President by ... this title may be exercised to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat ... to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States, if the President declares a national emergency with respect to such threat.\"",
      "\"The authorities granted to the President ... may only be exercised to deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat with respect to which a national emergency ...\" it adds in part.",
      "In other words, in order to use IEEPA to impose tariffs, Trump would have to declare a national emergency through an executive order, claiming that a U.S. trading partner posed a major threat.",
      "Alan Wm. Wolff, former deputy director-general of the World Trade Organization and a distinguished visiting fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE), is skeptical that Trump has the authority to impose sweeping tariffs under IEEPA.",
      "\"Can it be used against trade with all countries, our allies and friends in Europe and Asia, in the Americas, not to mention the poorest countries in Africa? That would simply be too large a power grab to have been within what Congress intended in this statute,\" he wrote in a recent blog post.",
      "Manak also said Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930 could conceivably give the president the authority to unilaterally raise tariffs. The rarely used act allows the president to impose duties of up to 50% of a product's value, and is triggered when a president finds that a foreign country has imposed an unreasonable charge on, or discriminated against, U.S. commerce.",
      "Typically, though, that has to be determine by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC). \"But the statute's language is ambiguous in terms of what that would look like, and I would imagine he could pursue this without a final finding from ITC, or pursue it while a finding is being made,\" Manak said.",
      "How would sweeping tariffs affect U.S. consumers?",
      "Some companies have already said they're aiming to move production out of China to avoid Trump's proposed tariffs. Shoemaker Steve Madden, for example, said last week week it plans to import fewer goods made in China and replace them with items made in other countries.",
      "If imposed, the proposed tariffs on imports could lead to consumers losing between $46 billion and $78 billion in spending power each year on products including apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear and travel goods, according to the National Retail Federation.",
      "By another estimate, a 20% general tariff on all imported goods, combined with a 60% tariff on goods imported from China, would cost the typical U.S. households more than $2,600 a year. If Trump instead imposed a 10% across-the-board tariff, that would cost families $1,700 more, according to PIIE.",
      "Experts expect the incoming Trump administration to impose some proposed tariffs quickly, while perhaps phasing in or threatening to apply other levies over time in a bid to gain trade concessions.",

      "A deadly E. coli outbreak linked to slivered onions on McDonald's Quarter Pounder burgers has sickened 104 people in 14 states, federal health officials said in an update on Wednesday.",
      "At least 34 people have been hospitalized, and four developed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a serious condition that can cause kidney failure. An 88-year-old man who resided in Grand Junction, Colorado, died, as previously reported. The illnesses began at the end of September, and the most recent onset of illness occurred as of October 21, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. inflation rose 2.6% on an annual basis last month, representing an uptick from September when the Federal Reserve began cutting interest rates amid signs of cooling prices and a weaker labor market.",
      "That matched forecasts from economists polled by FactSet that the Consumer Price Index rose 2.6% in October. The CPI rose 2.4% in September, when the Fed ushered in a jumbo rate cut of 0.5 percentage points, followed by a second rate cut this month.",
      "The slight rise on a month-over-month basis signals that the Fed's battle to tame inflation to its goal of a 2% annual rate might take a bumpy path over the next months. Some types of goods and services, from housing to insurance products, are still experiencing sharply higher prices, crimping consumers' budgets and creating economic headwinds.",
      "\"Looking ahead to the next six months, we foresee consumers and businesses still spending but doing so more prudently amid still-elevated costs and rates,\" noted EY chief economist Gregory Daco in a November 11 research note.",
      "A key driver of last month's inflation bump was the housing market, with shelter prices rising 0.4% in October, contributing about half of the monthly increase, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Wednesday. Transportation costs also rose due to higher airfares and a 14% annual jump in auto insurance, the report said.",
      "Despite the monthly uptick in prices, the Federal Reserve is forecast to cut rates for a third time this year at its December meeting, with two-thirds of economists polled by FactSet predicting a 0.25 percentage point cut. The latest CPI report isn't likely to derail that, given that the inflation numbers were in line with expectations, noted Lindsay Rosner, head of multi sector fixed income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management in an email.",
      "\"Bang in-line core inflation leaves the Fed on track to cut rates in December,\" Rosner wrote. \"After a run of unseasonably hot autumn data, today's number cools fears of an imminent slowdown in the pace of rate cuts.\"",
      "Trump's policies and inflation",
      "The inflation report marks the first since the November 5 election, which handed former President Donald Trump another win. But the president-elect's economic policies, which include a broad-based tariff on all imports and deporting millions of undocumented immigrants, could prove inflationary, economists say.",
      "Trump's plans could boost the inflation rate by as much 1 percentage point, bringing it to an annual rate of about 3.6% \u2014 above the Fed's 2% goal \u2014 some Wall Street experts have forecast.",
      "If that occurs, the Fed would likely slow its pace of rate cuts in order to battle ongoing elevated inflation, experts note.",

      "Meanwhile, at least 11 states have passed privacy laws that would require customers' consent before their genetic data is transferred.",
      "Still, experts say a new owner could change 23andMe's privacy terms following a sale, potentially putting the onus on consumers to push back against any move to share their data.",
      "23andMe said that roughly 80% of its customers consent to participate in the company's research program, which it said has generated more than 270 peer-reviewed publications uncovering new genetic insights into disease. Any data that shared is anonymized and cannot be traced back to individual customers, according to the company.",

    "published": "Wed, 13 Nov 2024 15:03:38 -0500",
    "summary": "One couple took out a loan to cover the out-of-network costs of an abortion and drove eight hours to a hospital in the neighboring state.",
    "story": [
      "Four women suing over Idaho's strict abortion bans told a judge Tuesday how excitement over their pregnancies turned to grief and fear after they learned their fetuses were not likely to survive to birth \u2014 and how they had to leave the state to get abortions amid fears that pregnancy complications would put their own health in danger.",
      "\"We felt like we were being made refugees, medical refugees,\" said Jennifer Adkins, one of the plaintiffs in the case.",
      "The women, represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, aren't asking for the state's abortion ban to be overturned. Instead, they want the judge to clarify and expand the exceptions to the strict ban so that people facing serious pregnancy complications can receive abortions before they are at death's door.",
      "Currently, the state's near-total ban makes performing an abortion a felony at any stage of pregnancy unless it is \"necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.\"",
      "Adkins' fetus had a severe medical condition that meant the fetus would not survive the pregnancy. The illness also put Adkins at risk of developing \"mirror syndrome,\" a dangerous syndrome that can cause fatally high blood pressure and other issues, she said.",
      "Adkins and her husband, John, decided to seek an abortion, and learned, after another ultrasound showed the fetus still had a heartbeat, that they would have to go out of state to get one.",
      "Idaho law prohibits a woman from getting an abortion when a fetal heartbeat is detected, with the exception of cases of rape, incest or a \"medical emergency,\" defined by the law as \"a condition that, in reasonable medical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death or for which a delay will create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\"",
      "\"No parent wants to wish that when they look at an ultrasound they don't see their baby's heartbeat, yet here I was hoping that I wouldn't,\" Adkins said. \"I wanted the decision to be made for us, and I wanted to end her suffering, so it was really hard to see that and know that we had the challenges ahead of us that we did.\"",
      "\"I was not willing to watch my son suffer\"",
      "Kayla Smith cried as she told the judge how she found out she was pregnant for a second time on Mother's Day of 2022, and how she and her husband chose the name \"Brooks\" for their son. She was around 18 or 20 weeks along in her pregnancy when the sonographer grew quiet during a routine anatomy scan, Smith said.",
      "Brooks' heart had fatal anomalies, and the young family could not find a pediatric cardiologist willing to attempt an operation. The veins supplying Brooks' lungs were also abnormal, Smith said, and he would not survive birth.",
      "Smith had developed dangerously high blood pressure during a previous pregnancy, and she was at risk of developing the condition called preeclampsia again.",
      "\"If I were to continue pregnancy not only would I risk my life with preeclampsia, I was not willing to watch my son suffer and potentially gasp for air,\" Smith said, crying.",
      "Idaho's abortion ban went into effect two days before Brooks' diagnosis, she said, making it impossible for her to get an abortion in her home state.",
      "\"We wanted to meet our son \u2014 that was really important to us \u2014 so we needed to do it in a hospital,\" she said.",
      "They took out a loan to cover the estimated $16,000 to $20,000 out-of-network cost for the procedure and drove more than eight hours to a hospital where doctors induced labor.",
      "\"All four of these women were overjoyed to be pregnant with their second child and all four of them received the worst news a mother can imagine,\" attorney Gail Deady, with the Center for Reproductive Rights, told 4th District Judge Jason D. Scott during opening arguments. All of them sought abortions \"to protect their health, to spare their babies from pain and suffering, and to remain alive and healthy to protect their young children.\"",
      "James Craig, a division chief with the Idaho Attorney General's office, said the women and their attorneys are relying on hypotheticals rather than concrete facts to make their case. Under their proposal, a pregnant woman could receive her abortion for something as minor as stepping on a rusty nail \u2014 even though the risk of infection in that scenario could be easily treated by receiving a tetanus booster shot, Craig said.",
      "\"Unborn children have a fundamental right to life, and protecting the lives of children is a legitimate and fundamental government interest,\" Craig said.",
      "The state also has the same interest in protecting the lives of women, Craig said \u2014 and the abortion ban laws do both, he contended.",
      "In the \"rare circumstances where abortion is necessary\" to prevent the death of the mother, Idaho law allows that to occur, Craig said. The women suing are trying to \"usurp the role of the Legislature\" by asking the judge to rewrite the law, he said, and that is not the proper role of the court.",
      "Dr. Emily Corrigan, an ob-gyn who works in emergency medicine at Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center who is also a plaintiff in the case, told the judge how Idaho's multiple abortion bans have created confusion for physicians and made it difficult to treat pregnant patients who need emergency care.",
      "Doctors have had to \"basically guess which pregnancy conditions would fall under the state medical exception,\" Corrigan said.",
      "\"I have had other hospital staff refuse to participate in the care of my patients because of the lack of understanding of the laws, and this has caused patient care delays,\" she said. \"I have personally cared for several patients who have been denied stabilizing abortion care at other hospitals in Idaho. By the time they arrive at my institution, their conditions have deteriorated and have lead to increased complications that I need to manage.\"",
      "Several conditions can put the health of pregnant people at risk, she said. Some are caused by pregnancy like preeclampsia, and others \u2014 including some chronic illnesses and cancers \u2014 can be made worse by pregnancy, she said. In those cases, delaying an abortion might not cause immediate death but can cause a shortened life span or have dramatic effects on a person's health, Corrigan said.",
      "\"We are not trained to wait until things become urgent or emergent. We are trained to prevent harm to our patients,\" she said.",

      "In effect, pushing China's own people to buy more of their country's own goods and services could, in the view of the two analysts, prove to be Beijing's best protection against Trump's threatened tariffs.",
      "\"The best tool would be to stimulate consumption growth inside China,\" said Chen. \"At the moment, the leadership has not really tried to help the Chinese consumers by sending them government checks and even tax costs to corporations. I think if the Chinese government really moves in that direction more aggressively, then it would help the Chinese economy generate more internal domestic consumption demand to make up for some of their possible lost exports to the U.S.\"",
      "Beijing needs Washington, but tariffs could have a complex impact",
      "During Trump's first term as president, he imposed tariffs ranging from 10% to 25% on Chinese agricultural products imported to the U.S., including seafood, pork and dairy. Beijing retaliated with its own tariffs, kicking off a trade war between the world's two biggest economies.",
      "Nearly eight years later, however, Beijing appears less able to wage such a war, due to its close economic links with the U.S.",
      "\"In terms of retaliation choices for China, it's very limited,\" said Chen. \"China imports a lot of agricultural products like soybeans, corn. They may try to import more such agricultural products from Brazil, and also from Russia as one of their ways to retaliate against the U.S. But at the end of the day, China imports so much [computer] chips from Nvidia, Intel, especially Qualcomm,\" Wang said. \"Those products are what China needs. So, China cannot produce internally.\"",
      "In effect, if Beijing does impose retaliatory tariffs, it could be shooting itself in the proverbial foot. Tariffs would make all those products, vital to China's continued economic and technological development, more expensive for its own people.",
      "But another possible impact of Trump's expected protectionist policies could actually be to push some of America's oldest allies and trade partners closer to China, reversing the so-called decoupling of the U.S. and Western European economies from Beijing that Washington has pushed under Mr. Biden.",
      "5 ways Trump's next presidency could affect the U.S. economy and your money",
      "5 ways Trump's next presidency could affect the U.S. economy and your money",
      "\"The Biden administration did such a good job to more or less unite that,\" said Chen. \"If Trump makes the EU and NATO member countries upset, that makes it more possible for Germany, for France or Italy or even the U.K. to warm up more with China on the trade front. So, that may help neutralize, to some extent, the negative impact of the expected Trump tariffs on Chinese goods.\"",
      "Trump has claimed repeatedly that foreign companies would foot the bill, effectively absorbing the additional costs of exporting to the U.S. market imposed by his tariffs, but many economists disagree, and say it would effectively be a tax on American consumers.",
      "According to findings released by the National Retail Federation last week, U.S. consumers could lose between $46 billion and $78 billion in spending power per year on everything from clothes and toys to household appliances and travel goods if there is a 60% blanket tariff on Chinese goods.",
      "\"Retailers rely heavily on imported products and manufacturing components so that they can offer their customers a variety of products at affordable prices,\" NRF Vice President of Supply Chain and Customs Policy Jonathan Gold said. \"A tariff is a tax paid by the U.S. importer, not a foreign country or the exporter. This tax ultimately comes out of consumers' pockets through higher prices.\"",
      "All of that said, and despite Trump's history of anti-China rhetoric, it remains unclear how quickly his administration might actually move to roll out sweeping tariffs, with some economists speculating that the president-elect plans, initially at least, to use the threat of additional levies as a cudgel to negotiate more favorable trade terms with Beijing. Trump could also choose to gradually phase in tariffs, delaying their full impact on China's economy.",
      "Will China attack Taiwan, and would Trump come to the rescue?",
      "Trump's return to the White House may also help Beijing further its interests with Taiwan, the democratically governed island of 23 million people just off China's east coast that the country considers a renegade province. President Xi Jinping has vowed to bring Taiwan back under Beijing's control, by force if necessary.",
      "Since the U.S. government enacted the Taiwan Relations Act in 1979, the U.S. is strategically committed to aid in Taiwan's defense in the event of any aggression, including by selling weapons to the island's government.",
      "Open to interpretation, however, and left deliberately vague in the U.S. law, is whether Washington is obligated to directly defend Taiwan, using the power of the American military, if it does come under attack.",
      "President Biden, during his first term, said Washington would, breaking with the long-time policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" that the Biden White House later returned to.",
      "\"The sovereignty over Taiwan is the red line of all the red lines,\" Wang told CBS News. \"Trump, in his presidential campaign speeches, he made it very clear\u2026 [that he's] unlikely to send troops to defend Taiwan.\"",
      "\"I believe that China's not going to invade Taiwan anytime soon,\" Wang added, noting that Beijing has \"so many problems it'll have to fix at home.\"",
      "If Beijing did invade Taiwan, the fallout would be felt worldwide.",
      "\"That would be a devastating hit to the global economy,\" said Chen. \"I hope that it would not happen. So, maybe now, given the challenges with the Chinese economy, the leadership is realizing that without a stable economy, then all its global geopolitical ambitions would not have any economic foundation.\"",

      "Spirit acknowledged in a regulatory filing late Tuesday that it is in \"active and constructive discussions\" with bondholders to restructure its obligations as its business woes continue. If the talks succeed, the airline expects operations to continue, and for employees and customers to be shielded from any impact.",

    "published": "Wed, 13 Nov 2024 05:00:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump has called the Biden administration's student loan relief efforts a \"total catastrophe.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Joe Biden made student loan forgiveness a central issue to his administration, rolling out efforts to forgive debt as well as to lower repayments for millions of borrowers. But with President-elect Donald Trump returning to the White House in January, the future of those efforts is now in question.",
      "During the presidential debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump described Mr. Biden's efforts to forgive student borrowers as \"a total catastrophe.\" While he hasn't explicitly addressed his plans for student loans, he's called for eliminating the Department of Education, which manages the $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio.",
      "It's unclear which agency or group would manage those loans if the Education Department were to be eliminated, a step that would require approval from Congress. The Trump campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about Trump's plans for student debt relief.",
      "There's a lot on the line for the 46 million Americans who hold $1.7 trillion in student loans, a financial burden that about half of borrowers say has impacted their life choices, delaying home purchases or starting their families, according to a 2021 Morning Consult study. Mr. Biden's term is drawing to an end with two of his key relief efforts tied up in the courts, adding to the uncertainty about what Trump's second presidency will mean for those plans.",
      "\"We know what is in Project 2025, and we know what we saw in the first Trump administration,\" Persis Yu, managing counsel for the Student Borrower Protection Center, an advocacy group for people with student loans. \"We just should be very concerned about what the next administration will mean for borrowers.\"",
      "The next Trump administration may be unlikely to continue the Biden administration's effort to fight against ongoing lawsuits targeting current student debt relief efforts, according to NerdWallet lending expert Kate Wood in an email. That could mean an end to those programs, experts say.",
      "\"Programs that the Biden administration created or expanded access to via regulatory changes could be easily rolled back,\" she added.",
      "What has Trump said about student loan relief?",
      "During his September debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump bashed the Biden administration's efforts.",
      "\"When they said they're going to get student loans terminated and it ended up being a total catastrophe. He went out, got rejected again by the Supreme Court,\" Trump said, referring to the high court's 2023 decision\u00a0that blocked Mr. Biden's initial student loan forgiveness program, which would have provided up to $20,000 in relief per borrower.",
      "\"So all these students got taunted with this whole thing about \u2014 this whole idea. And how unfair that would have been. Part of the reason they lost,\" he added.",
      "What does Project 2025 say about student loans?",
      "Project 2025\u00a0\u2014 an initiative overseen by the conservative Heritage Foundation to guide the next Republican president in an overhaul of the executive branch \u2014 calls for the abolishment of the Department of Education, and says student loans should be handled by the private sector. It also advocates for scuttling student loan relief.",
      "\"The new administration must end the practice of acting like the federal student loan portfolio is a campaign fund to curry political support and votes,\" Project 2025 says. \"The new administration must end abuses in the loan forgiveness programs. Borrowers should be expected to repay their loans.\"",
      "It's unclear whether Trump agrees with those views, although he has called for an end to the Education Department. While on the campaign trail, Trump distanced himself from Project 2025, calling some of the proposals \"abysmal.\"",
      "What is the status of Biden's student loan relief plans?",
      "Currently, there are two student loan relief plans that are tied up in court, both of which are being challenged by Republican-led states.",
      "The\u00a0Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, is an income-driven repayment program, which pegs a borrower's monthly payment to their income, lowering their financial costs. Some lower-income borrowers in SAVE have monthly payments of $0.",
      "The plan's 8 million enrollees are now in limbo, however, after court rulings blocked the Biden administration from implementing the plan. Currently, those borrowers are in forbearance through April, meaning that their loans are essentially paused while the Biden administration defends the plan in court.",
      "Separately, another Biden administration plan to use\u00a0the Higher Education Act to erase all or some of the student debt held by 30 million borrowers has also hit a legal roadblock, with a court putting that plan on hold in October.",
      "In the latter case, the Republican states argued that Mr. Biden's plan sought to \"unlawfully mass cancel up to hundreds of billions of dollars in student loans.\" The Education Department vowed to defend both plans.",
      "What could happen to these programs under Trump?",
      "Bob Eitel, who served during the first Trump administration as a senior counselor to the education secretary, said he expects the president-elect will move to rescind the proposed loan cancellation regulations.",
      "\"The Trump administration may pursue different avenues of loan relief, but it will not be the mass, blanket types of forgiveness that the current administration has pursued,\" said Eitel, president and co-founder of the Defense of Freedom Institute for Policy Studies.",
      "Some other student loan relief programs may remain, such as the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which would be tougher to eliminate but could become less accessible, said NerdWallet's Wood.",
      "That program, which was signed into law by former President George W. Bush in 2007, forgives student debt for public workers like teachers and police officers after 10 years in repayment. The Biden administration reworked the PSLF to make it easier for people to qualify for forgiveness, after the vast majority of people who applied were told they were ineligible.",
      "During Trump's first term, the Education Department was overseen by Betsy DeVos, who promoted school choice in K-12 and also called for deep spending cuts. She also proposed ending the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, although she was unsuccessful.",
      "Do Americans support student loan relief?",
      "It's a divisive issue among voters, with people's views colored by their political leanings and whether they themselves have student debt, according to an AP-Norc poll published in June.",
      "Only 15% of Republicans believe student loan forgiveness is important, versus 58% of Democrats. More than half of people currently paying student loans say it's an important issue, versus one-third of those with no experience with student debt, the poll found.",
      "Republicans have objected to Mr. Biden's efforts because they could deprive some lenders of revenue, while some object to forgiving loans for people who enrolled in college, given that a minority of Americans have college degrees.",
      "The Biden administration is \"saddling working Americans with Ivy League debt,\" said Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey in a September statement.",

      "Grocery prices continue to eat a hole in household budgets, with many Americans citing the economy and inflation as top issues\u00a0behind their votes in the November 5 election. But there are signs that consumers may soon get a break on their grocery bills, with some food prices falling in October from a year earlier \u2014 the first decline in four years.",
      "Online grocery prices dipped 0.1% in October from a year \u2014 that marks the first dip since January 2020, before the pandemic shuttered the U.S. economy and sent inflation soaring, according to new\u00a0data from Adobe's Adobe Digital Price Index (DPI), which tracks online prices.",
      "Online grocery prices represent what consumers pay when they order food from retailers such as Walmart, Whole Foods and others through apps or websites.",

But the October price decline signasl that shoppers could get more relief ahead in the grocery aisles, with a Credit Karma survey in May\u00a0finding that about one-quarter of Americans had skipped a meal due to food costs.",
      "Grocery inflation more broadly has also cooled after hitting a pandemic-era peak of 13.5% in August 2022. In September, the cost of food that consume at home rose 1.3%, below the Federal Reserve's goal of driving inflation down to a 2% annual rate. And grocery prices may remain relatively flat in 2025, with the USDA projecting that food-at-home costs will increase only 1.6% next year.",
      "More broadly, online prices across all product categories dropped 2.9% in October from a year earlier, Adobe said. The decline was led by drops in prices for clothing and toys, which fell about 10% and 4%, respectively.",

      "The Consumer Price Index for October will be released on November 13, with economists forecasting that inflation rose at an annual rate of 2.6% last month, according to economists surveyed by FactSet. That would reflect an uptick from September's 2.4% rate but a sharp decline from a year ago, when U.S. prices were still rising at a an annual rate of 3.2%.",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 16:07:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Measure that would repeal so-called \"government pensions offset\" has been gaining support in House.",
    "story": [
      "The House is expected to try to pass a Social Security-related bill this week to ensure benefits for workers who are also eligible for other pensions, despite a surprise move by hard-right Freedom Caucus leaders to derail the effort.",
      "It's a quick turnaround to salvage what had been a bipartisan effort to pass the bill, called the\u00a0Social Security Fairness Act, during what's now the lame-duck post-election period of the Congress.",
      "What is the Social Security Fairness Act?",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act would repeal the so-called \"government pensions offset,\" or GPO, which reduces Social Security spousal or widow(er) benefits for those who receive noncovered pensions, according to the Social Security Administration's\u00a0website.",
      "The summary also says the bill also eliminates the so-called \"windfall elimination provision\" that \"in some instances reduces Social Security benefits for individuals who also receive a pension or disability benefit from an employer that did not withhold Social Security taxes.\"",
      "Such pensions are paid by employers \u2014 typically, state and local governments or non-U.S. employers \u2014 that do not withhold Social Security taxes from employee salaries.",
      "\"The GPO reduces the spousal or widow(er) benefit by two-thirds of the monthly non-covered pension and can partially, or fully, offset an individual's spousal/widow(er) benefit, depending on the amount of the non-covered pension,\" according to SSA.gov.",
      "The bill would repeal the GPO provision and reinstate full Social Security benefits.",
      "For instance, under the GPO, an individual with a $900 spousal benefit from Social Security, who also has a $1,000 non-covered pension, would see their Social Security benefit reduced by $667, or two-thirds the non-covered pension amount. That leaves them with a $233 remaining spousal benefit.",
      "If the GPO measure is repealed, the same individual would be entitled to the entire $900 spousal benefit amount without an offset reduction.",
      "Does the bill have bipartisan support?",
      "Yes, the bill was introduced by a Republican, Rep. Garrett Graves of Louisiana, and a Democrat, Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, and it has gained support in the House. A robust 300 lawmakers, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, have signed on to it.",
      "Other groups have also supported the bill, such as the National Association of Counties, which represents county governments. That group says that eliminating the GPO would help county governments recruit workers at a time when many are facing labor shortages.",
      "What happened next to the bill?",
      "To force the legislation forward, the sponsors of the bill, Rep. Graves and Rep. Spanberger, this fall used a rarely successful process called a discharge petition.",
      "They collected the minimum 218 signatures needed from House lawmakers to dislodge the bill from committee and send it to the floor for a vote.",
      "The move is often seen as an affront to House leaders, particularly the House speaker and the majority leader who determine the floor schedule.",
      "But Spanberger and Graves \u2014 who both did not seek reelection \u2014 had little to lose. Besides, Johnson backed the bill before becoming speaker.",
      "Did the House Freedom Caucus block the Social Security bill?",
      "Two leaders of the conservative House Freedom Caucus intervened when the rest of Congress was away from Capitol Hill, mostly in home states for Election Day.",
      "The Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., and former chair Rep. Bob Goode, R-Va., used a routine pro forma session of the House on Nov.\u00a05 to swiftly table part of the measure.",
      "The Freedom Caucus tends to block new spending. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the bill would add some $196 billion to the federal deficit over a decade.",
      "Graves said that's the amount people are missing out on without reinstating full Social Security benefits.",
      "But in tabling the legislation the conservatives actually set back its procedural rule, but not the bill itself.",
      "The legislation is expected to move forward with a House vote anyway, possibly in the week ahead.",
      "Could the Social Security Fairness Act still pass?",
      "Yes, but that said, passage will now be tougher, requiring a supermajority threshold rather than a simple majority as had been planned under the rule that the Freedom Caucus leaders turned back.",
      "If it passes the House, it's unclear if the bill has enough support to clear the Senate. But the wide margin in the House indicates potentially broad support.",
      "It would then go to President Joe Biden's desk. If signed into law, the summary says the changes are effective for benefits payable after December 2023.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 13:45:39 -0500",
    "summary": "Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will head an effort, dubbed DOGE, to reduce wasteful federal spending. Here's what it's about.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump is vowing to reduce wasteful federal spending by tapping two billionaires \u2014 Tesla CEO Elon Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy \u2014 to spearhead the initiative, which the president-elect is calling the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.",
      "The appointments, announced by Trump on Tuesday, raise a host of questions about the effort, including whether Musk and Ramaswamy will have the authority to make changes in federal outlays, given that Congress authorizes the nation's spending, as well as where the businessmen might look to cut spending. Under the plan, meanwhile, DOGE is not an official government department, raising questions about its powers and how it will operate.",
      "The announcement comes a week after Trump won a second term\u00a0as president, with voters expressing their dissatisfaction with the economy under the Biden administration. As part of his campaign vows, Trump promised to slash government spending. Musk's bio on X, the social media platform he bought in 2022, now reads, \"The people voted for major government reform.\"",
      "\"Frankly, it does need to be done again, so every few decades you really need to look at everything,\" Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution who managed the Clinton Administration's National Performance Review, an effort to cut government spending in the 1990s, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "But Kamarck harbors reservations about Musk and Ramaswamy's mandate, especially after the former recently suggested he could find more than $2 trillion in savings \u2014 almost one-third of the federal government's $6.7 trillion in annual spending. Two-thirds of that spending is mandatory through programs including Social Security and Medicare, while discretionary spending is largely spent on defense.",
      "\"This is the first warning sign that this is going to be a failed operation,\" Kamarck said. \"That's insane.\"",
      "Speaking on transformational change within government and organizations, Michael Morris, a professor at Columbia University's Columbia Business School, noted there are two models: a bottom-up, grassroots effort and a top-down strategy \u2014 sometimes called a shock-change approach. DOGE likely belongs to the latter, according to Morris, who is also author of the nonfiction book \"Tribal,\" about how people form and relate to each other through group dynamics.",
      "\"Unless you have a new leader with incredible legitimacy and the status quo with no legitimacy, you rarely have people responding well to shock therapy,\" he said. \"It's hard to see it happening in this case \u2014 I don't think Musk is going to be able to form a deep knowledge of government.\"",
      "The Trump campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "What is the Department of Government Efficiency?",
      "Trump announced the DOGE in a statement on Tuesday, describing it as an effort to \"slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies.\"",
      "The name is a nod to Musk's support for a cryptocurrency called dogecoin, which was created as a joke by two software engineers and uses the image of a smiling Shiba Inu dog. (Dogecoin has more than tripled in price during the last month, and now trades at 38 cents.)",
      "Trump said Musk and Ramaswamy's work \"will conclude no later than July 4, 2026,\" or by the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Trump only outlined the initiative's contours and didn't disclose how it will be staffed or funded. The Trump campaign didn't respond to a request about the DOGE's funding or whether Musk or Ramaswamy will be paid for their work on the effort.",
      "Can the DOGE actually cut federal spending?",
      "At the moment, that appears unlikely given that the DOGE isn't a real government department, which would need to be created by congressional approval. Federal spending is authorized by Congress, and senators and House representatives may hesitate to support cuts to major programs like Social Security or Medicare, which are popular with millions of voters, or to the nation's military.",
      "It's also not clear how the organization will operate. It could come under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which dictates how external groups that advise the government must operate and be accountable to the public.",
      "Trump described Musk and Ramaswamy's role as providing \"advice and guidance from outside of government.\"",
      "That doesn't amount to much, Kamarck said.",
      "\"They have no authority \u2014 none whatsoever,\" she added, while noting that the backing of the president can help convince lawmakers to throw their support behind efficiency efforts.",
      "However, Trump's aides are reportedly working on a way to enact some of DOGE's spending recommendations without requiring congressional approval, the Washington Post reported.",
      "What have Musk and Ramaswamy said about federal spending?",
      "Musk, the world's richest person with a net worth of $319 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, has described the U.S. government as bloated and said it its spending is unsustainable. The Tesla founder also said he wants to reduce the number of federal agencies to 99, down from more than 400.",
      "\"There are so many [agencies] that people have never heard of, and that have overlapping areas of responsibilities,\" Musk\u00a0said earlier this month.",
      "While on the campaign trail with Trump, Musk also\u00a0said\u00a0he could cut \"at least $2 trillion\" from the annual budget. \"Your money is being wasted, and the Department of Government Efficiency will fix that,\" Musk said.",
      "Musk is known for cost-cutting at his own companies, slashing\u00a0most of X's workforce after he bought the business two years ago as well as focusing on manufacturing costs at Tesla. Even so, those efforts have had mixed results, with X's valuation falling by about 80% since his purchase. Tesla's stock price, meanwhile, has surged 48% in the past year, bumping its value above $1 trillion.",
      "Ramaswamy, whom Forbes says has a net worth of about $1 billion, dropped out of the presidential race in January after running on an \"anti-woke\"\u00a0campaign. He also advocated for government cuts by eliminating the Department of Education, a goal shared by President-elect Trump.",
      "Have administrations previously tried to cut costs?",
      "Yes, both Republican and Democratic presidents have created efforts to cut government spending.",
      "In 1982, President Ronald Reagan created the Grace Commission, led by wealthy businessman J. Peter Grace, the CEO of W. R. Grace & Company, a chemicals business. About 150 business people volunteered for the commission, which ultimately recommended 2,500 reforms, according to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.",
      "\"Most of the recommendations, especially those requiring legislation from Congress, were never implemented,\" the library notes. \"However, the Commission's work provided a starting point for many conservative critiques of the federal government.\"",
      "In the 1990s, President Bill Clinton created the National Performance Review with the goal to create a government that would work better and cost less, Kamarck said. The group was staffed with civil servants who understood the bureaucracy, and many of whom had frustrations with it, she added.",
      "The group had some successes in streamlining operations and paring costs, eventually cutting more than 300,000 jobs, according to a study from the Congressional Research Service. Kamarck noted that the group also focused on integrating technology into departments at a time when the internet was just emerging, leading to efficiencies such as online tax filing.",
      "Where could the Trump administration cut spending?",
      "While experts are skeptical of Musk's claim he can cut $2 trillion in spending, they also point out there are opportunities to look at efficiencies.",
      "Eliminating Medicare fraud is one area that could result in savings, according to the Citizens Against Government Waste, a nonpartisan group that looks at government spending. Its recommendations also include reducing the nation's contributions to the U.N. and ending subsidies for some agricultural products, like dairy and sugar. Its projected savings: $377 billion in the first year, or about 19% of the $2 trillion that Musk is eyeballing.",
      "But efficiency goes beyond cost-cutting, Kamarck noted. It's also about understanding how the bureaucracy works.",
      "\"Every single thing in the federal government is big and complicated, and there are layers and layers of complexity,\" she noted. \"Al Gore and I relied on hundreds of experienced civil servants to tell us how this worked \u2014 and if you don't do this, which I suspect they won't because Musk is an arrogant billionaire, you will fail.\"",
      "Does Musk have conflicts of interest?",
      "Yes, as Musk's SpaceX works with the Department of Defense and NASA, with the federal government pledging $3 billion to his companies last year, according to the New York Times. Tesla, meanwhile, has been investigated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, as well as by other agencies.",
      "Federal employees are generally required to disclose their financial assets and entanglements to ward off any potential conflicts of interest, and to divest significant holdings relating to their work. Because Musk and Ramaswamy would not be formal federal workers, they would not face those requirements or ethical limitations.",
      "Then there's also the question of Musk's ability to juggle another major role, given that he is also running several businesses, from Tesla to SpaceX, Columbia Business School's Morris noted.",
      "\"The whole question of Elon coming into government, that he's going to be this sort of roving efficiency expert, like a McKinsey consultant looking over the shoulders of the entire government \u2014 it's absurd on so many levels,\" Morris said. \"He's already the CEO of companies that are very demanding of his time.\"",
      "He added, \"To do work in government of this sort, you have to be process-oriented in a way that he has never been before.\"",

    "summary": "The DOJ launched a civil rights investigation into conditions at the Fulton County Jail after several inmates had died in a matter of weeks. One inmate, according to his family, was \"eaten alive\" by bed bugs.",
    "story": [
      "The jail in Georgia's largest county, Fulton County, leaves its inmates vulnerable to \"substantial risk of serious harm from violence\" and violates their constitutional and statutory rights, according to a new Justice Department report released Thursday.",
      "After a more than year-long civil rights probe into the Fulton County Jail \u2013 which has long been plagued by overcrowding, understaffing and violence \u2014 federal investigators concluded detainees are subjected to \"dangerous and unsanitary\" conditions, like pest infestations and malnourishment. These conditions especially endanger those with mental health conditions, the report found.",
      "\"None of these problems are new,\" the report said. \"And despite widespread awareness of these issues, the unconstitutional and illegal conditions have persisted.\"",
      "The Justice Department launched its civil investigation into Fulton County's jail in July 2023, after at least four Black inmates died in the mental health unit in a matter of weeks, including two who were killed by their cellmates. \"Within weeks of opening our investigation, six more Black men had died in the Jail,\" the Justice Department revealed. The family of one inmate, Lashawn Johnson, said he died in in the jail in 2022, after he was \"eaten alive\" by insects and bedbugs. About 91% of the jail's total population is Black, according to the report, compared to 45% of the overall Fulton County population.",
      "Justice Department investigators conducted multiple site visits, expert consultations and interviews with inmates and staff.",
      "Crumbling infrastructure, failing security, abusive staff and insufficient medical and mental health treatment contributed to the overall unconstitutional conditions described in the report.",
      "According to the county sheriff, 62% of the jail's inmates suffer from mental health or substance use disorders and the staff failed to provide proper treatment or take steps to mitigate risks of suicide.",
      "\"We found that 75% of those who died in the Jail since January 2021 had a current mental health diagnosis or reported a history of mental illness,\" the report said.",
      "Justice Department investigators noted in their findings that Fulton County and the sheriff sought to remedy some of the issues, including by surging millions in emergency funding and sending some inmates to detention facilities in other districts.",
      "Still, the problems persisted. In 2024, three men in Fulton County's main jail have died, including one person who was stabbed 20 times in April. From 2022 to the present, according to the report, \"six incarcerated people have died in violent attacks.\" All six victims were Black men, the Justice Department said.",
      "Non-lethal violent assaults are also rampant inside the jail. In 2023, the Sheriff's Office said there were 1,054 assaults and more than 300 stabbings in the jail. The investigation also uncovered a pattern or practice of sexual abuse, according to the report.",
      "Announcing the report's findings, Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Department said officials in Fulton County have taken \"preliminary steps\" to address the issues outlined in the report, but such measures are \"not enough.\"",
      "The Justice Department's report outlines various remedial measures the jail must carry out to improve the conditions, like increased accountability measures for staff, overhauling how the jail secures its facilities from violence and contraband, and ensuring proper suicide prevention measures.",
      "\"At the end of the day, people do not abandon their civil and constitutional rights at the jailhouse door,\" Clarke said. \"We can fix these problems,\" she added later.",
      "The Fulton County Sheriff's Office, which runs the jail, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Justice Department officials on Thursday noted the sheriff had cooperated with the probe.",

      "The House Ethics Committee, which has been conducting an investigation into sexual misconduct and obstruction allegations against Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, scheduled a vote for Friday on whether to release its report, according to three sources with knowledge of the committee's work.",
      "Hours after President-elect Donald Trump said he planned to nominate\u00a0Gaetz to be attorney general, Gaetz resigned his congressional seat, effective immediately.",

      "The news of the scheduled vote was first reported by Punchbowl. Now that Gaetz has resigned, it is unclear whether the panel will vote on releasing the report, since Gaetz is no longer in Congress.",
      "In June, the House Ethics Committee\u00a0released a statement\u00a0saying it was investigating a range of allegations against Gaetz, including sexual misconduct, illicit drug use, and bribery.",
      "Multiple sources at the time told CBS News that\u00a0four women\u00a0had informed the House Ethics Committee that they had been paid to go to parties that included sex and drugs, and that Gaetz had also attended. The committee has Gaetz's Venmo transactions that allegedly show payments for the women.",
      "Gaetz has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and has called the committee's investigation a \"frivolous\" smear campaign.",
      "There is precedent in Congress on the Senate side for an ethics committee report to become public after a member resigns from Congress, however. In 2011, this happened when Sen. John Ensign of Nevada resigned amid allegations that he tried to hide an extramarital affair.",
      "But it's not clear that that would apply to the House, leaving open the possibility that the report on Gaetz would not be released.",
      "Among those who have given testimony to the House Ethics Committee is a woman who says she had sex with Gaetz at a 2017 party shortly after he was elected to Congress. The woman was 17 at the time.",

      "\"The sequence and timing of Mr. Gaetz's resignation from the House raises serious questions about the contents of the House Ethics Committee report,\" Durbin said in a statement Thursday. \"We cannot allow this valuable information from a bipartisan investigation to be hidden from the American people.

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 10:39:59 -0500",
    "summary": "Who are the high rollers who bankrolled Trump and Republicans in the 2024 election, and what do they want in return for their generosity?",
    "story": [
      "More than $20 billion flooded into the 2024 presidential campaign, shattering the record for political spending in a single election. In an accelerating trend in American politics, Donald Trump, Kamala Harris and their allies raised colossal sums of money from billionaires.",
      "A majority of these megadonors were Republicans, according to Open Secrets, the nonpartisan watchdog organization that tracks the influence of money on politics.\u00a0 And with Trump's decisive victory, they hit the jackpot.",
      "So, who are these high rollers and what do they want in return for their generosity?",
      "Often, megadonors get lumped together in a single basket as plutocrats whose largesse is mostly about increasing their wealth with government contracts, tax breaks and regulatory relief, corrupting the democratic process along the way, according to critics of the U.S.' campaign finance system. There's certainly truth to that, but the story is more complicated.",
      "The super wealthy titans of tech and industry don't always share the same motivations and goals.\u00a0 Some are single-minded about bankrolling candidates as a way to bolster their bottom lines. But others are more ideologically driven, passionate about pet policies or reforming the way the government operates. Still others are driven by the scale of their ambitions or they crave the contact high of proximity to power.",
      "In some ways political giving defies neat categories, and some megadonors may have overlapping interests.\u00a0 Some donors' primary motivation may be an ideological commitment to unleashing the power of free markets, but that may also benefit their personal business interests.",
      "Others may be more transactional, fending off government investigations into their businesses or securing lucrative contracts, although that might coincide with their political beliefs.",
      "\"Megadonors can have a variety of financial, ideological or personal motivations for pouring millions into politics,\" said Brendan Fischer, deputy executive director of Documented, an investigative watchdog group. \"These motivations can operate on a spectrum or as a Venn diagram.\"",
      "But either way, with so much money flooding into American politics, it is helpful to be aware of the agendas and interests behind the torrent of cash gushing into the system. What follows is a taxonomy of the Republican donor class in the wake of a momentous election that has many wondering where the country is headed and who stands to benefit from the money that is driving the change.",
      "The Oligarch",
      "One dictionary definition of an oligarch is a \"very wealthy business leader who helps to run the government.\" That would seem to fit Elon Musk, the world's richest man, who personally gave more than $130 million (and his super PAC gave $200 million) to help Trump win back the White House. Musk has wasted no time taking advantage of his election dividend.",
      "He's been weighing in on key staffing decisions, has been named to head up (along with Vivek Ramaswamy) a commission on government efficiency and, according to Axios, even joined a call that Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week. Musk also traveled with Trump to Washington Wednesday for meetings with President Biden and with congressional Republicans.",
      "Musk stands to benefit financially from that clout he has with the incoming administration. His companies are mammoth players across some of the most powerful sectors of the economy, from electric vehicles to rocketry and space exploration, from satellite-powered internet technology to artificial intelligence. According to the New York Times, Musk has at least 100 different contracts with the federal government with 17 different agencies. His SpaceX rocket company already has tens of billions of dollars in government contracts and stands to gain billions more during a Trump presidency.",
      "And Musk has carefully cultivated key government regulators who could bring him a financial windfall after Trump takes office. One, according to Politico, is FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, who Trump is expected to name as the agency's chairman. Carr has been critical of his fellow commissioners for cutting Musk's Starlink satellite company out of the Biden administration's rural broadband program, denying him hundreds of millions or even potentially billions in subsidies.",
      "Meanwhile look for Musk to influence SEC and other regulatory appointments that could stop investigations into his businesses. But what makes Musk unique is that his influence far transcends U.S. policies that could benefit his own businesses. Musk, through his global business empire, has the power to affect geopolitics on a scale perhaps greater than any person outside of government in history.",
      "His personal wealth, estimated at $314 billion dollars (it jumped about $70 billion since Trump was elected), is greater than the GDP of multiple countries combined and the defense budgets of many industrialized Western countries. Musk's Starlink owns at least half of the satellites currently in orbit. Through Starlink, Musk has the power to alter the course of wars, since the communications constellation he controls is often the primary way governments can get internet access in combat zones. His ambitions seem boundless \u2014 he even hopes to be at the forefront of colonizing space.",
      "And none of that even takes into account his ownership of X, the social media platform he bought for $44 billion in 2022 and positioned as a MAGA megaphone to help Trump.",
      "\"All oligarchs have wealth power at their disposal, but not all are positioned in the same way,\" said Jeffrey Winters, a professor at Northwestern who is an expert on oligarchs. \"Some sell candy bars everyone eats. Others are engaged in space, high tech, own major media or have defense contracts. This takes their power to another level.\"",
      "The Pragmatist",
      "These are the megadonors who are laser-focused on influencing policy and legislation on behalf of their business interests. They may be hard-edged conservatives, but they are pragmatic about how their political giving can help their bottom line and the American economy. A quintessential example would be Ken Griffin, the billionaire founder of the Citadel hedge fund, who gave $100,000,000 in the 2024 cycle, putting him at No. 5 on the list of top contributors, according to Open Secrets.",
      "A self-described \"Reagan Republican,\" Griffin has long given to more establishment-oriented Super PACs like the Senate Leadership Fund and its counterpart in the lower chamber, the Congressional Leadership Fund. He has not donated to Trump. Nor has he given money to political causes closely associated with Trump's America First agenda. Instead, he has been tactical in his giving, focusing often on Republican candidates in down-ballot races who have business experience or are military veterans and can give Congress a more business-oriented complexion.",
      "\"Griffin is more of an establishment Republican more aligned with the traditional goals of the party, rather than the Trumpy wing,\" says Anna Massoglia, a campaign finance expert.",
      "Griffin said in a statement to CBS News, \"I'm grateful for our country and for all those who've come before us. Going forward, we all share a duty to further strengthen our nation and improve the lives of our fellow citizens. As such, I support solution-oriented leaders who share my commitment to individual rights and freedom, economic policies encouraging prosperity and upward mobility, access to high-quality education for all children and young adults, safe communities, and a strong national defense.\"",
      "A more cutting-edge example of the pragmatists are donors who back the crypto-currency industry.\u00a0Crypto Super PACs such as Fairshake and Defend American Jobs have been determined in their contributions to help elect pro-crypto candidates.",
      "Defend America Jobs poured in $40 million to help elect Bernie Moreno, the crypto-friendly candidate who defeated long-time Democratic incumbent Sherrod Brown in the Ohio Senate race. Among those boosters of crypto and other digital currencies who gave heavily during the 2024 cycle were Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, whose venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz ponied up $45.2 million to pro-crypto super PACs. CBS News was not able to reach Andreesen Horowitz for comment.",
      "Winklevoss Capital Management, the firm run by twin brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, chipped in another $5 million. \"The crypto army is striking!\" Tyler Winklevoss posted on X on Election NIght, hailing Brown's defeat. But bucking the trend toward purely partisan contributions, the crypto industry gives to Republicans and Democrats alike, so long as they commit to keeping their industry unshackled by government regulations.",
      "The Ideologue",
      "These megadonors are more driven by personal causes that are not directly tied to their business interests. A representative example is Miriam Adelson, who along with her now-deceased husband Sheldon Adelson has been a casino magnate and major supporter of Jewish and Israel causes. In 2024, Miriam Adelson contributed more than $132 million to help Trump's election effort. Adelson knows that her largesse drives results.",
      "After the Adelsons donated tens of millions of dollars to help Trump win the White House in 2016, the new president announced the U.S. government would recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and said he would move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The Adelsons even offered to pay for the construction of the new embassy. Miriam Adelson has not responded to a request for comment.",
      "\"These are passion projects, not attempts to feather the nest,\" says one Republican who knows Adelson but asked not to be named in discussing her donations.",
      "Another high-profile example of ideological givers are the billionaire shipping supply magnates Richard and Elizabeth Uihlein. The Wisconsin-based manufacturers of cardboard boxes and other packaging supplies, the Uihleins' business skyrocketed in sales in 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic ignited an e-commerce boom. The Uihleins did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "During the 2024 campaign cycle, they were among the top five political donors, contributing more than $133 million to conservative causes. While much of their money went to Trump's election, they also gave generously to other MAGA-allied causes. They've given to so-called election integrity groups that questioned the results of the 2020 election, as well as organizations like Moms for Liberty, which advocates against public school curricula that mention LGBTQ rights or critical race theory and supports book bans.",
      "The Enigma",
      "Some megadonors are so discreet about their political giving that it is hard to know what category they belong in. One example is Tim Mellon, the reclusive railroad magnate and heir to the Gilded Age Mellon fortune who happens to have given more money to Trump's election (at least $197 million) than any other donor.",
      "Mellon doesn't go on cable TV or hobnob with politicos at party conventions, but he has written a memoir and penned some opinion pieces that offer some clues. Early in his adult life, he held liberal views on race, the problem of income equality and the environment. But as Mellon's business career evolved, he developed a strong antipathy for what he viewed as intrusive government regulations on business, which seems to have strongly shaped his political views.",
      "One defining episode for Mellon occurred after he bought an airport in Connecticut in the late 1990s. He cut down 340 trees, arguing that they posed a danger to pilots landing their planes. But state environmental regulators ultimately sued him and won. He was ordered to pay tens of thousands of dollars in damages. Did that experience fuel his desire to influence politics with his vast fortune? Perhaps, but it is also the case that Mellon has contributed to causes that would seem to have little to do with his particular business interests.",
      "In the 2024 cycle he also gave $25 million to support Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s presidential run. Some speculated that Mellon was trying to be a spoiler to help Trump, whom he was also backing financially.\u00a0 But last August, he wrote an article in the American Spectator explaining his support for Kennedy.\u00a0 Mellon, it turns out, is a COVID-19 vaccine skeptic. \"I could not fathom how a 'vaccine' could be foisted on the general public with so little (if any) adequate testing.\"",
      "He began giving to Kennedy's Children's Health Defense, which promotes false information about vaccines \u2014 and later to the Super PAC supporting Kennedy. None of that would seem to help Mellon's personal business interests. Mellon did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "summary": "House Speaker Mike Johnson said Matt Gaetz, whose selection as attorney general prompted backlash, resigned from Congress.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump says he will nominate longtime ally GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida to serve as his attorney general\u00a0\u2014 a choice that quickly prompted backlash from Democrats and some Republicans over Gaetz's history. Following Trump's announcement, Gaetz resigned from his seat in the House of Representatives, House Speaker Mike Johnson said.",
      "Gaetz, who has represented Florida's 1st Congressional District since 2017, has been the focus of several investigations into his conduct.",
      "In a statement on social media, Trump praised him as a \"tenacious attorney\" who will \"end Weaponized Government, protect our Borders, dismantle Criminal Organizations and restore Americans' badly shattered Faith and Confidence in the Justice Department.\"\u00a0Gaetz said\u00a0said on X, \"It will be an honor to serve as President Trump's Attorney General!\"",
      "If confirmed, Gaetz would lead the Justice Department \u2014 a federal agency of more than 100,000 employees \u2014 and oversee its numerous investigative components, including the FBI. Gaetz's ascent to the Justice Department's top job will come at a unique time, after Mr. Trump spent all of his 2024 presidential campaign under federal investigation or prosecution.",
      "Johnson said Wednesday night that Gaetz had already submitted his letter resigning from Congress, effective immediately.",
      "\"That caught us by surprise a little bit,\" Johnson said. \"But I asked him what the reasoning was, and he said, 'Well, you can't have too many absences,'\" referring to the GOP's slim majority in the House of Representatives. Johnson said Florida law would allow Gaetz's replacement to be selected within the next eight weeks or so.",
      "\"I've already placed a call to Gov. DeSantis in Florida and said, 'Let's start the clock,'\" Johnson said.",
      "In the letter, later obtained by CBS News, Gaetz wrote: \"I hereby resign, as United States Representatives for Florida's First Congressional District, effective immediately, and I do not intend to take the oath of office for the same office in the 119th Congress, to pursue the position of Attorney General in the Trump Administration.\"",
      "In a confirmation process, Gaetz would undoubtedly face questions about an ongoing review by the bipartisan House Ethics Committee, which said in a statement earlier this year it was looking into allegations that Gaetz may have \"engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts, dispensed special privileges and favors to individuals with whom he had a personal relationship, and sought to obstruct government investigations of his conduct.\"",
      "Prior to his resignation, the committee had scheduled a vote Friday on whether to release its report into Gaetz, three sources with knowledge of the committee's work told CBS News. Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, on Thursday called on the House Ethics panel to preserve and share the report, as well as \"all relevant documentation\" on Gaetz with his committee.",
      "Gaetz has denied all wrongdoing and maintained his innocence throughout a Justice Department probe \u2014 closed last year \u2014\u00a0 into allegations that he violated sex trafficking laws and obstructed justice. Federal prosecutors in Florida did not file any charges in the case and informed the congressman that the case was closed.",
      "Senators, who will vote on his confirmation, began to weigh in as they learned of Trump's intent to nominate Gaetz.",
      "\"He wants to be the top cop, so I would say that yeah, he's certainly going to have to answer all those things, whether they're legit or not legit,\" GOP Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said of past allegations against Gaetz. \"Some of these investigations are still open, obviously.\" Cramer also said the pick was \"a surprise to me\" and expressed some reservations.",
      "\"The one thing about Matt was that concerned me a little bit. I didn't like the way he handled the squabble with with Speaker McCarthy.\" He said he was for every one of Trump's other nominees, adding, \"Matt could earn that, but I'm not there right out of the chute with Matt.\"",
      "\"This one was not on my bingo card,\" GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska told reporters. \"I don't think this is a serious nomination for attorney general. We need to have a serious attorney general.\"",
      "Senate Republican conference Chair John Barrasso, when asked by reporters about Gaetz, said, \"The president is going to continue to make his appointments. We're going to continue to look forward to them coming to the Senate and have hearings and get his Cabinet confirmed as quickly as possible.\"",
      "Sources told CBS News that the most conceivable, easiest and fastest way to install Gaetz would be for the House and Senate to recess shortly after Inauguration Day so that Gaetz and others could be installed through recess appointments, a temporary option that doesn't require Senate confirmation.",
      "One former senior Justice Department official during Trump's first administration told CBS News that \"Matt Gaetz has no business running DOJ.\"",
      "Gaetz, who has served on the House Judiciary Committee and has been a vocal critic of the Biden administration, would take over the post as the first confirmed attorney general under a Trump presidency since Bill Barr. Barr resigned in 2020 when then-President Trump sought to remain in power after he lost the election. Barr left office at the end of that year and was replaced by an acting attorney general, Jeff Rosen. Rosen and a number of his subordinates later testified against Trump during a hearing of the House select committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol. The former officials alleged that Trump had sought to pressure the Justice Department to investigate his claims of election fraud.",
      "Attorney General Merrick Garland, a former federal judge, appointed numerous special counsels to conduct investigations into high-profile figures, including Mr. Biden, his son Hunter and Mr. Trump.",
      "Gaetz's expected nomination comes as some of the president-elect's supporters have called for change inside the Justice Department. Attorney Mark Paoletta, who was thought to be in the running to serve as Mr. Trump's attorney general, said, \"Career DOJ lawyers must be fully committed to implementing President Trump's policies or they should leave or be fired.\"",
      "\"If the president wants to deport illegal aliens, secure the border, ban race-based 'affirmative action' and DEI, investigate antisemitism, halt Big Tech censorship, grant pardons and commutations to Jan 6th defendants, he has every right to expect that these perfectly lawful policies are implemented,\" Paoletta wrote. \"It is absolutely unacceptable for career employees to seek to thwart this policy agenda.\"",
      "Trump's first term brought tension between the White House and his two Senate-confirmed attorneys general, Jeff Sessions and Barr. Sessions, who angered Trump because he recused himself from the Justice Department investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, was forced out shortly after the 2018 midterm elections.",
      "In a statement released after last week's election results, the Justice Department said it is \"committed to ensuring an orderly and effective transition to the new Administration.\"",
      "Beyond the political implications, like attorneys general of both parties who have preceded him, Gaetz would likely try to shape the Justice Department around the priorities of the president. And he would be all but certain to reverse course on various Biden-era policies, too.",
      "Trump has called for mass deportations, pardons for some of those convicted in the ongoing Jan. 6 investigation and regulation slashing \u2014 all actions in which the Justice Department is likely to play a central role.",
      "Trump and Republicans have long criticized Garland's leadership and targeted various Justice Department initiatives, including the expansion of civil rights and business regulation cases. Under the Trump administration, that is likely to come to an end.",
      "Much of next attorney general's work would depend on who Trump appoints to lead various Justice Department divisions, like those that handle national security and criminal matters. Trump's pick to oversee the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel will also likely be key to Trump's agenda because this office will issue decisions on the department's legal interpretation of the president's decisions. For instance, it could cement the president's power to fire certain political appointees and career government officials.",
      "FBI Director Christopher Wray reports directly to the attorney general. He was nominated by Trump in 2017 for a ten-year term. Since then, however, the president-elect has criticized the Bureau amid the federal probes into Trump's conduct, and he has vowed to implement reforms.",

    "title": "Can Trump impose tariffs without Congress? It's complicated, experts say.",
    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 07:28:19 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump claims he can unilaterally impose sweeping tariffs on U.S. imports. The reality is more complicated, according to trade experts.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump, who recently described \"tariff\" as\u00a0\"the most beautiful word in the dictionary,\" has proposed a range of taxes on imports from other countries. The president-elect's stated aim: to reduce American companies' use of foreign goods and parts by raising their cost, a policy he contends would strengthen the U.S.' international trade position and boost job growth at home.",
      "Trump has also claimed that he doesn't need Congress' support to impose sweeping tariffs. The reality is more complicated, according to economists and foreign trade experts.",
      "What has Trump proposed?",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump proposed tariffs of up to 60% on Chinese goods. He's offered few additional details, however, such as whether the tariffs would apply to all goods or just certain categories of products.",
      "He's also proposed much broader tariffs of 10% to 20% on all imports, including those from key allies and trade partners, and has promised retaliatory levies on any country that imposes taxes on American-made goods.",
      "Can Trump unilaterally impose tariffs?",
      "Once he takes office, President-elect Trump has several possible pathways for implementing tariffs.",
      "The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the authority to impose tariffs in Article 1, Section 8, which states that \"The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties\u2026To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.\" But Congress can also selectively delegate tariff-setting authority to the president, which it has done for decades.",
      "In his first term as president from 2017-2021, Trump freely exercised this presidential authority to increase tariffs: Total duties paid on U.S. imports doubled from roughly $37 billion in 2015 to $74 billion in 2020, according to the\u00a0Congressional Research Service.",
      "\"Looking at his previous four years in office, he seems to believe he has the authority to impose tariffs,\" said Jake Colvin, president of the National Foreign Trade Council, a group dedicated to advocating for U.S. companies in international commerce. \"If they decide on day one that they want to use executive authority to put tariffs on Chinese goods, they could probably go ahead and do that.\"",
      "Colvin added that it will be important for the incoming Trump administration to provide businesses with more specifics so that companies can plan accordingly. \"A lot has been proposed in the course of the campaign, so it's important for the administration to give a signal about the path it intends to pursue, for clarity and planning purposes for American businesses,\" he said.",
      "How fast is Trump likely to move?",
      "The president has authority to impose a range of trade restrictions on foreign nations, said Inu Manak, a trade policy fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "\"It seems pretty clear that he would pursue tariffs soon after taking office. During his last term, tariffs were a tool of choice in the trade war against China and against allies, too. So I believe that is a strategy he'll replicate in his next term,\" Manak told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Manak added that he would likely be able to do so without support from Congress. \"The president has quite a bit of discretion to do what he wants,\" she said.",
      "Legal powers at Trump's disposal include Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, under which the president may impose retaliatory tariffs when \"an act policy, or practice of a foreign country \u2026 violates, or is inconsistent with, the provisions of, or otherwise denies benefits to the United States under, any trade agreement, or \u2026 is unjustifiable and burdens or restricts United States commerce.\"",
      "Trump previously\u00a0invoked\u00a0Section 301 to impose tariffs on China in 2018 and 2019 \u2014 many of which have been continued under the Biden administration \u2014 and he could simply expand upon existing tariff actions he's already taken, according to Manak.",
      "\"That would require no action from Congress because they are already in place,\" she said.",
      "What other power Trump does have?",
      "In his previous term as president, he also made use of\u00a0Section 232\u00a0of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. It grants the president the authority to adjust imports, including by imposing tariffs, when they are deemed a threat to national security.",
      "There's also the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), although it hasn't used to restrict trade since President Richard Nixon was in office. The act says: \"Any authority granted to the President by ... this title may be exercised to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat ... to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States, if the President declares a national emergency with respect to such threat.\"",
      "\"The authorities granted to the President ... may only be exercised to deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat with respect to which a national emergency ...\" it adds in part.",
      "In other words, in order to use IEEPA to impose tariffs, Trump would have to declare a national emergency through an executive order, claiming that a U.S. trading partner posed a major threat.",
      "Alan Wm. Wolff, former deputy director-general of the World Trade Organization and a distinguished visiting fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE), is skeptical that Trump has the authority to impose sweeping tariffs under IEEPA.",
      "\"Can it be used against trade with all countries, our allies and friends in Europe and Asia, in the Americas, not to mention the poorest countries in Africa? That would simply be too large a power grab to have been within what Congress intended in this statute,\" he wrote in a recent blog post.",
      "Manak also said Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930 could conceivably give the president the authority to unilaterally raise tariffs. The rarely used act allows the president to impose duties of up to 50% of a product's value, and is triggered when a president finds that a foreign country has imposed an unreasonable charge on, or discriminated against, U.S. commerce.",
      "Typically, though, that has to be determine by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC). \"But the statute's language is ambiguous in terms of what that would look like, and I would imagine he could pursue this without a final finding from ITC, or pursue it while a finding is being made,\" Manak said.",
      "How would sweeping tariffs affect U.S. consumers?",
      "Some companies have already said they're aiming to move production out of China to avoid Trump's proposed tariffs. Shoemaker Steve Madden, for example, said last week week it plans to import fewer goods made in China and replace them with items made in other countries.",
      "If imposed, the proposed tariffs on imports could lead to consumers losing between $46 billion and $78 billion in spending power each year on products including apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear and travel goods, according to the National Retail Federation.",
      "By another estimate, a 20% general tariff on all imported goods, combined with a 60% tariff on goods imported from China, would cost the typical U.S. households more than $2,600 a year. If Trump instead imposed a 10% across-the-board tariff, that would cost families $1,700 more, according to PIIE.",
      "Experts expect the incoming Trump administration to impose some proposed tariffs quickly, while perhaps phasing in or threatening to apply other levies over time in a bid to gain trade concessions.",
      "\"We would imagine that within a few months of him taking office, we would see the first tranche of tariffs taking effect,\" Manak said.",

      "The pair became embroiled in an extraordinary war of words during Trump's first presidency, initially sparked by Khan speaking out against a U.S. travel ban on people from certain Muslim countries.",
      "Trump then accused Khan -- the first Muslim mayor of a Western capital when he was first elected in 2016 -- of doing a \"very bad job on terrorism\" and called him a \"stone cold loser\" and \"very dumb.\"",
      "The mayor in turn allowed an unflattering blimp of Trump dressed as a baby in a diaper to fly above protests in Parliament Square during his 2018 visit to Britain.",
      "Speaking on a podcast recorded before Trump's re-election on November 5 and released earlier this week, Khan, a son of Pakistani immigrants to Britain, said he viewed the past targeting of him as \"incredibly personal.\"",
      "\"If I wasn't this color skin, if I wasn't a practicing Muslim, he wouldn't have come for me,\" he told the High Performance podcast, which interviews prominent people in different sectors.",
      "\"He's come for me because of, let's be frank, my ethnicity and my religion.\"",
      "Khan added that during this period he was \"speaking out against somebody whose policies were sexist, homophobic, Islamophobic, racist\" and that he has \"a responsibility to speak out.\"",
      "His latest comments on Trump are in stark contrast to those of his colleagues in Britain's Labour party, which swept to power in July.",
      "Several Labour members of Parliament now in senior government posts, including Foreign Secretary David Lammy, were critical of Trump while they were in opposition during his first White House term.",

      "\"I'm delighted and honored,\" Johnson said Wednesday evening at a news conference.",
      "The leadership elections were held at the same time that President-elect Donald Trump announced his intention to nominate Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, one of the most controversial members of the conference who led last year's revolt against former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, as attorney general.",
      "Johnson expressed confidence on Tuesday that he will win the speakership in the first round of voting on the House floor in January. It took his predecessor, McCarthy, 15 rounds and four days to secure the speaker's gavel in 2023.",
      "Several House members said earlier Wednesday that Johnson had the support of Trump, who attended their candidate forum earlier in the day with Elon Musk, who Trump has tapped to lead the new \"Department of Government Efficiency.\"",
      "\"You don't fire people after you win the majority, and every one of those people in our leadership worked hard.

      "Thune, the current whip, won 29 votes on the second round of voting against the former Whip Sen. John Cornyn, who received 24. Sen. Rick Scott was eliminated after the first round after receiving the least votes.",
      "Meeting behind closed doors on Wednesday morning, the Republican senators cast secret ballots to elect their new leadership, as the three candidates vied for Senate Republican leader, with President-elect Donald Trump's shadow looming over the race.",
      "A candidate needed a majority of the conference, or 27 votes, to become leader.",
      "\"It's a new day in the United States Senate and it's a new day in America,\" Thune told reporters following the leadership elections. \"The American people have loudly rejected the failed policies of the Biden-Harris-Schumer agenda.\"",

      "Thune of South Dakota, Cornyn of Texas and Scott were gunning for the top role, having worked behind the scenes for months to win support from their colleagues. But the leadership race took on new meaning following the 2024 elections, which saw Republicans take control of the Senate for the 119th Congress. With Trump's return to the White House next year, and with Republicans projected to retain control of the House, the GOP will have a unified government in Washington, teeing up a long list of legislative priorities for the new Senate leader to work on with Trump.",
      "Though Trump didn't make an endorsement in the leadership race, he loomed large over the contest, weighing in with demands for the new leader to speed the confirmation of his nominees. Thune made clear Wednesday that the the GOP majority will work to process Trump's nominees quickly.",

      "\"For over two decades, Tulsi has fought for our country and the freedoms of all Americans,\" Trump said in a statement announcing Gabbard as his pick. \"As a former candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, she has broad support in both parties \u2014 she is now a proud Republican!\"",
      "The president-elect said Gabbard \"will bring the fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our intelligence community, championing our constitutional rights, and securing peace through strength.\"",
      "The position requires Senate confirmation.",
      "Gabbard does not have experience in the field of intelligence and opposes the United States' intervention in the war in Ukraine.",
      "In February 2022, just as Russia was preparing to invade Ukraine, Gabbard took to social media to blame the Biden administration, writing, \"This war and suffering could have easily been avoided if Biden Admin/NATO had simply acknowledged Russia's legitimate security concerns regarding Ukraine's becoming a member of NATO, which would mean US/NATO forces right on Russia's border.\"",
      "Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in 2019 that she believed the Russians were \"grooming\" a Democratic presidential primary contender to be a third-party candidate, which appeared to be a reference to Gabbard. Gabbard sued Clinton for defamation in 2020, but dropped the suit shortly after it was filed.",
      "In 2019, Gabbard also expressed opposition to U.S. involvement in Syria's civil war and said the country's leader, Bashar al-Assad, \"is not the enemy of the United States because Syria does not pose a direct threat to the United States.\" Gabbard\u00a0met with Assad\u00a0in 2017, which she defended at the time as a \"fact-finding mission,\" but in 2019 she described him a \"brutal dictator.\"",
      "Gabbard served in the Army National Guard for more than 20 years and was deployed to Iraq and Kuwait. She was elected as a Democrat to represent Hawaii in Congress in 2012 and served four terms. During her tenure in the House, Gabbard served on the Armed Services, Homeland Security and Foreign Affairs committees.",
      "During the 2020 presidential campaign, she opted not to pursue another term in the House and instead\u00a0mounted a longshot bid\u00a0for the Democratic presidential nomination.",
      "Gabbard\u00a0announced in 2022\u00a0that she would be leaving the Democratic Party, claiming it was \"under the complete control of an elitist cabal of warmongers\" driven by \"wokeness.\"",
      "She endorsed Trump in his bid for the White House in August and was\u00a0tapped to serve\u00a0as co-chair of his transition team with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who had also been a lifelong Democrat until he ran for president as an independent and then endorsed Trump.",
      "Trump has spent the days following his election to a second term\u00a0filling the ranks of his Cabinet and senior staff at the White House. Among those the president-elect has tapped for his national security team are Rep. Michael Waltz of Florida for national security adviser, former Rep. John Ratcliffe for CIA director and Fox News host Pete Hegseth for secretary of defense.",
      "Gabbard's selection to join Trump's administration continues a shift in political allegiance for the former Democrat, who endorsed Vermont Sen.

But \"our institutions don't have to incentivize that in places where traditionally \u2014 not traditionally \u2014 over human history, men in those positions are more capable.\" Ashton Carter, who was defense secretary during the Obama administration, opened all combat roles to women in 2015.",
      "Hegseth is the author of the recent book \"The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free,\" a New York Times bestseller, in which he denounces what he calls the \"warped, woke, and caustic policies of our current military.\"",
      "In it, he blamed former President Barack Obama and the Pentagon for shortfalls in recruitment, claiming they \"embraced the social justice messages of gender equity, racial diversity, climate stupidity, and the LGBTQA+ alphabet soup in their recruiting pushes.\" He continued: \"Only one problem: There just aren't enough lesbians from San Francisco who want to join the 82nd Airborne. Not only do the lesbians not join, but those very same ads turn off the young, patriotic, Christian men who have traditionally filled our ranks.\"",
      "In 2021, Hegseth was one of 12 National Guard members removed from a role guarding President Biden's inauguration after vetting by military officials due to possible extremist ties. He\u00a0has tattoos associated with white supremacists and neo-Nazis (on a recent podcast, Hegseth defended one as \"just a Christian symbol\").",
      "Hegseth previously served as head of Concerned Veterans for America, a group backed by conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch.",
      "In 2012, Hegseth\u00a0ran for Senate\u00a0as a Republican in his home state of Minnesota but withdrew from the race following the state convention. Kurt Bills, a state representative, won the GOP nomination but lost in the general election to Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar.",
      "Hegseth has \"an excellent background as a junior officer but does not have the senior national security experience that secretaries need,\" Mark Cancian, a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told The Associated Press, adding that the lack of experience might make it more difficult for Hegseth to get through Senate confirmation.",
      "Asked about the choice Tuesday night, Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst told CBS News that Hegseth is \"going to be a very strong secretary.\"",
      "But much of the rest of the initial reaction from other GOP senators was muted.",
      "Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, asked what he thought of Hegseth for the post, responded, \"I'd have to think about it.\"",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina called the choice \"interesting,\" and Sen. Todd Young of Indiana said he doesn't have \"a sense of his background.\"",
      "\"Wow,\" was the response from Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, when she learned of the selection from a reporter. Asked if Hegseth was a good choice, she replied, \"I'm just surprised. I'm not going to comment whether it's good, bad or indifferent. I'm just surprised because the names that I've heard for secretary of defense have not included him.\"",
      "On his confirmation prospects, Murkowski said, \"I don't know.\"",

Two sources familiar with the case said that Rahman worked for the CIA, but did not say whether he was a contractor or employee.",

      "Washington \u2014 Special counsel Jack Smith is expected to have departed the Justice Department by the time President-elect Donald Trump takes office in late January, two sources familiar with his plans told CBS News, as he and his team make plans to wind down the two federal prosecutions against the incoming president.",
      "By leaving before the start of Trump's second term, Smith would keep the president-elect from firing him, as Trump has said repeatedly he plans to do. The special counsel is expected to issue a final report, as required by Justice Department rules, though it will likely be more historical than factual.",
      "It's unclear when the report will be submitted to Attorney General Merrick Garland and likely sent to Congress, as the attorney general has done with reports from other special counsels\u00a0before they were made public. The New York Times first reported Smith's plans to step down.",
      "Smith was appointed by Garland two years ago to take over the Justice Department's investigations into Trump: the first involving his handling of sensitive government documents after leaving office at the end of his first term; and the second related to an alleged scheme to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 presidential election.",
      "The special counsel brought charges last year against Trump as a result of both probes. The president-elect was charged with 40 counts\u00a0related to the documents marked classified recovered from his South Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, and his alleged attempts to interfere with the Justice Department's investigation. He was also charged with four counts stemming from what prosecutors said was an unlawful attempt to overturn the results of the last presidential election.",
      "Proceedings in the case related to the 2020 election were paused for several months as Trump pursued claims that he was shielded from federal prosecution by presidential immunity. The Supreme Court ruled in July that former presidents cannot face charges arising from official actions taken while in the White House.",
      "The president-elect pleaded not guilty to all charges and denied any wrongdoing.",
      "But Trump's defeat of Vice President Kamala Harris last week is likely to bring both prosecutions to a close, and CBS News reported last week that the Justice Department and special counsel's office are engaged in active discussions about how to wind down the cases.",
      "The Justice Department has a longstanding policy against prosecuting a sitting president.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump is returning to the White House next year after a decisive victory in the 2024 election. And he's slated to bring with him a number of lawmakers to round out his administration \u2014 from Sen. JD Vance as vice president-elect to Rep.

      "With the moves, the lawmakers will have to vacate their seats after the start of the new Congress in January, teeing up the process to replace them. The process differs between the two chambers, and between states.",
      "Here's how the vacancies will be filled:",
      "Filling vacancies in the Senate",
      "Rules differ across states for how to fill a Senate vacancy. In 45 states, governors appoint replacements to serve until the next election, while in just five states \u2014 Kentucky, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin \u2014 vacancies are filled by expedited special elections.",
      "Trump tapped Vance, an Ohio Republican first elected to the Senate in 2022, as his running mate in July, prompting him to depart from the Senate to serve as vice president following the election. And Trump is expected to name Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida as his nominee for secretary of state, a Cabinet position that requires confirmation by the Senate.",
      "In both Florida and Ohio, the governor appoints a replacement to serve until the next statewide election. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis will appoint someone to fill the respective seats until a special election can be held in 2026. The winner of the 2026 election would serve the remainder of Vance and Rubio's terms, meaning that person would have to run for election again in 2028.",
      "Both DeWine and DeSantis have long histories with Trump, with the Ohio governor being one of the few prominent Republicans who declined to endorse Trump's 2024\u00a0 bid. And DeSantis' relationship with Trump had been similarly frosty, after the two men faced off in the GOP presidential primaries earlier this year. But both Republican governors are expected to work in the best interest of the party, especially after Trump's decisive victory.",
      "Who the governors will appoint to replace Vance and Rubio remains to be seen. In Ohio, names like Secretary of State Frank LaRose, state Sen. Matt Dolan and former Ohio GOP chair Jane Timken have circulated, as have a number of lawmakers who represent Ohio in the House.",
      "In Florida, a number of possibilities have emerged for DeSantis to appoint, including Trump's daughter in-law, Lara Trump, a co-chair of the Republican National Committee. DeSantis's chief of staff James Utheier and Florida Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nunez have also been among names floated, as have Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody and former Florida House Speaker Jose Olivia.",
      "Filling vacancies in the House",
      "In the House, vacancies are filled by special elections. But the timing of those elections can vary.",
      "Trump selected Stefanik, the current Republican conference chair, to serve as his ambassador to the United Nations, teeing up a special election to fill her seat representing New York's 21st congressional district. The district, which Stefanik won by more than 20 points in her reelection bid last week, is solidly red, making it a safe seat for Republicans in a special election. But it will remain vacant until a special election is held \u2014 a timeframe that is set by Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul and could take up to 90 days \u2014 taking away from what is expected to be a narrow Republican majority in the House.",
      "Rep. Michael Waltz, who Trump selected to serve as his National Security adviser, also represents a solidly red district in Florida. His seat will also be filled by a special election, and DeSantis is expected to work to quickly set a timeframe to replace him.",

    "published": "Wed, 13 Nov 2024 05:00:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump has called the Biden administration's student loan relief efforts a \"total catastrophe.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Joe Biden made student loan forgiveness a central issue to his administration, rolling out efforts to forgive debt as well as to lower repayments for millions of borrowers. But with President-elect Donald Trump returning to the White House in January, the future of those efforts is now in question.",
      "During the presidential debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump described Mr. Biden's efforts to forgive student borrowers as \"a total catastrophe.\" While he hasn't explicitly addressed his plans for student loans, he's called for eliminating the Department of Education, which manages the $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio.",
      "It's unclear which agency or group would manage those loans if the Education Department were to be eliminated, a step that would require approval from Congress. The Trump campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about Trump's plans for student debt relief.",
      "There's a lot on the line for the 46 million Americans who hold $1.7 trillion in student loans, a financial burden that about half of borrowers say has impacted their life choices, delaying home purchases or starting their families, according to a 2021 Morning Consult study. Mr. Biden's term is drawing to an end with two of his key relief efforts tied up in the courts, adding to the uncertainty about what Trump's second presidency will mean for those plans.",
      "\"We know what is in Project 2025, and we know what we saw in the first Trump administration,\" Persis Yu, managing counsel for the Student Borrower Protection Center, an advocacy group for people with student loans. \"We just should be very concerned about what the next administration will mean for borrowers.\"",
      "The next Trump administration may be unlikely to continue the Biden administration's effort to fight against ongoing lawsuits targeting current student debt relief efforts, according to NerdWallet lending expert Kate Wood in an email. That could mean an end to those programs, experts say.",
      "\"Programs that the Biden administration created or expanded access to via regulatory changes could be easily rolled back,\" she added.",
      "What has Trump said about student loan relief?",
      "During his September debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump bashed the Biden administration's efforts.",
      "\"When they said they're going to get student loans terminated and it ended up being a total catastrophe. He went out, got rejected again by the Supreme Court,\" Trump said, referring to the high court's 2023 decision\u00a0that blocked Mr. Biden's initial student loan forgiveness program, which would have provided up to $20,000 in relief per borrower.",
      "\"So all these students got taunted with this whole thing about \u2014 this whole idea. And how unfair that would have been. Part of the reason they lost,\" he added.",
      "What does Project 2025 say about student loans?",
      "Project 2025\u00a0\u2014 an initiative overseen by the conservative Heritage Foundation to guide the next Republican president in an overhaul of the executive branch \u2014 calls for the abolishment of the Department of Education, and says student loans should be handled by the private sector. It also advocates for scuttling student loan relief.",
      "\"The new administration must end the practice of acting like the federal student loan portfolio is a campaign fund to curry political support and votes,\" Project 2025 says. \"The new administration must end abuses in the loan forgiveness programs. Borrowers should be expected to repay their loans.\"",
      "It's unclear whether Trump agrees with those views, although he has called for an end to the Education Department. While on the campaign trail, Trump distanced himself from Project 2025, calling some of the proposals \"abysmal.\"",
      "What is the status of Biden's student loan relief plans?",
      "Currently, there are two student loan relief plans that are tied up in court, both of which are being challenged by Republican-led states.",
      "The\u00a0Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, is an income-driven repayment program, which pegs a borrower's monthly payment to their income, lowering their financial costs. Some lower-income borrowers in SAVE have monthly payments of $0.",
      "The plan's 8 million enrollees are now in limbo, however, after court rulings blocked the Biden administration from implementing the plan. Currently, those borrowers are in forbearance through April, meaning that their loans are essentially paused while the Biden administration defends the plan in court.",
      "Separately, another Biden administration plan to use\u00a0the Higher Education Act to erase all or some of the student debt held by 30 million borrowers has also hit a legal roadblock, with a court putting that plan on hold in October.",
      "In the latter case, the Republican states argued that Mr. Biden's plan sought to \"unlawfully mass cancel up to hundreds of billions of dollars in student loans.\" The Education Department vowed to defend both plans.",
      "What could happen to these programs under Trump?",
      "Bob Eitel, who served during the first Trump administration as a senior counselor to the education secretary, said he expects the president-elect will move to rescind the proposed loan cancellation regulations.",
      "\"The Trump administration may pursue different avenues of loan relief, but it will not be the mass, blanket types of forgiveness that the current administration has pursued,\" said Eitel, president and co-founder of the Defense of Freedom Institute for Policy Studies.",
      "Some other student loan relief programs may remain, such as the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which would be tougher to eliminate but could become less accessible, said NerdWallet's Wood.",
      "That program, which was signed into law by former President George W. Bush in 2007, forgives student debt for public workers like teachers and police officers after 10 years in repayment. The Biden administration reworked the PSLF to make it easier for people to qualify for forgiveness, after the vast majority of people who applied were told they were ineligible.",
      "During Trump's first term, the Education Department was overseen by Betsy DeVos, who promoted school choice in K-12 and also called for deep spending cuts. She also proposed ending the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, although she was unsuccessful.",
      "Do Americans support student loan relief?",
      "It's a divisive issue among voters, with people's views colored by their political leanings and whether they themselves have student debt, according to an AP-Norc poll published in June.",
      "Only 15% of Republicans believe student loan forgiveness is important, versus 58% of Democrats. More than half of people currently paying student loans say it's an important issue, versus one-third of those with no experience with student debt, the poll found.",
      "Republicans have objected to Mr. Biden's efforts because they could deprive some lenders of revenue, while some object to forgiving loans for people who enrolled in college, given that a minority of Americans have college degrees.",
      "The Biden administration is \"saddling working Americans with Ivy League debt,\" said Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey in a September statement.",

      "In his own statement, Musk said the new agency \"will send shockwaves through the system, and anyone involved in Government waste, which is a lot of people!\"",

      "\"A smaller Government, with more efficiency and less bureaucracy, will be the perfect gift to America on the 250th Anniversary of The Declaration of Independence,\" Trump wrote. \"I am confident they will succeed!\"",
      "The Trump campaign described the agency as \"potentially, the 'Manhattan Project' of our time,\" referencing the secret World War II program that was involved in developing the atomic bomb.",

      "Scientists say they have found the world's largest coral near the Pacific's Solomon Islands, announcing Thursday a major discovery \"pulsing with life and color.\" The coral is so immense that researchers sailing the crystal waters of the Solomon archipelago initially thought they'd stumbled across a hulking shipwreck.",
      "\"Just when we think there is nothing left to discover on planet Earth, we find a massive coral made of nearly one billion little polyps, pulsing with life and color,\" marine ecologist Enric Sala said.",
      "The standalone structure, formed from a \"complex network\" of tiny coral polyps, has likely been growing for 300 years or more, the researchers said.",
      "At about 111 feet wide and 104 feet long, the team said the \"mega coral\" was three times bigger than the previous record holder \u2014 a coral dubbed \"Big Momma\" in American Samoa. The massive coral is not a coral reef, structures that can be far larger but are comprised of many distinct coral colonies, they explained.",
      "\"While Big Momma looked like a huge scoop of ice cream plopped down on the reef, this newly discovered coral is as if the ice cream started to melt, spreading forever along the seafloor,\" said lead scientist Molly Timmers.",
      "It's longer than a blue whale and thought to be \"so colossal\" that it could be seen from space.",
      "The coral was discovered at the southeastern tip of the Solomon Islands, in an area known as the Three Sisters. It was spotted by a National Geographic team embarking on a scientific expedition in the region.",
      "Hotter and more acidic oceans have drained the life from corals in many of the region's tropical waters, a process called bleaching, including Australia's famed Great Barrier Reef. But this latest discovery offered a small glimmer of hope, the research team said.",

    "summary": "Seal-shaped boards decked with bright horizontal lights were less likely to be attacked by great white sharks, researchers found.",
    "story": [
      "Covering your surfboard in bright lights sounds like an open invitation to great white sharks, but research released Tuesday by Australian scientists found it might actually stave off attacks.",
      "Biologist Laura Ryan said the predator often attacked its prey from underneath, occasionally mistaking a surfer's silhouette for the outline of a seal.",
      "Ryan and her fellow researchers showed that seal-shaped boards decked with bright horizontal lights were less likely to be attacked by great white sharks.",
      "This appeared to be because the lights distorted the silhouette on the ocean's surface, making it appear less appetizing.",
      "\"There is this longstanding fear of white sharks and part of that fear is that we don't understand them that well,\" said Ryan, from Australia's Macquarie University.",
      "The study, published in the journal Current Biology, was conducted in the waters of South Africa's Mossel Bay, a popular great white feeding ground.",
      "Seal-shaped decoys were strung with different configurations of LED lights and towed behind a boat to see which attracted the most attention.",
      "Brighter lights were better at deterring sharks, the research found, while vertical lights were less effective than horizontal.",
      "Macquarie University Professor Nathan Hart, one of the study's authors, said the lights caused a \"complex interaction\" with the shark's behavior.",
      "\"It's like an invisibility cloak but with the exception that we are splitting the object, the visual silhouette, into smaller bits,\" Hart said.",
      "The study's authors released a video showing some of the research in action.",
      "Ryan said the results were better than expected and is now in the process of building prototypes for use on the underside of kayaks and surfboards.",
      "Australia has some of the world's most comprehensive shark management measures, including monitoring drones, shark nets and a tagging system that alerts authorities when a shark is near a crowded beach.",

      "More research was needed to see if bull and tiger sharks -- which have different predatory behavior \u2014 responded to the lights in a similar way, the authors said.",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 07:02:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Oil and natural gas companies will have to pay a federal fee if they emit methane above certain levels under a rule being finalized by the Biden administration that incoming Trump officials are likely to reverse.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Oil and natural gas companies for the first time will have to pay a federal fee if they emit dangerous methane above certain levels under a rule being made final by the Biden administration.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency rule follows through on a directive from Congress included in the 2022 climate law. The new fee is intended to encourage industry to adopt best practices that reduce emissions of methane - the primary component of natural gas - and thereby avoid paying.",
      "Methane is a climate \"super pollutant\" that is far more potent in the short term than carbon dioxide and is responsible for about one-third of greenhouse gas emissions. The oil and natural gas sector is the largest industrial source of methane emissions in the United States, and advocates say reduction of methane emissions is a crucial way to slow climate change.",
      "The rule, set to be announced Tuesday at an international climate conference in Azerbaijan, comes hours after President-elect Donald Trump named former New York congressman Lee Zeldin to head the agency in Trump's second term. If confirmed by the Senate, Zeldin is expected to move to reverse or loosen dozens of environmental regulations approved under President Biden as Trump seeks to establish U.S. \"energy dominance\u2033 worldwide.",
      "Trump is likely to target the methane fee amid a flurry of expected actions he has promised to deregulate the oil and gas industry.",
      "As outlined by the EPA, excess methane produced in 2024 could result in a fee of $900 per ton, with fees rising to $1,200 per ton in 2025 and $1,500 per ton by 2026. Industry groups are likely to challenge the rule, including any effort to impose a retroactive fee.",
      "The rule wouldn't become final until early next year, following publication in the Federal Register.",
      "EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement that the rule will work in tandem with a new EPA rule on methane emissions imposed this year. The rule targets the U.S. oil and natural gas industry for its role in global warming as Mr. Biden seeks to secure his legacy on fighting climate change.",
      "The fee, formally known as the Waste Emissions Charge, will encourage early deployment of available technologies to reduce methane emissions and other harmful air pollutants, Regan said. The fee \"is the latest in a series of actions under President Biden's methane strategy to improve efficiency in the oil and gas sector, support American jobs, protect clean air and reinforce U.S. leadership on the global stage,\" he said.",
      "Industry groups and Republican-led states have challenged the earlier methane rule in court, but lost a bid for the Supreme Court to block the rule while the case continues before lower-level judges.",
      "Opponents argue that the EPA overstepped its authority and set unattainable standards with the new regulations. The EPA, though, said the rules are squarely within its legal responsibilities and would protect the public.",
      "Many large oil and gas companies already meet or exceed methane-performance levels set by Congress under the climate law, meaning they are unlikely to be forced to pay the new fee, Regan and other officials said.",
      "Even so, the EPA estimates that the rule will result in cumulative emissions reductions of 1.2 million metric tons of methane (the equivalent of 34 million metric tons of carbon-dioxide) through 2035. That figure is similar to clean-air gains from taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year, the EPA said. Cumulative climate benefits could total as much $2 billion, the agency said.",
      "Like the earlier methane rule, the new fee faces a near-certain legal challenge from industry groups. The American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's largest lobbying group, called a fee proposed earlier this year a \"punitive tax increase\" that \"undermines America's energy advantage.''",
      "The API said it looks forward to working with Congress to repeal the \"misguided new tax on American energy.\"",
      "Environmental groups, for their part, have hailed the impending methane fee, saying oil and gas companies should be held accountable for pollution that contributes to global warming. Oil and gas companies routinely calculate that it's cheaper to waste methane through flaring and other techniques than to make necessary upgrades to prevent leaks, they said.",
      "The EPA said it expects that over time, fewer oil and gas companies will be charged for excess methane as they reduce emissions in compliance with the rule.",

    "summary": "1970s-era U.S. spy satellite imagery has led archeologists to what they believe is the site of a seventh-century battle that was decisive in the spread of Islam in the region.",
    "story": [
      "Beirut \u2014 Declassified 1970s-era U.S. spy satellite imagery has led a British-Iraqi archeological team to what they believe is the site of a seventh-century battle that became decisive in the spread of Islam throughout the region.",
      "The Battle of al-Qadisiyah was fought in Mesopotamia \u2014 in present-day Iraq \u2014 in the A.D. 630s between Arab Muslims and the army of the Sassanid Persian dynasty during a period of Muslim expansion. The Arab army prevailed and continued on its march into Persia, now Iran.",
      "A joint team of archeologists from the U.K.'s Durham University and the University of Al-Qadisiyah stumbled across the site while undertaking a remote sensing survey to map the Darb Zubaydah, a pilgrimage route from Iraq's Kufa to Mecca in Saudi Arabia built more than 1,000 years ago. The findings were published Tuesday in the journal Antiquity.",
      "While mapping the route, the team noticed that a site some 20 miles south of Kufa in Iraq's southern Najaf province \u2014 a desert area with scattered plots of agricultural land \u2014 had features that closely matched the description of the al-Qadisiyah battle site described in historic texts.",
      "William Deadman, a specialist in archaeological remote sensing at Durham University, said the Cold War era satellite images are commonly used tools by archeologists working in the Middle East because the older images often show features that have been destroyed or altered and wouldn't show up on present-day satellite images.",
      "\"The Middle East has developed so much in the last 50 years, both agricultural expansion and urban expansion,\" he said. Some of the distinguishing features at the al-Qadisiyah site, such as a distinctive trench, were \"much more pristine and clear\" in the 1970s images, he said.",
      "A survey on the ground confirmed the findings and convinced the team that they had correctly identified the site.",
      "The key features were a deep trench, two fortresses and an ancient river that was reportedly once forded by elephant-mounted Persian troops, said Jaafar Jotheri, a professor of archeology at the University of Al-Qadisiyah who's part of the team that made the discovery. The survey team also found pottery shards consistent with the time period when the battle took place.",
      "A revealing, well-known battle",
      "Jotheri said Iraqis of his generation, who grew up under the rule of Saddam Hussein, were all familiar with the battle in minute detail, down to the names of the generals on both sides.",
      "The battle at the time had political connotations \u2014 Iraq was engaged in a devastating war with Iran through much of the 1980s. Saddam pointed to the Battle of Qadisiyah as a harbinger of victory for Iraq.",
      "Like most children growing up in that era, Jotheri said he'd watched a popular movie about the battle multiple times as it was on regular rotation on television.",
      "In the post-Saddam era, al-Qadisiyah has become something of a political litmus test. Iraqis' views of the battle vary depending on their feelings toward Iran, which has expanded its influence in the country since the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq that toppled Saddam.",
      "\"There is some political and religious context in this battle because now, of course, we have religious differences, ethnic differences, political differences in Iraq and we read or we view everything based on our \u2026 differences,\" Jotheri said. But he added, \"We all agree that it is a very important battle, a decisive one, and we all know about it.\"",
      "Discovery was part of a regional trend",
      "The team plans to begin excavations at the site in the coming year, Jotheri said.",
      "The discovery comes as part of a broader project launched in 2015 to document endangered archaeological sites in the region.",
      "It also comes at the time of a resurgence of archeology in Iraq, a country often referred to as the \"cradle of civilization,\" but where archeological exploration has been stunted by decades of conflict that halted excavations and led to the looting of tens of thousands of artifacts.",

    "story": [
      "Three NASA astronauts who just wrapped up a 235-day mission to the International Space Station discussed their flight with reporters Friday, but steadfastly refused to comment on a medical issue of some sort that resulted in one astronaut spending the night in a hospital after landing.",
      "The unidentified astronaut flew back to the Johnson Space Center in Houston the day after splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico on Oct. 25, rejoining their crewmates. But NASA, citing medical privacy issues, provided no details other than to say the astronaut \"is in good health and will resume normal post-flight reconditioning with other crew members.\"",
      "\"I know there may be some interest in our post-flight medical event, where we diverted to a hospital,\" Crew 8 pilot Mike Barratt, a physician-astronaut, told reporters Friday. \"You know, space flight is still something we don't fully understand. We're finding things that we don't expect sometimes, and this was one of those times.",
      "\"We're still piecing things together on this. And so to maintain medical privacy and to let our processes go forward in an orderly manner, this is all we're going to say about that event at this time.\"",
      "Barratt, Crew 8 commander Matt Dominick, astronaut Jeanette Epps and Russian cosmonaut Alexander Grebenkin were launched from the Kennedy Space Center on March 3 and docked at the space station two days later. They returned to Earth last month after an extended stay in space.",
      "Barratt, Dominick and Epps all appeared healthy and in good spirits Friday as they continue their re-adjustment to gravity. Grebenkin flew back to Moscow shortly after splashdown, but in a social media post just after the crew's return to Earth, he was smiling and said to be in good shape.",
      "While the presumably minor medical issue remains a mystery, the crew shared highlights of their stay in space, including details about a water leak during preparations for a June spacewalk that triggered a blizzard in the space station's airlock.",
      "After a spacesuit \"discomfort\" problem forced Dominick and astronaut Tracy Dyson to call off a planned spacewalk on June 13, Dyson and Barratt suited up for another excursion on June 24.",
      "While floating in the airlock with the outer hatch open to space, an umbilical failed to \"seat\" properly and water began spewing into the chamber.",
      "\"Oh, my goodness,\" Dyson said when she noticed the water spewing out. \"There's a lot of water flowing. There's literally water everywhere. ... I've got ice all over my helmet.\"",
      "\"It was not a trivial leak,\" Barratt reflected Friday. \"Anybody who was watching NASA TV at the time could see there was basically a snowstorm, a blizzard spewing from the air lock, because we already had the hatch open. We were seeing flakes of ice in the air lock. Tracy was seeing a lot of them on her helmet, on her gloves, whatnot.",
      "\"So it was...dramatic is the right word, to be real honest. I think literally, Tracy's actions were nowhere short of a heroic to be able to re-mate that umbilical with her hands covered with ice and kind of being vision impaired and getting the air lock closed.\"",
      "Barratt said he grabbed her space-suited legs so Dyson could \"lever that thing closed, and she just made it happen. So yeah, there was a bit of drama. Everything worked out fine. And again, normal processes and procedures saved our bacon.\"",
      "NASA plans to resume spacewalks in January, and Barratt said the suits will be in good shape.",
      "\"I think we're leaving them a brand new umbilical, a really clean interface on that side where we had the problem and the suits are charged and really ready to go,\" he said. \"So I think we are more than ready for the next EVA campaign. I just wish we were doing it.\"",
      "That said, he pointed out, \"none of our spacesuits are spring chickens. And so we will expect to see some hardware issues with repeated use. So again, it's one of those things that we are always, at every second, ready to stop...or work a contingency procedure.\"",
      "As for the suit \"discomfort\" issue that Dominick reported prior to the earlier spacewalk attempt, no details were provided.",

      "\"Amazon Haul is a response to both the rise of low-price Chinese marketplaces and the fact that consumers are increasingly seeking value for money as they try to make their budgets stretch further,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director of market research firm GlobalData.",
      "He added, \"The value retail segment has been a major growth area over the past few years, and while the regular Amazon site has a good value-for-money reputation, its wide offer means that it is not primarily seen as an everyday low-price destination.\"",

      "Posts proliferated on X and other platforms pointing to hiccups like technical issues with voting machines, power outages and spelling errors on ballots as examples of a supposedly brewing conspiracy. And at 4:30 p.m. on Election Day, former President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social that there was \"a lot of talk about massive cheating\" in Pennsylvania \u2014 which officials said had \"no factual basis whatsoever.\"",
      "But as the votes were tallied and it became clear that Trump was on his way to a decisive victory, the deluge of posts questioning the integrity of the election fell to a trickle, researchers say.",
      "\"I think this shows that these narratives are pushed when they serve a purpose, and they are stage setting often for efforts to dispute unfavorable results,\" said Max Read, a senior researcher at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. \"And then once that stage setting and those claims are no longer needed, they're not pushed anymore.\"",
      "The shift was stark in Elon Musk's \"Election Integrity Community,\" a group of nearly 65,000 started by the platform owner's political action committee encouraging members to report \"voter fraud or irregularities.\"",
      "The group had already become a repository for speculation and unfounded rumors before Election Day. When the polls opened, hundreds of posts an hour were shared until the early hours of the morning on Wednesday, when the race was called for Trump in Pennsylvania, all but eliminating a winning path for Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "After that, the posting drastically diminished.",
      "Read's team at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue also found that mentions across the platform of voting machines in Pennsylvania and Michigan soared on Tuesday afternoon but dropped to hardly any by Wednesday morning.",
      "On Tuesday morning, a software error caused voting machines to be temporarily down in Cambria County, a county in southwestern Pennsylvania with a population of about 131,000. Voters used paper ballots and a court order extended voting hours from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. But some on social media baselessly suggested the technical issues were something nefarious, a plot to discard votes in a county Trump won by a wide margin in both of the last two elections.",
      "Danielle Lee Tomson, who leads the Center for an Informed Public's research on election rumors at the University of Washington, said the narrative around Pennsylvania voting machines echoed the conversation around election issues in Maricopa County, Arizona, in 2022. In that election, some ballots were printed with ink too light to be read by tabulators, so they were placed in a secure box and counted separately at the state's election headquarters. Claims that the errors were intentional fueled a lawsuit challenging the results that was later dismissed.",
      "\"On Election Day, we can always expect there to be irregularities or glitches or problems at polling sites,\" Tomson said. \"The question is will those issues be contorted into a larger narrative that election fraud is happening.\"",
      "While the volume of election rumors has drastically decreased, false claims are still spreading about races that have not yet been called. In Arizona, where Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake trails Democratic candidate Ruben Gallego, social users on the right are using the fact that Gallego had more votes than Harris by Friday to cast doubt on the validity of his lead.",
      "Meanwhile, turnout numbers are being twisted by both the left and the right to cast doubt on election results. While millions of votes are still being counted, some point to higher turnout in 2020 as evidence that there are 20 million \"missing votes.\" On the right, some claim this is evidence that 2020 was stolen from Trump; on the left, some say it's grounds for a recount.",
      "But the volume of posts questioning Harris's loss was nowhere near the \"Stop the Steal\" efforts that followed Trump's 2020 election loss, according to both Tomson and Read's research. No elected officials cast doubt on the outcome the way Trump pushed election denial when he lost in 2020. Harris urged all Americans to accept the results of the election in her concession speech on Wednesday.",

    "story": [
      "Tropical Storm Sara formed in the Caribbean on Thursday, becoming the 18th named storm of the 2024 Atlantic Hurricane Season. The system, previously called Tropical Depression 19, developed in the western Caribbean earlier this week and intensified while traveling westward on a path toward Central America.",
      "Sara has sustained winds of 40 mph and is located around 50 miles northeast of the Nicaragua-Honduras border, moving west, the National Hurricane Center said\u00a0in a 1 p.m. ET update. A weather system is considered a tropical storm when its sustained wind speeds reach at least 39 mph.",
      "The storm is expected to linger in the Caribbean through the weekend and slowly move into the Gulf of Mexico early next week. After that, its path is less clear.CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan said a lot of the models are now trending towards it dissipating either after it enters the Gulf of Mexico or over Mexico, but several still have it aiming towards Florida.",
      "\"Florida residents should closely monitor the forecast updates as they come in,\" Nolan advised.",
      "The Atlantic Hurricane Season\u00a0officially runs from June 1 until Nov. 30, with activity typically peaking between mid-August and mid-October. An average season brings 14 named storms, seven hurricanes, and three major hurricanes, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which did predict the 2024 season would produce \"above average\" numbers.",
      "What is the projected path of Tropical Storm Sara?",
      "Tropical Storm Sara could potentially bring catastrophic rainfall to parts of Central America. Between 10 and 20 inches of heavy rainfall are possible in Honduras early next week, forecasters warned, with up to 30 inches accumulating in some places.",
      "Forecasters at the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said they expected \"life-threatening\" flash floods to hit northern Honduras and persist through the weekend. The hurricane center also warned of potentially disastrous mudslides caused by the storm, especially in the mountainous area along and near Sierra La Esperanza on the country's northeastern coast. They estimated those conditions would persist through the weekend.",
      "The rest of Honduras, Belize, El Salvador, eastern Guatemala and western Nicaragua will likely receive between 5 and 10 inches of rainfall as the storm runs its course through that region, but up to 15 inches are possible.",
      "Governments across Central America have issued various watches and warnings as people brace for Sara's effects. Vast sections of Nicaragua and Honduras, including the Bay Islands, are under either a hurricane watch or a tropical storm warning, according to the hurricane center.",
      "Will Tropical Storm Sara become a hurricane?",
      "It remains to be seen whether Sara will grow into a hurricane by the time it's expected to move close to the eastern coast of Honduras on Friday or Saturday, but forecasters said the storm would likely \"be near or at hurricane strength\" when that happens.",
      "A tropical storm becomes a hurricane when its sustained winds reach at least 74 mph, making it a Category 1 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.",
      "Forecasters also cautioned residents of Belize and Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula to be ready for possible impacts of Sara early next week.",
      "Will Tropical Storm Sara hit Florida?",
      "After entering the Gulf of Mexico, some forecast models suggested the storm could make a right-hand turn and heading toward Florida by late next week, though Nolan noted that conditions can quickly change. Other models had the storm potentially heading into the central part of the Gulf and possibly dissipating.",
      "Hurricane hunters were flying into the area Thursday to investigate the strength and structure of the developing weather system.",

    "title": "What to know about Trump's DOGE, led by Musk and Ramaswamy",
    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 13:45:39 -0500",
    "summary": "Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will head an effort, dubbed DOGE, to reduce wasteful federal spending. Here's what it's about.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump is vowing to reduce wasteful federal spending by tapping two billionaires \u2014 Tesla CEO Elon Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy \u2014 to spearhead the initiative, which the president-elect is calling the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.",
      "The appointments, announced by Trump on Tuesday, raise a host of questions about the effort, including whether Musk and Ramaswamy will have the authority to make changes in federal outlays, given that Congress authorizes the nation's spending, as well as where the businessmen might look to cut spending. Under the plan, meanwhile, DOGE is not an official government department, raising questions about its powers and how it will operate.",
      "The announcement comes a week after Trump won a second term\u00a0as president, with voters expressing their dissatisfaction with the economy under the Biden administration. As part of his campaign vows, Trump promised to slash government spending. Musk's bio on X, the social media platform he bought in 2022, now reads, \"The people voted for major government reform.\"",
      "\"Frankly, it does need to be done again, so every few decades you really need to look at everything,\" Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution who managed the Clinton Administration's National Performance Review, an effort to cut government spending in the 1990s, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "But Kamarck harbors reservations about Musk and Ramaswamy's mandate, especially after the former recently suggested he could find more than $2 trillion in savings \u2014 almost one-third of the federal government's $6.7 trillion in annual spending. Two-thirds of that spending is mandatory through programs including Social Security and Medicare, while discretionary spending is largely spent on defense.",
      "\"This is the first warning sign that this is going to be a failed operation,\" Kamarck said. \"That's insane.\"",
      "Speaking on transformational change within government and organizations, Michael Morris, a professor at Columbia University's Columbia Business School, noted there are two models: a bottom-up, grassroots effort and a top-down strategy \u2014 sometimes called a shock-change approach. DOGE likely belongs to the latter, according to Morris, who is also author of the nonfiction book \"Tribal,\" about how people form and relate to each other through group dynamics.",
      "\"Unless you have a new leader with incredible legitimacy and the status quo with no legitimacy, you rarely have people responding well to shock therapy,\" he said. \"It's hard to see it happening in this case \u2014 I don't think Musk is going to be able to form a deep knowledge of government.\"",
      "The Trump campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "What is the Department of Government Efficiency?",
      "Trump announced the DOGE in a statement on Tuesday, describing it as an effort to \"slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies.\"",
      "The name is a nod to Musk's support for a cryptocurrency called dogecoin, which was created as a joke by two software engineers and uses the image of a smiling Shiba Inu dog. (Dogecoin has more than tripled in price during the last month, and now trades at 38 cents.)",
      "Trump said Musk and Ramaswamy's work \"will conclude no later than July 4, 2026,\" or by the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Trump only outlined the initiative's contours and didn't disclose how it will be staffed or funded. The Trump campaign didn't respond to a request about the DOGE's funding or whether Musk or Ramaswamy will be paid for their work on the effort.",
      "Can the DOGE actually cut federal spending?",
      "At the moment, that appears unlikely given that the DOGE isn't a real government department, which would need to be created by congressional approval. Federal spending is authorized by Congress, and senators and House representatives may hesitate to support cuts to major programs like Social Security or Medicare, which are popular with millions of voters, or to the nation's military.",
      "It's also not clear how the organization will operate. It could come under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which dictates how external groups that advise the government must operate and be accountable to the public.",
      "Trump described Musk and Ramaswamy's role as providing \"advice and guidance from outside of government.\"",
      "That doesn't amount to much, Kamarck said.",
      "\"They have no authority \u2014 none whatsoever,\" she added, while noting that the backing of the president can help convince lawmakers to throw their support behind efficiency efforts.",
      "However, Trump's aides are reportedly working on a way to enact some of DOGE's spending recommendations without requiring congressional approval, the Washington Post reported.",
      "What have Musk and Ramaswamy said about federal spending?",
      "Musk, the world's richest person with a net worth of $319 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, has described the U.S. government as bloated and said it its spending is unsustainable. The Tesla founder also said he wants to reduce the number of federal agencies to 99, down from more than 400.",
      "\"There are so many [agencies] that people have never heard of, and that have overlapping areas of responsibilities,\" Musk\u00a0said earlier this month.",
      "While on the campaign trail with Trump, Musk also\u00a0said\u00a0he could cut \"at least $2 trillion\" from the annual budget. \"Your money is being wasted, and the Department of Government Efficiency will fix that,\" Musk said.",
      "Musk is known for cost-cutting at his own companies, slashing\u00a0most of X's workforce after he bought the business two years ago as well as focusing on manufacturing costs at Tesla. Even so, those efforts have had mixed results, with X's valuation falling by about 80% since his purchase. Tesla's stock price, meanwhile, has surged 48% in the past year, bumping its value above $1 trillion.",
      "Ramaswamy, whom Forbes says has a net worth of about $1 billion, dropped out of the presidential race in January after running on an \"anti-woke\"\u00a0campaign. He also advocated for government cuts by eliminating the Department of Education, a goal shared by President-elect Trump.",
      "Have administrations previously tried to cut costs?",
      "Yes, both Republican and Democratic presidents have created efforts to cut government spending.",
      "In 1982, President Ronald Reagan created the Grace Commission, led by wealthy businessman J. Peter Grace, the CEO of W. R. Grace & Company, a chemicals business. About 150 business people volunteered for the commission, which ultimately recommended 2,500 reforms, according to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.",
      "\"Most of the recommendations, especially those requiring legislation from Congress, were never implemented,\" the library notes. \"However, the Commission's work provided a starting point for many conservative critiques of the federal government.\"",
      "In the 1990s, President Bill Clinton created the National Performance Review with the goal to create a government that would work better and cost less, Kamarck said. The group was staffed with civil servants who understood the bureaucracy, and many of whom had frustrations with it, she added.",
      "The group had some successes in streamlining operations and paring costs, eventually cutting more than 300,000 jobs, according to a study from the Congressional Research Service. Kamarck noted that the group also focused on integrating technology into departments at a time when the internet was just emerging, leading to efficiencies such as online tax filing.",
      "Where could the Trump administration cut spending?",
      "While experts are skeptical of Musk's claim he can cut $2 trillion in spending, they also point out there are opportunities to look at efficiencies.",
      "Eliminating Medicare fraud is one area that could result in savings, according to the Citizens Against Government Waste, a nonpartisan group that looks at government spending. Its recommendations also include reducing the nation's contributions to the U.N. and ending subsidies for some agricultural products, like dairy and sugar. Its projected savings: $377 billion in the first year, or about 19% of the $2 trillion that Musk is eyeballing.",
      "But efficiency goes beyond cost-cutting, Kamarck noted. It's also about understanding how the bureaucracy works.",
      "\"Every single thing in the federal government is big and complicated, and there are layers and layers of complexity,\" she noted. \"Al Gore and I relied on hundreds of experienced civil servants to tell us how this worked \u2014 and if you don't do this, which I suspect they won't because Musk is an arrogant billionaire, you will fail.\"",
      "Does Musk have conflicts of interest?",
      "Yes, as Musk's SpaceX works with the Department of Defense and NASA, with the federal government pledging $3 billion to his companies last year, according to the New York Times. Tesla, meanwhile, has been investigated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, as well as by other agencies.",
      "Federal employees are generally required to disclose their financial assets and entanglements to ward off any potential conflicts of interest, and to divest significant holdings relating to their work. Because Musk and Ramaswamy would not be formal federal workers, they would not face those requirements or ethical limitations.",
      "Then there's also the question of Musk's ability to juggle another major role, given that he is also running several businesses, from Tesla to SpaceX, Columbia Business School's Morris noted.",
      "\"The whole question of Elon coming into government, that he's going to be this sort of roving efficiency expert, like a McKinsey consultant looking over the shoulders of the entire government \u2014 it's absurd on so many levels,\" Morris said. \"He's already the CEO of companies that are very demanding of his time.\"",
      "He added, \"To do work in government of this sort, you have to be process-oriented in a way that he has never been before.\"",
      "The Associated Press\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "The jail in Georgia's largest county, Fulton County, leaves its inmates vulnerable to \"substantial risk of serious harm from violence\" and violates their constitutional and statutory rights, according to a new Justice Department report released Thursday.",
      "After a more than year-long civil rights probe into the Fulton County Jail \u2013 which has long been plagued by overcrowding, understaffing and violence \u2014 federal investigators concluded detainees are subjected to \"dangerous and unsanitary\" conditions, like pest infestations and malnourishment. These conditions especially endanger those with mental health conditions, the report found.",
      "\"None of these problems are new,\" the report said. \"And despite widespread awareness of these issues, the unconstitutional and illegal conditions have persisted.\"",
      "The Justice Department launched its civil investigation into Fulton County's jail in July 2023, after at least four Black inmates died in the mental health unit in a matter of weeks, including two who were killed by their cellmates. \"Within weeks of opening our investigation, six more Black men had died in the Jail,\" the Justice Department revealed. The family of one inmate, Lashawn Johnson, said he died in in the jail in 2022, after he was \"eaten alive\" by insects and bedbugs. About 91% of the jail's total population is Black, according to the report, compared to 45% of the overall Fulton County population.",
      "Justice Department investigators conducted multiple site visits, expert consultations and interviews with inmates and staff.",
      "Crumbling infrastructure, failing security, abusive staff and insufficient medical and mental health treatment contributed to the overall unconstitutional conditions described in the report.",
      "According to the county sheriff, 62% of the jail's inmates suffer from mental health or substance use disorders and the staff failed to provide proper treatment or take steps to mitigate risks of suicide.",
      "\"We found that 75% of those who died in the Jail since January 2021 had a current mental health diagnosis or reported a history of mental illness,\" the report said.",
      "Justice Department investigators noted in their findings that Fulton County and the sheriff sought to remedy some of the issues, including by surging millions in emergency funding and sending some inmates to detention facilities in other districts.",
      "Still, the problems persisted. In 2024, three men in Fulton County's main jail have died, including one person who was stabbed 20 times in April. From 2022 to the present, according to the report, \"six incarcerated people have died in violent attacks.\" All six victims were Black men, the Justice Department said.",
      "Non-lethal violent assaults are also rampant inside the jail. In 2023, the Sheriff's Office said there were 1,054 assaults and more than 300 stabbings in the jail. The investigation also uncovered a pattern or practice of sexual abuse, according to the report.",
      "Announcing the report's findings, Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Department said officials in Fulton County have taken \"preliminary steps\" to address the issues outlined in the report, but such measures are \"not enough.\"",

      "The House Ethics Committee, which has been conducting an investigation into sexual misconduct and obstruction allegations against Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, scheduled a vote for Friday on whether to release its report, according to three sources with knowledge of the committee's work.",
      "Hours after President-elect Donald Trump said he planned to nominate\u00a0Gaetz to be attorney general, Gaetz resigned his congressional seat, effective immediately.",
      "\"I do not intend to take the oath of office for the same office in the 119th Congress, to pursue the position of Attorney General in the Trump Administration,\" Gaetz said in his resignation letter obtained by CBS News.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters that there was about an eight-week period during which Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis could fill his seat by setting the date for a special election, enabling the vacancy to be filled around the time the new Congress is seated.",
      "The news of the scheduled vote was first reported by Punchbowl. Now that Gaetz has resigned, it is unclear whether the panel will vote on releasing the report, since Gaetz is no longer in Congress.",
      "In June, the House Ethics Committee\u00a0released a statement\u00a0saying it was investigating a range of allegations against Gaetz, including sexual misconduct, illicit drug use, and bribery.",
      "Multiple sources at the time told CBS News that\u00a0four women\u00a0had informed the House Ethics Committee that they had been paid to go to parties that included sex and drugs, and that Gaetz had also attended. The committee has Gaetz's Venmo transactions that allegedly show payments for the women.",
      "Gaetz has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and has called the committee's investigation a \"frivolous\" smear campaign.",
      "There is precedent in Congress on the Senate side for an ethics committee report to become public after a member resigns from Congress, however. In 2011, this happened when Sen. John Ensign of Nevada resigned amid allegations that he tried to hide an extramarital affair.",
      "But it's not clear that that would apply to the House, leaving open the possibility that the report on Gaetz would not be released.",
      "Among those who have given testimony to the House Ethics Committee is a woman who says she had sex with Gaetz at a 2017 party shortly after he was elected to Congress. The woman was 17 at the time.",
      "\"She was a high school student and there were witnesses,\" her attorney said in a statement, urging the committee to release its report on Gaetz.",
      "Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, called on the House Ethics panel to preserve and share the report, as well as \"all relevant documentation\" on Gaetz with his committee.",
      "\"The sequence and timing of Mr. Gaetz's resignation from the House raises serious questions about the contents of the House Ethics Committee report,\" Durbin said in a statement Thursday. \"We cannot allow this valuable information from a bipartisan investigation to be hidden from the American people. Make no mistake: this information could be relevant to the question of Mr. Gaetz's confirmation as the next attorney general of the United States and our constitutional responsibility of advice and consent.\"",
      "Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas told reporters Thursday morning he \"absolutely\" wants to see the House Ethics Committee's report on Gaetz.",
      "\"I think there should not be any limitation on the Senate Judiciary Committee's investigation, including whatever the House Ethics Committee has generated,\" he said. The Senate Judiciary Committee, which will be chaired by a Republican when the new Congress is seated in January, will conduct confirmation hearings for the nominee for attorney general.",
      "Some of the allegations of sexual misconduct under review by the committee were also the subject of a previous Department of Justice probe into Gaetz. \u00a0Federal investigators sought to determine if Gaetz violated sex trafficking and obstruction of justice laws, but\u00a0no charges were filed.",
      "The House Ethics Committee resumed its investigation into Gaetz in 2023, following the Justice Department's decision not to pursue charges against him.",
      "Gaetz has long blamed then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, also a Republican, for the probe. And Gaetz later led the movement to sack McCarthy as speaker.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 07:28:19 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump claims he can unilaterally impose sweeping tariffs on U.S. imports. The reality is more complicated, according to trade experts.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump, who recently described \"tariff\" as\u00a0\"the most beautiful word in the dictionary,\" has proposed a range of taxes on imports from other countries. The president-elect's stated aim: to reduce American companies' use of foreign goods and parts by raising their cost, a policy he contends would strengthen the U.S.' international trade position and boost job growth at home.",
      "Trump has also claimed that he doesn't need Congress' support to impose sweeping tariffs. The reality is more complicated, according to economists and foreign trade experts.",
      "What has Trump proposed?",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump proposed tariffs of up to 60% on Chinese goods. He's offered few additional details, however, such as whether the tariffs would apply to all goods or just certain categories of products.",
      "He's also proposed much broader tariffs of 10% to 20% on all imports, including those from key allies and trade partners, and has promised retaliatory levies on any country that imposes taxes on American-made goods.",
      "Can Trump unilaterally impose tariffs?",
      "Once he takes office, President-elect Trump has several possible pathways for implementing tariffs.",
      "The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the authority to impose tariffs in Article 1, Section 8, which states that \"The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties\u2026To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.\" But Congress can also selectively delegate tariff-setting authority to the president, which it has done for decades.",
      "In his first term as president from 2017-2021, Trump freely exercised this presidential authority to increase tariffs: Total duties paid on U.S. imports doubled from roughly $37 billion in 2015 to $74 billion in 2020, according to the\u00a0Congressional Research Service.",
      "\"Looking at his previous four years in office, he seems to believe he has the authority to impose tariffs,\" said Jake Colvin, president of the National Foreign Trade Council, a group dedicated to advocating for U.S. companies in international commerce. \"If they decide on day one that they want to use executive authority to put tariffs on Chinese goods, they could probably go ahead and do that.\"",
      "Colvin added that it will be important for the incoming Trump administration to provide businesses with more specifics so that companies can plan accordingly. \"A lot has been proposed in the course of the campaign, so it's important for the administration to give a signal about the path it intends to pursue, for clarity and planning purposes for American businesses,\" he said.",
      "How fast is Trump likely to move?",
      "The president has authority to impose a range of trade restrictions on foreign nations, said Inu Manak, a trade policy fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "\"It seems pretty clear that he would pursue tariffs soon after taking office. During his last term, tariffs were a tool of choice in the trade war against China and against allies, too. So I believe that is a strategy he'll replicate in his next term,\" Manak told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Manak added that he would likely be able to do so without support from Congress. \"The president has quite a bit of discretion to do what he wants,\" she said.",
      "Legal powers at Trump's disposal include Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, under which the president may impose retaliatory tariffs when \"an act policy, or practice of a foreign country \u2026 violates, or is inconsistent with, the provisions of, or otherwise denies benefits to the United States under, any trade agreement, or \u2026 is unjustifiable and burdens or restricts United States commerce.\"",
      "Trump previously\u00a0invoked\u00a0Section 301 to impose tariffs on China in 2018 and 2019 \u2014 many of which have been continued under the Biden administration \u2014 and he could simply expand upon existing tariff actions he's already taken, according to Manak.",
      "\"That would require no action from Congress because they are already in place,\" she said.",
      "What other power Trump does have?",
      "In his previous term as president, he also made use of\u00a0Section 232\u00a0of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. It grants the president the authority to adjust imports, including by imposing tariffs, when they are deemed a threat to national security.",
      "There's also the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), although it hasn't used to restrict trade since President Richard Nixon was in office. The act says: \"Any authority granted to the President by ... this title may be exercised to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat ... to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States, if the President declares a national emergency with respect to such threat.\"",
      "\"The authorities granted to the President ... may only be exercised to deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat with respect to which a national emergency ...\" it adds in part.",
      "In other words, in order to use IEEPA to impose tariffs, Trump would have to declare a national emergency through an executive order, claiming that a U.S. trading partner posed a major threat.",
      "Alan Wm. Wolff, former deputy director-general of the World Trade Organization and a distinguished visiting fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE), is skeptical that Trump has the authority to impose sweeping tariffs under IEEPA.",
      "\"Can it be used against trade with all countries, our allies and friends in Europe and Asia, in the Americas, not to mention the poorest countries in Africa? That would simply be too large a power grab to have been within what Congress intended in this statute,\" he wrote in a recent blog post.",
      "Manak also said Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930 could conceivably give the president the authority to unilaterally raise tariffs. The rarely used act allows the president to impose duties of up to 50% of a product's value, and is triggered when a president finds that a foreign country has imposed an unreasonable charge on, or discriminated against, U.S. commerce.",
      "Typically, though, that has to be determine by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC). \"But the statute's language is ambiguous in terms of what that would look like, and I would imagine he could pursue this without a final finding from ITC, or pursue it while a finding is being made,\" Manak said.",
      "How would sweeping tariffs affect U.S. consumers?",
      "Some companies have already said they're aiming to move production out of China to avoid Trump's proposed tariffs. Shoemaker Steve Madden, for example, said last week week it plans to import fewer goods made in China and replace them with items made in other countries.",
      "If imposed, the proposed tariffs on imports could lead to consumers losing between $46 billion and $78 billion in spending power each year on products including apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear and travel goods, according to the National Retail Federation.",
      "By another estimate, a 20% general tariff on all imported goods, combined with a 60% tariff on goods imported from China, would cost the typical U.S. households more than $2,600 a year. If Trump instead imposed a 10% across-the-board tariff, that would cost families $1,700 more, according to PIIE.",
      "Experts expect the incoming Trump administration to impose some proposed tariffs quickly, while perhaps phasing in or threatening to apply other levies over time in a bid to gain trade concessions.",
      "\"We would imagine that within a few months of him taking office, we would see the first tranche of tariffs taking effect,\" Manak said.",

    "summary": "Overdose deaths have slowed 18% since a peak last year, the CDC estimates.",
    "story": [
      "Opioid overdose deaths have now slowed to the lowest levels nationwide since 2020, according to new estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This marks the 12th straight month of decline since a peak last year.",
      "Around 70,655 deaths linked to opioids like heroin and fentanyl were reported for the year ending June 2024, the CDC now estimates, falling 18% from the same time in 2023.",
      "Almost all states, except for a handful in the West from Alaska through Nevada, are now seeing a significant decrease in overdose death rates. Early data from Canada also suggests overdose deaths there might now be slowing off of a peak in 2023 too.",
      "\"While these data are cause for optimism, we must not lose sight of the fact that nearly 100,000 people are still estimated to be dying annually from drug overdose in the U.S.\" said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, in a statement.",
      "Other types of drug overdoses beyond opioids are also slowing. While they make up a smaller share of overall deaths, overdoses linked to drugs like methamphetamine and cocaine are also showing signs of dropping nationwide following a peak last year.",
      "\"We are encouraged by this data, but boy, it is time to double down on the things that we know are working. It is not a time to pull back, and I feel very strongly, and our data shows, that the threat continues to evolve,\" Dr. Allison Arwady, head of the CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, told CBS News.",
      "Arwady pointed to a long list of factors that officials hope are contributing to the decline, ranging from broader availability of the overdose reversing spray naloxone, also known as Narcan, to efforts to ease gaps in access to medications that can treat opioid use disorder.",
      "Trends in what health officials call \"primary prevention\" have also improved in recent years \u2014 meaning fewer people using the drugs to begin with. As an example, Arwady cited CDC surveys showing a clear decline in high school students reporting that they have tried illegal drugs.",
      "The CDC and health departments have also gotten faster at gathering and analyzing data to respond to surges in overdoses, Arwady said, often caused by new so-called \"adulterants\" that are mixed in. Health authorities study this by testing blood and drug samples taken in the wake of surges, in search of potential emerging drug threats.",
      "Agency researchers are now looking closer at what could be behind gaps in communities that are still not seeing slowdowns, Arwady said.",
      "\"Unfortunately, for the most affected groups, namely Native Americans and Black American men, the death rates are not decreasing and are at the highest recorded levels,\" said Volkow.",
      "Why are drug overdose deaths declining?",
      "In the months since CDC data first began showing real signs of a nationwide change to the deadly record wave of opioid overdose deaths, experts have floated a number of theories to explain what caused the change.",
      "\"We had been seeing the numbers go down, on the national aggregate level, since last April, and we were skeptical and kind of holding our tongues. Then we started hearing from a lot of folks on the ground, frontline providers,'\" said Nabarun Dasgupta, a senior scientist at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill who studies opioid overdose deaths.",
      "Dasgupta led an analysis in September by the university's Opioid Data Lab illustrating the nationwide scope of the downturn and probing a number of theories that might explain it.",
      "Some explanations they dismissed as unlikely, like stepped-up law enforcement operations. Other ideas they judged as plausible, but complicated to prove, like a so-called \"depletion of susceptibles\" \u2014 essentially the epidemic burning itself out, as users either found ways to survive the influx of fentanyl or died \u2014 or the wider availability of naloxone.",
      "Dasgupta said they received a flood of interest since their initial post proposing more theories, like new scanners that were deployed on the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "There are likely a number of factors all playing a role in the shift, Dasgupta says. But he said early data from research they are wrapping up now supports one leading explanation: a shift in the illegal drug supply.",
      "\"Our hypothesis is that something has changed in the drug supply. This kind of pronounced shift, something that happens suddenly, if numbers had suddenly shot up, we would definitely be pointing to a change in the drug supply to explain it,\" said Dasgupta.",
      "Amid its downsides, xylazine's rise might have led to less injection drug use, they speculate. Its longer high could also be reducing the number of times people use fentanyl each day.",
      "\"We're not in our offices celebrating. We're still losing too many people that we love. So I just want it to be very clear that with like a hundred thousand people still dying, that's obscenely high,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "The Ohio Senate on Wednesday approved a ban on transgender students using bathrooms that fit their gender identities and sent the measure to Republican Gov. Mike DeWine.",
      "The Republican-backed bill applies to public K-12 schools and institutions of higher education. It requires the schools to designate separate bathrooms, locker rooms and overnight accommodations \"for the exclusive use\" of either males and females, based on one's gender assigned at or near birth, in both school buildings and facilities used for a school-sponsored event.",
      "The legislation would not apply to school employees, emergencies or people helping young children or those with disabilities, and schools would still be able to provide single-use and family bathroom facilities.",
      "State Sen. Jerry Cirino, a Kirtland Republican, said the bill \"is about safety and security.\"",
      "The ACLU of Ohio urged the governor not to sign the measure, which it condemned as a violation of the right of privacy of LGBTQ+ Ohioans that will make them less safe.",
      "\"We are closely considering next steps,\" the ACLU said on social media.",
      "\"If allowed to go into effect, SB 104 will create unsafe environments for trans and gender non-conforming individuals of all ages,\" Jocelyn Rosnick, the group's policy director, said in a statement. \"This bill ignores the material reality that transgender people endure higher rates of sexual violence and assaults, particularly while using public restrooms, than people who are not transgender.\"",
      "Transgender and gender-nonbinary teens who were subject to restroom or locker room restrictions had a higher prevalence of sexual assault, according to a 2019 study published in the journal Pediatrics. About 36% of surveyed teens reported sexual assault, the study found.",
      "The Center for Christian Virtue commended legislators for passing the bill and called on DeWine to sign it. The governor has said he's inclined to sign the bill, but will conduct a legal review first.",
      "\"Today is a huge victory for children and families in Ohio,\" CCV Policy Director David Mahan said in a statement. \"Amended SB104 is common-sense legislation that will guarantee the only people entering young ladies' private spaces are female, not men claiming to be female.\"",
      "At least 11 states have adopted laws barring transgender girls and women from girls' and women's bathrooms at public schools, and in some cases other government facilities.",

      "Tropical Storm Sara formed in the Caribbean on Thursday, becoming the 18th named storm of the 2024 Atlantic Hurricane Season. The system, previously called Tropical Depression 19, developed in the western Caribbean earlier this week and intensified while traveling westward on a path toward Central America.",
      "Sara has sustained winds of 40 mph and is located around 50 miles northeast of the Nicaragua-Honduras border, moving west, the National Hurricane Center said\u00a0in a 1 p.m. ET update. A weather system is considered a tropical storm when its sustained wind speeds reach at least 39 mph.",
      "The storm is expected to linger in the Caribbean through the weekend and slowly move into the Gulf of Mexico early next week. After that, its path is less clear.CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan said a lot of the models are now trending towards it dissipating either after it enters the Gulf of Mexico or over Mexico, but several still have it aiming towards Florida.",
      "\"Florida residents should closely monitor the forecast updates as they come in,\" Nolan advised.",
      "The Atlantic Hurricane Season\u00a0officially runs from June 1 until Nov. 30, with activity typically peaking between mid-August and mid-October. An average season brings 14 named storms, seven hurricanes, and three major hurricanes, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which did predict the 2024 season would produce \"above average\" numbers.",
      "What is the projected path of Tropical Storm Sara?",
      "Tropical Storm Sara could potentially bring catastrophic rainfall to parts of Central America. Between 10 and 20 inches of heavy rainfall are possible in Honduras early next week, forecasters warned, with up to 30 inches accumulating in some places.",
      "Forecasters at the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said they expected \"life-threatening\" flash floods to hit northern Honduras and persist through the weekend. The hurricane center also warned of potentially disastrous mudslides caused by the storm, especially in the mountainous area along and near Sierra La Esperanza on the country's northeastern coast. They estimated those conditions would persist through the weekend.",
      "The rest of Honduras, Belize, El Salvador, eastern Guatemala and western Nicaragua will likely receive between 5 and 10 inches of rainfall as the storm runs its course through that region, but up to 15 inches are possible.",
      "Governments across Central America have issued various watches and warnings as people brace for Sara's effects. Vast sections of Nicaragua and Honduras, including the Bay Islands, are under either a hurricane watch or a tropical storm warning, according to the hurricane center.",
      "Will Tropical Storm Sara become a hurricane?",
      "It remains to be seen whether Sara will grow into a hurricane by the time it's expected to move close to the eastern coast of Honduras on Friday or Saturday, but forecasters said the storm would likely \"be near or at hurricane strength\" when that happens.",
      "A tropical storm becomes a hurricane when its sustained winds reach at least 74 mph, making it a Category 1 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.",
      "Forecasters also cautioned residents of Belize and Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula to be ready for possible impacts of Sara early next week.",
      "Will Tropical Storm Sara hit Florida?",
      "After entering the Gulf of Mexico, some forecast models suggested the storm could make a right-hand turn and heading toward Florida by late next week, though Nolan noted that conditions can quickly change. Other models had the storm potentially heading into the central part of the Gulf and possibly dissipating.",
      "Hurricane hunters were flying into the area Thursday to investigate the strength and structure of the developing weather system.",
      "Forecast models take in the current environmental factors along with historical data to compute \"spaghetti plots\" of where systems may track. Each model uses different computations, and the forecast track is an output of the consensus from those models.",
      "\"It is too soon to determine what impacts the system could bring to portions of the eastern Gulf of Mexico, including Florida, the Florida Keys, and Cuba during the middle portion of next week,\" the hurricane center said Thursday. \"Residents in these areas should regularly monitor updates to the forecast.\"",

      "New Delhi \u2014\u00a0India's Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that authorities demolishing illegally-constructed homes and other properties belonging to suspected criminals is unconstitutional and must cease. The practice is allegedly used widely by several state governments to punish suspects outside the court justice process, and is commonly known as \"bulldozer justice.\"",
      "\"The executive can't become a judge and decide that a person accused is guilty and, therefore, punish him by demolishing his properties. Such an act would be transgressing [the] executive's limits,\" the court said in a 95-page judgement.",
      "The court issued its ruling in response to several petitions over a spate of home demolitions targeting suspected criminals in states governed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in recent years. Critics have accused the BJP state administrations of using bulldozer justice primarily to\u00a0target Muslims \u2014 an accusation the party has repeatedly denied.",
      "BJP state officials have argued that due process of law has been followed in carrying out the demolitions, but the court said authorities had adopted a \"pick and choose\" attitude toward illegally constructed homes, singling out those belonging to Muslims suspected of other crimes while sparing similar, but non-Muslim-owned illegal dwellings in the same area.",
      "\"In such cases, where the authorities indulge in arbitrary pick and choose of structures and it is established that soon before the initiation of such an action an occupant of the structure was found to be involved in a criminal case, a presumption could be drawn that the real motive for such demolition proceedings was not the illegal structure, but an action of penalizing the accused without even trying him before the court of law,\" the court said.",
      "One of the petitions to the Supreme Court was filed over the April 2022 demolition of dozens of homes belonging largely to Muslims following sectarian clashes in Delhi's Jahangirpuri neighborhood, which drew allegations of religious discrimination and extrajudicial punishment.",
      "\"The chilling sight of a bulldozer demolishing a building\u2026 reminds one of a lawless state of affairs,\" Justices B.R. Gavai and K.V.

      "But after energetic bidding, the hammer price ticked in at 3.55 million Swiss francs ($4 million), and Sotheby's listed the final price after taxes and commissions at 4.26 million francs ($4.81 million).",
      "The unidentified buyer, who put in her bid over the phone, was \"ecstatic,\" Andres White Correal, chairman of the Sotheby's jewelry department, told AFP.",

      "Some of the diamonds in the piece are believed to stem from the jewel at the center of the \"Diamond Necklace Affair\" \u2014 a scandal in the 1780s that further tarnished the reputation of France's last queen, Marie Antoinette, and boosted support for the coming French Revolution.",
      "The auction house said the necklace, composed of three rows of diamonds finished with a diamond tassel at each end, had emerged \"miraculously intact\" from a private Asian collection to make its first public appearance in 50 years.",

      "\"Spectacular piece of history\"",

      "Sotheby's said it was likely that some of the diamonds featured in the piece came from the famous necklace from the scandal that engulfed Marie Antoinette.",
      "That scandal involved a hard-up noblewoman named Jeanne de la Motte who pretended to be a confidante of the queen, and managed to acquire a lavish diamond-studded necklace in her name, against a promise of a later payment.",
      "On Oct. 16, 1793,\u00a0Marie Antoinette was guillotined\u00a0\u2014 but it turned she was actually innocent of the necklace fraud that she was accused of.",
      "While the queen was later found to be blameless in the affair, the scandal still deepened the perception of her careless extravagance, adding to the anger that would unleash the revolution.",
      "Sotheby's said the diamonds in the necklace sold Wednesday were likely sourced from \"the legendary Golconda mines in India\" \u2014 considered to produce the purest and most dazzling diamonds.",
      "\"The fortunate buyer has walked away with a spectacular piece of history,\" Tobias Kormind, head of Europe's largest online diamond jeweler 77 Diamonds, said in a statement.",

    "story": [
      "Scientists say they have found the world's largest coral near the Pacific's Solomon Islands, announcing Thursday a major discovery \"pulsing with life and color.\" The coral is so immense that researchers sailing the crystal waters of the Solomon archipelago initially thought they'd stumbled across a hulking shipwreck.",
      "\"Just when we think there is nothing left to discover on planet Earth, we find a massive coral made of nearly one billion little polyps, pulsing with life and color,\" marine ecologist Enric Sala said.",
      "The standalone structure, formed from a \"complex network\" of tiny coral polyps, has likely been growing for 300 years or more, the researchers said.",
      "At about 111 feet wide and 104 feet long, the team said the \"mega coral\" was three times bigger than the previous record holder \u2014 a coral dubbed \"Big Momma\" in American Samoa. The massive coral is not a coral reef, structures that can be far larger but are comprised of many distinct coral colonies, they explained.",
      "\"While Big Momma looked like a huge scoop of ice cream plopped down on the reef, this newly discovered coral is as if the ice cream started to melt, spreading forever along the seafloor,\" said lead scientist Molly Timmers.",
      "It's longer than a blue whale and thought to be \"so colossal\" that it could be seen from space.",
      "The coral was discovered at the southeastern tip of the Solomon Islands, in an area known as the Three Sisters. It was spotted by a National Geographic team embarking on a scientific expedition in the region.",
      "Hotter and more acidic oceans have drained the life from corals in many of the region's tropical waters, a process called bleaching, including Australia's famed Great Barrier Reef. But this latest discovery offered a small glimmer of hope, the research team said.",
      "\"While the nearby shallow reefs were degraded due to warmer seas, witnessing this large healthy coral oasis in slightly deeper waters is a beacon of hope,\" said coral scientist Eric Brown.",
      "The lush rainforests and pristine waters of the Solomon Islands have long been celebrated for their ecological diversity. Wildlife observations made in the area in the 1920s helped prove a key part of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution.",
      "\"There is so much to learn about the richness of marine life and the ocean ecosystem, but this finding opens doors of knowledge,\" said top Solomon Islands official Collin Beck. \"More scientific research is needed to better understand our rich biodiversity and our planet.\"",
      "The discovery was announced as representatives from around the world meet in Baku, Azerbaijan for the COP29 United Nations summit on climate change.",
      "The Solomon Islands national climate minister, Trevor Manemahaga, told CBS News' partner network BBC News at the summit that his nation was proud to be the home of the massive, newly discovered coral.",

      "Among the Israeli fans who came to support Maccabi Tel Aviv in Amsterdam, there were some who marched through the streets before the game chanting \"death to Arabs\" and tore down a Palestinian flag. But after the match, mobs cornered Israeli fans and bystanders, beating and kicking them and throwing one into a canal.",
      "Amsterdam Mayor Femke Halsema condemned the violence, saying in its wake that \"Jewish Israeli supporters were hunted down and attacked via anti-Semitic calls on social media and on the streets.\"",
      "Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof described the violence as a \"terrible antisemitic attack\" and declared himself \"deeply ashamed\" for the country's capital city, while his Israeli and American counterparts, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Biden, also voiced disgust and horror at the attacks targeting Jews.",
      "Speaking Tuesday, Mayor Halsema said \"a more complete picture\" had emerged of the clashes that gripped Amsterdam last week, \"and all sorts of terrible things happened,\" but she stressed that it \"in no way negates\" that a call had been issued in her city for a \"hunt for Jews.\"",
      "Clashes have persisted since then, despite a temporary ban on demonstrations in Amsterdam, with police breaking up one protest that sought to defy the ban as recently as Wednesday evening. A train in Amsterdam was also attacked, with one man shouting, \"cancer Jew!\"",

      "But French authorities have warned \"there's no such thing as zero risk.\"",

      "During that period, thousands of American and Filipino service members were captured and held at prisoner of war camps, the DPAA said. Calvi was among those reported captured when forces in Bataan surrendered. He, and thousands of others, were subjected to the 65-mile Bataan Death March and then held at a prisoner of war camp where 2,500 prisoners died during the course of the war.",
      "Calvi died on July 16, 1942, according to prison and historical records, just months after the surrender of the peninsula. He was buried in a mass grave, known as Common Grave 316.",
      "That grave and others at the camp were exhumed by the American Graves Registration Service after World War II ended. The remains from the graves were brought to a temporary U.S. military mausoleum that had been constructed in Manila, the Philippines' capital city.",
      "In 1947, the service attempted to identify the remains. Eleven sets of remains from Common Grave 316 were identified, and the remaining 17 were declared unidentifiable. Those unidentified remains were buried at the Manila American Cemetery and Memorial as Unknowns. Calvi's name, along with the names of other soldiers declared dead, was carved onto the Walls of the Missing at the cemetery.",
      "In April 2019, the DPAA began efforts to identify the Unknowns from Common Grave 316. The 17 sets of remains were exhumed and sent to the DPAA laboratory for analysis. Scientists used multiple techniques, including dental and anthropological analysis, mitochondrial and Y-chromosome DNA analysis, and historical evidence. On Sept. 16, they identified the set of remains as Calvi's.",
      "Before Calvi enlisted in the military, he had been a notable athlete, playing varsity baseball and football at his Massachusetts high school, according to archival news clippings shared by the DPAA. Before he was taken prisoner, Calvi was wounded at least once in action, but returned to active duty after recovering in a hospital in the Philippines. He was survived by his parents, two brothers, several aunts and uncles, and one nephew.",
      "Calvi will be buried in his hometown of North Adams, Massachusetts on Dec. 9, 2024. A rosette will be placed next to his name on the Walls of the Missing to indicate that he has been accounted for.",

The killing, which was confirmed by Moscow, is the latest in a string of targeted attacks on Russian military officers and pro-Kremlin public figures in occupied Ukrainian territory and within Russia.",
      "A source in the Security Service of Ukraine told AFP it had orchestrated a car bomb attack in the city of Sevastopol that killed senior naval officer Valery Trankovsky, a first rank captain in Russia's Black Sea Fleet.",
      "\"As a result of the explosion, the Russian captain's legs were blown off and he died of blood loss,\" the source added in written comments. It described Trankovsky as \"war criminal\" responsible for the launch of cruise missiles from the Black Sea at civilian targets in Ukraine.",

      "Polish archaeologists who found the grave of a German soldier discovered even more historic artifacts amid the exhumation of the remains.",
      "The grave was found in Wdecki Landscape Park, a nationally protected area with multiple nature preserves in northern Poland. The soldier was buried near a lake, and likely died in February 1945 while fighting for control of a bridge in Grzybek, Poland, according to a news release from the park on social media. Efforts began to recover the body.",

      "\"Our hunters came across coins scattered from different eras and territories all over Europe, it looked as if someone had discarded their coin collection right here!\" the park said.

      "Two Somali pirates have been sentenced to 30 years in prison for kidnapping American journalist Michael Scott Moore and holding him hostage for 977 days, federal prosecutors said Tuesday.",
      "Moore, a freelance journalist, traveled to Somalia in 2012 to research piracy and the nation's economy. On January 21, he was kidnapped by multiple heavily armed men and transported him to a secluded area, where he was held captive along with two fishermen from the Seychelles. Moore was moved several times over the course of three months, then transported to a hijacked boat, the F/V Naham III. Moore and one of the fishermen were held captive there, along with 28 crew members, for several more months, according to the Department of Justice. The fisherman was tortured, and the crew members told Moore that the pirates had killed the ship's captain when they hijacked the vessel, prosecutors said.",
      "Moore remained a hostage for another two years, continuously shuffled between safehouses, kept under armed guard and chained at night to prevent escape, prosecutors said. He was repeatedly threatened, according to the Department of Justice, and forced to make proof-of-life videos requesting large ransom payments. In 2014, negotiators paid a ransom of $1.6 million to secure Moore's release. Moore has said his family funded the ransom payment, and published a book about his experience in 2018.",
      "Abdi Yusef Hassan, 56, and Mohamed Tahlil Mohamed, 43, each \"played significant roles in Moore's captivity,\" according to the Department of Justice, and were handed 30-year prison sentences.",
      "Hassan, a naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in Mogadishu, Somalia, served as the minister of the interior in the Somalian province where Moore was captured. That meant he was in charge of police and security forces, but he also \"served as an overall leader of the pirates,\" according to the Department of Justice. He \"headed their efforts to extort a massive ransom from Moore's aging mother,\" the department said, and directed the production of the proof-of-life videos and participated in ransom negotiations. He also used his home as a base of operations for the pirates, the Department of Justice said. He was arrested in Minneapolis in 2019.",
      "Tahlil, also of Mogadishu, served in the nation's army and was a supervisor of the pirates who guarded Moore during the early months of his time in captivity. He used his military position, training and experience \"to serve as the pirates' head of security and armorer,\" according to the Department of Justice, and was in charge of moving Moore from location to location. He also provided and repaired weapons used to keep Moore in captivity. Tahlil was jailed in New York City in 2018.",

    "summary": "Germ\u00e1n Reyes was arrested on charges of homicide for the killing of Alejandro Arcos just a week after he took office as mayor, officials said.",
    "story": [
      "A former prosecutor and local police official was arrested Tuesday in connection with the grisly decapitation of a mayor on Oct. 6.",
      "Officials in the southern state of Guerrero confirmed that Germ\u00e1n Reyes was arrested on charges of homicide for the killing of Alejandro Arcos just a week after he took office as mayor of the state capital, Chilpancingo.\u00a0 The public prosecutor's office in Guerrero released a photo of the suspect, identifying him as German \"N\" in line with the usual practice of not giving full names.",
      "The arrest was shocking, because officials had previously blamed the killing on a local drug and extortion gang, and Reyes was formerly employed as special prosecutor for Guerrero state, a high-level position.",
      "The implication was that Reyes - who was also a former military officer who, according to his official resume, retired with rank of captain in the military justice system - had somehow worked in collusion with the gang.",
      "That would suggest that at least one of the two warring gangs fighting for control of Chilpancingo controls, intimidates or works with officials there.",
      "If Reyes is convicted, it would also be a stinging rebuke for a policy adopted by cities across Mexico of hiring retired military officers for top local police jobs, on the assumption that they are less prone to corruption.",
      "It was also revealing that state detectives had to rely on federal forces - soldiers and the National Guard - to make the arrest, suggesting they may not have trusted state and local police who would normally carry out such tasks.",
      "It was not clear what title Reyes held in the Chilpancingo municipal security force, or whether he served both under Arcos or the replacement mayor who took office after he was killed. Four mayors from other towns in Mexico requested protection\u00a0a day after Arcos' remains were found.",
      "Mexico's top federal security official, Omar Garc\u00eda Harfuch, said earlier Tuesday that Arcos -the mayor whose body was found in a pickup truck, with his severed head placed on the roof of the vehicle - was apparently killed by the same gang responsible for killing 11 market vendors, including four boys, last week.",
      "The vendors, members of an extended family, were abducted in late October as they traveled to sell their wares. Their bodies were found dumped in the bed of a pickup truck on an avenue in Chilpancingo last week.",
      "While neither Harfuch nor state prosecutors would name the gang, a local human rights activist said the Ardillos were responsible for killing the market vendors.",
      "The activist, who did not want to be quoted for fear of reprisals, said the Ardillos gang controlled large parts of the state and had state congressmen and other officials working for them.",
      "The Ardillos have been locked in a years-long battle for control of Chilpancingo with a rival gang, the Tlacos. That turf battle has left mutilated corpses strewn around the city in recent years.",
      "Mexican cartels frequently dump bodies of their hostages \u2014 or post grisly videos of torture, interrogation and decapitations of their victims \u2014 to\u00a0intimidate their rivals\u00a0and authorities. Messages are\u00a0often left on victims' bodies\u00a0by cartels seeking to threaten their rivals or punish behavior they claim violates their rules.",
      "Chilpancingo, a city of about 300,000, is so completely dominated by gangs that in 2023, one of them staged a demonstration of hundreds of people, hijacked a government armored car, blocked a major highway and took police hostage to win the release of arrested suspects.",
      "Violence in Guerrero reached such unprecedented levels that earlier this year, Roman Catholic bishops announced they had helped arrange a truce in another part of the state between two warring drug cartels.",
      "At the time, former president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador- who refused to confront the gangs - said he approved of such talks.",
      "\"Priests and pastors and members of all the churches have participated, helped in pacifying the country. I think it is very good,\" said L\u00f3pez Obrador, who left office Sept. 30.",

South Korea's spy agency also said North Korean troops were \"engaging in combat\" in the Kursk region, hours after the U.S. military shared its assessment of the growing Russian-North Korean cooperation.",
      "Air raid warnings blared for hours as Russia targeted eight regions of Ukraine, firing six ballistic and cruise missiles and 90 drones, the Ukrainian air force said. Air defenses downed four missiles and 37 drones, and another 47 drones were stopped by electronic jamming, the statement said.",
      "The damage was being assessed.",
      "The air assault came as most of the more than 10,000 North Korean troops sent by Pyongyang to help Moscow in the war were engaged in fighting in Kursk, where a Ukrainian army incursion three months ago has succeeded in holding a broad area of land, embarrassing the Kremlin.",
      "Russia's military has trained the North Korean soldiers in artillery, drone skills and basic infantry operations, including trench clearing, Pentagon deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel told a briefing Tuesday. The cooperation faces challenges, according to the Pentagon, including how to achieve military interoperability and overcoming the language barrier.",
      "NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said previously that the\u00a0deployment of North Korean troops to Russia\u00a0was a sign of Russian President Vladimir Putin's \"growing desperation\" as the full-scale war he launched against Ukraine nears the end of its third year, but he also said it marked \"a significant escalation\" in North Korea's involvement in the conflict, and \"a dangerous expansion of Russia's war.\"",

    "story": [
      "In 1965, a Norwegian woman gave birth to a baby girl in a private hospital. Seven days later she returned home with a baby.",
      "When the baby developed dark curls that made her look different from herself, Karen Rafteseth Dokken assumed she just took after her husband's mother.",
      "It took nearly six decades to discover the true reason: Rafteseth Dokken's biological daughter had been mistakenly switched at birth in the maternity ward of the hospital in central Norway.",
      "The girl she ended up raising, Mona, was not the baby she gave birth to.",
      "The babies \u2014 one born on Feb. 14 and the other on Feb. 15, 1965 \u2014 are now 59-year-old women who together with Rafteseth Dokken are suing the state and the municipality.",
      "In their case, which opened in the Oslo District Court on Monday, they argue that their human rights were violated when authorities discovered the error when the girls were teenagers and covered it up. They claim Norwegian authorities had undermined their right to a family life, a principle enshrined in the European human rights convention, and demand an apology and compensation.",
      "Rafteseth Dokken, now 78, was in tears as she described learning so many years later that she got the wrong baby, according to Norwegian broadcaster NRK.",
      "\"It was never my thought that Mona was not my daughter,\" she said in court on Tuesday. \"She was named Mona after my mother.\"",
      "Mona described a sense of never belonging as she grew up. That sense of uncertainty pushed her in 2021 to do a DNA test, which showed that she was not the biological daughter of those who raised her.",
      "But the woman who raised the other baby knew long before.",
      "A routine blood test in 1981 revealed that the girl she was raising, Linda Karin Risvik Gotaas, was not biologically related. The woman raising her, however, did not pursue a maternity case. Norwegian health authorities were informed of the mix-up in 1985, but refrained from telling the others involved.",
      "Both women who were swapped at birth have said in interviews that it was a shock to learn about the mix-up, but the knowledge made pieces of their lives fall into place, explaining differences both in terms of appearance and demeanor.",
      "Kristine Aarre Haanes, representing Mona, said the state \"violated her right to her own identity for all these years. They kept it secret.\"",
      "Mona could have learned the truth when she was a young adult, but instead \"she did not find out the truth until she was 57.\"",
      "\"Her biological father has died. She has no contact with her biological mother,\" added Aarre Haanes.",
      "Circumstances surrounding the 1965 swap at Eggesboenes hospital are unclear, but media reports by NRK suggest there were several cases during the 1950s and 1960s where children were accidentally swapped at the same institution. At the time babies were kept together while their mothers rested in separate rooms.",
      "In other cases the errors were spotted before the children were permanently placed with the wrong families, according to the reports.",
      "An official from the Norwegian Ministry of Heath and Care Services said the state was unaware of similar cases and that there were no plans for a public inquiry.",
      "Asgeir Nygaard, representing the Norwegian state, is fighting the case on the grounds that the 1965 switch took place in a private institution and that the health directorate in the 1980s did not have the legal authority to inform the other families when they discovered the error.",
      "\"Documentation from that time indicates that government officials found the assessments difficult, inter alia because it was legally unclear what they could do,\" he wrote in a statement to The Associated Press ahead of the trial's opening. \"Therefore, in court, we will argue that there is no basis for compensation and that the claims being made are in any case statute-barred.\"",
      "The trial is scheduled to run through Thursday, but it was not clear when a ruling is expected.",

    "summary": "U.S. airlines are barred from flying to Haiti for a month after 3 American carriers' planes are hit by gunfire amid relentless gang violence in the Caribbean nation.",
    "story": [
      "Port-au-Prince, Haiti\u00a0\u2014 The Federal Aviation Administration prohibited U.S. airlines from flying to Haiti for 30 days after gangs shot three planes and the United Nations also Tuesday temporarily suspended flights to Port-au-Prince, limiting humanitarian aid coming into the country. Bullets hit a Spirit Airlines plane when it was about to land in the capital Monday, injuring a flight attendant and forcing the airport to shut down. Photos and videos obtained by The Associated Press show bullet holes dotting the interior of a plane.",
      "On Tuesday, JetBlue and American Airlines announced that post-flight inspections found their planes also had been shot Monday while departing Port-au-Prince. American suspended flights to the capital until Feb. 12.",
      "The shootings were part of a wave of violence that erupted as the country plagued by gang violence swore in its new prime minister after a politically tumultuous process. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the agency documented 20 armed clashes and more roadblocks affecting humanitarian operation during the violence Monday.",
      "The Port-au-Prince airport will remain closed until Nov. 18, and Dujarric said the U.N. will divert flights to the country's second airport in the northern, more peaceful, city of Cap Ha\u00eftien.",
      "The U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince said in a security alert Monday that it was aware of \"gang-led efforts\" to block travel to and from the capital that may include \"armed violence, and disruptions to roads, ports, and airports.\"",
      "\"The security situation in Haiti is unpredictable and dangerous,\" the embassy warned. \"Travel within Haiti is conducted at your own risk. The U.S. government cannot guarantee your safety traveling to airports, borders, or during any onward travel. You should consider your personal security situation before traveling anywhere in Haiti.\"",
      "Even more limited access to the epicenter of the violence, Port-au-Prince, is likely to be devastating as\u00a0gangs choking the life out of the capital have pushed Haiti to the brink of famine. Dujarric warned that cutting off flights would mean \"limiting the flow of humanitarian aid and humanitarian personnel into the country.\"",
      "Already, a convoy of 20 trucks filled with food and medical supplies in the south had been postponed and an operation providing cash assistance to a thousand people in the Carrefour area where violence broke out had to be canceled.",
      "\"We are doing all we can to ensure the continuation of operations amidst this challenging environment,\" he said. \"We call for an end to the escalating violence, to allow for safe, sustained and unimpeded humanitarian access.\"",
      "On Tuesday, life in much of Haiti's capital was frozen after the wave of violence. Heavily armed police in armored cars outside the airport checked trucks used for public transportation passing by.",
      "Schools were closed, as were banks and government offices. Streets, where just a day before gangs and police were locked in a fierce firefight, were eerily empty, with few driving by other than a motorcycle with a man who had been shot clinging to the back.",
      "The sounds of heavy gunfire still echoed through the streets in the afternoon \u2014 a reminder that despite political maneuvering by Haiti's elites and a strong push by the international community to restore peace, the country's toxic slate of gangs kept its firm hold on much of the Caribbean nation.",
      "The United Nations estimates that gangs control 85% of the capital, Port-au-Prince. A U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police to quell gang violence struggles with a lack of funding and personnel, prompting calls for a U.N. peacekeeping mission.",
      "President Luis Abinader in the Dominican Republic, which shares a border with Haiti, was the first leader on the island to condemn the violence, describing the shooting a \"terrorist act\".",
      "On Tuesday, a transitional council established in April to restore democratic order to Haiti also condemned the violence.",
      "\"This cowardly crime, which threatens Haiti's sovereignty and security, aims to isolate our country on the international stage. The perpetrators of these heinous acts will be hunted down and brought to justice,\" the council wrote in a statement.",
      "The council has taken sharp criticism from many in Haiti who contend that its political fights and corruption allegations against three members created the political instability, allowing gangs to make violent power grabs like the one seen Monday.",
      "That came to a head over the weekend, when it fired former interim Prime Minister Garry Conille - long at odds with the council. They replaced him with businessman Alix Didier Fils-Aim\u00e9, who was inaugurated Monday surrounded by suit-clad officials and diplomats while gangs terrorized the capital around them.",
      "Neither Fils-Aim\u00e9 or Conille have commented on the wave of violence.",
      "Conille originally called the council's move illegal, but on Tuesday acknowledged Fils-Aim\u00e9's appointment in a post on the social media platform X.",
      "\"(I) wish him success in fulfilling this mission. At this crucial moment, unity and solidarity are essential for our country. Long live Haiti!\" he wrote. Fils-Aim\u00e9 promised to work with international partners to restore peace and hold long awaited elections, a vow also made by his predecessor.",
      "But many Haitians, like 43-year-old Martha Jean-Pierre, have little taste for the political fighting, which experts say only gives gangs more freedom to continue expanding their control.",
      "Jean-Pierre was among those to brave the streets of Port-au-Prince on Tuesday to sell the plantains, carrots, cabbage and potatoes she carried in a basket on her head. She had no choice, she said - selling was the only way she could feed her children.",
      "\"What good is a new prime minister if there's no security, if I can't move freely and sell my goods?\" she said, nodding to her basket of vegetables. \"This is my bank account. This is what my family depend on.\"",
      "It was a frustration that concerned international players like the U.N. and the U.S. that have pushed for a peaceful resolution in Haiti.",
      "On Tuesday, the U.S. State Department lamented that Conille and the council \"were unable to move forward in a constructive manner\" and called on Fils-Aim\u00e9 and the council to provide a clear action plan outlining a joint vision on how to decrease violence and pave the path for elections to be held to \"prevent further gridlock.\"",
      "\"The acute and immediate needs of the Haitian people mandate that the transitional government prioritize governance over the competing personal interests of political actors,\" it wrote in a statement.",

      "1. Email validation: By opening the email or engaging with the email (clicking a link or responding to it), you can validate that the email account they messaged is active. Oftentimes, scammers randomly email people whose email address they've gotten from data breaches, the dark web or data harvesting.",
      "2. Information gathering: If you reply to the email or use any other contact information they provide to \"reinstate\" your account, it will validate that the email address they reached out to is active, and they will likely hard-sell you for financial and personal information. If you call any phone number they provide you, they will also connect your phone number with your email address so they can continue to update their information on you.",

      "What you need to know",
      "The\u00a0FBI has seen a spike in criminal forum posts about emergency data requests and stolen email credentials from police departments and government agencies. Cybercriminals are getting into compromised U.S. and foreign government email accounts and using them to send fake emergency data requests to U.S.-based companies, which exposes customer data for further misuse in other crimes.",
      "In August 2024, a popular cybercriminal on an online forum advertised \"high-quality .gov emails\" for sale, meant for espionage, social engineering, data extortion, emergency data requests and more. The listing even included U.S. credentials, and the seller claimed they could guide buyers on making emergency data requests and even sell real stolen subpoena documents to help them pose as law enforcement.",
      "Another cybercriminal boasted about owning government emails from over 25 countries. They claimed anyone can use these emails to send a subpoena to a tech company and get access to usernames, emails, phone numbers and other personal client info. Some con artists are even hosting a \"masterclass\" on how to create and submit their own emergency data requests to pull data on any social media account, charging $100 for the full rundown.",
      "Illustration of a scammer at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "WINDOWS FLAW LETS HACKERS SNEAK INTO YOUR PC OVER WI-FI",
      "How this phishing scam works",
      "When law enforcement, whether federal, state or local, wants information about someone\u2019s account at a tech company, like their email address or other account details, they typically need a warrant, subpoena or court order. When a tech company receives one of these requests from an official email address, they\u2019re required to comply. So, if a scammer gets access to a government email, they can fake a subpoena and get information on just about anyone.",
      "To bypass verification, scammers often send emergency data requests, claiming that someone\u2019s life is at risk and that the data is needed urgently. Because companies don\u2019t want to delay in case of an actual emergency, they may hand over the information, even if the request turns out to be fake. By portraying it as a life-or-death situation, scammers make it harder for companies to take time to verify the request.",
      "For example, the FBI reported that earlier this year, a known cybercriminal posted pictures on an online forum of a fake emergency data request they\u2019d sent to PayPal. The scammer tried to make it look legitimate by using a fraudulent mutual legal assistance treaty, claiming it was part of a local investigation into child trafficking, complete with a case number and legal code for verification. However, PayPal recognized that it wasn\u2019t a real law enforcement request and denied it.",

      "CYBERSCAMMERS USE AI TO MANIPULATE GOOGLE SEARCH RESULTS",
      "What can companies do to avoid falling for these phishing scams?",
      "1) Verify all data requests: Before sharing sensitive information, companies should verify every data request, even those that look legitimate. Establish a protocol for confirming requests directly with the agency or organization that supposedly sent them.",
      "2) Strengthen email security:\u00a0Use email authentication protocols like DMARC, SPF and DKIM to block emails from unauthorized sources. Implement anti-phishing filters to detect suspicious content in messages.",
      "3) Train employees on phishing awareness: Regular training sessions on phishing scams can help employees recognize red flags, such as urgent language, unusual requests or emails from unknown addresses. Employees should be encouraged to report suspicious emails.",
      "4) Limit access to sensitive data: Restrict who can view or share sensitive customer data. Fewer people with access means fewer chances for accidental or intentional data leaks.",
      "5) Implement emergency verification procedures: Have a clear verification process in place for \"emergency\" data requests, including steps for double-checking with higher management or legal teams before responding to any urgent request for customer information.",

      "1) Double-check email addresses and links: Even if an email looks official, take a moment to check the sender\u2019s email address and hover over any links to see where they actually lead. Be cautious if anything looks off. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Use\u00a02FA for all sensitive accounts. This extra layer of security helps protect you even if your login credentials are compromised.",
      "3) Stay updated on phishing scams:\u00a0Keep an eye on the latest phishing tactics, so you know what to look out for. Regular updates help you spot new types of scams before they affect you.",

      "Chef Robert Irvine of the Robert Irvine Foundation speaks with Fox News Digital about the importance of supporting veterans and first responders this Veterans Day and some unique ways to do so.",
      "Cyberscammers are some of the most heartless people out there. They don\u2019t even spare our military heroes.",
      "Last year, these criminals stole $477 million from veterans, military personnel and their spouses, according to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). That\u2019s a $63 million jump from 2022, showing that the military community is a big target for scammers. The number of military members who lost money to these attacks went up by 7% to 30,948, per the FTC\u2019s latest data.",
      "These scammers use all kinds of tricks to get veterans to hand over personal info or hard-earned cash, including veterans' benefit scams and IRS scams. I break down five of the most common scams targeting our military heroes and how to stay safe from them.",

      "Image of military personnel (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Romance scams",
      "Romance scams have become an increasingly painful reality for veterans, as scammers target them through fake online relationships to exploit their emotions and financial stability. Often, these scammers pose as attractive, understanding individuals on dating apps, social media platforms or even support forums specifically tailored for veterans. They\u2019ll build a relationship over weeks or months, using flattery and fabricated stories to create a strong emotional connection with their target.",
      "Once the scammer believes they\u2019ve gained enough trust, they\u2019ll ask for money, typically by inventing a sudden, urgent situation. It might be a \"medical emergency,\" a supposed travel expense to come to visit or even a claim that they need help with a legal matter. The requests start small but can quickly escalate as the scammer continues to manipulate the victim's emotions.",
      "This continues to be the most common fraud targeting veterans, costing them and their families over $40 million in 2020, according to Aura. Among all romance scam victims, those ages 50-69 were hit the hardest, losing $179.65 million in just the first three quarters of 2022. That figure has almost certainly surged in 2024.",

      "NEARLY 1 MILLION MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES FACE DATA BREACH",
      "Veterans benefit scams",
      "Some scammers pretend to offer help with veterans' benefits. They promise to help increase benefits or expedite claims, but they\u2019re really after personal information or a fee. A scammer might claim you\u2019re eligible for new or additional benefits, contacting you by phone, email or text. When dealing with unsolicited advice, remember that if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Phishing scams from fake government agencies",
      "Phishing scams are a social engineering trick where scammers send emails that look like they\u2019re from official places, like the government or your bank. These legit-looking emails act as bait, but the real goal is to grab your banking or credit card info.",
      "Sometimes, these scam emails will ask you to click a link or download an attachment, which can install malware on your device. Scammers are also known to send phishing links through LinkedIn, Facebook or other social media.",
      "One classic example is the IRS scam. Though it targets everyone, military members are prime targets. Scammers pretend to be IRS agents, threatening jail time, fines or other penalties if they don\u2019t get immediate payment. They even spoof IRS caller IDs to make their calls look real.",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Rental property scams",
      "Rental property scams are a common way scammers try to exploit people looking for a place to rent. In these scams, fraudsters often post fake listings for apartments or houses on popular rental websites or social media platforms. The listing might look too good to be true, like a beautiful place at an unbelievably low price.",
      "The scammer will usually claim to be out of town or unavailable to meet in person, asking potential renters to send a deposit or rent payment upfront to \"secure\" the property. In some cases, they may even send fake lease agreements or claim that the property is already rented, but they can still \"help\" find a similar place.",
      "BEWARE OF THIS SOCIAL SECURITY SCAM BY CROOKS TRYING TO TRICK YOU",
      "Car sales and financing scams",
      "Car sales and financing scams targeting veterans are unfortunately common. Scammers know that veterans may have limited experience with certain financial deals, so they exploit that by offering unrealistic car sales or financing options. These scams can take various forms, and the result is often financial loss and stress.",
      "Image of military personnel honoring our troops (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "6 ways veterans can protect themselves from scams",
      "1) Be cautious with unsolicited offers: Whether it\u2019s a phone call, email or text, if someone claims to offer help with veterans' benefits or promises something too good to be true, don\u2019t take the bait. Verify the legitimacy of any offer directly through official channels like the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or trusted veteran organizations.",
      "2) Watch out for emotional manipulation in online relationships: Romance scammers often prey on veterans' emotions. Avoid sharing personal or financial details with people you meet online, especially if the relationship feels rushed or too perfect. If someone asks for money after just a few weeks or months, it\u2019s likely a scam.",
      "3) Verify government communications: Scammers often impersonate government agencies like the IRS or VA. If you get a message that threatens penalties or asks for personal information, don\u2019t respond. Instead, contact the agency directly using official contact details to confirm whether the message is legitimate.",
      "4) Be skeptical of rental or car sale deals that seem too good to be true: If a rental listing or car sale seems too cheap or perfect to be true, it probably is. Always visit the property or dealership in person, and never send money upfront without seeing the product or having a signed agreement.",
      "5) Protect your personal information: Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown sources. Scammers use phishing emails and fake websites to steal personal and financial information. Ensure your devices have updated security software and be extra cautious when handling sensitive data online.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6)\u00a0Invest in data removal services: Consider using data removal services to protect your personal information from being harvested by scammers. These services can help remove your data from public databases and people-search websites, reducing the risk of identity theft and unwanted solicitations.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Scammers rely on misinformation to trick you. However, by staying informed and being extra careful when navigating the internet, you can stay safe. These bad actors are constantly finding new ways to target veterans, from romance scams to fake government offers. Being cautious, verifying offers and keeping your data secure are the best ways to avoid falling victim to these heartless fraudsters.",

      "By masking your IP address and encrypting your data, a VPN makes you nearly invisible to online threats.",
      "Let\u2019s dive into how this powerful tool can safeguard your online activities and keep your financial transactions secure.",
      "I\u2019M GIVING AWAY A $500 GIFT CARD FOR THE HOLIDAYS",
      "A woman using a VPN on a tablet\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is a VPN?",
      "A VPN, or virtual private network, is a service that encrypts your internet connection, ensuring that your online activities remain private and secure. By routing your internet traffic through a secure server, VPNs mask your IP address, making it difficult for hackers and malicious entities to track your online behavior.",
      "A VPN being used on a laptop\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "CAN YOU BYPASS VPN BLOCKS AND PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY?",
      "How VPNs work",
      "VPNs operate through two primary mechanisms \u2014 IP address masking and data encryption. When you connect to a VPN, it hides your real IP address by assigning you a new one from its server network, effectively preventing websites and cybercriminals from tracking your location or identifying you based on your IP address.",
      "Simultaneously, VPNs encrypt all data transmitted between your device and the internet, rendering it unreadable to anyone who might attempt to intercept it. This encryption process ensures that sensitive information, such as credit card details, remains confidential throughout your online activities. By combining these two powerful features, VPNs create a secure tunnel for your internet traffic, significantly enhancing your online privacy and security.",

      "Identity theft occurs when someone illegally obtains your personal information to commit fraud. This can lead to unauthorized transactions and damage to your credit status. So, how can a VPN prevent identity theft? By encrypting your internet connection, VPNs protect against data breaches and unauthorized access to personal information, especially on unsecured networks like public Wi-Fi.

      "Online transactions are vulnerable to interception by cybercriminals looking to steal financial information such as credit card numbers and banking credentials. A VPN can be used as a shield for financial data. VPNs ensure that all data exchanged during online transactions is encrypted, making it nearly impossible for hackers to access sensitive financial information. When using public Wi-Fi networks, which are often targeted by cybercriminals, a VPN provides an additional layer of security by encrypting all data transmissions.",

      "2. Use strong passwords:\u00a0Combine the use of a VPN with strong, unique passwords for each of your accounts to enhance security. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",

      "ChatGPT is an amazing tool, and its developer, OpenAI, keeps adding new features from time to time.",
      "Recently, the company introduced a new memory feature in ChatGPT, which essentially enables it to remember things about you. For example, it can recall your age, gender, philosophical beliefs and pretty much anything else.",
      "These memories are meant to remain private, but a researcher recently demonstrated how ChatGPT's artificial intelligence memory features can be manipulated, raising questions about privacy and security.",
      "I\u2019M GIVING AWAY A $500 GIFT CARD FOR THE HOLIDAYS",
      "ChatGPT introduction screen. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is ChatGPT's Memory feature?",
      "ChatGPT\u2019s memory feature is designed to make the chatbot more personal to you. It remembers information that might be useful for future conversations and tailors responses based on that information, even if you open a different chat. For example, if you mention that you\u2019re vegetarian, the next time you ask for recipes, it will provide only vegetarian options.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "You can also train it to remember specific details about you, such as saying, \"Remember that I like to watch classic movies.\" In future interactions, it will tailor recommendations accordingly.

      "A prompt on ChatGPT. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "WINDOWS FLAW LETS HACKERS SNEAK INTO YOUR PC OVER WI-FI",
      "The security vulnerability in ChatGPT",
      "As reported by\u00a0Arstechnica, security researcher Johann Rehberger found that it\u2019s possible to trick the AI into remembering false information through a method called indirect prompt injection. This means the AI can be manipulated into accepting instructions from unreliable sources like emails or blog posts.",
      "For instance, Rehberger demonstrated that he could trick ChatGPT into believing a certain user was 102 years old, lived in a fictional place called the Matrix and thought the Earth was flat. After the AI accepts this made-up information, it will carry it over to all future chats with that user. These false memories could be implanted by using tools like Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive to store files, upload images or even browse a site like Bing \u2014 all of which could be manipulated by a hacker.",
      "Rehberger submitted a follow-up report that included a proof of concept, demonstrating how he could exploit the flaw in the ChatGPT app for macOS. He showed that by tricking the AI into opening a web link containing a malicious image, he could make it send everything a user typed and all the AI's responses to a server he controlled. This meant that if an attacker could manipulate the AI in this way, they could monitor all conversations between the user and ChatGPT.",
      "Rehberger's proof-of-concept exploit demonstrated that the vulnerability could be used to exfiltrate all user input in perpetuity. The attack isn't possible through the ChatGPT web interface, thanks to an API OpenAI rolled out last year. However, it was still possible through the ChatGPT app for macOS.",
      "When Rehberger privately reported the finding to OpenAI in May, the company took it seriously and mitigated this issue by ensuring that the model doesn\u2019t follow any links generated within its own responses, like those involving memory and similar features.",

      "CYBER SCAMMERS USE AI TO MANIPULATE GOOGLE SEARCH RESULTS",
      "OpenAI\u2019s response",
      "After Rehberger shared his proof of concept, OpenAI engineers took action and released a patch to address this vulnerability. They released a new version of the ChatGPT macOS application (version 1.2024.247) that encrypts conversations and fixes the security flaw.",
      "So, while OpenAI has taken steps to address the immediate security flaw, there are still potential vulnerabilities related to memory manipulation and the need for ongoing vigilance in using AI tools with memory features. The incident underscores the evolving nature of security challenges in AI systems.",
      "The company says, \"It\u2019s important to note that prompt injection in large language models is an area of ongoing research. As new techniques emerge, we address them at the model layer via instruction hierarchy or application-layer defenses like the ones mentioned.\"",

      "Cybersecurity best practices: Protecting your data in the age of AI",
      "As AI technologies like ChatGPT become more prevalent, it's crucial to adhere to cybersecurity best practices to protect your personal information. Here are some tips for enhancing your cybersecurity:",
      "1. Regularly review privacy settings:\u00a0Stay informed about what data is being collected. Periodically check and adjust privacy settings on AI platforms like ChatGPT and others to ensure you\u2019re only sharing information you\u2019re comfortable with.",
      "2. Be cautious about sharing sensitive information:\u00a0Less is more when it comes to personal data. Avoid disclosing sensitive details such as your full name, address, or financial information in conversations with AI.",
      "3. Use strong, unique passwords:\u00a0Create passwords that are at least 12 characters long, combining letters, numbers, and symbols, and avoid reusing them across different accounts. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA): Add an extra layer of security to your ChatGPT and other AI accounts.\u00a0By requiring a second form of verification, such as a text message code, you significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access.",
      "5. Keep software and applications up to date:\u00a0Stay ahead of vulnerabilities.\u00a0Regular updates often include security patches that protect against newly discovered threats, so enable automatic updates whenever possible.",
      "6. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0 In an age where AI is everywhere, protecting your data from cyber threats is more important than ever. Adding strong antivirus software to your devices adds a critical layer of protection. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices.",
      "7. Regularly monitor your accounts:\u00a0Catch issues early. Frequently check bank statements and online accounts for any unusual activity, which can help you identify potential\u00a0breaches quickly.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "As AI tools like ChatGPT get smarter and more personal, it's pretty interesting to think about how they can tailor conversations to us. But, as Johann Rehberger\u2019s findings remind us, there are some real risks involved, especially when it comes to privacy and security. While OpenAI is able to mitigate these issues as they arise, it also shows that we need to keep a close eye on how these features work. It's all about finding that sweet spot between innovation and keeping our data safe.",

      "The University of Rochester said hundreds of \"wanted\" posters seeking Jewish members of faculty were found posted around campus in recent days.",
      "In an update Wednesday, the Department of Public Safety (DPS) said it believes all the wanted posters, found in buildings across campus, including classroom spaces, have been removed, but anyone who finds more should contact the department.",
      "DPS Chief Quchee Collins said in a statement that the department has identified \"several persons of interest,\" including \"current students, individuals whose current enrollment status is unclear, and other individuals,\" as it continues to investigate the incident.",
      "The posters reportedly listed Jewish faculty members, including senior university leaders and members of the Board of Trustees, saying they are \"wanted\" for alleged \"war crimes,\" as the Israeli military continues its operation against Hamas terrorists in Gaza launched in response to the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks. Some posters accused those Jewish faculty members of \"ethnic cleansing\" and encouraging the \"displacement of Palestinians,\" or of perpetuating \"racism\" and \"hate speech,\" USA Today reported.",
      "\"I want to be as clear as I can that the University of Rochester strongly denounces the recent display of 'wanted' posters targeting senior university leaders and members of our faculty, staff, and Board of Trustees,\" University President Sarah Mangelsdorf said in a statement Tuesday. \"This act is disturbing, divisive, and intimidating and runs counter to our values as a university.\"",

      "\"Furthermore, several of those depicted appear to have been targeted because they are members of our Jewish community. We view this as antisemitism, which will not be tolerated at our University,\" she added. \"This isn\u2019t who we are. This goes against everything we stand for and we have an obligation to reject it.\"",
      "DPS said it was first made aware on Sunday night that \"hundreds\" of posters depicting members of the university community as \"wanted\" were posted around campus and \"immediately began working to remove the posters and return the spaces to their usual state.\" The department said the removal process \"is painstaking because of the strong adhesive used to affix the posters, which in some cases caused damage to walls, floors, chalkboards, and other surfaces.\"",
      "Collins said Wednesday that DPS has reached out to the individuals depicted on the posters to offer \"additional safety support and resources.\"",
      "Among those listed on the posters was James Newell, who retired in August as the university's assistant security director, USA Today reported. Newell said he believes he was targeted in connection to the arrest of a University of Rochester student in December 2023 who allegedly punched a school officer attempting to disperse an unauthorized anti-Israel campus protest. However, Newell said, he was at the security office when the arrest took place.",
      "The posters also depicted Joy Getnick, a member of the Hillel at the University of Rochester, who told WHEC-TV that such signage spreads \"harmful antisemitic ideas about the Jewish people and about Israel.\"",
      "Anti-Israel protesters sit in the Wilson Quadrangle at the University of Rochester on April 23, 2024. (Jeffrey Meehan/Democrat and Chronicle / USA TODAY NETWORK)",

      "\"We are continuing to pursue all available leads, and we are working diligently to gather and analyze all relevant evidence to ensure a thorough investigation,\" Collins said Wednesday. \"It is the intention of my office to identify and apprehend those whom our investigation determines to be involved in this incident and to ensure these individuals are turned over to the appropriate criminal justice and/or University conduct processes.\"",
      "\"As President Mangelsdorf stated, this behavior cannot and will not be tolerated at our University,\" the chief added. \"The safety and well-being of our campus community remains our highest priority.\"",

Public Safety continues to monitor all parts of the University while continuing our investigation, and we are available to provide an immediate response to anyone who is concerned with their safety.\"",

      "Rubio is blunt on China, writing on X, for example, \"Communist China is not, and will never be, a friend to democratic nations.\" In May 2022, Rubio introduced the \"Taiwan Peace Through Strength Act,\" a bill that would fast-track U.S.-Taiwan military coordination.\u00a0Rubio stated in connection to the bill that, \"Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine is not the first time an authoritarian regime invaded its neighbor and, unfortunately, it won\u2019t be the last.

We must do all we can to deter an attack on Taiwan, or we risk losing the Indo-Pacific region to the Chinese Communist Party.\"",
      "Rubio as a potential secretary of state is a problem for China, as the Florida Republican is blacklisted, or in more diplomatic terms, \"sanctioned.\" Rubio was among the 11 U.S. senators China sanctioned in 2020 for their \"wrong U.S. behaviors \u2026 who have behaved egregiously on Hong Kong-related issues.\"",

      "After the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel and the subsequent wars against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, Iran-backed groups have not only levied increasing fire at Washington\u2019s top ally in the Middle East, but also its troops in Iraq and Syria as well as U.S. naval vessels targeted by Houthi terrorists in Yemen.",

Though the figure is still just half the number of attacks levied in January when some 34 strikes targeted U.S. personnel in Syria along with 19 in Iraq.",
      "Cicurel clarified for Fox News Digital that these strikes are by organizations like the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, which is an \"umbrella mechanism for Iran\u2019s proxies\" and includes terrorist groups likes Kataib Hezbollah, Kataib Sayyid al-Shuhada, Asaib Ahl al-Haq, Ansar Allah al-Awfiya and Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba, to claim attacks against Israel and U.S. forces.\"",

      "But according to the JINSA report, prior to the October 2023 attacks by Hamas, Iran-sanctioned militant groups opted to target U.S. troops over Israeli positions because \"Iranian-linked groups determined that the U.S. responses would be less forceful than Israel\u2019s.\"",
      "That strategy halted after the Hamas attack on Israel, and in October this year alone Iran-backed groups launched more than 110 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), missiles and rockets at Israel from Iraq.",

      "Drawing on satellite images and public documents including project tenders, personnel files, environmental impact studies \u2014 and even a citizen\u2019s complaint about noisy construction and excessive dust \u2014 they concluded a prototype reactor for naval propulsion was being built in the mountains of Mucheng township, some 70 miles southwest of Sichuan's provincial capital Chengdu.",

      "Satellite mages from 2020 to 2023 have shown the demolition of homes and the construction of water intake infrastructure connected to the reactor site. Contracts for steam generators and turbine pumps indicate the project involves a pressurized water reactor with a secondary circuit \u2014 a profile that is consistent with naval propulsion reactors, the researchers say.",
      "An environmental impact report calls the Longwei Project a \"national defense-related construction project\" that is classified \"secret.\"",
      "\"Unless China is developing nuclear-powered cruisers, which were pursued only by the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, then the Nuclear Power Development Project most certainly refers to a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier development effort,\" researchers wrote in a detailed 19-page report on their findings shared exclusively with the AP.",
      "Jamie Withorne, an analyst at the Oslo Nuclear Project who was not involved in the research and reviewed the findings, said Middlebury's team made a \"convincing argument.\"",
      "\"From the identifying reports, co-location with other naval reactor facilities, and correlating construction activity, I think it can be said that it is likely the Longwei Project is housed at Base 909, and it could potentially be located at the identified building,\" she said.",
      "The research does not, however, provide clues as to when a Chinese nuclear-powered carrier could be built and become operational, she said.",
      "Sarah Laderman, a senior analyst with Open Nuclear Network, a program of the U.S.-based NGO PAX sapiens foundation, said the findings were \"carefully conducted and thoroughly researched.\"",
      "\"Given the evidence presented here, I see a compelling case made that China seems to be working towards building a nuclear propulsion system for its naval surface ships (likely aircraft carriers) at this location,\" said Laderman, who is based in Vienna and was not involved in Middlebury\u2019s research.",
      "Pursuit of a nuclear-powered carrier",
      "China\u2019s first carrier, commissioned in 2012, was a repurposed Soviet ship, and its second was built in China but based upon the Soviet design. Both ships \u2014 named the Liaoning and the Shandong \u2014 employ a so-called \"ski-jump\" type launch method, with a ramp at the end of a short runway to help planes take off.",
      "The Type 003 Fujian, launched in 2022, was the country's third carrier and its first to be indigenously designed and built. It employs an electromagnetic-type launch system like those developed and used by the U.S. Navy. All three carriers are conventionally powered.",
      "Sea trials hadn\u2019t even started for the Fujian in March when Yuan Huazhi, political commissar for China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy, confirmed the construction of a fourth carrier.

      "There has been speculation that China may begin producing two new carriers at once \u2014 one Type 003 like the Fujian and one nuclear-powered Type 004 \u2014 something that it has not attempted before but that its shipyards have the capacity to do.",
      "Matthew Funaiole, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies\u2019 China Power Project, said he doubts China's next carrier will be nuclear-powered. Instead, he said, he would expect the People's Liberation Army Navy's fourth carrier to focus on optimizing the existing design of the Fujian carrier with \"incremental improvements.\"",
      "Nick Childs, senior fellow for naval forces and maritime security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the Chinese \"have taken an incremental approach to their carrier development with a number of ambitions that will evolve over time.\"",
      "\"For now, their deployments have been relatively cautious, remaining largely within range of shore support, but projecting influence and to some extent coercion within their near waters.\"",
      "CHINA OFFICIALLY 'DOESN'T CARE' ABOUT TRUMP WIN; UNOFFICIALLY, EXPERTS SAY BEIJING IS RATTLED",
      "Eventually, however, \"larger carriers more akin to their U.S. counterparts will give them more options to project power,\" Childs said.",
      "It takes several years to build a carrier and bring it into operation, but developing nuclear propulsion for its next generation of warships would eventually give China more power to run advanced systems, such as electromagnetic launchers, radars and new technology weapons, Childs said.",
      "\"As well as obviating the need for the ship to refuel regularly and therefore giving it much greater range, nuclear power means that without the need to carry fuel oil for the ship there will be room aboard for fuel and weapons for its aircraft, extending their capabilities,\" Childs said.",
      "\"Much will depend on what overall size the next carrier is, but the addition of nuclear power will represent a significant step further in China\u2019s carrier development with a vessel more comparable to the U.S. Navy\u2019s carriers.\"",
      "Zhao, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said nuclear-powered carriers would provide the Chinese military \"with greater flexibility and endurance to operate around strategic hotspots, especially along the First Island Chain, where most territories disputed by China are located,\" said Zhao.",
      "The First Island Chain includes the self-governed island of Taiwan, which China claims as its own and vows to annex it by force if necessary.",
      "The U.S. is obligated by a domestic law to supply Taiwan with sufficient weapons to deter invasion, and it could provide assistance to the island from its bases in the Pacific in the event of an invasion or blockade. Tensions also have risen in the South China Sea between China and neighboring nations over territorial disputes and maritime claims.",
      "\"These carriers could also extend Chinese operations deeper into the Western Pacific, further challenging the U.S. military\u2019s ability to \u2018intervene\u2019 in regional matters that China views as best resolved by countries from the region only,\" Zhao said.",
      "U.S.-China rivalry",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has tasked defense officials with building a \"first-class\" navy and becoming a maritime power as part of his blueprint for the country\u2019s rejuvenation.",
      "The country\u2019s most recent white paper on national defense, dated 2019, said the Chinese navy was adjusting to strategic requirements by \"speeding up the transition of its tasks from defense on the near seas to protection missions on the far seas.\"",
      "The People's Liberation Army Navy is already the world\u2019s largest navy with more than 370 ships and submarines. The country also boasts powerful shipbuilding capabilities: China\u2019s shipyards are building many hundreds of vessels each year, whereas the U.S. is building five or fewer, according to a U.S. congressional report late last year.",

      "However, the Chinese navy lags behind the U.S. Navy in many respects. Among other advantages, the U.S. currently has 11 carriers, all nuclear powered, allowing it to keep multiple strike groups deployed around the world at all times, including in the Indo-Pacific.",
      "But the Pentagon is growingly increasingly concerned about China\u2019s rapid modernization of its fleet, including the design and construction of new carriers.",

    "summary": "Some staff members at the Food and Drug Administration are considering a quick exit as Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
    "story": [
      "Some staff members at the Food and Drug Administration are considering a quick exit as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is being floated as a potential health official in the incoming Trump administration, according to three former and one current government official who were granted anonymity to speak freely about sensitive issues. The former officials are still in touch with colleagues who work at the FDA.",
      "Staff turnover is typical when a new administration comes in, and a significant number of FDA employees similarly considered leaving before President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s first term in office, said one former and one current official. At the time, there were also concerns about what the FDA would look like under the first Trump administration.",
      "But there ended up being \u201crelatively little turnover\u201d at the time, said one former official, adding that Trump\u2019s first term generally worked out well for those who stayed at the FDA,\u00a0 as they were able to \u201cexecute\u201d on new priorities for the agency, such as accelerated drug approvals.",
      "This time, however, there\u2019s an added layer of anxiety outside Trump: Kennedy.",
      "\u201cWith the first administration, more people took a wait-and-see approach. Now, between the concerns about new post-employment restrictions and the risk of involuntary separation, more people are looking proactively,\u201d one former official said.",
      "The current official agreed with that assessment, adding that \u201cdozens\u201d are most likely considering their options.",
      "It\u2019s not yet known what kind of health role Kennedy will have in the administration \u2014 if any \u2014 but Trump has said he\u2019ll let the former independent presidential candidate and vaccine skeptic \u201cgo wild on health.\u201d\u00a0 Meanwhile, Kennedy is promising a shakeup at the federal health agencies, including the FDA, telling NBC News the day after the election\u00a0 that \u201cin some categories, there are entire departments, like the nutrition department at the FDA that are, that have to go.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe question now is, will the agency have leadership that\u2019s able to come in and continue to advance innovative new products, or is there going to be leadership that tries to shake things up in a way that actually could make it harder for the agency to do its core mission?\u201d one of the former officials said.",
      "The FDA did not respond to a request for comment on whether employees were considering leaving.",
      "One former official and one current official said that at this time it\u2019s all chatter and it\u2019s unclear if anyone has left yet or made any serious plans to do so.",
      "At a cancer research event Tuesday, FDA Commissioner Robert Califf said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the election results and was uncertain about the agency\u2019s future.",
      "Asked whether he foresees any kind of \u201cmass exodus\u201d of employees, Califf said, \u201cI think people are waiting to see.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen now,\u201d Califf said. \u201cI do think it\u2019s pretty clear that the gist of this administration from everything that\u2019s been said is to change a lot of things and how it gets changed depends on who gets appointed into key positions and how the various policies play out.\u201d",
      "Trump has also suggested he may seek to end the so-called revolving door, where government officials who leave the agency end up lobbying their former colleagues \u2014 an added layer of concern for staff about their future job prospects if they stay, one person said.",
      "Another said they weren\u2019t sure how such a restriction would look or how Trump would make it binding retroactively.",
      "One person said that a number of staffers at the FDA are up for retirement, and \u201c some may think now would be an opportune time to do so.\u201d There are more than 18,000 employees at the FDA, according to the agency.",
      "It\u2019s also possible Kennedy will be put in a role that has little or no influence over the overall functioning of the FDA.",
      "Last month, NBC News reported that the Trump campaign was thinking of having Kennedy spearhead what\u2019s been described as \u201cOperation Warp Speed for childhood chronic disease,\u201d referring to the title of the Covid vaccine development project during Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "Kennedy has also floated the idea that he would be a White House \u201chealth czar.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 As he waged his winning campaign, Donald Trump described the Justice Department as a hotbed of partisan prosecutors who had \u201cweaponized\u201d law enforcement and the military as a fighting force that had forsaken its mission in favor of political decorum.",
      "A Trump presidency would fix all that, he pledged, and with his choices to lead the Defense and Justice departments, along with other agencies, he has shown he meant just what he said.",
      "Since his decisive victory last week, Trump has tapped trusted allies to carry out the priorities that align with what he promised voters.",
      "If he wins Senate confirmation, Matt Gaetz will become the next attorney general, with power to end the Justice Department\u2019s traditional independence from the White House and ensure that it is a reliable tool of Trump\u2019s political interests.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is going to hit the Justice Department with a blowtorch, and Matt Gaetz is that torch,\u201d Steve Bannon, Trump\u2019s former White House strategist, told NBC News.",
      "Gaetz, R-Fla., submitted his resignation from the House on Wednesday.",
      "In Pete Hegseth, a former Fox News personality, Trump would have at his side a defense secretary who may be called upon to purge the armed forces of the sorts of generals Trump has deemed anathema to America\u2019s military superiority.",
      "Former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who was a Democrat in Congress but has since left the party, has been tapped to be the director of national intelligence, despite limited experience in that arena.",
      "Trump picked a hard-line former immigration official, Tom Homan, to be his border czar and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, who once gave him a model of Mount Rushmore that included his face, for homeland security secretary. If they are confirmed, both would be crucial to his plan to evict undocumented immigrants on an unprecedented scale.",
      "Follow live updates on the aftermath of the 2024 election",
      "Trump\u2019s transition team announced a rolling series of Cabinet picks this week as he moves swiftly to set up an administration and capitalize on the electoral victory that has given him the popular mandate he didn\u2019t enjoy when he won in 2016.",
      "One difference this time is that he's elevating people he largely knows and likes, as opposed to strangers boasting impressive credentials and r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. In his first term, he nominated a retired four-star general, James Mattis, for defense secretary. Mattis had commanded troops in wartime and was considered a blend of soldier and scholar, with a library of thousands of books.",
      "As homeland security chief, Trump at the time chose John Kelly, another retired four-star general, whose son was killed fighting in Afghanistan.",
      "Trump broke with both men, ousting Mattis and parting ways with Kelly after having brought him into the White House to be his chief of staff.",
      "At the time, both Mattis and Kelly were seen as \"adults in the room\" who would guide a new president who'd never held public office.",
      "That model didn't suit Trump, and he's plainly abandoning it as he shapes a new presidency.",
      "The Gaetz and Hegseth announcements, in particular, drew backlash.",
      "Neither has run anything as complex and consequential as the departments they\u2019d be leading. Hegseth was deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq and served in the National Guard for more than 19 years.",
      "A Trump transition official said Hegseth is \u201cperhaps unorthodox to inside-the-Beltway types [but] exactly the kind of young, talented, new thinker that can execute for DJT [Donald J. Trump] with lessons the president learned from his first term.\u201d",
      "Still, in filling jobs with such vast responsibility, experience counts, others said.",
      "\"You need two things: competence and character. You need people who have deep, large, organizational experience, ideally with the public sector. We\u2019re not seeing that with these picks,\u201d said Max Stier, chief executive of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit group devoted to improving government effectiveness.",
      "Gaetz has been investigated over allegations of sex trafficking of a 17-year-old girl. The federal probe didn\u2019t result in criminal charges, and he has long denied wrongdoing.",
      "A Justice Department official called the Gaetz announcement \"truly stunning\u201d; another labeled it \u201cinsane.\u201d",
      "At this point, Trump has shown no signs of backing down. He won a clear-cut victory over Democrat Kamala Harris. His party will control both the House and the Senate, and Congress\u2019 habit is to give presidents latitude in choosing their own teams.",
      "In this instance, a fight might be in the offing. Trump will need united support from Senate Republicans; he may not get it.",
      "Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said she didn't think Gaetz was \"a serious nomination for the attorney general.\" Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said he was \"a long shot.\"",
      "From bitter experience, Trump knows that he needs an attorney general he can trust implicitly, and it might be worth the political capital to battle for Gaetz's confirmation.",
      "Little happened in Trump\u2019s first term that angered him as much as Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 decision to recuse himself and appoint a special counsel to investigate whether there were links between his 2016 campaign and Russia.",
      "\u201cThis is the end of my presidency. I\u2019m f-----,\u201d Trump said, according to a report filed by the special counsel, Robert Mueller.",

      "In Gaetz, Trump would get an attorney general who has said Trump won the election that year, as well as an iconoclast who shares his willingness to upset the status quo.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t care if it takes every second of our time and every ounce of our energy,\" Gaetz said at a conference of conservative activists last year. \"We either get this government back on our side or we defund and get rid of \u2014 abolish the FBI, CDC, ATF, DOJ, every last one of \u2019em if they do not come to heel.\"",
      "Asked about the likelihood of Gaetz\u2019s making it through Senate confirmation, a source close to Trump told NBC News: \u201cThe American people made clear that they want President Trump to remake Washington, and Rep. Gaetz is the perfect man to restore the DOJ to greatness.",

      "\u201cWhat the f--- is happening?!\u201d asked a senior Justice Department official, who, like others quoted in this story, spoke anonymously to candidly assess the man chosen to head their department.The official called it \"laughable\" that Gaetz was nominated, saying he should not be confirmed to such a critical position at a monumental juncture in history.",
      "Another Justice Department employee said, \"I\u2019m struggling to find words.\"",

      "A current senior Justice Department official \"did not see this coming,\" while another called it \"absolutely unbelievable.\"",
      "Within the halls of Justice Department headquarters on Pennsylvania Avenue on Wednesday, the mood was somber, as some employees sat and processed what impact Gaetz might have on the institution, which has operated under a set of post-Watergate norms designed to prevent political bias from affecting criminal investigations.",

      "In the years after the attack, he spread conspiracy theories about Ray Epps, a Trump supporter and Jan. 6 defendant who was falsely portrayed as a government agent, as well as about the pipe bombs that were left outside the Republican National Committee and the Democratic National Committee on the eve of the attack.",
      "Gaetz also tried to visit Jan. 6 detainees in jail and demanded the release of all of the surveillance tapes from the attack. One Jan. 6 defendant, Brandon Straka, said early last year that he was \u201cregularly\u201d in contact with Gaetz about the fate of those charged in relation to the Capitol attack.",
      "Once Trump takes office, Gaetz will still need to be formally nominated for the job, a position that is confirmed by the Senate. Senate Republicans expressed bafflement with the choice of Gaetz on Wednesday, though most were careful to leave the door open to him.",
      "A former senior Justice Department official, meanwhile, said in a text message Gaetz's selection \"cannot be real.\"",
      "\"Matt lacks any substance and any understanding about the way the Dept works,\" the former official continued. \"He would be the final decision-maker on real important matters of national security and this is someone completely unprincipled.\u201d",

Noblewoman Jeanne de La Motte then, so the story goes, posed as the queen and convinced an out-of-favor cardinal to give her the lavish necklace as a gift before absconding with the lucrative diamonds.",
      "A subsequent trial found the queen innocent, but the same could not be said of the court of public opinion. The French Revolution followed years later.",
      "It is unclear exactly how the necklace ended up in the hands of a British aristocratic family, the Pagets.",
      "The Marchioness of Anglesey, a member of the Paget family, wore the necklace at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in June 1953.",
      "According to Sotheby\u2019s, the family parted with the piece after it was acquired by an \u201cimportant Asian private collection in the 1970s.\u201d",
      "The necklace has been in private hands ever since.",
      "In 2022, bracelets that once belonged to\u00a0Marie Antoinette sold for more than $8 million at\u00a0auction,\u00a0also in Geneva."

    "story": [
      "Police confirmed that they responded to a call involving white nationalist Nick Fuentes and a woman who appeared to show up at his Illinois home Sunday unannounced after he was doxxed online.",
      "Marla Rose, 57, said in a now-deleted Facebook post that she was about to ring Fuentes\u2019 doorbell when he opened the door, sprayed her with a liquid, took her phone, pushed her down the steps and went back inside. Rose did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",
      "Rose shared a video of the altercation Tuesday on Facebook. In the video, Fuentes opens the door and points what appears to be a spraying device toward the camera. The person holding the camera says, \u201cOh, my God, what are you doing?\u201d and the camera seems to be knocked over as Fuentes says, \u201cGet the f--- out of here.\u201d Fuentes then grabs the phone, takes it inside the house and appears to lock the door, and the video ends.",
      "The Berwyn Police Department confirmed that it got a call Sunday involving Fuentes and Rose. Deputy Chief Michael Ochsner Jr. said that \u201cat this time, neither party is willing to cooperate with the investigation, so we are unable to take it any further until there is a change to that status.\u201d",
      "On Monday, Fuentes hinted at the incident by reposting an X post by Tristan Tate, alt-right influencer Andrew Tate\u2019s brother, that read, \u201cIf a man turned up at a \u2018pro choice\u2019 woman\u2019s house to confront her about her views she could literally shoot him dead and nobody would care.\u201d He also reposted an X post by far-right commentator Candace Owens, who wrote about the incident, \u201cShe is lucky she wasn\u2019t in a \u2018stand your ground\u2019 state or she could have been shot.\u201d Fuentes did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",
      "Fuentes has faced a wave of backlash for a post on X on Nov. 5, when he wrote, \u201cYour body, my choice. Forever,\u201d referring to abortion policies. The phrase has become a meme in some right-wing circles. Afterward, many users on X began spreading Fuentes\u2019 personal information online, including his home address and pictures of his house, writing, \u201cYour house, our choice.\u201d Since then, Google Maps has blurred its picture of Fuentes\u2019 house.",
      "In her original deleted post, in which she disclosed Fuentes\u2019 home address multiple times, Rose wrote that she found Fuentes\u2019 information after a friend messaged her his address, seeing that they lived in the same town. Rose wrote that she was inspired to \u201cpop over there\u201d given Fuentes\u2019 history of antisemitic and white supremacist statements.",
      "In an interview with Vice Magazine, Rose said that she showed up at Fuentes\u2019 door \u201cto ask him, \u2018Why do you feel comfortable saying the things that you say?\u2019\u201d and that \u201cpart of my curiosity about him was being a Jewish person living in a town with an actual, proud Nazi.\u201d Rose also told Vice that her address has started to circulate online.",
      "Rose had written in her deleted Facebook post that she was prompted to ring the doorbell after another woman who was in her car outside Fuentes\u2019 house told her, \u201cYou should ring his doorbell and see what he has to say for himself.\u201d She said the same woman called the police after the incident to file a police report. Rose wrote that a police officer called an ambulance to check her eyes but that she did not sustain any major injuries besides \u201ca sore\u201d on her right side, where she said she had fallen. The Berwyn Police Department said it did take a report on the incident but that it has not released it to the public yet.",
      "Rose and her husband, John Beske, have said they have faced harassment since the incident. Beske wrote Tuesday on Facebook that they were \u201cswatted,\u201d a form of harassment in which police are called to a residence without cause."

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 18:46:36 GMT",
    "summary": "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul OK'd a first-in-the-nation congestion pricing plan that would charge  $9 to most vehicles entering Manhattan during peak hours.",
    "story": [
      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul gave the green light Thursday to relaunch the drive for congestion pricing in New York City, a first-in-the-nation plan aimed at reducing gridlock by imposing a $9 toll on most vehicles entering the core of Manhattan during peak hours.",
      "Hochul made the announcement four months after she put the brakes on an earlier version that would have gone into effect in June and would have charged cars $15 to enter Manhattan\u00a0below 61st Street, and hit trucks with even higher tolls a few months later.",
      "At the time, Hochul said congestion pricing at that rate would be a hardship on New Yorkers struggling to make ends meet in the post-pandemic economy.",
      "\u201cI believe that no New Yorker should have to pay a penny more than absolutely necessary to achieve these goals, and $15 was too much,\u201d Hochul said Thursday at a news conference. \u201cI am proud to announce we have found a path to fund the MTA, reduce congestion and keep millions of dollars in the pockets of our commuters.\u201d",
      "The lower toll will still allow officials to make improvements to New York City's aging transit system \"and begin to drive down gridlock\" while improving air quality for all New Yorkers, she said.",
      "\"Years and years of disinvestment by previous administrations ends today,\" Hochul said.",
      "Now the race is on to get congestion pricing approved before President-elect Donald Trump, who opposes it, takes office in January.",
      "Hochul was still speaking when New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy issued a statement from the other side of the Hudson River condemning the plan and vowing to sue to stop it from going into effect.",
      "\"All of us need to listen to the message that voters across America sent last Tuesday, which is that the vast majority of Americans are experiencing severe economic strains and still feeling the effects of inflation,\" Murphy said. \"There could not be a worse time to impose a new $9 toll on individuals who are traveling into downtown Manhattan for work, school, or leisure.\"",
      "But Hochul stressed that drivers who make less than $50,000 a year would be eligible for a 50% discount and that the toll rates will be lower during off-peak hours to encourage overnight deliveries.",
      "The revised congestion pricing plan is expected to go before the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board for approval next week.",
      "State officials have said that the revised plan is unlikely to need a repeat of the time-consuming environmental review process because, when the MTA board voted 11 to 1 in favor of congestion pricing in March, it was for tolls ranging from $9 to $23.",
      "After the expected MTA approval, the state and city will then ink an agreement with transportation officials in the Biden administration, who have been supportive of congestion pricing.",
      "The toll plan is expected to go into effect in January.",
      "Hochul had been under pressure to move on congestion pricing from transit advocates and state lawmakers seeking funding for badly needed upgrades to the transit system, like the expansion of the Second Avenue subway line and installing modern subway signals and elevators in 23 stations.",
      "Not all motorists would be socked with higher tolls.",
      "While all the details of the new pricing structure were not immediately disclosed, NBC News reported in March that government vehicles would likely get full exemptions.",
      "The full $9 toll would not be in effect for taxis, but drivers would be charged $1.25 a ride. The same policy would apply to Uber, Lyft and other rideshare drivers, though their surcharge would be $2.50.",
      "Most drivers entering Manhattan's Central Business District, which stretches from 60th Street all the way down to the southern tip of the Financial District, would have to pay the toll.",
      "The full daytime rates would be in effect from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. each weekday and 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekends.",
      "Only one toll would be levied each day, which means any motorist who enters the area, then leaves and returns, would be charged only once that day.",
      "Proponents of the plan said congestion pricing would reduce the number of vehicles entering the most congested parts of Manhattan by 17% or about 153,000 cars.",
      "They also predicted that congestion pricing would generate $15 billion that could be used to modernize subways and buses."

    "story": [
      "JACKSON, Miss. \u2014 For out-of-state developers hoping to bring a win to Mississippi\u2019s capital, their pitch was flat.",
      "The city had long been searching for someone to develop part of downtown Jackson, and when two men showed up expressing their interest in late February, City Council member Virgi Lindsay agreed to meet with them at an upscale steakhouse in a nearby suburb.",
      "But they had \u201cno vision,\u201d Lindsay said in an interview, and they were short on details. She could not recall whether they even offered a business card.",
      "She left the dinner \u2014\u00a0after having paid for her own meal, a personal policy that is a holdover from her days as a newspaper reporter, she said \u2014\u00a0 not expecting to join them at a ribbon-cutting any time soon.",
      "\u201cI just thought I would never see them again, because I just felt like they were so poorly prepared,\u201d Lindsay said. \u201cI certainly did not suspect they were connected to the FBI.\u201d",
      "Now, Hinds County District Attorney Jody Owens, who invited her to the meeting and was present, is accused in a federal indictment filed in the Southern District of Mississippi of participating in and facilitating a bribery scheme that ensnared the mayor and members of the City Council. The out-of-state \u201cdevelopers\u201d were FBI agents. As part of a sting operation, they sought support from officials in Jackson, the state\u2019s largest city, for a phony hotel deal in exchange for cash and perks like shopping sprees and personal security details.",
      "Owens, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba and City Council member Aaron Banks were indicted last month on conspiracy and bribery charges. All have pleaded not guilty. A trial is set for early January.",
      "A City Council member, Angelique Lee, resigned in August and pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bribery. Sherik Marve Smith \u2014 a relative of Owens who court records say conspired to give \u201cthings of value,\u201d including cash payments and campaign donations, to elected officials in exchange for their support for the real estate project \u2014 also pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bribery. Smith did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "No other City Council members have been charged.",
      "The allegations in the federal indictment paint a picture of people entrusted to public office in a city where roughly 26% of residents live in poverty being accused of receiving more than $100,000 in \u201cbribe payments\u201d while being whisked away to hobnob on private jets and yachts.",
      "The bribery scandal is the latest in a series of challenges Jackson has faced in recent years. Last year residents went without garbage pickup for roughly two weeks amid a contract dispute.",
      "That breakdown came on the heels of a water system crisis that left much of the city without access to running water for days in 2022. The problems with the water system persisted, with residents being asked to boil their water for safety amid reports of brown water, leaking sewage and low water pressure. The system is now under the control of an interim third-party manager.",
      "\u201cPeople are tired; they just want some good stuff done,\u201d said Vernon Hartley, a City Council member for one of the city\u2019s poorest wards.",
      "The indictment lays out a roughly eight-month period when two FBI agents, posing as developers from Nashville, worked with Owens to secure support they would need to win a development project in the city.",
      "The undercover FBI agents arrived in Jackson in July 2023 looking for potential real estate opportunities and were put in touch with Owens, according to the indictment.",
      "The city had received a multimillion-dollar loan from the Department of Housing and Urban Development in 2008 to be used to pay for development projects in the city\u2019s downtown, and the city struggled to find anyone to take up the project throughout the years. The city made another effort in July 2023 to find developers by issuing a public request.",
      "Owens was campaigning for re-election when the developers flew him and others to Nashville on a private jet in October 2023 to discuss business opportunities in Jackson.",
      "After that trip, the indictment alleges, Owens boasted to undercover agents that he and Smith had \u201ca bag of f------ information on all the city councilmen\u201d that allowed him to \u201cget votes approved.\u201d",
      "A few weeks later, he would win re-election by a wide margin. At his victory party, he told developers that being the district attorney was a \u201cpart time job\u201d that he used to get leverage for his full time job of real estate development, the indictment alleges.",
      "\u201cThis is the part time job to get the conversations and the access. Access equals the other sh-t we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d he said, according to the indictment.",
      "Owens, whose attorney did not respond to a request for comment, said after last week\u2019s arraignment that \u201ccherry-picked statements of drunken locker room banter is not a crime.\u201d",
      "The next day, Owens and Smith negotiated a $250,000 payout to be divided between them and an unidentified person, with Owens and Smith receiving $100,000 each for securing support for the developers\u2019 project, according to the indictment.",
      "In December, the developers flew Smith, Owens and an unidentified witness to Florida on a private jet for a meeting on a yacht. Owens is alleged to have accepted $125,000 in cash from one of the agents on the yacht, according to the indictment.",
      "Owens boasted about his power to sway things, saying, \u201cEverybody needs something. Every file comes to us. Everybody needs something fixed,\u201d according to the indictment.",
      "Roughly a month later, in a meeting at the DA\u2019s office in a room he had dubbed the \u201cwar room,\u201d Owens gave the developers a heads-up that the city of Jackson would be putting out another request to solicit developers for a downtown development project that would include a hotel near the city\u2019s convention center, according to the indictment.",
      "The request for proposals issued in July failed to secure any approved projects.",
      "At that point, Owens and the developers\u2019 alleged efforts to secure support for the proposal seemed to pick up steam, and Banks, then the City Council president, was brought into the alleged scheme, according to the indictment.",
      "Banks is alleged to have told a developer at a meeting with Owens on Jan. 11 that \u201cfifty grand as soon as possible would help\u201d during a discussion about his support for their project, according to the indictment. The next month, Banks accepted $10,000 in cash from Owens, it alleges.",
      "Reached by phone Monday, Banks, who is charged with two felony counts, said, \u201cI have nothing to say.\u201d",
      "In February, Owens arranged a dinner to introduce Lumumba, the mayor, to the developers. The indictment alleges that during introductions, Owens said, \u201cI\u2019ve done background checks. They\u2019re not FBI by the way,\u201d and that he went on to explain their development interest to the mayor.",
      "After the dinner, Owens promised the developers he would get them three more votes, in addition to securing Banks and Lumumba, according to the indictment. He went into detail about how to funnel funds through campaign finance accounts and explained how to first \u201cclean\u201d the money, the indictment said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t give a sh-t where the money comes from. It can come from blood diamonds in Africa, I don\u2019t give a f------ sh-t,\u201d the indictment quotes Owens as saying. Owens said his job was to \u201cget this deal done.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe can take dope boy money, I don\u2019t give a sh-t. But I need to clean it and spread it,\u201d Owens said, according to the indictment.",
      "At least one other dinner among Owens, the developers and a council member would occur, according to court records. In late March, developers gave a bag of $3,000 in cash to Lee, then a member of the City Council, according to the indictment. The next day, she would spend more than $6,000 on luxury goods using one of the agent\u2019s credit cards, according to the indictment.",
      "In August, Lee pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bribery. She has not yet been sentenced. Lee\u2019s attorney did not respond to a request for comment, and a call to a number listed for Lee was not returned.",
      "Owens worked with the developers to concoct a plan by which he, Smith and Lumumba would travel to Florida for another meeting on the yacht, where Lumumba would receive $50,000, according to the indictment. They arranged for the money to be paid in five $10,000 \u201ccampaign contribution\u201d checks in exchange for Lumumba\u2019s moving back the deadline for the development proposals, according to the indictment. The developers agreed to pay him another $50,000 later, the indictment said.",
      "During the trip, Lumumba was recorded calling a city employee with instructions to change the deadline for proposals, according to the indictment.",
      "A spokesperson for Lumumba declined to comment.",
      "The same day, according to the indictment, Owens, Lumumba and the agents went to a venue identified only as a \u201cclub\u201d in court documents. Owens is alleged to have made $5,000 in cash available for Lumumba to spend there, while Lumumba is alleged to have instructed one of the developers \u201cto pay cash to employees of the club for Lumumba\u2019s benefit,\u201d according to court papers.",
      "In late May, the FBI searched Owens\u2019 office at the Hinds County District Attorney\u2019s Office under a warrant. During the raid, they found that a book titled \u201cThe Constitution of The United States\u201d was actually a lockbox, according to the indictment. Inside, officials said, there was $20,000 in cash. Almost half of it was traced via serial numbers to funds the developers had given Owens, according to the indictment.",
      "The indictment alleges that Owens had told developers earlier that he kept \u201cdope money and drug money and more than a million dollars\u201d in the office safe to avoid the risk of keeping it in his home.",
      "Owens said in a statement that he was fully cooperating with their efforts.",
      "At least three City Council members have confirmed to NBC News that Owens invited them to meetings with developers in January and late February.",
      "On the day Owens and the developers first met with Banks, they had lunch with another council member, Hartley, Hartley said.",
      "Hartley said in an interview that he declined their offer to pay for his meal at Walker\u2019s Drive-In, a restaurant often frequented by Jackson\u2019s business class and well-known for seafood and other Southern fare. As with Lindsay, the details of what they hoped to do in Jackson seemed scarce to him.",
      "Hartley said Owens had said the developers had an interest in learning about his ward. The meeting itself, though, was lackluster, he said.",
      "Ashby Foote, the council\u2019s sole Republican, told NBC News he joined the group for lunch at the Capital Club on Feb. 29.",
      "The restaurant\u2019s location, the 19th floor of the downtown Capital Towers building, was a prime one. Its windows overlooked the property developers had their eye on.",
      "Foote said that there was no formal presentation during the meal and that the businessmen talked \u201cin generalities.\u201d",
      "But one thing stood out.",
      "\u201cThey said, \u2018How does Jackson work?\u2019 I think, or something to that effect, or \u2018How do things get done in Jackson?\u2019 or something to that effect,\u201d Foote said. \u201cI didn\u2019t really answer the question.\u201d",
      "He initially looked at the meeting as \u201ca nothing burger.\u201d",
      "Normally, you might at least get a business card, Foote said. He was frustrated. He did not catch their names, but he did write down the name of their group, the Facilities Solutions Team.",
      "\u201cIt never occurred in my wildest dreams they were undercover for the FBI,\u201d Foote said.",
      "Now, the City Council is grappling with the aftermath of the latest developments, alongside routine matters of governance.",
      "\u201cAfter the parade is gone,\u201d Hartley said, \u201cwe still have to clean up the mess.\u201d",
      "The first council meeting since the indictments is scheduled for Tuesday."

There are also problems with the sewage drains. The fumes come back up and make us sick.\"",
      "Pi\u00f1\u00f3n and Hern\u00e1ndez are among the Ohio residents who filed a lawsuit in 2022 against the companies that own the two mobile home parks and the company that does the water metering.

      "Hern\u00e1ndez and Fairgrounds United resident Ricardo Rodr\u00edguez, 40, said that since their mobile home parks changed owners, services that were once included as part of the rent, such as water, are now billed separately at much higher prices.",

      "Melissa Solomon, Jones Estates\u2019 director of corporate governance and transactions, said by email that the company will not make \u201cany comments on the pending litigation.\u201d 5 Star Metering, the water service provider, which that is also being sued, did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In August, Lake County Common Pleas Judge Patrick J. Condon ruled that Jones Estates did send a one-year lease to the tenants, so that claim will not be pursued at trial.",
      "Regarding the charges for water and sewage services, the court considers that \u201cthere are factual issues regarding the actual charges\u201d and that \u201cthey are excessive,\u201d he wrote, so that allegation will go to trial.",
      "The complaints about the lack of attention to requests from Latino residents and accusations of discrimination will also go to the trial, the judge said.",
      "Hearings related to the lawsuit are expected to begin in the first weeks of December.",
      "Mobile home parks \u2014 but not mobile",
      "Of the 7.22 million residents of mobile homes (also known\u00a0as manufactured homes) in the U.S., 1.32 million, or 18%, identify as Hispanic, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s 2023 American Housing Survey.",
      "Residents can buy their homes, but they often must rent the land on which the homes are located, often in lots known as mobile home parks \u2014 a term that experts say does not reflect the nature of the homes, since most cannot be easily moved for relocation.",
      "\u201cThey are not mobile because the house is attached to a concrete slab, and in many cases they are old. If you try to move it, there is always the chance that the house will break and be damaged, and it costs between $8,000 and $12,000. It is very expensive,\u201d said Yvonne Maldonado, a co-director of\u00a0Manufactured Housing Action, a nonprofit group that focuses on such communities. \u201cAlso, the most important thing is that there is nowhere to move it, because many states do not allow you to move a house or a plot of land or to another park.\"",
      "Since 2016, Maldonado has lived in a mobile home park in New York state. She said she has also experienced the constant rent increases firsthand, going from paying $695 when she arrived to $1,100 today.",
      "\u201cBut in 2019, a law was passed in New York state that puts a limit on the annual rent increase for manufactured homes \u2014 but that does not happen in all states,\u201d she said.",
      "Complaints in Colorado",
      "In Foxridge Farm, a mobile home park in Arapahoe County, Colorado, Ana Eugenia B\u00e1ez, 55, and other residents say the park has enforced arbitrary parking policies, creating parking spaces far from their homes for which they have to pay an extra fee, towing cars parked on the streets without notice and charging extra fees when residents receive visitors with cars, among other things.",
      "Although park rules allow two to four spaces per dwelling depending on the type of home, residents say that is not enough, saying the mobile home park is far from any public transportation and residents need cars to get to work. They also say the new parking lots are unsafe.",
      "\u201cEven though we live in prefabricated houses, we have the right to live with dignity,\" B\u00e1ez said.",
      "Andrea Chiriboga-Flor, executive director of\u00a0Justice for the People Center, a nonprofit legal organization that advises Foxridge Farm residents, said: \u201cThese residents are struggling because the landlord over the last two years is not only raising the rent but is also putting in place unfair rules that we believe are not legal. From one day to the next, they decided that no one can park on the street, and now you have to pay for your parking. That has caused a crisis in the park, and there are families who have had to move against their will.\u201d",
      "Complaints by B\u00e1ez and her neighbors prompted an inspection by the Colorado Mobile Home Oversight Program this year. It found that Ascentia, the company that owns the park,\u00a0had violated several\u00a0state laws. Ascentia appealed the decision, and the neighbors and the company are in the middle of a legal process in administrative court.",
      "Asked for comment, Ascentia, which has 39 such communities in seven states, according to information on\u00a0its website, said in a statement that the parking rules are not new and that they date back decades but had not been implemented and are \u201cnorms for the improvement of the community.\u201d",
      "The company said that over two years, it invested $350,000 to build the parking lots and that they are \u201clit and have security cameras.\u201d Most of the violations detected by the Colorado Mobile Home Monitoring Program \u201chave been\u00a0resolved,\" Ascentia President Marko Vukovich said in a statement.",
      "\"The two pending issues for hearing concern the state\u2019s demand that we not be allowed to charge residents for the use of new parking lots, and its demand that the decades-old ban on street parking be declared unreasonable. We consider these demands to constitute an unconstitutional abuse of state power,\u201d Vukovich said.",
      "A home \u2014 but not classified as real estate",
      "More than a fifth of manufactured-home owners earned less than $20,000 a year in 2021, and more than half earned less than $50,000 a year, according to the Private Equity Stakeholder Project (PESP), a nonprofit organization that monitors the\u00a0manufactured home market.",
      "Because they are cheaper homes, they are attractive to lower-income workers, including migrants who have recently arrived in the country or who are undocumented. \"However, these houses are not classified as real estate but as personal property, and that means they have fewer protections,\u201d said Esther Sullivan, an associate sociology professor at the University of Colorado in Denver and author of the book\u00a0\u201cManufactured Insecurity: Mobile Home Parks and Americans\u2019 Tenuous Right to Place.\u201d",
      "The situation means that, in many states, residents of the parks are\u00a0excluded from basic legal protections\u00a0that cover tenants of rented houses or apartments, such as mandatory notice periods for rent increases and evictions, among other things.",
      "Of the 1.32 million Hispanic-led households living in manufactured homes, 869,000 report owning their units, according to census data.  Of those, half are in manufactured home communities where they pay rent for their lots; the other half do not.",
      "While decoupling housing from the underlying land lowers the upfront expense of homeownership, it comes with significant challenges for the tenant-owners, a report by the nonprofit group Prosperity Now found in 2021.",
      "Over the past decade, as income inequality has increased, corporate investors have turned to mobile home parks as a growth market.",
      "\u201cWe have recently seen private equity enter the manufactured housing market,\" PESP housing research coordinator Madeline Bankson said. \"And what we typically see is that they often raise rents significantly \u2014\u00a0we also see a lot of issues that residents report due to maintenance problems.\u201d",
      "In their acquisitions of manufactured housing parks, many private equity firms have enlisted the help of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored lending enterprises that guarantee most mortgages.",
      "PESP notes that Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac funded nearly half (49%) of the privately owned parks it monitored, which has caught the attention of national lawmakers.",
      "In\u00a0June 2023, Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H.; Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.; and John Fetterman, D-Pa., sponsored a bill to establish minimum standards for tenants in such parks that receive federal funding through Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or the Federal Housing Administration.",
      "\u201cAs the housing crisis continues to impact American families, predatory landlords are raising rents and taking advantage of mobile home tenants who lack adequate legal protections,\u201d Shaheen told Noticias Telemundo in a statement.",
      "Cheaper, but with risks",
      "With an average price of $127,250 in 2022, manufactured homes \u201care a vital source of affordable housing for rural and low-income families,\u201d according to PESP researchers.",
      "Though mobile homes are cheaper, they come with financial and safety risks.",
      "Banks may not be as open to financing that type of housing. Depending on the location and the house, the quality may be poorer, said Juan Pablo Garnham, head of communications and policies at Princeton University\u2019s Eviction Lab.",
      "In addition, most states do not have laws like New York's that cap rent increases in mobile home parks, \u201cso even if you own your [mobile] home, the cost of renting the land can go up a lot,\" Chiriboga-Flor said.",
      "During weather emergencies, the homes have structural limitations. During hurricanes, the\u00a0National Weather Service\u00a0has said, 72% of deaths occur in homes, and of those, 54% occur in mobile homes.",
      "Garnham said residents should try to avoid homes that are more than 30 or 40 years old because they deteriorate more easily. There can also be issues with moisture and mold, and in some cases the homes are not well-connected to water or electricity or gas.",
      "Chiriboga-Flor recommended that people review any mobile home contract before they sign it. She also urged mobile home park residents to organize their communities and if there are complaints, to do it as a group, which is more effective.",
      "An earlier version of this report was first published in Noticias Telemundo."

    "story": [
      "Where is Roshanak Molaei? The hashtag is circulating in Iran after the 25-year-old woman disappeared in Tehran after being taken into custody by police, raising concerns about her treatment as the country continues to crack down on women who defy mandatory hijab laws.",
      "The events that led to Roshanak Molaei's arrest did not start as a protest.",
      "A surveillance video shows the woman walking along a Tehran sidewalk on Nov. 1, before a man dressed in a military uniform approaches her from behind on a motorcycle.",
      "It is not clear from the angle of the footage whether the man verbally or physically accosted her, but according to the nearly 2-minute video that Molaei later posted to her X account, she reacted by grabbing the motorcyclist in a heated exchange that drew several bystanders. The man then drove off.",
      "Molaei captioned the video: \u201cA scene from being a woman in Iran.\u201d",
      "Her account was swiftly taken down.",
      "Hengaw, a Norway-based human rights organization that monitors violations in Kurdistan and Iran, also reposted a version of the video on X.",
      "According to a statement by the organization, Molaei had previously argued on social media with a government official over mandatory hijab laws. The incident captured by the surveillance camera shows Molaei without a hijab.",
      "Iranian police confirmed in a statement that there was a \u201cconfrontation between a young woman and a motorcyclist\u201d on Nov. 1, adding that \u201cinitial investigations indicate that the motorcyclist harassed the young woman.\u201d",
      "\u201cBoth parties have been referred to judicial authorities,\" the police statement said. \"The motorcyclist will face investigation for both harassment and traffic violations. The woman is being prosecuted for not observing mandatory hijab laws.\u201d",
      "According to Hengaw, on Nov. 2 Molaei was \"summoned by FATA,\" the Iranian cyberpolice, about her post, and was arrested the following day.",
      "\"It remains unclear in which prison she is currently being held,\" a representative from Hengaw told NBC News.",
      "\"Since her detention, there has been limited information regarding her health and conditions of imprisonment. The lack of transparent information about the situation of political prisoners in Iran remains a widespread concern,\" the Hengaw representative said.",
      "This is not the first time Molaei is arrested for opposing Iran\u2019s mandatory hijab laws, according to Hengaw. In 2022, she was arrested during the \u201cWoman, Life, Freedom\u201d protests, a series of peaceful demonstrations triggered by the death of Mahsa Amini in police custody.",
      "Amini had been arrested in part for not wearing a hijab correctly, with the U.N. asserting that she was killed \u201cas a result of beatings\u201d by Iranian authorities. Iran has denied the charges, saying she died of pre-existing medical conditions.",
      "Following her arrest in September 2022, Molaei was sentenced to over six years in prison but released in February 2023 after being granted amnesty, according to Hengaw.",
      "Molaei's new arrest is yet another incident fueling alarm from international human rights organizations. In a 2024 report on the situation of human rights in Iran the U.N. \"raised pressing concerns\" about the \"deteriorating human rights situation for women and girls\" across the country.",
      "\"Roshanak\u2019s case exemplifies the systematic oppression faced by women when they seek to claim their basic rights and personal freedoms,\" Hengaw said in a statement.",
      "\"Women in Iran who publicly oppose mandatory hijab and other discriminatory laws face immense risks, including imprisonment, intimidation, and mistreatment.\"",
      "A day before Molaei's arrest, a young woman was detained after stripping to her underwear in an apparent protest at the Olum Tahghighat branch of the Islamic Azad University in Tehran, state media reported. The woman was transferred to a psychiatric hospital, raising concerns for her safety. There is no specific information on the woman\u2019s condition, but Amnesty International has found evidence that people detained in psychiatric wards have been subject to torture, beatings and other mistreatment.",
      "The security agents who enforce hijab laws, informally called morality police, have recently started easing public confrontations with women over the headscarves, following the election of reformist president Masoud Pezeshkian who campaigned on opposing these police patrols.",
      "However, locals say the agents continue to be present in the streets, but have been instructed to issue warnings rather than take immediate enforcement actions. Bystanders are discouraged or prevented from filming, restricting the how many of these interactions appear on social media.",
      "In addition, the government has set up new centers called \u201canti-unveiling clinics,\u201d where women who choose not to wear the hijab may be referred to for a program described as \u201ctherapy,\u201d to encourage compliance of hijab laws."

      "LONDON \u2014 Animal campaigners are calling for a ban on the public sale of fireworks after a baby red panda was thought to have died from stress related to the noise.",
      "The Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS), a conservation charity that runs Edinburgh Zoo, said Wednesday that it was likely Roxie, a three-month-old red panda kit, \"died due to stress caused by fireworks being let off across the city centre.\"",
      "Fireworks are set off across the United Kingdom on and around Nov. 5, known as Bonfire Night\u00a0or Guy Fawkes Night, in celebration of the failure of a plot to blow up the Houses of Parliament by a group of dissident Catholics in 1605.",
      "The tradition is centuries old and unique to the U.K., with some towns creating huge elaborate effigies of Guy Fawkes to be burned \u2014 sometimes instead building models of contemporary figures, including former prime ministers Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak.",
      "But animal rights campaigners and pet owners have long complained that the noise causes extreme distress to animals.",
      "RZSS says the red panda's mother also died just five days earlier and that death could also be related to fireworks noise.",
      "\u201cRoxie had recently lost her mum Ginger but was responding well to specialist care from our expert team and was feeding independently,\" Ben Supple, RZSS deputy chief executive said in a statement.",
      "\"Very sadly, she choked on her vomit on bonfire night and our vets believe this was probably a reaction to fireworks,\" Supple said.",
      "\"Roxie had access to her den but the frightening noises seem to have been too much for her. We know that fireworks can cause stress to other animals in the zoo and we cannot rule out that they may have contributed to the untimely death of Roxie\u2019s mother Ginger, just five days\u2019 earlier,\" he continued.",
      "A petition with more than 1.1 million signatures calling for tighter rules on the sale of fireworks \u2014 including limiting the noise levels and allowing sales only on specific dates \u2014 was delivered last week to No. 10 Downing Street, the home and private office of Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "Edinburgh City Council this year became the first Scottish local authority to ban fireworks in some areas, with four districts under a ban on privately-bought fireworks between Nov. 1 and Nov. 11.",
      "Others have however gone further and called for the total ban of the sale of fireworks nationally, except for large-scale licensed public events.",
      "\"We support calls from animal welfare charities to ban the sale of fireworks to the public, with only light displays being permitted at organized events,\" Supple said.",
      "\"This would help avoid devastating consequences for animals like Roxie while ensuring that people can still enjoy traditional celebrations.\""

      "\u201c\u2018The Wizard of Oz\u2019 was always sort of prophetic in a way,\u201d Chu said. \u201cIt was written at a time of America in transition. At that point, the Depression had just finished and they\u2019re about to go into war. And so it\u2019s always a question of about what the American dream looks like when the road ends and what are the possibilities of the next thing.\u201d",
      "\u201cWicked,\u201d starring Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, is an adaptation of the hit Broadway musical, which is loosely based on the 1995 novel of the same name. The film and the novel expand on the 1900 novel \u201cThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz\u201d and its 1939 film adaptation, \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201d",
      "NBC News and NBCUniversal, the distributor of \u201cWicked,\u201d share Comcast as a parent company.\u00a0\u201cWicked\u201d gives a sympathetic revision to the Wicked Witch of the West, named Elphaba, who seeks to take on the Wizard and his propaganda against her and the animals of Oz.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 20:08:13 GMT",
    "summary": "Two former Missouri officers were charged in separate, unconnected cases in federal court this week over allegations that they illegally searched women's phones during traffic stops to obtain intimate, explicit images found on the devices.",
    "story": [
      "Two former Missouri officers were charged in separate, unconnected cases in federal court this week over allegations that they illegally searched women's phones during traffic stops to obtain intimate, explicit images found on the devices.",
      "Julian Alcala, 29, who was employed as an officer with the city of Florissant, is charged with 20 counts of deprivation of rights and a count of destroying records in a federal investigation, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri announced Thursday.",
      "The deprivation of rights specifically refers to being free from unreasonable search and seizure, established in the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.",
      "According to the federal indictment, Alcala would take women's phones during traffic stops in order to confirm their insurance coverage or vehicle registration. But Alcala searched their phones for nude images and took photos on his own personal phone, the indictment said.",
      "In one case, Alcala allegedly texted himself a video and deleted evidence of the text.",
      "Alcala is accused of doing this to 20 women between Feb. 6 and May 18 of this year.",
      "The Florissant Police Department said in a statement to NBC News on Wednesday that it was completely unaware of the alleged behavior. Alcala had passed a \"meticulous and thorough background investigation\" during the hiring process and the department had not received a complaint about him in the 11 months of his employment.",
      "\"We are disgusted at this behavior, which is a complete betrayal of the values we uphold and in no way reflects the professionalism and integrity of our dedicated officers,\" the department said. \"We recognize the gravity of this breach of trust and its impact on our community.\"",
      "Alcala resigned in June after the Florissant Police Department was contacted by the FBI regarding an investigation into him, according to the department statement.",
      "Civil lawsuits have also been filed against Alcala and the city, including one which echoes an allegation made by federal prosecutors. A lawsuit filed in the same district court last month alleges that Alcala sent himself a private video made by a couple having sex.",
      "The Jane Doe was pulled over in February, where Alcala allegedly took her phone back to his vehicle when she presented the insurance information that she stored on the device. The lawsuit said that she noticed \"there was a deleted text message\" from the time of the stop.",
      "Alcala sent himself the video, deleted the message \"in an effort to hide his tracks,\" the suit said. He's also accused of obtaining a nude photo from her phone in the same stop.",
      "Attorney Bevis\u00a0Schock is representing six people in civil litigation against Alcala in the city. He told NBC News affiliate KSDK that his clients are \"real nice, normal people who do what police officers say.\"",
      "\"The way this started was, the FBI called the victims,\" Schock said. \"And each victim said, 'Well I got pulled over and he took my phone back.'\"",
      "Court records show a warrant was issued for Alcala on Wednesday but it's unclear if he is in custody. He has not yet made an appearance in court and does not have an attorney listed.",
      "NBC News was unable to find contact information for Alcala using public records in an effort to reach him for comment on the case. An attorney representing the city of Florissant in a civil lawsuit in the case did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "A similar, but unconnected, case was filed by the U.S. Attorney's office on Tuesday against a former Missouri State Highway Patrol trooper.",
      "David McKnight, 39, was indicted in the same federal court on nine counts of deprivation of rights and one count of destroying records. Federal prosecutors allege that he illegally searched the phones of nine women between September 2023 and August 2024 while working for the highway patrol.",
      "According to the U.S. Attorney's Office, McKnight used his own phone to take pictures of nude images on the women's phones after they gave him the devices to show their insurance or identification information. Most of the women were pulled over for traffic stops, the office said.",
      "The Missouri State Highway Patrol did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Missouri Department of Public Safety told NBC News that records show McKnight surrendered his state peace officer license, \"which means he can never work as a Missouri law enforcement officer again.\"",
      "The federal prosecutor's office told NBC News that McKnight and Alcala's cases are not connected. It's unclear if either of the men are in custody.",
      "A public defender assigned to McKnight's case did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.",
      "Ashley Johnson, special-agent-in-charge of the FBI St. Louis Division, told people not to hesitate to report uncomfortable encounters with officers. Both cases were investigated by the FBI, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office press release.",
      "\"If you feel your civil rights have been violated, contact the FBI,\" Johnson said. \"Investigating criminal conduct by a law enforcement officer is among our top priorities.\u201d"

      "Anker 523 PowerCore Slim 10K",
      "I gifted this portable power bank to one of my best friends years ago and she still sends me selfies using it across the world. It\u2019s one of our go-to travel accessories because it can charge your phone, tablet, headphones and earbuds while you are on the move or off the grid. It has USB-A and USB-C ports, and comes with both types of cable in the box, meaning they can charge almost all their devices.",
      "Apple AirTag",
      "If you know they own an iPhone, chances are they will find a good use for an Apple Airtag. It\u2019s a Bluetooth tracker that shows its precise location using Apple\u2019s FindMy app. I\u2019ve gifted these to friends and family, and everyone finds them easy to set up and use. It does not come with a strap, so something like this Belkin AirTag holder can help them attach it to luggage or a backpack.",
      "Tile Pro Tracker (2024)",
      "If you know they don\u2019t use an iPhone, but tend to lose track of things, this Bluetooth tracker from Tile works similar to an AirTag. It uses the Tile app (available on iPhone and Android) to show you the location of the tracker. Similar to an AirTag, it also has a replaceable coin-shaped CR2023 battery inside \u2014 consider adding extra batteries into your gift box for added longevity.",
      "Tomtoc 360 Protective Laptop Sleeve",
      "I\u2019ve used this protective laptop case for years, and it makes for a great gift for students. It has a zipper closure with extra layers of padding around the corners to protect my laptop from any accidental drops or bumps. The top zipper pocket isn\u2019t very deep, but can store extra cables or earbuds easily. It comes in different colors and is available in 13-inch, 14-inch, 15-inch and 16-inch sizes.",
      "Anker Soundcore 2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker",
      "This Bluetooth speaker is small, lightweight, water-resistant and very affordable, compared to other brands. NBC Select updates editor Mili Godio uses it at parties and picnics, because it has a loud and clear sound.",
      "It connects over Bluetooth and can be controlled wirelessly, but also has buttons on the top as a backup option. If they are a big beach lover, consider one of our other favorite Bluetooth speakers, as this one does not have any dust-resistance rating.",
      "Apple AirPods Pro 2",
      "If you want to give them one of the best wireless earbuds money can buy (and you know they use an iPhone), the AirPods Pro 2 are it. They have the best sound, noise-canceling and call quality of all of Apple\u2019s earbuds, in my experience. Our team has used them for everything from work calls, exercise, travel and even drifting off to sleep.",
      "Tech gifts for homebodies",
      "Apple iPad (10th Gen)",
      "An iPad is a wonderful gift for anyone who loves to watch their favorite TV shows around the house or just enjoys a bigger screen for video chatting. One of the biggest upgrades in this 10th generation version is the two built-in speakers, one on each side, for a clearer, stereo-style listening experience. It also comes in much brighter colors, giving it a fun pop inside of your gift box.",
      "Amazon Echo Pop",
      "If they tend to ask their voice assistant questions all the time, chances are they will get a lot of use out of an Amazon Echo smart speaker. NBC Select reporter Zoe Malin uses the Echo Pop in her bedroom to control her smart lights and get reports on the news and weather in the morning as she gets ready for the day.",
      "Ember Mug 2",
      "Room-temperature coffee can ruin a morning. The Ember Mug solves this tragedy \u2014 it can control the temperature of drinks remotely through the Ember app. The temperature ranges between 120 and 145 degrees fahrenheit, which is good for keeping drinks warm, but not pipping hot. The mug has about 1.5 hours of battery, and charges wirelessly on the included coaster.",
      "Canon Ivy 2 Mini Photo Printer",
      "You might not consider a printer high tech, but this one fits into a purse and connects wirelessly to your phone \u2014 no cables or big ink cartridges needed. It prints small 2x3 inch photos with peel and stick backs that make it easy to decorate school supplies or an office cubicle. Printing photos can be a great alternative to scrolling through the thousands on your phone, in my experience.",
      "Tech gifts for travelers",
      "Apple AirPods 4 Wireless Earbuds",
      "If they hate the feeling of rubber eartips clogging up their eardrums, chances are they will enjoy open earbuds like the latest AirPods 4. The earbuds rest in the ear without any rubber eartips, leaving the ear mostly open to the environment. AirPods 4 have better battery life, clearer audio and microphone quality and improved water and dust protection, so they make for a great gift even if your giftee owns the older, long-stemmed AirPods 2.",
      "Bose QuietComfort Wireless Headphones",
      "These are our favorite over-ear headphones, especially for travel. Plane, train and automobile noise fades instantly once I put on these noise-canceling headphones, plus they don\u2019t feel hot or uncomfortable, even after a five hour flight. They work well on all kinds of devices, come with a wired connection for seatback entertainment, and have a hard travel case in the box.",
      "Hicober 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Station",
      "Do they hate cable clutter? Same. That\u2019s why I use this flat wireless charging station in my bedroom, so I don\u2019t have a rats nest of cables near my bedside. This model can charge an iPhone, Apple Watch and compatible wireless earbuds at once, though the charging pad itself does need to be plugged into the wall.",
      "Topo Designs Accessory Bags",
      "You know where else cable clutter sucks? Travel bags. A simple zippered pouch like this one is great for separating chargers and charging cables from everything else. Any frequent flier with an eye for organization will find a use for one of these accessory bags that come in over 10 colors.",
      "Kindle Paperwhite",
      "A Kindle e-reader is a great way for them to enjoy all their favorite books and audiobooks without accidently getting lost in phone notifications. They can easily read this Kindle Paperwhite outside in bright sunlight and, unlike a laptop, there\u2019s no glare, says NBC Select commerce editor Lindsay Schneider. This latest model also has up to 12 weeks of battery life, according to the brand.",
      "Tech gifts for gamers",
      "Meta Quest 3s VR Headset",
      "Gaming in a VR headset is completely different from anything else \u2014 take it from someone who has tried it. The Meta Quest 3s is VR gaming made easy: all they need is what\u2019s in the box: no additional cables or wall-mounted cameras. For a first game, I recommend Supernatural \u2014 a fun exercise game that mixes music and fitness in an exciting and engaging way.",
      "Nintendo Switch Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Bundle",
      "The Nintendo Switch is one of our favorite handheld gaming consoles and is a great gift for anyone who doesn\u2019t already have one. This holiday bundle comes with the console and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, one of the best Nintendo Switch games. The best parts of the console are its amazing games and its portability \u2014 they can play it on the TV and switch to handheld mode instantly by taking the console out of the dock.",
      "Tech gifts for the outdoors",
      "JBL Clip 5 Portable Bluetooth Speaker",
      "If you asked anyone on the NBC Select team for a speaker recommendation, there\u2019s a good chance they will recommend the JBL Clip 5. If your giftee likes to take their music everywhere (and I mean everywhere), this is the speaker to gift. It has a built-in carabiner that lets them attach it to almost anything: we\u2019ve tried backpack straps, belt loops, bike handlebars, shower curtain rods, kitchen cabinet handles, the list goes on. It\u2019s small, lightweight, loud and weatherproof.",
      "Fitbit Charge 6",
      "The FitBit Charge 6 is a fitness tracker best for beginners looking to start a new fitness journey or just track basics like steps, heart rate and sleep, in my experience. One of its best traits is its long seven day battery life \u2014 they won\u2019t have to worry about charging it nearly as often as their phone. It connects to the FitBit app on their phone to show all kinds of health, sleep and workout data.",
      "Tech gifts for athletes",
      "Theragun Relief",
      "I\u2019ve gifted a massage gun in a group setting \u2014 everyone wanted a turn to try it out. This model from Theragun is great for loosening stiff and sore muscles. It\u2019s also easy to use: it has one button that turns it on, off and changes between three speeds. It comes with three ball-head attachments (wide, standard and narrow).",
      "Shokz OpenRun Headphones",
      "If they want to listen to their favorite playlist or audiobook and still hear traffic and pedestrians while they run, bike or skate, get them a pair of open ear headphones. The Shokz OpenRun are one of our favorite workout headphones because they do not block your ear at all \u2014 instead they rest on the side of your head and use vibrations to transmit sounds. NBC Select editorial director Lauren Swanson and I have used these headphones to stay safe while running and biking in heavily-trafficked areas.",
      "Why trust NBC Select?",
      "I\u2019m a reporter who covers technology and fitness including guides to fitness trackers, wireless earbuds, TV brands and more. For this article, I curated gifts using my first-hand experience with products, NBC Select staff recommendation, previous coverage and top-rated items from major storefronts like Amazon and Best Buy.",

      "The role of Alex Cross is not new to on-screen adaptations. The first came in 1997\u2019s \u201cKiss the Girls,\u201d with Morgan Freeman playing the hardened Washington D.C. detective. The movie was a loose adaptation of the series\u2019 second book of the same name. A second installment also starring Freeman called \u201cAlong Came a Spider,\u201d released in 2001.",

      "With multiple films and a longstanding book series in the rearview, Hodge had the difficult task of making the legendary character his own in an eight episode series. In an interview with TODAY.com, Hodge explained how he approached the task with showrunner Ben Watkins.",
      "\u201cThe perspective of how we shaped this character came in conversations with Ben Watkins where we didn\u2019t even talk about the character. We just talked about what was going on in our personal lives, our lives as men.\u201d",

      "\u201cI recently stepped into fatherhood,\u201d Hodge said. \u201cI was in a whirlwind of emotions because it\u2019s such a beautiful experience.

To show how much heart this character had and what he was willing to do to make sure his partner, his brother, lived up to his higher power.\u201d",
      "The backdrop of Washington D.C. also serves as an important component of this new retelling of the Alex Cross story. Hodge explains that in the show, \u201cD.C. stands as its own character.\u201d",
      "The star says that the show attempts to go beyond the political significance of nation\u2019s capital by tapping into the culture of the people that make up the city\u2019s heart.",
      "\u201cSomething that was really important to Ben was that we really bring out the flavor of D.C.\u2019s culture. You\u2019ve only really seen D.C. from the political side, the White House, the monuments,\u201d Hodge explains. \u201cWe owe it to the culture to highlight them in a celebratory way.\u2019"

      "Her decision came down to Chock Chapple, a 60-year-old insurance executive from Wichita, Kansas, and Guy Gansert, a 66-year-old ER doctor from Reno, Nevada. Ultimately, she chose Chock \u2014 the man who said, over and over, he was \"crazy about her.\"",

      "\"It was really, really hard at the end to say goodbye to you because in any other situation, I would have been with you because we would have had more time,\" she said. \"It was absolutely nothing you did. I have missed you. It's been really hard to be away from you.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 13:46:33 GMT",
    "summary": "\"Full House\" actor Dave Coulier who played Joey Gladstone reveals he has Stage 3 non-Hodgkin lymphoma. He's undergoing chemotherapy to treat his cancer.",
    "story": [
      "Dave Coulier announced exclusively on the TODAY show that he's been diagnosed with Stage 3 non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a type of blood cancer that starts in the lymphatic system.",
      "The \"Fuller House\" star, who famously played Uncle Joey, noticed his first symptoms a little over a month ago, when he came down with a cold. In the past, he'd noticed the lymph nodes in his neck or armpits would swell when he was sick. This time, though, he felt surprised to discover a golf-ball sized lump in his groin within a week of falling ill.",
      "\u201cIt swelled up immediately,\" Coulier, 65, tells TODAY.com in a phone interview. \u201cI thought, \u2018Wow, I\u2019m either really sick, or my body\u2019s really reacting to something.\u2019\u201d",
      "Worried, he visited his doctors who ran a variety of tests, including bloodwork, EKG, and PET and CT scans. While everything appeared to be normal, the doctors biopsied the lymph node just to be safe. Coulier soon learned why his lymph node became so enlarged.",
      "\u201c(My doctors) said, \u2018Hey, we wish we had better news, but you have non-Hodgkin lymphoma, B-cell lymphoma,\u2019\u201d Coulier recalls. \u201cIt was a shock.\u201d",
      "Despite his cancer diagnosis, Coulier is still finding joy in life.",
      "\u201cMy joke is that in four short weeks I\u2019ve gone from a Virgo to a Cancer,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to retain a sense of reality but also a sense of humor about it.\u201d",
      "Dave Coulier diagnosed with Stage 3 non-Hodgkin lymphoma",
      "When Coulier felt under the weather a little over a month ago and noticed a swollen lymph node in his groin, he felt puzzled.",
      "\"The onset of this growing lymphoma in my groin area was very quick. So I said, 'Something's not right,'\" he recalled to Hoda during his Nov. 13 appearance on TODAY.",
      "Coulier visited his doctor, who ordered a battery of tests.",
      "\u201cThey said, \u2018Yeah, we need to take a serious look at this.\u2019 And so, we did blood tests,\u201d he says. \u201cBlood tests came back great. My EKG, everything great. Heart, everything perfect.\u201d",
      "But his doctors felt worried by how quickly the lump grew and ordered more advanced imaging before eventually wanting a sample of it for testing.",
      "\u201c\u2018We\u2019d like to either remove this or biopsy it,\u2019\u201d Coulier recalls his doctors telling him. \u201cI said, \u2018Well, why don\u2019t we just remove it and biopsy it at the same time?\u2019\u201d",
      "Three days later, Coulier received the news from his doctor that he had B-cell lymphoma, a type of cancer that develops in B-lymphocytes, according to the American Cancer Society. B-cell lymphomas account for the vast majority of non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Every year, more than 80,000 Americans are diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.",
      "\u201cThe first thing I said to them was, \u2018Wait a minute \u2014 cancer?\u2019\u201d he Coulier. \u201c(I was) feeling like I got punched in the stomach because it never happens to you. You always hear about it happening to someone else.\u201d",
      "Hearing the news was even harder because his wife, Melissa Coulier, wasn\u2019t at home.",
      "\u201cI was just contemplating, \u2018How do I tell her?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I told her, of course, she thought I was joking.\u201d",
      "After he reassured her that he was not joking, Melissa \u201corganized (his) entire life, from nutrition to the doctor\u2019s appointments to the pills.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s got stuff color-coded,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty great.\u201d",
      "To understand what stage of cancer he had, Coulier\u2019s doctors took a bone marrow sample.",
      "\u201cThey wanted to see if (the cancer had) moved on to any major organs or my blood or bones or anything,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was pins and needles for a few days because I didn\u2019t know what stage it was or if it had progressed.\u201d",
      "Yet at some point, Coulier started feeling a sort of acceptance.",
      "\u201cI told Melissa I don\u2019t know why, but I (am) OK with whatever the news (is) going to be no matter how devastating. \u2026 I can\u2019t explain where that came from,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve had an incredible life. I\u2019ve had the most amazing people in my life. This has been an extraordinary journey, and I\u2019m OK if this is the end of the journey.\u201d",
      "A few days later, he learned he had Stage 3 non-Hodgkin lymphoma.",
      "Stage 3 non-Hodgkin lymphoma survival rate",
      "Stage 3 non-Hodgkin lymphoma means the cancer has not spread outside the lymphatic system, according to the American Cancer Society. The five-year survival rate for B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has not spread widely is about 74%, per ACS.",
      "\u201c(Stage 3) doesn\u2019t sound great,\" Coulier says, but because it hasn't spread to his bone marrow, doctors told him his curability rate is upwards of 90%.",
      "\"It's very treatable,\" he said on TODAY.",
      "Starting chemotherapy",
      "Doctors wanted Coulier to start chemotherapy promptly, and he underwent another surgery to have his chemotherapy port, which delivers the medication, placed.",
      "Leading up to his first treatment, Coulier faced his fear of the unknowns of cancer.",
      "\u201cYou hear chemo, and it scares the daylights out of you,\u201d he says. \u201cThe first round was pretty intense because you don\u2019t know what to expect. You don\u2019t know how you\u2019re going to feel. Is this going to hit me immediately? Is it going to be devastating? Am I going to walk out of here?\u201d",
      "As \u201ca preemptive strike,\u201d Coulier shaved his head, which he jokes makes him \u201clook like a baby bird.\u201d The last time he was bald was when he shaved his head during the \u201cFull House\u201d series wrap, getting rid of the mullet he sported for many years.",
      "Coulier felt better than expected after his first round of chemotherapy. In total, he\u2019ll have six rounds every 21 days and should be finished with treatment by February 2025. Following treatment, he expects a \u201ctotal remission.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a bit of a roller coaster. There (are) days where I feel unbelievable,\u201d he says. \u201cThen there\u2019s other days where \u2026 I\u2019m just going to lay down and let this be what it\u2019s going to be.\u201d",
      "Still he's been able to maintain a positive outlook as he navigates treatment.",
      "\u201cThis is a journey,\u201d Coulier told Hoda. \u201cThis is a bit of a battle and you\u2019re going to need to be on your game.\u201d",
      "When Coulier feels good, he takes advantage of it. He\u2019s been recording episodes of the podcast \u201cFull House Rewind\u201d with his new co-host Marla Sokoloff, who played Gia Mahan on \u201cFull House\u201d and \u201cFuller House.\u201d And he recently skated with the Detroit Red Wings alumni \u2014 though he can\u2019t play hockey as it could damage his chemotherapy port. At the end of this week, John Stamos will visit him following his second round of chemotherapy.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have so many laughs. We\u2019re going to have so much fun,\u201d Coulier says. \u201cI said, \u2018It could be \u2018Weekend at Bernie\u2019s\u2019 if I\u2019m just out of it.\u2019 And (Stamos) said, \u2018That\u2019s OK. I\u2019ll carry you around.\u2019\u201d",
      "Coulier feels grateful for his \u201cincredible wife\u201d and \u201cincredible friends\u201d supporting him through his cancer diagnosis and treatment.",
      "\u201cThey all rallied around this, and a couple of comments that I\u2019ve heard are, \u2018Dave, you\u2019re not letting us worry about this very much,\u2019\u201d Coulier says. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to. I want us to have happy times and we\u2019ll get through this.\u201d",
      "Since his diagnosis, Coulier has learned that \u201che\u2019s strong enough to know (his) weaknesses,\u201d and he understands when to ask for help.",
      "Raising awareness",
      "Sadly, Coulier has plenty of experience with cancer.",
      "\u201cI lost my sister Sharon at 36 years old, breast cancer. I lost my niece Shannon at 29 years old, breast cancer,\u201d he says. \u201cI lost my mom, and now my sister Karen has cancer. So, over the years I\u2019ve seen what the women in my family have gone through, and it\u2019s been not only an awakening but a learning process.\u201d",
      "While it\u2019s been tough watching cancer affect his family so dramatically, the actor has grown from it.",
      "\u201cWhen I was diagnosed, all of those memories came back of what they went through and so many hospital visits and sitting bedside and talking and having conversations and watching them leave the planet,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat they went through is 10 times harder than what I\u2019m going through. So, if I can be one-tenth as strong as they were, I\u2019m going to be fine.\u201d",
      "His family also taught him to embrace joy, and that has helped him maintain a positive outlook.",
      "\u201cMy mom, my sister and my niece were laughing until the day they died,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was a real inspiration for me to just remember that there\u2019s a lot of happiness.\u201d",
      "Coulier\u2019s looking forward to the future. His son, Luc, and his wife, Alex, are expecting a baby boy in March, and Coulier\u2019s excited to become a grandfather and anticipates lots of flights from Michigan to Los Angeles to spend time with his family.",
      "Coulier felt compelled to share his story to raise awareness of cancer and encourage others to undergo screening for it.",
      "\u201cThe one thing that just kept presenting itself to me was to tell other people about it. Talk to them about getting something as simple as pre-screening or a breast exam, mammogram, a colonoscopy or a prostate exam,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a really simple thing to do and it can add years to your life.\u201d"

      "His four-song set on TODAY had something for every fan, including the upbeat tune \"Chuck Taylors,\" soulful ballad \"Messed Up As Me,\" and one of his greatest hits \u2014 \u201cSomewhere In My Car.\u201d",
      "Offstage, Urban is equally as known for his charm as he is for his performing prowess. Savannah Guthrie called him one of the \u201cbest, nicest, coolest guests that we have\u201d during the singer's spot on the show.",
      "Urban maintained his good humor throughout a series of early morning interview questions for TODAY\u2019s original video series \u201c8 before 8.\"",
      "Here's what Urban had to say about his latest album, his personal guitar heroes and his favorite Australian animal.",
      "What inspired you to title your new album \"High\"?",
      "I called the latest album \u201cHigh\u201d because it was a good, strong, simple, euphoric word that has a lot of interpretations, which I also liked. Everybody gets to that place differently, but it\u2019s definitely the destination, and the record has a feeling of euphoria.",
      "Do you see yourself releasing any of the scrapped songs from \u201c615\u201d in the future?",
      "So, I made an album called \u201c615,\u201d and there were four songs that I took off that record which made it onto \u201cHigh.\u201d The rest of them, right now, they\u2019re out in the front yard, up on blocks with grass growing around them. So we\u2019ll see what happens.",
      "Who would you put on your Mount Rushmore of guitarists?",
      "Well, first of all, I\u2019m going to need more than four faces, probably. (Jimi) Hendrix, No. 1 for sure. No. 2 is always hotly contested: Stevie Ray Vaughan, Eric Clapton, Mark Knopfler, Angus Young. I could go on and on. It\u2019s too many, way too many.",
      "Where is the most unusual place you've performed?",
      "The most unusual place I\u2019ve performed? On the baggage carousel at an airport on the little carpeted strip in between where the bags go around. Yeah, totally humiliating.",
      "What\u2019s your most fun song to perform onstage?",
      "All of them, because I feel really grateful that I don\u2019t have to do a song that I don\u2019t like. I feel really, really lucky that that\u2019s happened to me: to have such a long career and have certain songs like \u201cBlue Ain\u2019t Your Color,\u201d or \u201cSomebody Like You,\u201d or some of these songs, that I couldn\u2019t not do them. But I love them just as much as I did when I recorded them.",
      "When did your iconic hairstyle become part of your look?",
      "I've never decided to make hair a part of my look. God bless my mom. I got my mom\u2019s hair, and my dad really didn\u2019t have much, and I\u2019m grateful that I got her gene. Go, mom.",
      "From LL Cool J: How have you maintained your long career?",
      "That's a great question. First of all, right back at you, dude \u2014\u00a0been around a long time, high level. Same answer you\u2019d probably have: passion, hunger, curiosity.",
      "I love playing music just as much as I did when I was sitting in my bedroom at 6 years old learning to play guitar. I don\u2019t feel any different. I\u2019m just as excited to write the next song, put on the next tour, make another album \u2014 like, literally giddy with excitement to do that. That\u2019s never changed. And that could have worked or not worked, as far as staying relevant or being able to have songs that connect. I\u2019ve just been really blessed and lucky, and the harder I\u2019ve worked, the luckier I\u2019ve become.",
      "Rapid fire round:",
      "There\u2019s too many! I do love In-N-Out. I do love Chick-fil-A. ... I'm going to say In-N-Out is my favorite. Yeah, period.",
      "Oh, Sydney summer. Nashville winters are brutal. January is like Monday. February is like Tuesday. March is like a Wednesday. And slowly, as you can see, you\u2019re getting towards the weekend in Nashville, and the summer is like Friday, Saturday, Sunday \u2014 perfect.",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 15:33:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Gillian Anderson did an interview with her former \"X-Files\" co-star David Duchovny on his \"Fail Better\" podcast about the \"tension\" in their relationship.",
    "story": [
      "David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson acknowledged there was \"a lot of tension\" between them on \"The X-Files\" that resulted in the co-stars not speaking for weeks off camera while working on the hit show.",
      "Anderson, 56, spoke to Duchovny, 64, on the Nov. 12 episode of his \"Fail Better\" podcast, with the two revisiting their time together on the hit Fox show that ran from 1993-2002, spawned two movies, and revivals in 2016 and 2018. Duchovny played FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder, and Anderson played his partner, Special Agent Dana Scully, in the science fiction series about unsolved cases involving the paranormal.",
      "Anderson said she came on Duchovny's podcast to have \"a conversation that I don't feel like we ever had,\" which led to him reflecting on shooting the show together during the height of its popularity in the '90s.",
      "\"The part of this conversation that is the trickiest part for me is, I guess I would talk about like my failure of friendship, or my failure of companionship,\" Duchovny said.",
      "\"There was a long time working on the show where we were just not even dealing with one another off camera,\" he added. \"And there was a lot of tension, which didn\u2019t matter, apparently, for the work, because we\u2019re both f------ crazy, I guess, that we could just go out there and do what we needed to do.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s crazy that we were able to present on camera the various feelings and emotions and attraction and all that kind of stuff, but then not speak to each other for weeks at a time or whatever,\" Anderson said.",
      "\"I don\u2019t know, but I could have handled myself better,\" Duchovny said.",
      "Duchovny also opened up about leaving the show in the early 2000s and his emotions after Anderson left \"The X-Files\" following its revival in 2018.",
      "\"I never apologized to you for that,\" he told Anderson about his original departure from the show. \"I don\u2019t know that I even talked to you about it, and then you said you weren\u2019t going to do the show anymore, like, the last time we did it (in 2018). And I know that hurt my feelings.\"",
      "\"Oh, I didn't know,\" Anderson said.",
      "\"I get it, you know, like, OK, and I support it, whatever it is you want to do, but I was like, 'Oh, she\u2019s quitting me,' you know?\" Duchovny said. \"She doesn\u2019t like working with me anymore. It was like, that little kid inside is going, 'Hey!' And then I was like, but I didn\u2019t say anything to her back in the day.\"",
      "Later in their conversation, Anderson returned to the moment Duchovny left in 2001.",
      "\"We never talked about it,\" she said. \"I don\u2019t think I ever blamed you. ... I don\u2019t think I blamed you at all. I don\u2019t think I was upset.\"",
      "\"Well, thanks a lot,\" Duchovny said.",
      "After Duchovny departed, Anderson considered following him out the door.",
      "\"There was a point, I mean, for me at that time, it was, 'Can I too?'\" she said. \"At first I thought, 'Well, then we\u2019re both going to because clearly I can\u2019t go on without him, so surely I\u2019ll be able to.' And then they started talking about, 'Well, if you stay on, you can actually make some good money.'\"",
      "Duchovny also recalled a \"dysfunctional\" moment between the two in the midst of their stardom on the show.",
      "\"It was some Emmys, and it was the day after, and I had a private plane, and I was giving you a ride,\" he said. \"And you were late, and I was so angry. And then we sat on this private plane, flying to Vancouver from LA, not talking.",
      "\"And you wrote me a letter,\" he continued. \"So you\u2019re just like 6 feet away from me, writing a letter to me, and it\u2019s a beautiful letter. I don\u2019t remember it exactly, but it was appreciative, and it was like it was all the things that I wanted to hear. But it\u2019s just amazing that we couldn\u2019t just have that conversation. The fact that it\u2019s a private plane, it\u2019s just all ridiculous.\"",
      "\"I had no memory that we were even on a private plane together, let alone, yeah, I wrote you a letter on one,\" Anderson said. \"Interesting.\"",
      "Duchovny also remembered a moment with \"The X-Files\" creator Chris Carter amid some tension in the first season.",
      "\"I think we were kind of butting heads so early on in the first season that Chris asked us if we would go into fake couples (therapy). Like, would we go into TV character couple therapy? I remember sitting in his office with you, and Chris is like, 'Yeah, do you guys want to go into therapy.' And I was like, 'You mean as Mulder and Scully?' I\u2019m confused. I remember that.\"",
      "Another source of strife came in 2016 when Anderson fought for pay equity with Duchovny for the revival of the show. She told The Daily Beast at the time that she was only offered half the salary of Duchovny for the 2016 return and had spent three years during the original run of \"The X-Files\" trying to achieve pay equity with her co-star.",
      "\"That whole pay equity thing, that\u2019s in our past as well,\" Duchovny said. \"I was part of that.",
      "\"Selfishly, back then, I thought I was like being attacked,\" he continued. \"I thought, 'Oh, I\u2019m being attacked for being offered more money.'\"",
      "\"Attacked by who?\" Anderson asked.",
      "\"The world,\" Duchovny said.",
      "\"What, that they blamed you in some way?\" Anderson said.",
      "\"In a way,\" Duchovny said.",
      "\"Oh really, I didn\u2019t know that,\" Anderson said. \"I'm sorry. That's interesting that I wasn't paying attention to that side of it.\"",
      "\"Well, I didn't make you pay attention to it,\" Duchovny said.",
      "During their talk, the two also delved into Anderson's childhood and latest ventures, including her new book, \"Want,\" a collection of anonymous sexual fantasies submitted by women from around the world."

      "The ramped-up security presence comes after the violence surrounding the soccer match between Israel\u2019s Maccabi Tel Aviv and Ajax of Amsterdam put authorities across Europe on high alert.",

      "Smotrich canceled his trip to France to speak at the gala, citing security concerns, but at least two demonstrations went ahead, drawing hundreds of protesters.",
      "At one point during one of the demonstrations held by pro-Palestinian groups, tear gas appeared to have been deployed against the crowd, as police in shields and riot gear pushed up against protesters. Meanwhile, organizers at another protest held by leftist Jewish groups condemning the gala told NBC News their rally was shut down by police.",
      "Demonstrators at both events told NBC News they did not want to allow the normalization of Israel's actions in Gaza, where local officials say more than 43,000 people have been killed over the past year.",
      "The U.N. said over the weekend that women and children accounted for around 70% of those who have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its offensive in the enclave following Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attacks, in which Israeli officials say some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage.",
      "\u201cWe won\u2019t stop protesting,\u201d one demonstrator, Omar, 30, who declined to provide his last name, said, speaking during a demonstration on Wednesday night that saw protesters march from Paris\u2019 Saint-Lazare station to Place de la R\u00e9publique.",

The woman was transferred to a psychiatric hospital, raising concerns for her safety. There is no specific information on the woman\u2019s condition, but Amnesty International has found evidence that people detained in psychiatric wards have been subject to torture, beatings and other mistreatment.",

      "However, locals say the agents continue to be present in the streets, but have been instructed to issue warnings rather than take immediate enforcement actions. Bystanders are discouraged or prevented from filming, restricting the how many of these interactions appear on social media.",
      "In addition, the government has set up new centers called \u201canti-unveiling clinics,\u201d where women who choose not to wear the hijab may be referred to for a program described as \u201ctherapy,\u201d to encourage compliance of hijab laws."

    "summary": "A 300-carat necklace, whose diamonds have been linked to a scandal involving the last French queen Marie Antoinette, sold Wednesday for nearly $5 million at a Sotheby's auction in Geneva.",
    "story": [
      "It's a sparkling piece of scandal.",
      "A 300-carat 18th century necklace, whose diamonds may have helped fuel the overthrow of the French monarchy, sold Wednesday for nearly $5 million at an auction in Geneva.",
      "The necklace has been worn at two British coronations and may contain diamonds from the infamous necklace at the heart of a scandal that tainted the reputation of Marie Antoinette, the last queen of France.",
      "It sold for more than twice its estimate, at $4.81 million.",
      "Experts believe that some of the diamonds may be linked to the infamous \u201cAffair of the Diamond Necklace.\u201d That theory is supported by the style of the necklace as well as the quality and age of the stones, the auction house Sotheby\u2019s said in a press release.",
      "The exact origins of the necklace have not been recorded, with Sotheby\u2019s stressing it does not know for certain.",
      "Despite this, it said it believed that the necklace\u00a0\"could only have been created for royalty or a high-ranking aristocrat.\" It pointed to its nearly 500 diamonds arranged in three rows that trail on either side into a tassel.",
      "\u201cIt stands head and shoulders above all other documented Royal and Imperial jewels of the period,\u201d Andres White Correal, head of royal and noble jewels at Sotheby\u2019s said in a statement before the auction.",
      "\u201cThis rare and important diamond jewel is a sublime survivor from the opulent court life of the Georgian era, defined by its unrivalled pomp and splendor; it is arguably one of the most magnificent and intact Georgian jewels in private hands,\u201d he added.",
      "\u201cIt was an electric night,\u201d White Correal told the Reuters news agency after the sale.",
      "\u201cThere is obviously a niche in the market for historical jewels with fabulous provenances. People are not only buying the object, they are buying all the history that is attached to it,\u201d he said.",
      "That history centers on Louis XV, the king of France, who commissioned a lavish diamond necklace for his mistress, Madam Du Barry, in 1722 \u2014 two years before he died of smallpox.",
      "That meant he could not pay for and receive the necklace, leaving the jewelers out of pocket.",
      "Marie Antoinette, the country's new queen consort, declined to buy the necklace despite her reputation for extravagance. Noblewoman Jeanne de La Motte then, so the story goes, posed as the queen and convinced an out-of-favor cardinal to give her the lavish necklace as a gift before absconding with the lucrative diamonds.",
      "A subsequent trial found the queen innocent, but the same could not be said of the court of public opinion. The French Revolution followed years later.",
      "It is unclear exactly how the necklace ended up in the hands of a British aristocratic family, the Pagets.",
      "The Marchioness of Anglesey, a member of the Paget family, wore the necklace at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in June 1953.",
      "According to Sotheby\u2019s, the family parted with the piece after it was acquired by an \u201cimportant Asian private collection in the 1970s.\u201d",
      "The necklace has been in private hands ever since.",
      "In 2022, bracelets that once belonged to\u00a0Marie Antoinette sold for more than $8 million at\u00a0auction,\u00a0also in Geneva."

      "Defacing sites or breaking the rules at important international sites has led to charges and serious fines for tourists on many occasions.",

      "LONDON \u2014 Animal campaigners are calling for a ban on the public sale of fireworks after a baby red panda was thought to have died from stress related to the noise.",
      "The Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS), a conservation charity that runs Edinburgh Zoo, said Wednesday that it was likely Roxie, a three-month-old red panda kit, \"died due to stress caused by fireworks being let off across the city centre.\"",
      "Fireworks are set off across the United Kingdom on and around Nov. 5, known as Bonfire Night\u00a0or Guy Fawkes Night, in celebration of the failure of a plot to blow up the Houses of Parliament by a group of dissident Catholics in 1605.",
      "The tradition is centuries old and unique to the U.K., with some towns creating huge elaborate effigies of Guy Fawkes to be burned \u2014 sometimes instead building models of contemporary figures, including former prime ministers Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak.",
      "But animal rights campaigners and pet owners have long complained that the noise causes extreme distress to animals.",

      "\"Very sadly, she choked on her vomit on bonfire night and our vets believe this was probably a reaction to fireworks,\" Supple said.",

We know that fireworks can cause stress to other animals in the zoo and we cannot rule out that they may have contributed to the untimely death of Roxie\u2019s mother Ginger, just five days\u2019 earlier,\" he continued.",
      "A petition with more than 1.1 million signatures calling for tighter rules on the sale of fireworks \u2014 including limiting the noise levels and allowing sales only on specific dates \u2014 was delivered last week to No. 10 Downing Street, the home and private office of Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",

      "Others have however gone further and called for the total ban of the sale of fireworks nationally, except for large-scale licensed public events.",
      "\"We support calls from animal welfare charities to ban the sale of fireworks to the public, with only light displays being permitted at organized events,\" Supple said.",
