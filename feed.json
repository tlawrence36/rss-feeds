      "\u201cThe Pitt\u201d has won best drama series at the Emmys, with Noah Wyle taking best actor in a drama",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Seth Rogen and \u201cThe Studio\u201d turned the Emmys into a wrap party, winning best comedy series Sunday and breaking a comedy record for victories in a season with 13, while Noah Wyle and \u201cThe Pitt\u201d took the top drama prize.",
      "The evening also brought meaningful wins for Jean Smart, Stephen Colbert and 15-year-old Owen Cooper, whose Netflix series \u201cAdolescence\u201d dominated the limited series categories.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m legitimately embarrassed by how happy this makes me,\u201d \u201cThe Studio\u201d co-creator Rogen said with his signature giggle, surrounded by cast and crew from the Apple TV+ movie-business romp after it won best comedy at the Peacock Theater in a show hosted by Nate Bargatze that aired on CBS. Rogen personally won four, including best actor.",
      "\u201cThe Pitt\u201d from HBO Max completed a sentimental journey with its win for best drama series. The character-driven medical drama won over viewers and gained emotional momentum during a season whose biggest drama prizes once seemed destined to be swept by \u201cSeverance.\u201d",
      "Wyle won best actor in a drama for playing a grizzled, warm-but-worn-down supervising doctor, getting his first Emmy after five nominations with no victories in the 1990s for playing a scrubbed young cub doctor on \u201cER.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat a dream this has been,\u201d Wyle said. \u201cOh my goodness.\u201d",
      "Katherine LaNasa, whose nurse is perhaps the show's most beloved character, was a surprise winner of best supporting actress in a drama over three women of \u201cThe White Lotus\u201d on a night when every acting Emmy but one went to a first-time victor.",
      "The first-timers included Britt Lower, who won best actress in a drama, and Tramell Tillman, who won best supporting actor, in the night's two biggest moments for \u201cSeverance.\u201d",
      "Along with its creative arts wins, the Orwellian workplace satire ended up with eight for its acclaimed second season. Star Adam Scott lost out to Wyle for best actor.",
      "The show's losses kept the evening from being a total triumph for Apple TV+, which has still never won a best drama prize, though it has now won best comedy three times between \u201cThe Studio\u201d and \u201cTed Lasso.\u201d",
      "Lower\u2019s win was a surprise in a category where Kathy Bates was considered a heavy favorite, for \u201cMatlock.\u201d",
      "Cristin Milioti won best actress in a limited series for \u201cThe Penguin.\u201d",
      "Jean Smart bucked the rookie trend, winning her fourth Emmy for best actress in a comedy for \u201cHacks\u201d and her seventh Emmy overall. At 73, she extended her record for oldest winner in the category.",
      "Netflix\u2019s widely acclaimed \u201cAdolescence,\u201d the story of a 13-year-old in Britain accused of a killing, won six times, including the Emmy for best limited series. Co-creator Stephen Graham won for lead acting and writing while Cooper won best supporting actor and became the youngest Emmy winner in over 40 years.",
      "Cooper said in his acceptance that he was \u201cnothing three years ago.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just so surreal,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cHonestly, when I started these drama classes a couple years back, I didn\u2019t expect to be even in the United States, never mind here.\u201d",
      "Best supporting actress went to Erin Doherty, who played a therapist opposite Cooper in a riveting episode that like all four \u201cAdolescence\u201d episodes was filmed in a single shot.",

      "\u201cThe Studio\u201d came into the evening having won nine Emmys already during last weekend's Creative Arts ceremony. On Sunday night, it added four more, which all went to Rogen. Along with the comedy series award, he won best directing with his co-creator and longtime collaborator Evan Goldberg, and best writing with Goldberg and others.",
      "The show brought blockbuster buzz for its first season from the start and the Emmys ate it up, whether because of Hollywood's love for stories about itself (with A-list guest stars) or the television industry's love for stories that mock the self-importance of movie people.",
      "Backstage, Rogen clumsily tried to hold up all four Emmys at once. Asked whether the night will be fodder for season two, he said no.",
      "\u201cThis is, like, far too good a thing to have happen on our show,\u201d he said. \u201cOur show is generally based on stress and disappointment and right now, we\u2019re all very happy.\u201d",
      "Smart's castmate and constant scene partner Hannah Einbinder, who had also been nominated for all four seasons of \u201cHacks\u201d but unlike Smart had never won, took best supporting actress in a comedy.",
      "She said she had become committed to a long-term bit where \u201cit was cooler to lose.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut this is cool too!\u201d she shouted, then ended her speech by cursing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and saying \u201cFree Palestine!\u201d Political sentiments from the stage were otherwise rare.",
      "In perhaps the night's biggest upset, Jeff Hiller won best supporting actor in a comedy for \u201cSomebody Somewhere,\u201d over Ike Barinholtz of \u201cThe Studio\u201d and others.",
      "Colbert may have been the night's most popular winner, taking best talk series for \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert\u201d for the first time. He got huge ovations both when he took the stage to present the first award and when he won.",
      "The win may have been the result of a protest vote and a desire to pay tribute to its host, weeks after its cancellation by CBS. Jimmy Kimmel, who was among his competitors, campaigned for Colbert to win.",
      "\u201cSometimes you only truly know how much you love something when you get a sense that you might be losing it,\u201d Colbert said in his acceptance.",
      "Many perceived the end of the show as punishment of Colbert and placation of President Donald Trump after Colbert was harshly critical of a legal settlement between the president and Paramount, which needed administration approval for a sale to Skydance Media. Executives called the decision strictly financial.",
      "Colbert showed no bitterness to CBS, thanking the network, which telecast the Emmys and aired a commercial celebrating his win, for letting him be part of the late-night tradition.",
      "Bargatze delivered his opening monologue only after the first award was handed out.",
      "The show opened with a sketch where \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d stars Mikey Day, Bowen Yang and James Austin Johnson joined Bargatze, who played television inventor Philo T. Farnsworth opining on what the future of TV will be like.",
      "Bargatze-as-Farnsworth mentions that there will one day be a Black Entertainment Television. When asked if there will be a network for white people, he replied, \u201cWhy, CBS of course.\u201d",

      "The film extended its meteoric run, scoring the biggest anime opening of all time with a $132.1 million weekend, according to Comscore. Crunchyroll and Sony rolled it out across North America and 49 international markets, pushing the global total to $177.8 million.",
      "\u201cThis performance by this particular film shows the unpredictability of the box office,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cIf we were sitting here, let\u2019s say a month or even a couple of weeks ago, would we be thinking, \u2018Wow, a Japanese anime film would be number one at the box office, overperform and bring in $70 million?\u2019 If you predicted that, kudos to you.\u201d",

    "summary": "The Library of Congress has named Arthur Sze the new U.S. poet laureate",
    "story": [
      "The Library of Congress has named Arthur Sze the new U.S. poet laureate",
      "At a time when its leadership is in question and its mission challenged, the Library of Congress has named a new U.S. poet laureate, the much-honored author and translator Arthur Sze.",
      "The library announced Monday that the 74-year-old Sze had been appointed to a one-year term, starting this fall. The author of 12 poetry collections and recipient last year of a lifetime achievement award from the library, he succeeds Ada Lim\u00f3n, who had served for three years. Previous laureates also include Joy Harjo, Louise Gl\u00fcck and Billy Collins.",
      "Speaking during a recent Zoom interview with The Associated Press, Sze acknowledged some misgivings when Rob Casper, who heads the library\u2019s poetry and literature center, called him in June about becoming the next laureate. He wondered about the level of responsibilities and worried about the upheaval since President Donald Trump fired Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden in May. After thinking about it overnight, he called Casper back and happily accepted.",
      "\u201cI think it was the opportunity to give something back to poetry, to something that I\u2019ve spent my life doing,\u201d he explained, speaking from his home in Santa Fe, New Mexico. \u201cSo many people have helped me along the way. Poetry has just helped me grow so much, in every way.\u201d",
      "Sze\u2019s new job begins during a tumultuous year for the library, a 200-year-old, nonpartisan institution that holds a massive archive of books published in the United States. Trump abruptly fired Hayden after conservative activists accused her of imposing a \u201cwoke\u201d agenda, criticism that Trump has expressed often as he seeks sweeping changes at the Kennedy Center, the Smithsonian museums and other cultural institutions.",
      "Hayden\u2019s ouster was sharply criticized by congressional Democrats, leaders in the library and scholarly community and such former laureates as Lim\u00f3n and Harjo. It also led to a debate over who has the authority to decide on an interim replacement.",
      "Although the White House announced that it had named Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche as the acting librarian, daily operations are being run by a longtime official at the library, Robert Randolph Newlen. Events such as the annual National Book Festival have continued without interruption or revision.",
      "Laureates are forbidden to take political positions, although the tradition was breached in 2003 when Collins publicly stated his objections to President George W. Bush\u2019s push for war against Iraq.",
      "Newlen is identified in Monday\u2019s announcement as acting librarian, a position he was in line for according to the institution's guidelines. He praised Sze, whose influences range from ancient Chinese poets to Wallace Stevens, for his \u201cdistinctly American\u201d portraits of the Southwest landscapes and for his \u201cgreat formal innovation.\u201d",

      "\u201cLike Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman, Sze forges something new from a range of traditions and influences \u2014 and the result is a poetry that moves freely throughout time and space,\u201d his statement reads in part.",
      "Sze\u2019s official title is poet laureate consultant in poetry, a 1985 renaming of a position established in 1937 as consultant in poetry to the Library of Congress. The mission is loosely defined as a kind of literary ambassador, to \u201craise the national consciousness to a greater appreciation of the reading and writing of poetry.\u201d Initiatives have included Robert Pinsky\u2019s \u201cFavorite Poem Project,\u201d for which the public would share thoughts on works of their choosing, and Lim\u00f3n\u2019s \u201cYou Are Here,\u201d which included poetry installations at national parks.",
      "Sze wants to focus on a passion going back more than a half-century to his undergraduate years at the University of California, Berkeley \u2014 translation. He remembers reading some English-language editions of Chinese poetry, finding the work \u201cantiquated and dated\u201d and deciding to translate some of it himself, writing out the Chinese characters and engaging with them \u201con a much deeper level\u201d than he had expected. Besides his own poetry, he has published \u201cThe Silk Dragon: Translations from the Chinese.\u201d",
      "\u201cI personally learned my own craft of writing poetry through translating poetry,\u201d he says. \u201cI often think that people think of poetry as intimidating, or difficult, which isn\u2019t necessarily true. And I think one way to deepen the appreciation of poetry is to approach it through translation.\u201d",
      "Sze is a New York City native and son of Chinese immigrants who in such collections as \u201cSight Lines\u201d and \u201cCompass Rose\u201d explores themes of cultural and environmental diversity and what he calls \u201ccoexisting.\u201d In a given poem, he might shift from rocks above a pond to people begging in a subway, from a firing squad in China to Thomas Jefferson\u2019s plantation in Virginia. His many prizes include the National Book Award for \u201cSight Lines\u201d and such lifetime achievement honors as the Jackson Poetry Prize and the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize.",
      "He loves poetry from around the world but feels at home writing in English, if only for the \u201crichness of the vocabulary\u201d and the wonders of its origins.",
      "\u201cI was just looking at the word \u2018ketchup,\u2019 which started from southern China, went to Malaysia, was taken to England, where it became a tomato-based sauce, and then, of course, to America,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I was just thinking days ago, that\u2019s a word we use every day without recognizing its ancestry, how it\u2019s crossed borders, how it\u2019s entered into the English language and enriched it.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Songwriter Bobby Hart, a key part of the Monkees' multimedia empire who teamed with Tommy Boyce on such hits as \u201cLast Train to Clarksville\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m Not Your Steppin\u2019 Stone,\u201d has died. He was 86.",
      "Hart died at his home in Los Angeles, according to his friend and co-author, Glenn Ballantyne. He had been in poor health since breaking his hip last year.",
      "Boyce and Hart were a prolific and successful duo in the mid-1960s, especially for the Monkees, the made-for-television group promoted by Don Kirshner. They wrote the Monkees' theme song, with its opening shot, \"Here we come, walkin' down the street,\" and enduring chant, \"Hey, hey, we're the Monkees,\" and their first No. 1 hit, \u201cLast Train to Clarksville.\u201d The Monkees' eponymous, million-selling debut album included six songs from Boyce and Hart, who also served as producers and used their own backing musicians, the Candy Store Prophets, as session players.",
      "\"I always credit them not only with writing many of our biggest hits, but, as producers, being instrumental in creating the unique Monkee sound we all know and love,\" the Monkees' Micky Dolenz wrote in a foreword to Hart's memoir, \"Psychedelic Bubblegum,\" published in 2015.",
      "As Boyce and Hart grew in fame and the Monkees took more control of their work, they pursued their own careers, releasing the albums \"Test Patterns\" and \"I Wonder What She's Doing Tonite\" and appearing on such sitcoms as \"I Dream of Jeannie\" and \"Bewitched.\" They also were politically active. They campaigned for Robert F. Kennedy when he ran for president in 1968 and wrote the brassy \"L.U.V. (Let Us Vote)\" in support of the 26th Amendment, which in 1971 lowered the voting age from 21 to 18. Their other songs included the Monkees' melancholy \"I Wanna Be Free\" and the theme to the daytime soap opera \"Days of Our Lives.\"",
      "They were covered by everyone from Dean Martin (\"Little Lovely One\") to the Sex Pistols (\"I'm Not Your Steppin' Stone\").",
      "In the 1970s and '80s, Hart managed several hits with other collaborators and even contributed material to another TV act, the Partridge Family. He worked with Austin Roberts on \"Over You,\" an Oscar-nominated ballad performed by Betty Buckley in \"Tender Mercies,\" and with Dick Eastman on \"My Secret (Didja Gitit Yet?)\" for New Edition. He and Bryce toured with Dolenz and fellow Monkee Davy Jones in the '70s, put out the album \"Dolenz, Jones, Boyce & Hart\" and received renewed attention when the Monkees enjoyed a comeback in the 1980s.",

      "He was a minister's son, born Robert Luke Harshman in Phoenix, Arizona. In his memoir, he remembered himself as a shy kid with a \"strong desire to distinguish\" himself, as he wrote in \"Psychedelic Bubblegum.\" Music was the answer. By high school, he had learned piano, guitar and the Hammond B-3 organ. He also started his own amateur radio station, eventually adding a console, turntables and microphones. After graduating from high school and serving in the Army reserves, he settled in Los Angeles in the late 1950s, hoping first to become a disc jockey, but soon working as a songwriter and session musician. His name shortened to Bobby Hart, he toured as a member of Teddy Randazzo and the Dazzlers, and with Randazzo and Bobby Weinstein wrote \"Hurt So Bad,\" a hit for Little Anthony and the Imperials later covered by Linda Ronstadt.",
      "He also befriended Boyce, a singer and songwriter from Charlottesville, Virginia, with a \"very unusual personality, spontaneous and extroverted, yet very cool at the same time.\" Boyce and Hart helped write the top 10 hit \"Come a Little Bit Closer\" for Jay and the Americans and were a strong enough combination that Kirshner recruited them for his Screen Gems songwriting factory: They were assigned to the Monkees. Asked to come up with songs for a quartet openly modeled on the Beatles, they devised a twangy guitar line similar to the one for the \"Paperback Writer\" and wrote \"Last Train to Clarksville,\" a chart topper in 1966 based in part on Hart's mishearing of the Beatles hit (he thought Paul McCartney was singing \u201ctake the last train\u201d near the end; McCartney was singing \u201cpaperback writer\u201d).",
      "When Kirshner suggested a song with a girl's name in the title, they turned out \"Valleri\" and reached the top 5. For the show's theme song, a stroll outside was enough.",
      "\"Boyce began strumming his guitar and I joined in by snapping my fingers & making noises with my mouth that simulated an open & closed hi-hat cymbal,\" Hart wrote in his memoir. \"We had created the perfect recipe for inspiration and started singing about just what we were doing: 'Walkin' down the street.'\"",

      "Ed Sheeran has long sought to bring people together with his music, whether it be his emotionally resonant acoustic ballads or unproblematic, danceable pop hits",
      "NEW YORK -- Ed Sheeran has long sought to bring people together with his music, whether it be his emotionally resonant acoustic ballads or unproblematic, danceable pop hits. \u201cPlay,\u201d his eighth studio album out Friday, stays in that familiar lane for the most part.",
      "In his quest, Sheeran has maintained an everyman quality by carefully evolving with the status quo (while, largely, removing himself from public discourse, save his copyright court win and more recent promotional pop-ups in everyman places, like a New York City ice cream shop just this week). The aesthetic of Ed Sheeran, global star, still matches that of Ed Sheeran, up-and-coming troubadour. Most of the time, it's still just Sheeran, his guitar and his loop pedal against the world.",
      "Of course, Sheeran, like most pop stars, knows that as his stardom has risen and his audience widened, the meaning of that relatability has shifted. His listeners, over a decade in, know that too. So \u201cPlay,\u201d the first project in a new series from Sheeran named for symbols (he's said \u201cRewind\u201d will be next), uses Sheeran's global acclaim to his advantage \u2014 without straying too far from his singer-songwriter roots.",
      "Recorded throughout his \u201cMathematics World Tour\u201d and finished in Goa, India, the project feels split. There are moments that herald the return of Sheeran the hitmaker, an exciting development after his last two albums \u2014 the final chapter of his mathematics series, \u201cSubtract,\u201d and the folk-pop \u201cAutumn Variations\u201d \u2014 were well received but failed to produce the kind of chart-toppers that created Sheeran, the megastar. Most tracks, however, fall more in line with those albums, deviating little from the narrative songwriting toolkit that raised Sheeran, the artist.",
      "Sheeran turned to new collaborators for a couple songs that are already established hits. The addictive \u201cSapphire\u201d features Indian singer Arijit Singh, who ranks among Spotify's most popular artists globally. A Farsi version of the single \u201cAzizam,\u201d written and produced with Ilya Salmanzadeh, Savan Kotecha and Johnny McDaid, was released in April featuring Iranian singer Googoosh. Sheeran isn't just eyeing the U.S. and U.K. charts here \u2014 he's playing for cross-cultural domination, and having fun while doing it.",
      "The rest of the tracks, those that feel more classically Sheeran, see old themes recycled: \u201cOld Phone\u201d provides him the space to remember old friends and reminisce about his changing personal life, just as the landscape in 2017's \u201cCastle on the Hill\u201d provided a tangible marker of memory. The conceit of the sappily sweet \u201cCamera\u201d \u2014 \u201cI don't need a camera to capture this moment\u201d \u2014 comes in conflict with that of Sheeran's own beloved \u201cPhotograph\u201d from 2014's \u201cMultiply.\u201d",
      "There are still moments that feel like they'll stick: Sheeran's ode to his daughters, \u201cFor Always,\u201d with cooing backing vocals from co-writer Amy Allen, is sure to be a favorite father-daughter dance track, right behind the groovy \u201cThe Vow\u201d on wedding playlists.",
      "Sheeran flexes his pen on \u201cOpening,\u201d the album's first track. Bounded by glittery verses about boundaries, he raps about his family, his mental health, that court case, fame and what comes next. \u201cBeen a long time up top but I ain\u2019t complacent/If I look down I can see replacements,\u201d he raps at one point. \u201cGotta make dreams and chase them.\u201d",
      "Sheeran wants to be for everyone. And to do that, he'll still be an everyman.",

      "A new Whitney Houston song has arrived 13 years after her death",
      "NEW YORK -- It sounds impossible, but that's the magic of it. On Thursday, a new Whitney Houston song arrives 13 years after her death.",
      "English singer Calum Scott is responsible. The single is a duet between Scott and Houston, a balladic reinterpretation of the timeless \u201cI Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me),\u201d using Houston's original vocal stems. (Stems are the individual musical elements that, when combined, make up a song.)",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t even something I could have dreamt as a possibility, and the fact that I'm getting to do it is, geez, one of the honors of my career,\u201d Scott told The Associated Press. Houston's voice is one that soundtracked his childhood \u2014 courtesy his mom \u2014 and he refers to Houston as one of the most influential performers in his life and the lives of many.",
      "\u201cTimeless,\u201d he describes her.",
      "Here's how the new song came into existence.",
      "Such an undertaking couldn't be possible without the approval of a number of parties. Specifically, it required Pat Houston, Whitney\u2019s sister-in-law and the executor of her estate, and Primary Wave, which acquired the copyrights to hit Whitney Houston songs as part of a 2022 deal.",
      "Pat Houston says the idea for Scott's \u201cI Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\u201d actually came from Primary Wave. They were familiar with Scott's live cover version of the song from his stint opening for Ed Sheeran in 2024. On that tour, Scott stripped the 1987 classic down into a ballad, blending it with Robyn's \u201cDancing On My Own.\u201d",
      "After hearing what Scott could do with the song \u2014 taking it from its up-tempo pop spirit to a big-hearted ballad, while also taking into consideration that 2025 marks the 40th anniversary of Houston's music career \u2014 Pat Houston was on board. It was yet another opportunity for celebration. \u201cI said, you know what, this is a no-brainer. This is the Houston style. So, let\u2019s go with this,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cWhitney was a balladeer and that\u2019s why we all fell in love with her,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd Calum turned the song into a beautiful ballad.\u201d",
      "First, the Houston estate and Primary Wave provided Scott with the original vocal stems, produced by her longtime producer Narada Michael Walden. Then Scott recorded the song with producers Jon \u201cMAGS\u201d Maguire, Andrew Yeates and Charlie T in the U.K. in \u201cabout a week,\u201d he recalls. They were joined by a string section, which gave additional dimension to their somber take on the song.",
      "\u201cTake a pop song and make it sad,\u201d Scott jokes of his approach.",
      "Recording the ballad made sense because, as Scott points out, the lyrics to the original song are a bit melancholic. \u201cYou want to dance with somebody who loved you, you know, you're not actually dancing with them,\u201d he says. It's about yearning. But in an early demo, the chorus was recorded in a minor chord \u2014 which sounded a bit too depressing. The change was made swiftly; even slowed, the song needed some of that Houston ebullience.",

      "Another early decision: The new song would start with just Houston's voice, alone, in the first verse. \u201cWhitney starts the song because this is her song,\u201d Scott says simply. \u201cI would never dare stand in front of Whitney for that first verse.\u201d",
      "Eagle-eyed (eared?) fans might notice the sound of a snare drum bleeding into her vocal on that verse \u2014 because it was originally recorded to tape, not digitally, and because \u201cwe can\u2019t change anything like that because those are etched into the song and into her vocal,\u201d says Scott. \u201cAnd to remove it would be taking a piece away.\u201d",
      "It's one of the reasons they kept the song's iconic key change in the last chorus as well.",
      "\u201cI really had to dig for those high notes,\u201d he says of the recording. \u201cIt was an honor just to harmonize with her.\u201d",
      "Scott looked to the original songwriters for approval \u2014 the dream team of George Merrill and Shannon Rubicam. They were immediately on board.",
      "\u201cSome people would have come in and they would have added something ... to boost their visibility next to Whitney. And he had the boldness to tear it all down and just have acoustic piano, just Whitney, and then give her the first verse,\u201d said Merrill. \u201cAnd I mean, this is his project. To me, that\u2019s showing such respect.\u201d",
      "That, and they recognize Scott as a virtuosic vocalist. \u201cHis music really features his voice, as with Adele or Whitney, and rightly so because he can carry it off,\u201d said Rubicam. \u201cThere aren\u2019t just hundreds of people who can carry that off with his kind of power.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re a good vocal match together,\u201d she adds. \u201cThey both got a lot of emotionality and command also of their vocal instrument. ... Whitney could overpower a lot of people. But for Calum, he\u2019s confident and he had a vision about it and they both are meeting at an emotional level.\u201d",
      "\u201cI felt like I gently walked alongside Whitney,\u201d says Scott. The song is meant to feel alive, channeling the spirit of Houston \u2014 not a tribute, but an active single. It's why their version of \u201cI Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\u201d will be featured on his new album \u201cAvenoir,\u201d out Oct. 10.",
      "\u201cThis is as much part of my story as any other song on the album,\u201d he says. \u201cJust being given the honor of it has been, you know, I could die a very happy man now.\u201d",
      "\u201cForty years ago, this particular song was hot then and it\u2019s hot now,\u201d says Pat Houston. \u201cSo why not keep producing. But it\u2019s the right connection, it's the right platform and it certainly is the right artist to collab with her on this.\u201d",

      "\"Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale\" brings change to the Crawley family as they face the 1930s",
      "Change comes slowly to the Downton Abbey universe and its Crawley family. Just watch Robert Crawley go flat-hunting in London.",
      "Wait, what? FLAT-HUNTING? The Earl of Grantham? Well, yes, and it\u2019s the most amusing scene in \u201cDownton Abbey: The Grand Finale\u201d (a self-announcing title if there ever was one).",
      "Just look at proud and starched Robert (Hugh Bonneville), trying to be open-minded but utterly flummoxed by this \u201cflat\u201d in which you cannot go \u201cup\u201d to bed because there is no \u201cup.\u201d Well, you can go \u201calong\u201d to bed, suggests daughter Mary (Michelle Dockery, as always the sensible center of things) trying to make it all sound manageable.",
      "But the prospect of flat-living \u2014 rather than maintaining a mansion in London \u2014 is a thing the Crawleys must consider as they move into the 1930s, with financial and social instability always around the corner. \u201cFamilies like us need to keep moving to survive,\u201d says Mary, with the weight of Downton Abbey\u2019s future itself resting on her shoulders.",
      "A note to those coming in cold to the franchise here: Well, it\u2019s going to be quite hard. Writer Julian Fellowes and director Simon Curtis do not engage in hand-holding when it comes to mastering the Crawley family tree or the broader family of servants that Downton fans know and love. Even those who saw the first two films \u2013 the last in 2022 \u2013 might feel the need for a refresher.",
      "We begin in London\u2019s West End, at a show by Noel Coward, attended by Downton inhabitants from all levels. They\u2019re all there to watch dashing actor Guy Dexter (Dominic West), who in the last movie asked former butler Thomas Barrow to become his dresser, and more. It\u2019s nice to see Barrow is happy now, able to live life as a gay man \u2014 even if Robert can\u2019t quite grasp their relationship (change is slow, remember).",
      "Meanwhile Mary is shopping in London with sister Edith, and the importance of this scene is perhaps to remind us that the real star of the \u201cDownton\u201d universe, after that stupendous house of course, are the costumes. Mary finds a sleek red satin gown that is quite possibly the most smashing outfit we\u2019ve seen yet.",
      "But when she puts it on for a society ball, trouble erupts. As the family arrives we learn that Mary\u2019s divorce decree has come through \u2014 and this means, alas, that she will become a pariah. The newspaper screams news of \u201cdivorce in high places,\u201d and indeed, the ball\u2019s hostess actually kicks Mary out of the party because royalty is coming. Mary\u2019s concerned parents are outraged \u2014 but they stay, and their daughter heads out, quipping that she hopes a taxi will agree to take her.",
      "Soon enough we\u2019re back at Downton, and there is one very big difference: no longer does Violet Crawley, aka Maggie Smith, with her inimitable style and those hilarious quips, rule the halls. She died in the last film \u2014 and Smith died in 2024. But the film is dedicated to her in more ways than one.",

The playwright is the closest thing in Downton world to a modern celebrity \u2014 everyone wants to be with him, no matter station nor gender, and he winds up helping Mary overcome her social shunning.",

      "NEW YORK -- Polly Holliday, a Tony Award-nominated screen and stage actor who turned the catchphrase \u201cKiss my grits!\u201d into a national retort as the gum-chewing, beehive-wearing waitress aboard the long-running CBS sitcom \u201cAlice,\u201d has died. She was 88.",

      "\u201cAlice\u201d ran from 1976 to 1985, but Holliday had turned into such a star that the network gave her her own short-lived spin-off called \u201cFlo\u201d in 1980. It lasted a year.",
      "Holliday earned four Golden Globe nominations and won one in 1980 for \u201cAlice,\u201d as well as four Emmy Award nominations, three for \u201cAlice\u201d and one for \u201cFlo.\u201d",
      "As for the \u201cKiss my grits!\u201d line, the Alabama-born Holliday was quick to distance herself from it, telling interviewers that the line was \u201cpure Hollywood\u201d and not a regional saying. But she identified with Flo.",

      "Moving between high schools, she never felt welcome, Palacio said, and the pain only intensified as the months wore on. Finally, near the first anniversary of the fires, Palacio reached out for help.",
      "Hundreds of students like Palacio have struggled mentally since the fires \u2013 and not all have received the help they need.",
      "The Hawaii Department of Education estimates more than a third of Maui students lost a family member, sustained a serious injury or had a parent lose a job after the fires, which killed 102 people and damaged more than 3,300 properties in Lahaina.",

      "That\u2019s common after a disaster, especially at the two-year mark, when adrenaline wears off and stress remains high, said Christopher Knightsbridge, one of several researchers at the University of Hawaii who has studied the well-being of Lahaina fire survivors. While kids may feel numb immediately following a disaster, after two years, they\u2019re facing the toll of constant uncertainty and change, he said.",
      "It\u2019s a phenomenon seen wherever schooling has been disrupted by natural disasters, reporting by Honolulu Civil Beat, The Associated Press and several other news outlets shows. But a couple years after the disaster, schools are not always prepared with extra mental health supports.",
      "On Maui, the island is dealing with an ongoing shortage of specialists. In the past few years, the number of psychiatrists serving youth has dropped from four to two, even as demand has grown.",
      "\u201cThe crisis isn\u2019t over,\u201d Knightsbridge said.",

      "Two years in, many kids still wrestle with depression and anxiety.",
      "DayJahiah Valdivia, a senior at K\u012bhei Charter School, said her stress levels spike when there are strong winds or small brush fires. Valdivia lives in Upcountry Maui, which also faced wildfires that burned over a thousand acres of land on the same day as the 2023 Lahaina fires. Her home was spared, but it took months for her family to return because their property was covered in soot and needed professional cleaning.",
      "She feels less anxious now that her family members have discussed their escape plan for future disasters. But a summer fire near a friend\u2019s home in Central Maui renewed her fears about her loved ones\u2019 safety.",
      "\u201cThe anxiety never really wore off,\u201d she said. On windy days, it was especially difficult to concentrate in class or feel safe.",
      "In a University of Hawaii study of fire survivors conducted in 2024, just over half of children reported symptoms of depression, and 30% were likely facing an anxiety disorder. Nearly half of kids in the study, ages 10 to 17, were experiencing PTSD.",
      "Children in disaster-torn towns across the U.S. can relate.",
      "In Paradise, California, where the 2018 Camp Fire took 85 lives, a protracted period of disillusionment followed what some called the \u201chero phase,\u201d when the community pulled together and vowed to resurrect their town. Both Lahaina and Paradise had housing shortages after their fires, so families had to move away or live with friends to go to school or work in the area. In general, students who don\u2019t have a permanent living arrangement tend to struggle more academically and have more behavioral challenges, research shows.",
      "Many Paradise students still struggle with anxiety and grief, seven years later, making it difficult to fully engage in school. A year after the Camp Fire, 17% of students were homeless, and the suspension rate was 7.4%, compared to 2.5% statewide. The suspension rate remained nearly triple the state average last year, and more than 26% were chronically absent.",
      "Aryah Berkowitz, who lost her home, two dogs and her family\u2019s business in the Paradise blaze, dealt with lingering behavioral challenges following the disaster. For nearly a year afterward, her family of seven, plus a pair of surviving pit bull-Labrador mixes, lived with a friend in nearby Chico, sharing two bedrooms and a bathroom. Berkowitz, then in sixth grade, slept on the couch.",
      "\u201cI was having to help my family a lot and wasn\u2019t able to handle it,\u201d said Berkowitz , once a high-achieving student who was suspended twice after the fire. \u201cI was holding it inside and took it out on other people. Some days I\u2019d just walk out of class.\u201d",

      "\u201cThey just sort of vanished,\u201d Chapin said.",
      "Maui has long dealt with medical workforce challenges. Even before the fires, it faced a shortage of mental health professionals because they struggled with the state\u2019s high cost of living and housing shortage.",
      "The fires brought burnout and greater economic obstacles, only exacerbating the issue. Since then, Hawaii\u2019s education department has tried to bulk up Maui\u2019s mental health staff by bringing in providers from neighbor islands and the mainland and, more recently, using a $2 million federal grant to support students.",
      "But hiring mental health staff has been so difficult that even the federal money hasn\u2019t made much of a dent. In the first nine months of the grant, the state education department primarily used the money to bus displaced students from other parts of the island to Lahaina schools.",
      "The state has used the money to hire five part-time mental health providers working with students and staff, including one specialist who works in the evenings with students living as boarders on Lahainaluna\u2019s campus, said Kimberly Lessard, a Department of Education district specialist.",
      "Two of the six behavioral health specialist positions in Lahaina schools remained unfilled this summer, as they have been for years due to Maui\u2019s housing shortage and high cost of living, Lessard said.",
      "Valdivia, who still struggles with anxiety from the Upcountry Maui fires, has seen the impacts of the provider shortage firsthand. She\u2019s on a two- to three-month waiting list to see a psychiatrist on Maui, and she\u2019s seeing an O\u02bbahu-based therapist via telehealth because there aren\u2019t enough providers who can meet with her in person.",
      "\u201cEven just to get evaluated (by a psychiatrist), it\u2019s literally months,\u201d she said. \u201cI just think that\u2019s crazy.\u201d",

      "Yet despite legislation in 2000 to create more school psychologist positions, it wasn\u2019t until the pandemic that the commonwealth\u2019s Education Department dedicated money to hire them. Today, there are 58 vacancies across the archipelago\u2019s 870 schools.",
      "The school psychologists \u201ccan\u2019t keep up,\u201d said Nellie Zambrana, a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Puerto Rico at R\u00edo Piedras. Those who are working are overstretched, according to a study by the university\u2019s Psychological Research Institute. One psychologist, the study said, was assigned to more than 100 students at three schools.",
      "Loren Lapow wasn\u2019t deterred by the storm clouds gathering one June afternoon over D.T. Fleming Beach on Maui. The social worker helped teens carry an inflatable paddleboard to the water\u2019s edge, cheering them on as they swam.",
      "Amid the fun, Lapow directed the teens to reflect on their fears and losses. He asked them how they feel when they smell smoke or think about Lahaina\u2019s famed Front Street, most of which was destroyed in the blaze.",
      "\u201cPlaces are like a friend to us,\u201d Lapow said. \u201cWhen you lose places, it hurts.\u201d",
      "Lapow founded the Maui Hero Project, which his website describes as \u201cadventure-based counseling services.\u201d The eight-week program Lapow started 25 years ago teaches teens basic disaster preparedness skills and immerses them in outdoor activities. It's also a form of mental health support, which Lapow has leaned into since the wildfires.",
      "Lapow\u2019s approach has become a common strategy for nonprofits and therapists trying to reach kids who have balked at discussing their mental health since the fires. But those efforts don't always reach the kids who need the most help.",
      "There\u2019s a strong stigma around seeking mental health services, particularly in Filipino and Latino communities that make up a large portion of Lahaina\u2019s population, said Ruben Juarez, a professor at University of Hawaii who led the research study on fire survivors. Families may see counseling as a sign of weakness, and children may be reluctant to open up to therapists out of fear of being judged or scrutinized, he added.",
      "Yet in the study, Latino teens reported the highest rates of severe depressive and PTSD symptoms. Filipino teens reported some of the highest rates of anxiety.",

The project helped her own mental health improve, said Cashman, who regularly met with her school\u2019s behavioral health specialist.",
      "Now, Cashman is entering her second year at Brigham Young University Hawaii and hopes to work as a behavioral health specialist in Hawaiian language immersion schools",
      "\u201cThis horrible, horrible thing happened to me and my family, but I don\u2019t have to let it kill the rest of my life,\u201d Cashman said. \u201cI can really help my family, my community in school, and just make an impact in what I know how to do.\u201d",

      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer is willing to risk a government shutdown at the end of the month if Republicans don\u2019t accept Democratic demands on health care",
      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer weathered backlash from Democrats earlier this year when he voted with Republicans to keep the government open. But he\u2019s now willing to risk a shutdown at the end of the month if Republicans don\u2019t accede to Democratic demands.",
      "Schumer says he and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries are united in opposing any legislation that doesn\u2019t include key health care provisions and a commitment not to roll them back. He argues that the country is in a different place than it was in March, when he vigorously argued against a shutdown, and he says he believes Republicans and President Donald Trump will be held responsible if they don\u2019t negotiate a bipartisan deal.",
      "\u201cThings have changed\u201d since the March vote, Schumer said in an interview with The Associated Press on Thursday. He said Republicans have since passed Trump\u2019s massive tax breaks and spending cuts legislation, which trimmed Medicaid and other government programs, and Democrats are now unified \u2014 unlike in March, when he voted with Republicans and Jeffries voted against legislation to fund the government.",
      "A shutdown, Schumer said, wouldn\u2019t necessarily worsen an environment in which Trump is already challenging the authority of Congress. \u201cIt will get worse with or without it, because Trump is lawless,\u201d Schumer said.",
      "Schumer\u2019s threat comes as Republicans are considering a short-term stopgap spending measure to avoid a Sept. 30 shutdown and as Democrats face what most see as two tough choices if the parties can\u2019t negotiate a deal \u2014 vote with Republicans to keep the government open or let it close indefinitely with no clear exit plan.",
      "It also comes amid worsening partisan tensions in the Senate, where negotiations between the two parties over the confirmation process broke down for a second time Thursday and Republicans are changing Senate rules to get around Democratic objections. Democrats are also fuming over the Trump administration\u2019s decision to unilaterally claw back $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid just as negotiations over the spending deadline were getting underway in late August.",
      "Republicans have said that Democrats clearly will be to blame if they don\u2019t vote to keep the government open, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has repeatedly said that Schumer needs to come to them with a specific proposal on health care, including an extension of expanded government tax credits for many Americans who get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. Some Republicans are open to extending those credits before they expire at the end of the year.",

      "Schumer said Democrats also want Republicans to commit that the White House won\u2019t take back money they have negotiated and Congress has approved after Republicans pushed through a $9 billion cut requested by the White House in July and Trump blocked the additional foreign aid money in August. \u201cHow do you pass an appropriations bill and let them undo it down the road?\u201d Schumer said.",
      "Schumer\u2019s move to support the spending legislation in March put him in the rare position of bucking his party\u2019s base. He said then that of two bad options, a partial government shutdown was worse because it would give Trump even more control to shut down agencies and there would be \u201cno off-ramp\u201d to get out of it. \u201cI think people realize it\u2019s a tough choice,\u201d he said.",
      "He faced massive backlash from within the party after the vote, with some activists calling on him to resign. Jeffries temporarily distanced himself from his New York colleague, saying in a statement immediately after Schumer\u2019s vote that House Democrats \u201cwill not be complicit.\u201d The majority of Senate Democrats also voted against the plan.",
      "This time, though, Schumer is in lockstep with Jeffries and in messaging within his caucus. In Democrats\u2019 closed-door lunch Wednesday, he shared polling that he said suggested most Americans would blame Trump, not Democrats, for a shutdown.",
      "\u201cI did what I thought was right\u201d in March, Schumer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a different situation now than then.\u201d",

      "The Justice Department said the information was needed to investigate possible fraud or unlawful off-label promotion of drugs, but the information requested \u2014 including actual patient records \u2014 seemed to be unrelated, the judge said. Phone messages left with the Justice Department\u2019s attorney Ross Goldstein and with a Justice Department public affairs officer were not immediately returned.",
      "\u201cThe Administration has been explicit about its disapproval of the transgender community and its aim to end GAC,\u201d Joun wrote, referring to gender-affirming care. The judge later continued, \u201cIt is abundantly clear that the true purpose of issuing the subpoena is to interfere with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts' right to protect GAC within its borders, to harass and intimidate BCH to stop providing such care, and to dissuade patients from seeking such care.\u201d",
      "Just eight days after taking office, President Donald Trump issued an executive order aimed at restricting access to medical care for transgender youth. In June, the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division announced the division would use \u201call available resources to prioritize investigations of doctors, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, and other appropriate entities,\u201d in an effort to investigate what it called \u201cradical gender experimentation.\u201d",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi announced in a statement July 9 that the Justice Department had sent more than 20 subpoenas to doctors and clinics that provide care to transgender patients under 18. Bondi said the requests were part of investigations into \u201chealthcare fraud, false statements, and more.\u201d But the requests did not just seek information on policies or billing practices \u2014 they also demanded information about individual patients who had been prescribed puberty blockers or hormone therapy.",
      "Boston Children's Hospital asked the federal court to quash the subpoena on July 8, saying the Justice Department was seeking practically every document related to the provision of gender-affirming care over the past five and a half years, including highly sensitive and personally identifiable information about young patients.",
      "But the Justice Department contended the subpoena was proper and a valid way for the agency to investigate potential violations of off-label prescription drug rules.",

      "Every time humans cut into the Amazon rainforest or burn or destroy parts of it, they're making people sick.",
      "It's an idea Indigenous people have lived by for thousands of years. Now a new study in the journal Communications Earth & Environment adds to the scientific evidence supporting it, by finding that instances of several diseases were lowered in areas where forest was set aside for Indigenous peoples who maintained it well.",
      "With the United Nations climate summit set for Brazil in November, the study authors and outside experts said the work highlights the stakes for people around the world as negotiators try to address climate change. Belem, the city hosting the conference, is known as the gateway to the Amazon, and many who will be attending, from activists to delegates, think the role of Indigenous communities in climate action and conservation will be highlighted in a distinct way.",
      "\u201cThe \u2018forest man\u2019 or \u2018man forest,\u2019 according to the Indigenous perspective, has always been linked to the reciprocity between human health and the natural environment where one lives,\u201d said Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez Cayetano, president of the Federation of Ticuna and Yagua Communities of the Lower Amazon, or FECOTYBA, in the Peruvian Amazon. \u201cIf each state does not guarantee the rights and territories of Indigenous peoples, we would inevitably be harming their health, their lives, and the ecosystem itself.\u201d",
      "That harm can look like respiratory diseases such as asthma caused by toxic air pollution after fires, or illnesses that spread from animals to humans such as malaria, said Paula Prist, a senior program coordinator for the Forest and Grasslands Unit at the International Union for Conservation of Nature and one of the study authors.",
      "The researchers compiled and analyzed data on forest quality, legal recognition of Indigenous territory and disease incidence in the countries that border and include the Amazon.",
      "The work was \u201cimpressive\u201d to University of Washington health and climate scientist Kristie Ebi. She said it highlighted the complexity of factors that affect human health, and the importance of understanding the role Indigenous communities play in shaping it. \u201cUsing these methods, others could study other parts of the world,\u201d she said.",
      "The researchers found creative ways to account for other variables that can affect the spread of diseases, like access to health care in a given area, said Magdalena Hurtado, an anthropology and global health professor at Arizona State University and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences who was not involved with the study. But she expressed concern that the findings were presented with a precision that may not be warranted, given that they were based on correlation and use data on observations that can be difficult to measure.",
      "\u201cThey claim that Indigenous territories only protect health when forest cover is above 40%. And so that that feels like, why 40%? Why not 35? Or why not a range?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that the study is wrong, but it means that we need to be cautious because the patterns could change if different, more precise methods were used.\u201d",
      "Still, she thinks this is a starting point that could open the door to future research. \u201cThey are actually doing something quite beautiful,\u201d empirically connecting the legal recognition of Indigenous lands to human health outcomes, she said.",
      "Hern\u00e1ndez, of FECOTYBA, said that's important for the global policymakers who are coming to Brazil.",

      "There's a strong body of evidence showing that Indigenous land tenure helps maintain intact forests, but the paper shows it's important to maintain forest outside of Indigenous-stewarded areas as well, said James MacCarthy, a wildfire research manager with the Global Forest Watch team at the World Resources Institute who worked on a new report on extreme wildfires and the role of Indigenous communities in addressing them, and who was not involved with the study.",
      "Prist said the goal of the study was to understand how landscapes can be healthy for people, but that it would be naive to suggest that all forest landscapes stay exactly as they are, especially with the land needs of farming and livestock production.",
      "The world needs landscapes that provide economic services, but also services that protect people's health, she said.",

      "The governments of Denmark and Greenland officially apologized in a statement last month for their roles in the historic mistreatment in an apparent attempt to get ahead of the highly anticipated report. An official apology event in Greenland's capital is set for Sept. 24.",
      "Nearly 150 Inuit women last year sued Denmark and filed compensation claims against its health ministry, saying Danish health authorities violated their human rights. That case remains ongoing.",
      "While Tuesday's report covers the experiences of more than 350 women who came forward to speak to the investigators, Danish authorities say more than 4,000 women and girls \u2014 reportedly half the fertile women in Greenland at the time \u2014 received IUDs between the 1960s and mid-1970s.",
      "The alleged purpose was to limit population growth in Greenland by preventing pregnancies. The population on the Arctic island was rapidly increasing at the time because of better living conditions and better health care.",
      "Greenland took over its own health care programs on Jan. 1, 1992.",
      "The investigation\u2019s conclusion comes as Greenland is in the headlines alongside U.S. President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly said he seeks U.S. jurisdiction over Greenland. He has not ruled out a military force to take control of the mineral-rich, strategically located Arctic island.",

      "The forced contraception of Indigenous women and girls was part of centuries of Danish policies that dehumanized Greenlanders and their families.",
      "The policies included the removal of young Inuit children from their parents to be given to Danish foster families for reeducation and controversial parental competency tests that resulted in the forced separation of Greenlandic families.",
      "The investigators received reports from 354 Greenlandic women who were between 48 and 89 years old when they spoke to authorities for the independent investigation, which began June 1, 2023 following a media outcry.",
      "Almost all victims were between 12 and 37 years old at the time. One girl was under 12, but her exact age was not made public in Tuesday's report due to anonymity concerns. The vast majority of the procedures occurred in Greenland.",

      "There are more than 1,000 whitewashed stone chapels on the Greek island of Tinos owned and cared for by private families as they have in some cases for centuries",
      "TINOS, Greece -- More than a thousand chapels dot the Greek island of Tinos. In a rare centuries-old tradition, the mostly simple, room-sized stone structures are painstakingly maintained by the ordinary families that own them.",
      "These private whitewashed chapels with miniature bell towers belong to octogenarians and Generation Z, goat farmers and hotel owners, Orthodox Christians and Catholics who worship daily and de facto atheists.",
      "What they have in common is an unwavering dedication to preserving the diminutive churches their ancestors built \u2014 and to throwing a liturgical and community celebration called panigiri around the feast day of the Virgin Mary or saint they honor.",
      "\u201cThis tradition and custom that connect us between members of the family is part of our identity. I\u2019m fully committed to maintaining and passing them down to my children,\u201d said Ioanna Krikelli during the September festival at her family\u2019s church, Agios Sostis, established in the 17th century.",
      "Perched on a rocky promontory on the Aegean Sea facing Mykonos, the chapel with its twin bell towers topped by simple crosses hosted an hourlong evening liturgy. Hundreds of faithful packed the front yard festooned with small Greek flags and string lights.",
      "\u201cWhat you see here is very deep,\u201d Krikelli said, as family members \u2014 including two who had traveled from Iceland and the United Kingdom for the occasion \u2014 served homemade raki liqueur and sweets after the service.",
      "For centuries, European aristocrats built private chapels, usually in their palaces. Today, many homes in predominantly Orthodox Greece have a tiny chapel nearby. Beyond the spiritual, tax breaks for houses of worship can extend to attached buildings.",
      "But in the Cycladic islands, particularly Sifnos and Tinos, there\u2019s more than one chapel per 10 residents. The reasons trace back to past empires, which successively oversaw these strategic islands providing a bridge between Europe and Asia.",
      "The Venetians, who ruled Tinos from the 13th to the early 18th century, granted land rights to Tinos\u2019 farmers as a buffer to the Ottomans. After taking over, the Ottomans allowed the locals to keep and build hundreds of chapels on their farmland, said Maria Vidali, an architect from Tinos who researched the chapels.",
      "Then there are the many chapels built by sailors\u2019 families as vows for their safe passage, those constructed for deceased family members, and those erected in honor of the Virgin Mary, Vidali added. One of Greece\u2019s most important Marian shrines, Panagia Evaggelistria, is in Tinos' main town.",
      "Even though almost all chapels share the iconic Cycladic style \u2014 cubic forms, flat roofs, touches of blue paint on mostly white surfaces \u2014 \u201cevery mason added his own flourish,\u201d said the Rev. Markos Foskolos. The Tinos native has been a Catholic priest on the island for more than 50 years and authored its history.",
      "Most chapels are always open, with a supply of oil for candle wicks as well as candy and bottled water for pilgrims.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s as if they expect visitors,\u201d said Nikos Levantis at Agios Giorgos, a friend\u2019s 200-year-old chapel squeezed among massive granite boulders.",
      "Levantis\u2019 family owns three chapels, and he recalls as a child carrying blankets for sleepovers with a dozen cousins before the morning liturgy. His mother, Eleftheria Levanti, remembers how the festivals were essential social events for islanders decades ago. Young men often proposed by putting a flower alongside meat on their fork and handing it to a girl, she said.",
      "Offering food to pilgrims was a practical need, Foskolos said, when people walked long distances to reach the chapels and did so while fasting before receiving Communion. Feeding poor people was also part of the social contract for those who owned farmland.",
      "\u201cAll this helps to form a sense of community. In these little chapels, one becomes a brother with everyone else,\u201d Foskolos said.",
      "Community gathering remains a crucial part of today\u2019s celebrations, though many are scaled down.",

      "The visit, featuring glittering tiaras, brass bands and a sumptuous banquet served on 200-year-old silver, is a display of the pomp and ceremony that Britain does like no one else. But it\u2019s a spectacle with a purpose: to bolster ties with one of the world\u2019s most powerful men at a time when his America First policies are roiling longstanding trade and security relationships.",

      "Three centuries after Britain\u2019s kings and queens gave up political power and settled for the role of ceremonial head of state, the royals remain a robust instrument of \u201csoft power,\u201d which the elected government uses to reward friends and wring concessions out of reluctant allies.",

      "LONDON -- Families of the victims and survivors of the 1972 Bloody Sunday, in which British soldiers opened fire and killed 13 unarmed civil rights marchers and injured 15 others in Northern Ireland, have fought for justice for five decades without a single person being held accountable in court.",

They said there wasn't enough evidence to charge 16 other former soldiers and two alleged members of the Official Irish Republican Army who were investigated for their roles in the shootings.",

They made the decision after a judge tossed out a case against two soldiers in the killing of an Irish Republican Army leader after ruling key prosecution evidence was inadmissible.",

      "\u201cThe first two demands have been met, and when a British soldier stands in the dock on Monday and faces charges of multiple murder and attempted murder, we will see the third demand met, although we will always believe there should be many more on trial for Bloody Sunday,\u2033 Doherty said. \u201cWe have waited 53 long years for justice and, hopefully, we will see a measure of it through this trial.\u201d",

      "The following year, Chakwera won a redo of the election.",
      "This time, Chakwera, 70, of the Malawi Congress Party is seeking a second term. Mutharika, 85, of the Democratic Progressive Party, is hoping to return to the leadership.",
      "They two are seen as the main contenders in Tuesday's election, which has a lineup of 17 presidential candidates, including another former president, Joyce Banda. Malawians will also elect lawmakers to Parliament and more than 500 local council members.",

      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Pope Leo XIV on Sunday honored hundreds of Christians who have been killed for their faith in the 21st century, praising their courage and lamenting that their numbers were growing in many parts of the world.",
      "The Vatican has been documenting these Christian martyrs, not as part of its saint-making process but to merely collect and remember their stories. Their numbers include cases of Christians being killed by Islamic militants, mafia groups or Amazonian ranchers upset at their defense of the rainforest and poor.",
      "Leo presided over a Holy Year evening prayer service to honor them, inviting Orthodox patriarchs and Christian ministers from over 30 Christian denominations. It was part of the Vatican\u2019s ongoing effort to underline what it calls the indiscriminate \u201cecumenism of blood\u201d that unites Christians who are persecuted and killed for their faith, regardless of their particular denomination.",
      "\u201cMany brothers and sisters, even today, carry the same cross as our Lord on account of their witness to the faith in difficult situations and hostile contexts,\u201d Leo said. \u201cLike him, they are persecuted, condemned and killed.\u201d",
      "The service, at the basilica of St. Paul Outside the Walls, came 25 years after St. John Paul II presided over a 2000 Jubilee commemoration of new martyrs held at the Colosseum.",
      "Leo cited a few examples of martyrdom since then, including Sister Dorothy Stang, an American nun who spent three decades trying to preserve the Amazon rainforest and defend the rights of poor settlers who confronted powerful ranchers seeking their lands. She was gunned down in 2005 in a hit ordered by ranchers.",
      "\u201cWhen those who were about to kill her asked her for a weapon, she showed them her Bible and replied, \u2018This is my only weapon,\u2019\u201d Leo said.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- Japan\u2019s government on Monday defended its stance on wartime sexual slavery and described South Korean court rulings ordering Japanese compensation as violations of international law, after U.N. investigators criticized Tokyo for failing to ensure truth-finding and reparations for the victims.",
      "In its own response to U.N. human rights rapporteurs, South Korea called on Japan to \u201csquarely face up to our painful history\u201d and cited how Tokyo\u2019s refusal to comply with court orders have denied the victims payment. The statements underscored how the two Asian U.S. allies still hold key differences on the issue, even as they pause their on-and-off disputes over historical grievances to stabilize bilateral relations.",
      "A group of U.N. investigators in July sent letters to Japan and South Korea as well as China, the Philippines, Indonesia, the Netherlands and East Timor \u2014 where sexual slavery victims also come from \u2014 over what they described as the countries\u2019 failures to \u201censure access to truth, justice, remedy, and reparations for survivors.\u201d The governments were given 60 days to respond, but only the responses from Japan and South Korea were posted on a U.N. website on Monday.",
      "U.N. investigators had asked Japan to address various concerns, including claims that its past investigations and reparations regarding sexual slavery were insufficient, that it continues to evade state and legal responsibility, and its refusal to comply with three South Korean court rulings from 2021 to 2025 ordering compensation for victims.",
      "Japan responded by reiterating its long-standing position that all compensation matters with South Korea over sexual slavery victims were settled by past agreements, including the 1965 treaty normalizing relations and a separate 2015 deal aimed at resolving their differences on the issue.",
      "The Japanese statement, issued by its permanent mission in Geneva, claimed that the recent Korean court rulings violated the principle of state immunity in such lawsuits and urged Seoul to \u201ctake appropriate measures to remedy its breaches of international law as a country.\u201d",
      "Japan in past years has strongly rejected South Korean court rulings ordering the government in Tokyo and Japanese companies to provide reparations to Korean victims of sexual slavery and also wartime forced labor, another legacy of Japan\u2019s brutal colonial rule of Korea before the end of World War II. Japan says the rulings violate its sovereign immunity and go against the 1965 treaty. South Korean courts contend that sovereign immunity does not protect foreign states from accountability for crimes against humanity or wrongful acts committed on South Korea\u2019s territory against its nationals.",

      "But only the latest, which a Supreme Court panel ruled was orchestrated by former President Jair Bolsonaro, ended with prison sentences for its leaders, instigators and supporters, many of whom are already behind bars.",
      "To a large extent, the unprecedented outcome is the result of one man\u2019s drive.",
      "Supreme Court justice Alexandre de Moraes, the judge who spearheaded the case, has become a hero to some Brazilians and a zealot to others.",
      "In Brazil he is better known as \u201cXand\u00e3o,\u201d or \u201cBig Alex\u201d in Portuguese. Married with three children, he is widely known for his shiny bald head and use of soccer metaphors, but also for what many see as swift and divisive actions.",
      "De Moraes, 56, has taken on politicians, billionaire Elon Musk and Bolsonaro supporters who damaged government buildings in Brasilia, the capital, during a 2023 riot that prosecutors said was instigated by the former president.",
      "From now on, Brazilian history books will call him the Supreme Court judge who led a five-member panel to sentence Bolsonaro to 27 years and three months in prison.",
      "He led the trial despite pressure from the U.S. government that sanctioned de Moraes and imposed tariffs on Brazil because of the process against Bolsonaro, an ally of U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Only one of the justices, Luiz Fux, disagreed and asked for Bolsonaro to be acquitted. But de Moraes\u2019 sway in the case is such that the longest serving member of the court, Justice Gilmar Mendes, and Chief Justice Luis Roberto Barroso popped by the panel\u2019s room at end of the trial solely to defend his work.",
      "The panel also ruled against seven close allies of the former president, including top military men.",
      "\u201cI may have disagreements in some issues with Justice de Moraes,\" said Jos\u00e9 Eduardo Cardozo, a former justice minister who first met de Moraes about 30 years ago. \"But in general his standing is rigorously righteous for those who understand constitutional law and defend the rule of law vehemently.\u201d",
      "For Cardozo, the criticism of how he handled Bolsonaro's trial is \u201cpurely political.\u201d",
      "Celso Vilardi, a lawyer for Bolsonaro, took swipes at de Moraes after Fux voted almost entirely in disagreement in the case.",
      "\u201cI am vindicated,\u201d Vilardi told journalists Wednesday. \u201cThis was a technical vote.\u201d",
      "But before he became Bolsonaro\u2019s lawyer in January, Vilardi had nothing but praise for de Moraes.",
      "Before the Bolsonaro case began, de Moraes\u2019 public image was one of a backward, conservative judge.",
      "He frequently was mocked on social media for two videos. One shows him destroying a small marijuana plantation with his bare hands. The other exposes his discomfort among Indigenous Brazilians, who danced as they repeated his name.",
      "Now social media is filled with images of de Moraes. Right-wing content shows the judge asking people for their private information if they don\u2019t want to be jailed, while left-wing voters portray him as Superman, an unstoppable hero rising to the task. Some memes mock his seemingly more aggressive decisions when his soccer club Corinthians loses.",
      "Friends, adversaries and colleagues have said over the years that de Moraes does not waiver when on duty.",
      "\u201cHistory teaches us that impunity, omission and cowardice are not options for pacification, because the apparently easier path, and only apparently, is that of impunity, omission, leaving traumatic scars in our society and corrodes our democracy,\u201d de Moraes said during the first week of Bolsonaro's trial.",
      "A university professor and former public prosecutor, he was appointed to the country\u2019s top court in 2017 by President Michel Temer, a conservative, after a stint as his justice minister.

      "The disagreement involved a monthslong dispute with Musk over free speech, far-right accounts and misinformation.

      "Recently, Trump's administration imposed a 50% tariff hike on Brazilian exports with vocal support from Bolsonaro\u2019s sons. The U.S. also sanctioned de Moraes over alleged suppression of freedom of expression and overseeing the Bolsonaro trial.",

      "Some of that experience became obvious during his term as president of Brazil\u2019s top electoral court, overseeing the 2022 election.",
      "His efforts to fight disinformation and protect the integrity of the electoral process were praised by moderates, international institutions and supporters of President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva as key to the results being respected.",
      "The electoral court role was added to one he received at the start of the Bolsonaro administration as rapporteur of a \u201cfake news\u201d probe focused on online attacks against members of the Supreme Court. De Moraes was handpicked based on his security experience in Sao Paulo.",
      "The two investigations resulted in arrests of political figures, blocks on social media accounts and lawsuits against business leaders, but in some ways also converged in the coup plot.",
      "As the verdict and sentencing phase of Bolsonaro's trial ended Thursday, de Moraes made an effort to reign in his emotions as his peer Fl\u00e1vio Dino took almost five minutes to praise his work.",
      "\u201cJustice Alexandre sees this as finishing line,\" Dino said. \u201cBut there will be other trials, other tasks. This is a high point in his career, and we have to pay a tribute to him. That\u2019s not very common in our community.\u201d",

      "For now, it's not even clear who will be there. The meeting will likely include Lisa Cook, an embattled governor, unless an appeals court or the Supreme Court rules in favor of an effort by President Donald Trump to remove her from office. And it will probably include Stephen Miran, a top White House economic aide whom Trump has nominated to fill an empty seat on the Fed's board. But those questions may not be resolved until late Monday.",
      "Meanwhile, the U.S. economy is mired in uncertainty. Hiring has slowed sharply, while inflation remains stubbornly high.",
      "So a key question for the Fed is: Do they worry more about people who are out of work and struggling to find jobs, or do they focus more on the struggles many Americans face in keeping up with rising costs for groceries and other items? The Fed's mandate from Congress requires it to seek both stable prices and full employment.",
      "For now, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other Fed policymakers have signaled the Fed is more concerned about weaker hiring, a key reason investors expect the central bank will reduce its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point on Wednesday to about 4.1%.",
      "Still, stubbornly high inflation may force them to proceed slowly and limit how many reductions they make. The central bank will also release its quarterly economic projections Wednesday, and economists project they will show that policymakers expect one or two additional cuts this year, plus several more next year.",
      "Ellen Meade, an economics professor at Duke University and former senior economist at the Fed, said it's a stark contrast to the early pandemic, when it was clear the Fed had to rapidly reduce rates to boost the economy. And when inflation surged in 2021 and 2022, it was also a straightforward call for the Fed, which moved quickly to raise borrowing costs to combat higher prices.",
      "But now, \u201cit\u2019s a tough time,\u201d Meade said. \u201cIt would be a tough time, even if the politics and the whole thing weren\u2019t going on the way they are, it would be a tough time. Some people would want to cut, some people would not want to cut.\u201d",
      "Amid all the economic uncertainty, Trump is applying unprecedented political pressure on the Fed, demanding sharply lower rates, seeking to fire Cook, and insulting Powell, whom he has called a \u201cnumbskull,\u201d \u201cfool,\u201d and \u201cmoron.\u201d",
      "Loretta Mester, a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and finance professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, said that Fed officials won't let the criticisms sway their decisions on policy. Still, the attacks are unfortunate, she said, because they threaten to undermine the Fed's credibility with the public.",
      "\u201cAdded to their list of the difficulty of making policy because of how the economy is performing, they also have to contend with the fact that there may be some of the public that\u2019s skeptical about how they\u2019ve gone about making their decisions,\u201d she said.",

      "Miran, if he is on the board, and Governor Michelle Bowman may dissent in opposition to a quarter-point reduction in favor of a steeper half-point cut.",
      "There could be additional dissenting votes in the other direction, potentially from regional bank presidents who might oppose any cuts at all. Beth Hammack, president of the Fed's Cleveland branch, and Jeffrey Schmid, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, have both expressed concern that inflation has topped the Fed's 2% targer for more than four years and is still elevated. If either votes against a cut, it would be the first time there were dissents in both directions from a Fed decision since 2019.",
      "\u201cThis degree of division is unusual, but the circumstances are unusual, too,\" Andolfatto said. \u201cThis is a situation central banks really don\u2019t like: The combination of inflationary pressure and labor market weakness.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump\u2019s push to revitalize American manufacturing by luring foreign investment into the U.S. has run smack into one of his other priorities: cracking down on illegal immigration.",
      "Hardly a week after immigration authorities raided a sprawling Hyundai battery plant in Georgia, detained more than 300 South Korean workers and showed video of some of them shackled in chains, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung warned that the country's other companies may be reluctant to take up Trump\u2019s invitation to pour money into the United States.",
      "If the U.S. can't promptly issue visas to the technicians and other skilled workers needed to launch plants, then \u201cestablishing a local factory in the United States will either come with severe disadvantages or become very difficult for our companies,\u201d Lee said Thursday. \u201cThey will wonder whether they should even do it.\u201d",
      "The raid and subsequent diplomatic crisis show how the Trump administration's mass deportation goals are running up against its efforts to bring in money from abroad to drive the U.S. economy and create more jobs. Moves like workplace immigration enforcement and visa restrictions could risk alienating allies that are pledging to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S. to avoid high tariffs.",
      "Trump\u2019s economic agenda is built around using hefty tariffs on imports, including a 15% levy on South Korean products, as a cudgel to force manufacturing to return to the U.S. He\u2019s repeatedly said foreign companies can escape his tariffs if they produce in America.

      "NEW YORK -- In the days following the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, numerous workers have been fired for their comments on his death, among them MSNBC political analyst Matthew Dowd.",
      "Several conservative activists have sought to identify social media users whose posts about Kirk they viewed as offensive or celebratory, targeting everyone from journalists to teachers. Right-wing influencer Laura Loomer said she would try to ruin the professional aspirations of anyone who celebrated Kirk\u2019s death.",
      "It's far from the first time workers have lost their jobs over things they say publicly \u2014 including in social media posts. But the speed at which the firings have been happening raises questions about worker rights versus employer rights.",
      "In the U.S., laws can vary across states, but overall, there\u2019s very little legal protections for employees who are punished for speech made both in and out of private workplaces.",
      "\u201cMost people think they have a right to free speech\u2026but that doesn\u2019t necessarily apply in the workplace,\u201d said Vanessa Matsis-McCready, associate general counsel and vice president of HR Services for Engage PEO. \u201cMost employees in the private sector do not have any protections for that type of speech at work.\u201d",
      "Add to that the prevalence of social media, which has made it increasingly common to track employees\u2019 conduct outside of work and to dox people, or publish information about them online with the intent of harming or harassing them.",
      "Protections for workers vary from one state to the next. For example, in New York, if an employee is participating in a weekend political protest, but not associating themselves with the organization that employs them, their employer cannot fire them for that activity when they return to work.",
      "But if that same employee is at a company event on a weekend and talks about their political viewpoints in a way that makes others feel unsafe or the target of discrimination or harassment, then they could face consequences at work, Matsis-McCready said.",
      "Most of the U.S. defaults to \u201cat-will\u201d employment law \u2014 which essentially means employers can choose to hire and fire as they see fit, including over employees' speech.",
      "\u201cThe First Amendment does not apply in private workplaces to protect employees\u2019 speech,\" said Andrew Kragie, an attorney who specializes in employment and labor law at Maynard Nexsen. \"It actually does protect employers\u2019 right to make decisions about employees, based on employees\u2019 speech.\u201d",
      "Kragie said there are \u201cpockets of protection\u201d around the U.S. under various state laws, such as statutes that forbid punishing workers for their political views. But the interpretation of how that gets enforced changes, he notes, making the waters murky.",
      "Steven T. Collis, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin and faculty director of the school\u2019s Bech-Loughlin First Amendment Center, also points to some state laws that say employers can\u2019t fire their workers for \u201clegal off duty conduct.\u201d But there\u2019s often an exception for conduct seen as disruptive to an employer\u2019s business or reputation, which could be grounds to fire someone over public comments or social media posts.",
      "\u201cIn this scenario, if somebody feels like one of their employees has done something that suggests they are glorifying or celebrating a murder, an employer might still be able to fire them even with one of those laws on the books,\u201d Collis said.",
      "For public employees, which can range from school teachers and postal workers to elected officials, the process is a bit different. That\u2019s because the First Amendment plays a unique role when the government is the employer, Collis explains. The Supreme Court has ruled that if an employee is acting in a private capacity but speaking on a matter of public concern, they could be protected. Still, he noted that government employers can discipline a worker if they determine such conduct will interfere with the government\u2019s ability to do its job.",
      "Some in the public sector have already worked to restrict speech in the aftermath of Kirk's death. For instance, leaders at the Pentagon unveiled a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy for any posts or comments from troops that make light of or celebrate the killing of Kirk.",
      "The policy, announced by the Pentagon\u2019s top spokesman Sean Parnell on social media Thursday, came hours after numerous conservative military influencers and activists began forwarding posts they considered problematic to Parnell and his boss, defense secretary Pete Hegseth.",

      "The ubiquity of social media is making it easier than ever to share opinions about politics and major news events as they're unfolding. But posting on social media leaves a record, and in times of escalating political polarization, those declarations can be seen as damaging to the reputation of an individual or their employer.",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t realize when they\u2019re on social media, it is the town square,\u201d said Amy Dufrane, CEO of the Human Resource Certification Institute. \u201cThey\u2019re not having a private conversation with the neighbor over the fence. They\u2019re really broadcasting their views.\u201d",
      "Political debates are certainly not limited to social media and are increasingly making their way into the workplace as well.",
      "\u201cThe gamification of the way we communicate in the workplace, Slack and Teams, chat and all these things, they\u2019re very similar to how you might interact on Instagram or other social media, so I do think that makes it feel a little less formal and somebody might be more inclined to take to take a step and say, 'Oh, I can\u2019t believe this happened,'\u201d Matsis-McCready said.",
      "In the tense, divided climate of the U.S., many human resource professionals have expressed that they're unprepared to address politically charged discussions in the workplace, according to the Human Resource Certification Institute. But those conversations are going to happen, so employers need to set policies about what is acceptable or unacceptable workplace conduct, Dufrane said.",
      "\u201cHR has got to really drill down and make sure that they\u2019re super clear on their policies and practices and communicating to their employees on what are their responsibilities as an employee of the organization,\u201d Dufrane said.",
      "Many employers are reviewing their policies on political speech and providing training about what appropriate conduct looks like, both inside and outside the organization, she said. And the brutal nature of Kirk's killing may have led some of them to react more strongly in the days that followed his death.",
      "\u201cBecause of the violent nature of what some political discussion is now about, I think there is a real concern from employers that they want to keep the workplace safe and that they\u2019re being extra vigilant about anything that could be viewed as a threat, which is their duty,\u201d Matsis-McCreedy said.",
      "Employees can also be seen as ambassadors of a company\u2019s brand, and their political speech can dilute that brand and hurt its reputation, depending on what is being said and how it is being received. That is leading more companies to act on what employees are saying online, she said.",
      "\u201cSome of the individuals that had posted and their posts went viral, all of a sudden the phone lines of their employers were just nonstop calls complaining,\u201d Matsis-McCready said.",
      "Still, experts like Collis don\u2019t anticipate a significant change in how employers monitor their workers speech \u2014 noting that online activity has come under the spotlight for at least the last 15 years.",
      "\u201cEmployers are already and have been for a very long time, vetting employees based on what they\u2019re posting on social media,\u201d he said.",

      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California will extend a key climate program under a bill state lawmakers passed Saturday, sending the measure to Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has championed it as a crucial tool to respond to the Trump administration\u2019s environmental rollbacks.",
      "The Democrat-dominated Legislature voted to reauthorize the state's cap-and-trade program, which is set to expire after 2030. Then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, signed a law authorizing the program in 2006, and it launched in 2013.",
      "The program sets a declining limit on total planet-warming emissions in the state from major polluters. Companies must reduce their emissions, buy allowances from the state or other businesses, or fund projects aimed at offsetting their emissions. Money the state receives from the sales funds climate-change mitigation, affordable housing and transportation projects, as well as utility bill credits for Californians.",
      "Newsom, a Democrat, and legislative leaders, who said months ago they would prioritize reauthorizing the program, almost ran out of time to introduce the proposal before the statehouse wraps for the year.",
      "\u201cAfter months of hard work with the Legislature, we have agreed to historic reforms that will save money on your electric bills, stabilize gas supply, and slash toxic air pollution \u2014 all while fast-tracking California\u2019s transition to a clean, green job-creating economy,\u201d Newsom said after striking the deal this week.",
      "The proposal would reauthorize the program through 2045, better align the declining cap on emissions with the state's climate targets and potentially boost carbon-removal projects. It would also change the name to \u201ccap and invest\" to emphasize its funding of climate programs.",
      "The Legislature approved another bill committing annual funding from the program's revenues. It includes $1 billion for the state's long-delayed high-speed rail project, $800 million for an affordable housing program, $250 million for community air protection programs and $1 billion for the Legislature to decide on annually.",
      "The votes come as officials contend with balancing the state\u2019s ambitious climate goals and the cost of living. California has some of the highest utility and gas prices in the country. Officials face increased pressure to stabilize the cost and supply of fuel amid the planned closures of two oil refineries that make up roughly 18% of the state's refining capacity, according to energy regulators.",
      "Proponents of the extension say it will give companies certainty over the program's future. The state lost out on $3.6 billion in revenues over the past year and a half, largely due to uncertainty, according to a report from Clean and Prosperous California, a group of economists and lawyers supporting the program. Some environmentalists say the Trump administration's attacks on climate programs, including the state's first-in-the-nation ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, added urgency to the reauthorization effort.",

      "\u201cA stay by this court would therefore be the first signal from the courts that our system of government is no longer able to guarantee the independence of the Federal Reserve. Nothing would then stop the president from firing other members of the board on similarly flimsy pretexts. The era of Fed independence would be over. The risks to the nation\u2019s economy could be dire,\u201d according to the filing.",
      "The court has given the Trump administration the option to respond to Cook's filing by 3 p.m. Eastern on Sunday.",
      "At stake is whether the Trump administration will succeed in its extraordinary effort to shape the board before the Fed\u2019s interest rate-setting committee meets Tuesday and Wednesday. At the same time, Senate Republicans are pushing to confirm Stephen Miran, President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to an open spot on the Fed\u2019s board, which could happen as soon as Monday.",
      "Trump has accused Cook of mortgage fraud because she appeared to claim two properties as \u201cprimary residences\u201d in July 2021, before she joined the board. Such claims can lead to a lower mortgage rate and smaller down payment than if one of them was declared as a rental property or second home.",
      "Cook has denied the charges and sued the Trump administration to block her firing.",
      "On Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Jia Cobb ruled the administration had not satisfied a legal requirement that Fed governors can only be fired \u201cfor cause,\u201d which she said was limited to misconduct while in office. Cook did not join the Fed\u2019s board until 2022.",

      "The administration then appealed the decision and asked for an emergency ruling reversing the lower court order by Monday. In their emergency appeal, Trump\u2019s lawyers argued that even if the conduct occurred before Cook's time as governor, her alleged action \u201cindisputably calls into question Cook\u2019s trustworthiness and whether she can be a responsible steward of the interest rates and economy.\u201d",
      "If the Trump administration's appeal succeeds, Cook would be removed from the Fed\u2019s board until her case is ultimately resolved in the courts, and she would miss next week\u2019s Fed meeting, when the central bank is set to decide whether to reduce its key interest rate.",
      "If the appeals court rules in Cook\u2019s favor, the administration could seek an emergency ruling from the Supreme Court.",
      "The Fed is under relentless pressure from Trump to cut rates. The central bank has held rates steady since late 2024 over worries that the Trump administration\u2019s unpredictable tariff policies will reignite inflation.",
      "Last month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled that Fed officials are increasingly concerned about weaker hiring, setting the stage for a rate cut next week. Most economists expect the Fed will cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point to about 4.1%.",
      "When the Fed reduces its key rate, it often, over time, lowers borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, and business loans. Some of those rates have already fallen in anticipation of cuts from the Fed.",

      "The Congressional Budget Office has released new economic projections, indicating that unemployment, inflation and overall growth will worsen in 2025 before improving over the next year",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policy, immigration crackdowns and sweeping tax and spending law are expected to increase jobless rates and inflation and lower overall growth this year before they improve next year, according to a new report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The CBO on Friday released new economic projections for the next three years, updating the outlook it originally released in January, before Trump's inauguration.",
      "The latest figures, which compare fourth quarter changes, show the unemployment rate, inflation and overall growth are expected to be worse this year than initially projected, while the economic picture is expected to steady in subsequent years.",
      "The CBO outlooks attempt to set expectations for the economy in order to help choices made by congressional and executive branch policymakers. It does not forecast economic downturns or recessions, with its estimates generally reverting back to an expected average over time.",
      "But Friday\u2019s outlook showed the degree to which Trump\u2019s choices are altering the path of the U.S. economy, suggesting that growth has been hampered in the near term by choices that have yet to show the promised upside of more jobs and lower budget deficits.",
      "Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson, told The Associated Press, \u201cAmericans heard similar doom-and-gloom forecasts during President Trump\u2019s first term, when the President\u2019s economic agenda unleashed historic job, wage, and economic growth and the first decline in wealth inequality in decades.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese same policies of tax cuts, tariffs, deregulation, and energy abundance are set to deliver \u2014 and prove the forecasters wrong \u2014 again in President Trump\u2019s second term,\u201d he said.",
      "Overall, the CBO expects real GDP growth to decrease from 2.5% in 2024 to 1.4% this year, a downgrade from the initial projection of 1.9%. The CBO attributes the projected decline to a slowdown in consumer spending stemming from new tariffs and a decrease in immigration, which would also impact consumer spending.",
      "The tariffs \u201craise prices for consumer goods and services, thereby eroding the purchasing power of households; they also increase costs for businesses that use imported and import-competing inputs in production,\u201d the report says.",

      "Additionally, unemployment is expected to hit 4.5% in 2025, higher than the 4.3% initially expected, according to the CBO. The jobless rate is expected to reach 4.2% in 2026 \u2014 slightly lower than the 4.4% originally anticipated \u2014 and even out at 4.4% in 2027 and 2028.",
      "And inflation is now expected to hit 3.1% for the rest of 2025, according to the CBO, up from its 2.2% projection in January. Inflation would then lower to 2.4% in 2026, higher than the initial expectation of 2.1%, before leveling off at 2% the next two years.",
      "The CBO on Wednesday issued a report that shows Trump\u2019s plans for mass deportations and other hard-line immigration measures will result in roughly 320,000 people removed from the United States over the next ten years.",
      "Coupled with a lower fertility rate in the U.S., the reduction in immigration means that the CBO\u2019s projection of the U.S. population will be 4.5 million people lower by 2035 than the nonpartisan office had projected in January.",

      "Vikings quarterback J",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- Trailing by nine and facing third-and-1 deep in their own end early in the fourth quarter, the Vikings put their trust in quarterback J.J. McCarthy. However, his deep pass down the left sideline sailed five yards beyond an open Jalen Nailor\u2019s grasp and the Vikings were forced to punt.",
      "It was one miscue on a night filled with them for McCarthy and the Vikings, who in two games have ridden the highs and lows of having a first-year starter at quarterback.",
      "One week after leading a fourth-quarter comeback in Chicago that earned him NFC Offensive Player of the Week honors, McCarthy struggled mightily in his first game in front of Vikings fans. McCarthy completed 11 of 21 passes for 158 yards, was sacked six times and committed three turnovers in the Vikings\u2019 22-6 loss to the Falcons on Sunday night.",
      "\u201cThis is unfortunate, but I know we have a great ... culture (in the) locker room and that we\u2019re going to respond from this,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to learn and get better and bounce back next week.\u201d",
      "Playing most of the game without two of their starting offensive linemen, the Vikings' offense looked disjointed all night. They rushed for just 78 yards, allowed regular pressure on McCarthy and couldn\u2019t make a big play when it mattered most.",
      "For instance, the only time they got the ball into the red zone came early in the second quarter. McCarthy and Nailor hooked up for 17 yards to get the ball down to the Atlanta 2-yard line. But then a fumble, a delay of game penalty and a sack derailed any hopes of finding the end zone.",
      "\u201cThat right there in a nutshell is what the night kind of was,\u201d Vikings coach Kevin O\u2019Connell said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s nobody that\u2019s going to fix those things besides our coaches and players.\u201d",
      "Atlanta led 12-6 through three quarters, but Vikings fans had to be hoping for more fourth-quarter magic from McCarthy when Minnesota took over at midfield with 15 minutes left. But on the first play of the quarter, McCarthy was sacked by Zach Harrison and fumbled the ball. The Falcons recovered, added a field goal to make it a two-score game and never looked back.",
      "McCarthy also threw two interceptions and missed a handful of open receivers in big moments, including the deep shot to Nailor on third-and-1 on the first possession after his fumble. But O\u2019Connell saw more good than bad in McCarthy\u2019s performance.",

      "Just 22 years old, McCarthy has been lauded for his maturity, which showed up after three rough quarters in his debut against the Bears. Now he\u2019s got another chance to demonstrate how he responds to adversity, both as a quarterback and as a team leader.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an all-11 thing, and it starts with me first,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cThis is a long season. Everyone\u2019s telling me this is a journey and I believe them wholeheartedly.\u201d",
      "One veteran teammate said he\u2019s got full confidence that McCarthy will learn and improve quickly.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s built for that,\u201d wide receiver Adam Thielen said. \u201cI think that\u2019s why they fell in love with him in the draft process and why we all are so confident in him \u2014 because he\u2019s legitimately built for that. So it\u2019s going to be a process as a team, like it is every year.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- UCLA fired second-year football coach DeShaun Foster on Sunday after the school\u2019s first 0-3 start since 2019.",
      "Athletic director Martin Jarmond announced the move two days after the Bruins lost to New Mexico 35-10, their second straight loss to a Mountain West Conference opponent.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a decision I made lightly, but it was important to take decisive action,\u201d Jarmond said on a Zoom call with media. \u201cThis serves as a message to our fans that the results we\u2019ve seen so far are simply not acceptable.\u201d",
      "Tim Skipper will serve as interim coach for the rest of the season, which includes games against three highly ranked Big Ten Conference opponents. Skipper had been special assistant to Foster, and he served as Fresno State\u2019s interim coach last year.",
      "Foster was 5-10 since taking over the program from Chip Kelly in February 2024, after national signing day and relatively late in the recruiting process.",
      "\u201cI regret putting DeShaun in that position as we were going into the Big Ten,\" Jarmond said. \u201cGetting a start so late really disadvantaged the start of his coaching career.\u201d",
      "Last year, the Bruins finished 5-7 after a 1-5 start in the school\u2019s first season in the Big Ten. Foster had been the program\u2019s running backs coach from 2017-23 and added the title of associate head coach in 2023 before being promoted to the top job by Jarmond. Foster spent one season on the staff at Texas Tech.",
      "The Bruins were beaten by Utah in their opener and by UNLV a week ago. They trailed at halftime in all three losses, two of them coming at the Rose Bowl, where attendance was sparse and tarps are used to cover wide swaths of seating.",
      "Foster was asked Friday if he was still the person for the job, and he replied: \u201cMost definitely. Because I can get these boys to play.\u201d",
      "However, even the arrival of highly touted quarterback Nico Iamaleava via the transfer portal couldn't save Foster. The sophomore left Tennessee after leading the Volunteers to the College Football Playoff last season and didn't participate in spring camp.",
      "Iamaleava defended Foster after Friday's loss, saying: \u201cWe're not executing as players. It all falls back on the players.\u201d",
      "Iamaleava is among 55 new players in Westwood this season, along with eight new assistants. Over half the defensive line is made up of transfers.",

      "INDIANAPOLIS -- Denver Broncos coach Sean Payton sounded content to let others debate Sunday's leverage call against linebacker Dondrea Tillman.",
      "Payton wanted no part of it. And neither did the rest of the Broncos.",
      "Shortly after the Colts' Spencer Shrader missed a 60-yard field-goal try that would have won the game \u2014 only to redeem himself with a second chance from 15 yards closer because of the penalty \u2014 Payton and his players blamed themselves, not the officials, for Denver's 29-28 loss.",
      "\u201cYou go from feeling like you\u2019ve just escaped after our errors,\u201d said Bo Nix, who threw three touchdown passes in the first half. \u201cI always hate putting the game in the officials\u2019 hands. We gave them an opportunity, and they called it at the end. Sometimes, it just doesn\u2019t go your way.\u201d",
      "The leverage rule says a player can't use a teammate or opponent to vault himself into the air to try and block a kick.",
      "Regardless of Tillman's intent, that's how the officiating crew saw it.",
      "\u201cAs a defender, you're not allowed to place your hand on an opponent or a teammate and push off to propel yourself into the air to block a kick,\u201d referee Craig Wrolstad told a pool reporter. \u201cIn this case, No. 92 (Tillman) came across the line to the right guard and he puts his hand on the right guard and pushed off him to elevate himself in order to block the kick. You're not allowed to do that.\u201d",
      "There's bound to be plenty of chatter about whether the officials were right to penalize Tillman. But the Broncos certainly had plenty of chances to put away a game that featured only three punts \u2014 all by Denver.",
      "One scoring chance slipped away when Nix was picked off by Cam Bynum inside the Colts 10-yard line early in the fourth quarter. Another vanished when Broncos kicker Wil Lutz clanked a 42-yard field goal attempt off the right upright with 3:15 to go, setting up Indy's final drive.",
      "Denver went scoreless for the final 26 minutes, 15 seconds.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing. Every player has to look in the mirror and think of ways to help this team get better,\u201d right tackle Mike McGlinchey said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we should have lost this game. We had six or seven opportunities in the second half to put it away. But we didn\u2019t.\u201d",

In a Monday night game at Tampa Bay, Indy rallied from a 21-point deficit in the final five minutes to force overtime and won 38-35 when Mike Vanderjagt missed a medium-range field goal, only to get a second chance when Buccaneers defensive lineman Simeon Rice was called for leaping. The 15-yard penalty set up an easy, game-ending 29-yarder.",
      "This time, with the Colts needing a field goal to win, coach Shane Steichen played it conservatively.",
      "He ran the ball seven times on the eight plays preceding Spencer's first kick, and when Jonathan Taylor was tackled for a loss on third down, it meant Shrader's first attempt would come from 60 yards. His previous career long was 45 yards, and the franchise record of 58 has stood since 1962.",
      "When Shrader\u2019s first kick fell short, the Broncos celebrated \u2014 until they saw the flag.",
      "\u201cLook, we understand the rule,\u201d Payton said. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that to the long snapper. You can\u2019t grab and pull guys down. And you can\u2019t push off another player.\u201d",
      "And Shrader made the Broncos pay.",

      "Whether it\u2019s winning three Super Bowls or five NASCAR Cup Series championships, Joe Gibbs knows how to guide his teams to success through internal turmoil.",
      "So when Christopher Bell angrily called out his No. 20 crew last week for questionable strategy during a 24-race winless streak, Gibbs let the emotions run their course rather than step in to defuse the tension.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been on the sideline and heard some outbursts,\u201d Gibbs said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some outbursts in our competition meetings in racing. I\u2019ve learned when you\u2019re around sports, and things don\u2019t go your way, that\u2019s going to happen every now and then.",
      "\u201cI let them handle it. I really do.\u201d",
      "With his fourth victory this season, Bell reaffirmed Saturday night at Bristol Motor Speedway that that\u2019s a winning philosophy for Joe Gibbs Racing, which completed a first-round sweep of the NASCAR Cup Series playoffs at the Tennessee short track.",
      "Bell, Denny Hamlin and Chase Briscoe have won three consecutive races to stamp the team as the championship favorite. JGR\u2019s four Toyotas led a combined 757 of 1,107 laps in the first round of the playoffs, which were cut from 16 to 12 drivers at Bristol with seven races and three rounds remaining.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got fast cars right now,\u201d Gibbs said. \u201cI think it just says a lot for the way we feel back at the race shop. It\u2019s a big deal all the way across the board for us. It really means a lot.\u201d",
      "His hands-off approach won Cup titles with hot-tempered Tony Stewart and Kyle Busch. Bell is mild-mannered by comparison, so he made headlines with a vulgarity-filled tirade on his team radio for losing \u201cwith the best car every week\u201d after a seventh place at World Wide Technology Raceway.",
      "He had only praise Saturday for his team and crew chief Adam Stevens, who deftly managed Bell\u2019s pace and tactics over 500 hazardous laps at Bristol as many teams struggled with excessive tire wear on the 0.533-mile oval. Charging from fourth to first on a late restart, Bell led the final four laps and held off Brad Keselowski for his 13th career victory.",
      "\u201cWinning fixes everything, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Bell said. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge morale boost for the team and myself as a driver.",
      "\u201cI got really frustrated last week because we had an opportunity to win, and we didn\u2019t. We\u2019ve had several opportunities to win throughout the summer, and we didn\u2019t. Every week, we can do it, and while I was frustrated with the calls last week, Adam nailed every call this week. Tonight was just a perfect example of everybody doing the right things.\u201d",
      "Though Bell won the All-Star Race exhibition in May, Bristol marked his first Cup points victory since March. After a 31st-place crash in the Daytona 500 season opener, he won three consecutive races at Atlanta Motor Speedway, Circuit of the Americasand Phoenix Raceway, which will be the site of the Nov. 2 championship race.",
      "Stevens reminded his driver that the No. 20 Toyota often came close to winning during the drought.",
      "\u201cIt felt like a long time because we\u2019ve had such good speed between now and then,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cThat\u2019s inherently frustrating when you can\u2019t capitalize on it. The reasons why you\u2019re not capitalizing are probably week to week, and it just comes down to execution and qualifying a little better and having track position late in the races.",

      "NASCAR released an extra set of tires halfway through the race, which featured a season-high 14 caution flags and 137 laps run under the yellow \u2014 the most at Bristol since 167 caution laps in the July 25, 1965, race. Many incidents resulted from drivers misjudging gaps because of massive disparities in lap times with a less durable right-side tire whose speed diminished rapidly.",

      "There had been no issues with tire wear during Friday afternoon practice, which had crew chiefs such as Stevens strategizing for being able to run more than 100 laps on a set of rubber. But temperatures dropped into the low 60s Saturday night, and the conditions caused excessive wear after 30 laps. No driver went past 85 laps before pitting.",
      "\u201cI would have bet my house that it was going to be a normal Bristol race, but they\u2019re working hard to make the tires wear out,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cBy golly, I think they hit it this time. That was shocking. God help us all because if we\u2019re going to see this every week, that\u2019s going to shorten the careers of some people.\u201d",
      "After leading a career-high 201 laps, Ty Gibbs settled for 10th after botching his pit entry on a green-flag stop with 65 laps remaining. The grandson of team owner Joe Gibbs remained winless through 116 starts in the Cup Series.",
      "\u201cThis sport is really hard, and I keep telling him patience,\u201d Joe Gibbs said. \u201cTwo races ago, he said: \u2018Coach, will you quit using the word patience. I don\u2019t want you to use it ever again.\u2019 So patience is out the window. We\u2019re trying to win here. I just think he knows this is what he\u2019s wanted to do his entire life, and so he\u2019s after it.\u201d",
      "Despite four wins on road and street courses in the regular season, Shane van Gisbergen was eliminated in the first round with three consecutive finishes of 25th or worse. The Trackhouse Racing rookie, who is inexperienced on ovals after winning three championships in the Australian-based Supercars series, placed 26th at Bristol after spinning twice.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a privilege to be here but also pissed at myself,\u201d van Gisbergen said. \u201cThe last few weeks I just haven\u2019t been good enough. I\u2019ve been really doing well getting better at ovals, and I just haven\u2019t performed the last couple of weeks. I blame myself at the moment but thanks to the Trackhouse team, we\u2019ve had an awesome year.\u201d",

      "The overnight strike on the Kirishi refinery, in Russia's northwestern Leningrad region, follows weeks of Ukrainian attacks on Russian oil infrastructure that Kyiv says fuels Moscow\u2019s war effort.",
      "The facility, operated by Russian company Surgutneftegas, produces close to 17.7 million metric tons per year (355,000 barrels per day) of crude, and is one of Russia's top three by output.",
      "More than three years since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, drones continue to be a key weapon for both sides. Multiple Russian drones crossed into Poland on Wednesday, prompting NATO to send fighter jets to shoot them down and underlining long-held concerns that the fighting might spill over beyond Ukraine's borders.",
      "According to Ukraine\u2019s General Staff, explosions and a fire were reported at the Kirishi refinery. It posted a photo appearing to show a blaze and clouds of smoke against a night sky.",
      "Regional Gov. Alexander Drozdenko said that three drones were downed overnight in the Kirishi area, with falling debris sparking a fire at the facility. He said that no one was injured, and the blaze was put out.",
      "As of Sunday afternoon, Russian officials offered no further comment on the consequences of the strike, and it wasn't immediately possible to verify these. At least 80 Ukrainian drones were shot down overnight over Russia, the annexed Crimean Peninsula and the adjacent Sea of Azov, according to the Russian Defense Ministry.",
      "Ukrainian drones previously targeted the Kirishi refinery in March, causing minor damage, according to social media posts published at the time by Drozdenko.",
      "Russia remains the world\u2019s second-largest oil exporter, but a seasonal rise in demand and sustained Ukrainian drone strikes have caused gasoline shortages in recent weeks. Gas stations have run dry in some regions of the country, with motorists waiting in long lines and officials resorting to rationing or cutting off sales altogether.",
      "To try to ease the shortage, Russia has paused gasoline exports, with officials on Wednesday declaring a full ban until Sept. 30 and a partial ban affecting traders and intermediaries until Oct. 31.",
      "Also in the Leningrad region, a diesel locomotive was derailed during the night, local Gov. Drozdenko said Sunday. He said the incident occurred near Gatchina south of St. Petersburg. Russia's No. 2 city, which was known as Leningrad during Soviet times, is surrounded by but not included in the region of the same name.",
      "Drozdenko said the locomotive's driver was trapped in his cabin, and later died of his injuries while being transported to a hospital. He added an official investigation would check for signs of sabotage.",

      "Residents of Annob\u00f3n island in Equatorial Guinea have faced severe internet outages since complaining about dynamite explosions by a Moroccan construction company",
      "LAGOS, Nigeria -- When residents of Equatorial Guinea's Annob\u00f3n island wrote to the government in Malabo in July last year complaining about the dynamite explosions by a Moroccan construction company, they didn't expect the swift end to their internet access.",
      "Dozens of the signatories and residents were imprisoned for nearly a year, while internet access to the small island has been cut off since then, according to several residents and rights groups.",
      "Local residents interviewed by The Associated Press left the island in the past months, citing fear for their lives and the difficulty of life without internet.",
      "Banking services have shut down, hospital services for emergencies have been brought to a halt and residents say they rack up phone bills they can't afford because cellphone calls are the only way to communicate.",
      "When governments shut down the internet, they often instruct telecom providers to cut connections to designated locations or access to designated websites, although it's unclear exactly how the shutdown works in Annob\u00f3n.",
      "The internet shutdown remains in effect, residents confirmed alongside activists, at a moment when the Trump administration has considered loosening corruption sanctions on the country\u2019s vice president.",
      "The Moroccan company Somagec, which activists allege is linked to the president, confirmed the outage but denied having a hand in it. The AP could not confirm a link.",
      "\u201cThe current situation is extremely serious and worrying,\u201d one of the signatories who spent 11 months in prison said, speaking anonymously for fear of being targeted by the government.",
      "In addition to the internet shutdown, \"phone calls are heavily monitored, and speaking freely can pose a risk,\u201d said Macus Menejolea Taxijad, a resident who recently began living in exile.",
      "It is only the latest of repressive measures that the country has deployed to crush criticisms, including mass surveillance, according to a 2024 Amnesty International report.",
      "Equatorial Guinea, a former Spanish colony, is run by Africa\u2019s longest-serving president, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, who, at 83, has served as president for more than half his life. His son serves as the vice president and is accused of spending state funds on a lavish lifestyle. He was convicted of money laundering and embezzlement in France and sanctioned by the U.K.",
      "On Friday, the U.N.'s top court declined Equatorial Guinea's request for France to return a Paris-based mansion confiscated as part of a corruption probe, ruling that the African nation has not shown it has a \u201cplausible right to the return of the building.\u201d",
      "Despite the country\u2019s oil and gas wealth, at least 57% of its nearly 2 million people live in poverty, according to the World Bank. Officials, their families and their inner circle, meanwhile, live a life of luxury.",
      "The Equatorial Guinea government did not respond to the AP\u2019s inquiry about the island, its condition and internet access.",
      "Located in the Atlantic Ocean about 315 miles (507 kilometers) from Equatorial Guinea\u2019s coast, Annob\u00f3n is one of the country\u2019s poorest islands and one often at conflict with the central government. With a population of around 5,000 people, the island has been seeking independence from the country for years as it accuses the government of disregarding its residents.",
      "The internet shutdown is the latest in a long history of Malabo\u2019s repressive responses to the island\u2019s political and economic demands, activists say, citing regular arrests and the absence of adequate social amenities like schools and hospitals.",

      "A new airport that opened in Annob\u00f3n in 2013, which was built by Somagec, promised to connect the island to the rest of the country. But not much has improved, locals and activists say. The internet shutdown has instead worsened living conditions there, collapsing key infrastructure, including health care and banking services.",
      "In 2007, Equatorial Guinea entered into a business deal with Somagec, a Moroccan construction company that develops ports and electricity transmission systems across West and Central Africa.",
      "Annob\u00f3n's geological formation and volcanic past make the island rich in rocks and expands Malabo's influence in the Gulf of Guinea, which is abundantly rich in oil. Somagec has also built a port and, according to activists, explored mineral extraction in Annob\u00f3n since it began operations on the island.",
      "Residents and activists said the company's dynamite explosions in open quarries and construction activities have been polluting their farmlands and water supply. The company's work on the island continues.",
      "Residents hoped to pressure authorities to improve the situation with their complaint in July last year. Instead, Obiang then deployed a repressive tactic now common in Africa to cut off access to internet to clamp down on protests and criticisms.",

      "\u201cAfter having undertaken geotechnical and environmental impact studies, the current site where the quarry was opened was confirmed as the best place to meet all the criteria,\u201d Sahyoun said in an email.",
      "The residents, meanwhile, continue to suffer the internet shutdown, unable to use even the private satellite deployed by the company.",
      "\"Annob\u00f3n is very remote and far from the capital and the (rest of) continent,\" said Alicante, the activist from the island. \u201cSo you're leaving people there without access to the rest of the continent ... and incommunicado.\u201d",

      "Former Biden administration Health Secretary Xavier Becerra is embracing the popular short-video app to target Spanish-language users. His campaign and surveys note that Hispanic adults use TikTok in much higher numbers than Black and white adults.",
      "Congress last year passed a ban on TikTok, but President Joe Biden, who signed the bill into law and was Becerra's boss at the time, announced before leaving office that he wouldn't enforce it. After the Supreme Court ruled the ban constitutional, President Donald Trump suspended it on his first day in office to give the China-based company ByteDance time to find a new buyer.",
      "Trump, a Republican, had tried to ban dealings with ByteDance during his first term, but he joined the platform last year and has millions of followers. He has repeatedly extended the deadline for ByteDance to find a buyer and hinted occasionally that there was a deal in place, but without offering details. The White House started its own TikTok account last month.",
      "Becerra's new approach is part of an effort by Democrats to counter the rightward swing that was seen last year both in red states such as Texas and Florida and blue states such as California, New Jersey and New York, where Trump improved his numbers among Latinos.",
      "The idea is to lock in a key user base by pushing out content early on a platform politicians are still largely experimenting with. The effort comes when the Trump administration is phasing out multilingual services as part of the president's push to make English the official language of the United States.",
      "Candidates running in the 2025 elections in New Jersey and Virginia are already adapting their campaigns to appeal to Hispanics, who may have stayed away from the polls or voted for Trump based on his economic promises. But strategists say that it\u2019s still very much up for debate whether the trend will hold.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s critical to communicate in the language and on the platforms where voters spend their time and get their information,\u201d Becerra said in a statement.",
      "A 2024 Pew Research Center survey concluded that while TikTok has seen significant user growth in a short time, the demographics were different depending on race and ethnicity. Nearly half of Hispanic adults reported using it compared with 39% of Black adults and 28% of white adults.",
      "Becerra\u2019s campaign says it will push out a mix of videos with him speaking directly to the camera, policy explainers and behind-the-scenes clips from the campaign trail. It also plans to collaborate with influencers and publish videos created by supporters. All in Spanish.",

      "Many on social media have reminisced about seeing the giant Pacific octopus named Ghost when they had visited the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach. Some shared that they had a tattoo of Ghost or would wear a sweater emblazoned with the beloved cephalopod in her memory.",
      "\u201cShe is a wonderful octopus and has made an eight-armed impression on all of our hearts,\u201d the aquarium said on Instagram.",
      "Ghost laid eggs earlier this week and entered the last phase of her life cycle, known as senescence. During this period, the octopus will neglect her own basic needs like eating, instead focusing on protecting her eggs and aerating them to prevent bacteria or other harmful agents from growing on them.",

      "Ghost is originally from the waters of British Columbia, Canada, and arrived at the aquarium in May 2024 from a scientific collector. She was only 3 pounds (1.4 kilograms) then but now weighs more than 50 pounds (22.7 kilograms).",
      "The average giant Pacific octopus lives for three to five years. Ghost is estimated to be between two and four years old, Jaros said.",
      "Ghost was a \u201csuper active and very physical octopus\u201d who enjoyed spending time with humans, Jaros said.",

      "Freddy jolted Maere into action. He decided he needed to change his age-old tactics if he was to survive.",
      "He is now one of thousands of small-scale farmers in the southern African country using a generative AI chatbot designed by the non-profit Opportunity International for farming advice.",
      "The Malawi government is backing the project, having seen the agriculture-dependent nation hit recently by a series of cyclones and an El Ni\u00f1o-induced drought. Malawi\u2019s food crisis, which is largely down to the struggles of small-scale farmers, is a central issue for its national elections next week.",
      "More than 80% of Malawi's population of 21 million rely on agriculture for their livelihoods and the country has one of the highest poverty rates in the world, according to the World Bank.",
      "The AI chatbot suggested Maere grow potatoes last year alongside his staple corn and cassava to adjust to his changed soil. He followed the instructions to the letter, he said, and cultivated half a soccer field's worth of potatoes and made more than $800 in sales, turning around his and his children's fortunes.",
      "\u201cI managed to pay for their school fees without worries,\u201d he beamed.",
      "Artificial intelligence has the potential to uplift agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa, where an estimated 33-50 million smallholder farms like Maere's produce up to 70-80% of the food supply, according to the U.N.'s International Fund for Agricultural Development. Yet productivity in Africa \u2014 with the world's fast-growing population to feed \u2014 is lagging behind despite vast tracts of arable land.",
      "As AI's use surges across the globe, so it is helping African farmers access new information to identify crop diseases, forecast drought, design fertilizers to boost yields, and even locate an affordable tractor. Private investment in agriculture-related tech in sub-Saharan Africa went from $10 million in 2014 to $600 million in 2022, according to the World Bank.",
      "But not without challenges.",
      "Africa has hundreds of languages for AI tools to learn. Even then, few farmers have smartphones and many can't read. Electricity and internet service are patchy at best in rural areas, and often non-existent.",
      "\u201cOne of the biggest challenges to sustainable AI use in African agriculture is accessibility,\u201d said Daniel Mvalo, a Malawian technology specialist. \u201cMany tools fail to account for language diversity, low literacy and poor digital infrastructure.\u201d",
      "The AI tool in Malawi tries to do that. The app is called Ulangizi, which means advisor in the country's Chichewa language. It is WhatsApp-based and works in Chichewa and English. You can type or speak your question, and it replies with an audio or text response, said Richard Chongo, Opportunity International's country director for Malawi.",

      "As Big Tech\u2019s data centers continue to grow threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are considering bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- With the explosive growth of Big Tech's data centers threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are taking a hard look at a tough-love solution: bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies.",
      "Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.",
      "Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.",
      "Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.",
      "That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.",
      "Texas was first, but it won't be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,\u201d said Michael Weber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. \u201cData center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.\u201d",
      "That's because grids can't keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.",
      "Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.",
      "A proposal similar to Texas' has emerged from the nation's biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.",
      "The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs \u2014 likely for the biggest power users \u2014 to meet growing demand.",
      "The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast \u2014 twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data \u2014 and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.",
      "Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.",
      "\u201cData center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,\u201d said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.",
      "Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there's a power outage.",
      "Data center operators, however, say they hadn't anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.",
      "The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.",

      "That's caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.",
      "Many questioned PJM's legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.",
      "\u201cThis is particularly concerning given that states within PJM\u2019s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,\u201d the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.",
      "The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it's too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.",
      "Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won't lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a \u201cbring your own generation\u201d requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.",
      "In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.",
      "Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.",
      "However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.",
      "To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.",
      "It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.",
      "Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.",
      "But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.",
      "\u201cAnd the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?\" Silverman said. \"Or is there a better way to do it?\u201d",

      "Australia has approved a world-first vaccine to protect koalas from chlamydia",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- A regulator has approved a world-first vaccine to protect koalas from chlamydia infections, which are causing infertility and death in the iconic native species that is listed as endangered in parts of Australia.",
      "The single-dose vaccine was developed by the University of the Sunshine Coast in Queensland state after more than a decade of research led by professor of microbiology Peter Timms.",
      "The research showed the vaccine reduced the likelihood of koalas developing symptoms of chlamydia during breeding age and decreased mortality from the disease in wild populations by at least 65%.",
      "The recent approval by Australia\u2019s veterinary medicine regulator means the vaccine can now be used in wildlife hospitals, veterinary clinics and in the field to protect the nation\u2019s most at-risk koalas, Timms said on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cWe knew a single-dose vaccine \u2014 with no need for a booster \u2014 was the answer to reducing the rapid, devastating spread of this disease, which accounts for as much as half of koala deaths across all wild populations in Australia,\u201d Timms said in a statement.",
      "\u201cSome individual colonies are edging closer to local extinction every day, particularly in southeast Queensland and New South Wales, where infection rates within populations are often around 50% and in some cases can reach as high as 70%,\u201d\u202fTimms added.",
      "Deborah Tabart, chair of the conservation charity Australian Koala Foundation, said resources being spent on vaccinating koalas should be redirected at saving koala habitat.",
      "\u201cAt the risk of sounding flippant, how can anyone be so delusional as to think that you can vaccinate 100,000 animals? It\u2019s just ridiculous,\u201d Tabart said on Friday.",
      "Tabart\u2019s foundation estimates there are fewer than 100,000 koalas in the wild. The government-backed National Koala Monitoring Program estimated last year there were between 224,000 and 524,000 koalas.",
      "\u201cI accept that chlamydia is an issue for koalas, but I also want people to understand that they\u2019re sick because they haven\u2019t got any habitat,\u201d Tabart said.",

      "\u201cKoalas were at risk before chlamydia outbreaks, and they will remain at risk even if we manage chlamydia perfectly, because we keep on destroying their habitat,\u201d he added.",
      "Koalas are listed as endangered species in the states of Queensland and New South Wales and in the Australian Capital Territory, with habitat loss due to wildfires and urban expansion as the major threats. Chlamydia can cause urinary tract infections, infertility, blindness and death.",
      "Treatment with antibiotics can disrupt an infected koala\u2019s ability to digest eucalyptus leaves \u2014 its sole food source \u2014 leading to starvation, the university said in a statement.",

      "\u201cWe know that koalas need help to fight diseases like chlamydia. It\u2019s a widespread threat impacting their reproductive health and causing infertility,\u201d Watt said in a statement.",
      "Koalas are iconic Australian marsupials, like wombats and kangaroos. They spend most of their time eating and sleeping in eucalyptus trees, and their paws have two opposing thumbs to help them grasp and climb up tree trunks.",

      "High school and college educators say that student use of artificial intelligence has become so widespread that they need to rethink how to assign and assess students",
      "The book report is now a thing of the past. Take-home tests and essays are becoming obsolete.",
      "High school and college educators around the country say student use of artificial intelligence has become so prevalent that to assign writing outside of the classroom is like asking students to cheat.",
      "\u201cThe cheating is off the charts. It\u2019s the worst I\u2019ve seen in my entire career,\u201d says Casey Cuny, who has taught English for 23 years. Educators are no longer wondering if students will outsource schoolwork to AI chatbots. \u201cAnything you send home, you have to assume is being AI\u2019ed.\u201d",
      "The question now is how schools can adapt, because many of the teaching and assessment tools that have been used for generations are no longer effective. As AI technology rapidly improves and becomes more entwined with daily life, it is transforming how students learn and study, how teachers teach, and it\u2019s creating new confusion over what constitutes academic dishonesty.",
      "\u201cWe have to ask ourselves, what is cheating?\u201d says Cuny, a 2024 recipient of California\u2019s Teacher of the Year award. \u201cBecause I think the lines are getting blurred.\u201d",
      "Cuny\u2019s students at Valencia High School in southern California now do most writing in class. He monitors student laptop screens from his desktop, using software that lets him \u201clock down\u201d their screens or block access to certain sites. He\u2019s also integrating AI into his lessons and teaching students how to use AI as a study aid \u201cto get kids learning with AI instead of cheating with AI.\u201d",
      "In rural Oregon, high school teacher Kelly Gibson has made a similar shift to in-class writing. She is also incorporating more verbal assessments to have students talk through their understanding of assigned reading.",
      "\u201cI used to give a writing prompt and say, \u2018In two weeks I want a five-paragraph essay,\u2019\u201d says Gibson. \u201cThese days, I can\u2019t do that. That\u2019s almost begging teenagers to cheat.\u201d",
      "Take, for example, a once typical high school English assignment: Write an essay that explains the relevance of social class in \u201cThe Great Gatsby.\u201d Many students say their first instinct is now to ask ChatGPT for help \u201cbrainstorming.\u201d Within seconds, ChatGPT yields a list of essay ideas, plus examples and quotes to back them up. The chatbot ends by asking if it can do more: \u201cWould you like help writing any part of the essay? I can help you draft an introduction or outline a paragraph!\u201d",
      "Students say they often turn to AI with good intentions for things like research, editing or help reading difficult texts. But AI offers unprecedented temptation and it\u2019s sometimes hard to know where to draw the line.",
      "College sophomore Lily Brown, a psychology major at an East Coast liberal arts school, relies on ChatGPT to help outline essays because she struggles putting the pieces together herself. ChatGPT also helped her through a freshman philosophy class, where assigned reading \u201cfelt like a different language\u201d until she read AI summaries of the texts.",
      "\u201cSometimes I feel bad using ChatGPT to summarize reading, because I wonder is this cheating? Is helping me form outlines cheating? If I write an essay in my own words and ask how to improve it, or when it starts to edit my essay, is that cheating?\u201d",
      "Her class syllabi say things like: \u201cDon\u2019t use AI to write essays and to form thoughts,\u201d she says, but that leaves a lot of grey area. Students say they often shy away from asking teachers for clarity because admitting to any AI use could flag them as a cheater.",
      "Schools tend to leave AI policies to teachers, which often means that rules vary widely within the same school. Some educators, for example, welcome the use of Grammarly.com, an AI-powered writing assistant, to check grammar. Others forbid it, noting the tool also offers to rewrite sentences.",
      "\u201cWhether you can use AI or not, depends on each classroom. That can get confusing,\u201d says Valencia 11th grader Jolie Lahey, who credits Cuny with teaching her sophomore English class a variety of AI skills like how to upload study guides to ChatGPT and have the chatbot quiz them and then explain problems they got wrong.",
      "But this year, her teachers have strict \u201cNo AI\u201d policies. \u201cIt\u2019s such a helpful tool. And if we\u2019re not allowed to use it that just doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Lahey says. \u201cIt feels outdated.\u201d",

      "Many schools initially banned use of AI after ChatGPT launched in late 2022. But views on the role of artificial intelligence in education have shifted dramatically. The term \u201cAI literacy\u201d has become a buzzword of the back-to-school season, with a focus on how to balance the strengths of AI with its risks and challenges.",
      "Over the summer, several colleges and universities convened their AI task forces to draft more detailed guidelines or provide faculty with new instructions.",
      "The University of California, Berkeley emailed all faculty new AI guidance that instructs them to \u201cinclude a clear statement on their syllabus about course expectations\u201d around AI use. The guidance offered language for three sample syllabus statements \u2014 for courses that require AI, ban AI in and out of class, or allow some AI use.",
      "\u201cIn the absence of such a statement, students may be more likely to use these technologies inappropriately,\u201d the email said, stressing that AI is \u201ccreating new confusion about what might constitute legitimate methods for completing student work.\u201d",
      "At Carnegie Mellon University there has been a huge uptick in academic responsibility violations due to AI but often students aren\u2019t aware they\u2019ve done anything wrong, says Rebekah Fitzsimmons, chair of the AI faculty advising committee at the university\u2019s Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy.",
      "For example, one English language learner wrote an assignment in his native language and used DeepL, an AI-powered translation tool, to translate his work to English but didn\u2019t realize the platform also altered his language, which was flagged by an AI detector.",
      "Enforcing academic integrity policies has been complicated by AI, which is hard to detect and even harder to prove, said Fitzsimmons. Faculty are allowed flexibility when they believe a student has unintentionally crossed a line but are now more hesitant to point out violations because they don't want to accuse students unfairly, and students are worried that if they are falsely accused there is no way to prove their innocence.",
      "Over the summer, Fitzsimmons helped draft detailed new guidelines for students and faculty that strive to create more clarity. Faculty have been told that a blanket ban on AI \u201cis not a viable policy\u201d unless instructors make changes to the way they teach and assess students. A lot of faculty are doing away with take-home exams. Some have returned to pen and paper tests in class, she said, and others have moved to \u201cflipped classrooms,\u201d where homework is done in class.",
      "Emily DeJeu, who teaches communication courses at Carnegie Mellon\u2019s business school, has eliminated writing assignments as homework and replaced them with in-class quizzes done on laptops in \u201ca lockdown browser\u201d that blocks students from leaving the quiz screen.",
      "\u201cTo expect an 18-year-old to exercise great discipline is unreasonable, that\u2019s why it\u2019s up to instructors to put up guardrails.\u201d",

      "All rides will be provided for free for at least the first few months to help promote the existence of the service in the perennially popular travel destination. Once it begins charging for rides in Las Vegas, Zoox says its prices will be comparable to traditional taxis and ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft.",

      "They stressed that in-depth analysis is needed of the sample gathered there by Perseverance \u2014 ideally in labs on Earth \u2014 before reaching any conclusions.",
      "Roaming Mars since 2021, the rover cannot directly detect life. Instead, it carries a drill to penetrate rocks and tubes to hold the samples gathered from places judged most suitable for hosting life billions of years ago.

      "Either way, Hurowitz said it\u2019s the best, most compelling candidate yet in the rover\u2019s search for potential signs of long-ago life. It was the 25th sample gathered; the tally is now up to 30, with six more to go.",
      "\u201cIt would be amazing to be able to demonstrate conclusively that these features were formed by something that was alive on another planet billions of years ago, right?\" Hurowitz said.

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- A New Zealand court has rejected the latest bid by internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom to halt his deportation to the United States on charges related to his file-sharing website Megaupload.",
      "Dotcom had asked the High Court to review the legality of an official\u2019s August 2024 decision that he should be surrendered to the U.S. to face trial on charges of copyright infringement, money laundering and racketeering. It was the latest chapter in a protracted 13-year battle by the U.S. government to extradite the Finnish-German millionaire from New Zealand.",
      "The Megaupload founder had applied for what in New Zealand is called a judicial review, in which a judge is asked to evaluate whether an official's decision was lawful.",
      "A judge on Wednesday dismissed Dotcom's arguments that the decision to deport him was politically motivated and that he would face grossly disproportionate treatment in the U.S. In a written ruling, Justice Christine Grice also rejected Dotcom's claim that New Zealand's police were wrong to charge his business partners, but not him, under domestic laws \u2014 which likely yielded laxer sentences than if the men had been tried in the U.S.",
      "The latest decision could be challenged in the Court of Appeal, where a deadline for filing is Oct. 8. It wasn't immediately clear if Dotcom would do so.",
      "One of his lawyers, Ron Mansfield, told Radio New Zealand that Dotcom's team had \"much fight left in us as we seek to secure a fair outcome,\u201d but didn't elaborate further. Neither Dotcom nor Mansfield responded to a request for comment from The Associated Press on Thursday.",
      "New Zealand\u2019s government hasn\u2019t disclosed what will happen next in the extradition process or divulged an expected timeline for Dotcom to be surrendered to the United States.",
      "The saga stretches back to the January 2012 arrest by New Zealand authorities of Dotcom in a dramatic raid on his Auckland mansion along with other company officers at the request of the FBI. U.S. prosecutors said Megaupload raked in at least $175 million, mainly from people who used the site to illegally download songs, television shows and movies, before the FBI shut it down earlier that year.",
      "Lawyers for Dotcom and the others arrested argued that it was the users of the site, founded in 2005, who chose to pirate material, not its founders. But prosecutors said the men were the architects of a vast criminal enterprise, with the Department of Justice describing it as the largest criminal copyright case in U.S. history.",
      "He has been free on bail in New Zealand since February 2012.",
      "Dotcom and his business partners fought the FBI's efforts to extradite them for years, including by challenging New Zealand law enforcement's actions during the investigation and arrests. In 2021, however, New Zealand\u2019s Supreme Court ruled that Dotcom and two other men could be surrendered.",

      "Experts say a ship likely cut cables in the Red Sea, disrupting internet access in Africa, Asia and the Middle East",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- A ship likely cut cables in the Red Sea that disrupted internet access in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, experts said Tuesday, showing the lines' vulnerability over a year after another incident severed them.",
      "The International Cable Protection Committee told The Associated Press that 15 submarine cables pass through the narrow Bab el-Mandeb Strait, the southern mouth of the Red Sea that separates East Africa from the Arabian Peninsula.",
      "Over the weekend, authorities in multiple countries identified the cables affected as the South East Asia\u2013Middle East\u2013Western Europe 4, the India-Middle East-Western Europe and the FALCON GCX cables. On Tuesday, that list expanded to include the Europe India Gateway cable as well, said Doug Madory, director of internet analysis at the firm Kentik.",
      "Initial reporting suggested the cut happened off the coast of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, something authorities in the kingdom have not acknowledged, nor have the companies managing the cables.",
      "\u201cEarly independent analysis indicates that the probable cause of damage is commercial shipping activity in the region,\u201d John Wrottesley, the committee's operations manager, told the AP. \u201cDamage to submarine cables from dragged anchors account for approximately 30% of incidents each year representing around 60 faults.\u201d",
      "Madory also told the AP that the working assumption was a commercial vessel dropped its anchor and dragged it across the four cables, severing the connections. Cabling in the Red Sea can be at a shallow depth, making it easier for an anchor drag to affect them.",

      "Undersea cables are one of the backbones of the internet, along with satellite connections and land-based cables. Typically, internet service providers have multiple access points and reroute traffic if one fails.",
      "However, rerouting traffic can cause latency, or lag, for internet users. Madory said it appeared at least 10 nations in Africa, Asia and the Middle East had been affected by the cable cut. Among those nations were India, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.",
      "\u201cNobody\u2019s completely offline, but each provider has lost a subset of their international transit,\u201d Madory said. \"So if you imagine this is like an equivalent to plumbing and you lose some volume of water coming down the pipes ... and now you just have less volumes to carry the traffic.\u201d",
      "Cable security also has been a concern amid attacks by Yemen's Houthi rebels on ships over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. In early 2024, Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government in exile alleged that the Houthis planned to attack undersea cables. Several later were cut, possibly by a ship attacked by the Houthis dragging its anchor, but the rebels denied being responsible.",

So this is nothing new \u2014 in fact, I would say this is taken from the playbook, which is now very established, of trying to control social media narratives.\u201d",

Officials are calling for laws to to monitor social media and ensure both the users and operators are responsible and accountable for what they share. But the move has been criticized as a tool for censorship and punishing opponents who voice their protests online.",
      "\u201cGovernments absolutely have a valid interest in seeking to regulate social media platforms. This is such a daily part of our lives and in our business. And it is certainly reasonable for authorities to sit down and say we want to develop rules for the road,\u201d said Kian Vesteinsson, senior research analyst for technology and democracy at the Washington-based nonprofit Freedom House.",

      "It's not just Nepal. Freedom House has found that global internet freedom has declined for the 14th consecutive year in 2024, as governments crack down on dissent and people face arrest for expressing political, social or religious views online. While China consistently tops the list as the \u201cworld's worst environment\u201d for internet freedom, last year Myanmar shared this designation as well. The organization did not track Nepal.",
      "India passed a telecommunications law in 2023 that gave its government \u201cbroad powers to restrict online communications and intercept communications,\" according to Freedom House.

      "The Committee to Protect Journalists said Monday that the protests \u201cunderscore the widespread concerns over Nepal\u2019s ban on social media and the pressing need for the government to drop its order. Such a sweeping ban not only restricts freedom of expression, it also severely hinders journalists\u2019 work and the public\u2019s right to know.\u201d",
      "The crackdown appears to have spurred a surge in use of virtual private networks, or VPNs, according to Proton, which provides encrypted services. Signups for Proton\u2019s VPN service in Nepal have jumped by 8,000% since Sept. 3, according to data the company posted online.

      "\"This is a police chief's nightmare,\" said UVU's police chief.",
      "The fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk has put Utah Valley University (UVU) under scrutiny as security experts said the location of the stage for the outdoor event where the conservative commentator was targeted was particularly vulnerable, and questioned why no metal detectors were in place and bags seemingly were not checked.",
      "More than 3,000 people were on hand Wednesday as the 31-year-old Kirk, CEO and co-founder of the conservative grassroots organization Turning Point USA, spoke in an open-air courtyard on the Orem, Utah, campus, which is at the bottom of a bowl-shaped area surrounded by buildings, law enforcement officials said.",
      "A gunman fired the deadly shot at Kirk with a high-powered bolt-action rifle from the rooftop of a campus building a substantial distance from where Kirk was speaking, hitting him in the throat, officials said.",
      "The suspect in the shooting, identified as 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, was arrested on Friday night after his father recognized him from surveillance images and video released by investigators, authorities said.",
      "\"This is a police chief's nightmare,\" Chief Jeff Long of the Utah Valley University campus police department said at a news conference on Wednesday.",
      "Witnesses told ABC News that the event was not just open to the students on campus, but to the general public as well.",
      "Long said he worked with Kirk's private security team to establish security protocols for the event, which was the first stop on a nationwide tour of college campuses Kirk launched, called The American Comeback Tour.",
      "\"We worked together. He has his team and they do this all over the country. We all know that. It's not uncommon for them. They're very comfortable on campuses. And I was coordinating with his lead security guy,\" Long said.",
      "Turning Point USA did not respond to an ABC News request for comment.",
      "Long said six campus police officers were working the event, including some in plainclothes who were monitoring the crowd.",
      "\"We train for these things, and you think you have things covered, and these things, unfortunately, they happen,\" Long said. \"You try to get your bases covered and, unfortunately, today [Wednesday] we didn't. Because of that, we have this tragic incident.\"",
      "But multiple witnesses who attended the event told ABC News there seemed to be little to no security at all.",
      "\"We walked in, we were kind of surprised because there was like no security check. They didn't check us for IDs. They didn't pat us down. You just walked in,\" Jasmine Martinez, a mother of five, told ABC News on Thursday.",
      "Justin Hicken, who also attended the event, said he, too, was surprised by the seeming lack of security.",
      "\"I just followed the crowd into some of the campus buildings and ... once you made your way through the campus buildings, it opens up into a courtyard where the stage or the amphitheater drops down like a pit,\" Hicken told ABC News, adding that he also was not scrutinized by any security when he arrived at the free event.",
      "He said that while the crowd was mostly comprised of college-aged people, \"There were people of all ages there.\"",
      "\"There were elderly people with walkers, there were children, there were families. It was a big group,\" Hicken said. \"I would say it was probably about 97% or 98% pro-Charlie. There were a few people you could tell were in opposition to him being there but for the most part, it was a very pro-Charlie crowd.\"",
      "Before the event, an online petition was circulated asking school officials to prevent Kirk from speaking on the UVU campus. The petition stated in part that \"Charlie Kirk is known for his divisive rhetoric that often supports policies and laws which aren't inclusive and can marginalize various communities.\" The petition gathered more than 900 signatures.",

As a public institution, UVU upholds First Amendment rights and fosters an environment where ideas \u2013 popular or controversial \u2013 can be exchanged freely, energetically, and civilly.\"",
      "However, Don Mihalek, a retired senior special agent for the U.S. Secret Service and an ABC News contributor, questioned the location of the stage with roofs of buildings surrounding the area where Kirk was shot, given that President Donald Trump was shot at a July 13, 2024, campaign rally at an outdoor venue in Butler, Pennsylvania, by a man who fired from rooftop 400 feet from where Trump was speaking.",
      "Investigators said the gunman who shot Kirk fired an older model imported Mauser .30-06 caliber bolt-action rifle from the roof of a building and appeared to have a clear line of sight to where Kirk was seated under a shade canopy more than 100 yards away.",
      "\"The location of the event was in the middle of a college quad, it sounds like, which was surrounded by tall buildings, which present line-of-sight issues,\" Mihalek said.",
      "Mihalek added, \"In my view, in this day and age, you can't not do proper advanced planning for an event, especially an outdoor event, and take into account all the standard security measures for an event.\"",
      "Mihalek said pre-planning for possible security issues, including access control to the event, line-of-sight issues and monitoring of the crowd, \"all has to be baked into the event planning process.\"",
      "Robert Boyce, the retired chief of detectives for the New York Police Department and an ABC News contributor, said that from a security standpoint, the outdoor venue should have never been chosen for an event featuring such a controversial speaker.",
      "Boyce further said that the venue for the event shouldn\u2019t have been outdoors.",
      "\"For a controversial person speaking in any way, with any kind of petition, any outside threats we don't know right now, you really can't have it outside,\" Boyce said. \"You have to have a door to control and that's important, especially in these times. We're really at a different point in our history that's really hard to believe. But you want to control that door. This way, you know who's inside and you can walk around and see and identify anybody who's acting out of sorts.\"",
      "Boyce also questioned why the event was opened to the general public.",
      "\"It's inexplicable to me why a university would let outside people come in and watch this on their campus, and that has to be answered,\" Boyce said.",
      "In response to the questions raised about the security plan for the event, a university spokesperson told ABC News, \"I\u2019m not able to answer those specifics at this time.\"",
      "The university spokesperson directed ABC News to a page on the school's website answering some frequently asked questions about the Charlie Kirk event. Under the question \"What security measures were taken?\" the website states \"Kirk\u2019s lead security staff coordinated with UVU Police Chief Jeff Long regarding the security measures,\" echoing Chief Long's statement during the Sept. 10 news conference.",
      "The website page also said that Kirk had previously visited the school with Turning Point USA in 2019.",
      "The Utah Board of Higher Education \u2013 the governing body for the Utah System of Higher Education, which is comprised of 16 public colleges and universities, including UVU \u2013 issued a statement last week, saying it will \"continue working with state leaders to identify ways to keep our campuses safe and welcoming for everyone.\"",
      "The statement added, \"We believe strongly that Utah\u2019s campuses must remain places where individuals can share and debate differing viewpoints openly and respectfully. Attempts to diminish that freedom have no place here and we will continue working to ensure our students, faculty and visitors feel safe to express themselves.\"",

      "Residents of Santiago de Compostela are struggling with overtourism",
      "SANTIAGO DE COMPOSTELA, Spain -- While some Barcelona residents sought to repel a tsunami of tourists with plastic water pistols, a neighborhood association in Santiago de Compostela opted for a friendlier approach: a guide to good manners for visitors to their town, the endpoint of the Catholic world's most famous pilgrimage.",
      "Translated into several languages, the group posted it throughout the northwestern Spanish city and distributed it at its ever-growing number of hostels. It reminded tourists to keep noise down, respect traffic rules and use plastic protectors on hiking poles to avoid damaging the narrow cobblestone streets, among other things.",
      "To little avail, it would seem. Large groups still take over the streets singing hymns, bikes ride in the wrong direction and metal pole tips clatter against the ground. Santiago's social media is awash with photos denouncing a lack of decorum.",
      "Tourists' greater offense, though, stems from their sheer numbers; the old town and squares surrounding the cathedral holding the reputed tomb of Saint James the Apostle \u2014 and that was the center of town life for a millennium \u2014 today are almost exclusively the domain of outsiders, whose influx has served to expel residents. This dynamic has left Santiago emerging as the latest global destination where longtime residents have grown embittered by the overtourism transforming their community.",
      "\u201cWe do not have tourism-phobia. We have always lived in harmony with tourism, but when it gets out of hand, when the pressure goes beyond what is reasonable, that is when rejection arises,\u201d said Roberto Almu\u00ed\u00f1a, president of the neighborhood association in the old town that's a UNESCO World Heritage site.",
      "The \u201cCamino de Santiago,\u201d known in English as the Way of St. James, dates back to the 9th century, with pilgrims following its converging trails for up to hundreds of kilometers on paths originating in Portugal and France. The modern popularity it gained with the 2010 film \u201cThe Way\u201d starring Martin Sheen was turbocharged more recently by social media and experience-driven travel after the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "Last year, a record half-million people signed up to trek one of the approved routes to the cathedral \u2014 equal to five times the city\u2019s resident population, and marking a 725-fold increase over the last four decades. Added to those masses are ordinary tourists not arriving by trail.",
      "The proliferation of short-term rentals drove annual rent prices up 44% from 2018 to 2023, according to a study commissioned by the city council to the Fundaci\u00f3n Universidade da Coru\u00f1a. That led municipal authorities in May to request the regional government classify the area as a high-pressure zone, like Barcelona or San Sebastian, which would help to limit rent increases.",
      "Already, last November, Santiago's city council enacted a ban on Airbnb-style tourist accommodations in the historic center, arguing at the time in a statement that it was \u201ca necessity arising from its significant growth, which has clear effects on the number of housing units available for residents and on their price.\u201d",
      "Sihara P\u00e9rez, a researcher at the University of Santiago, described finding anywhere to rent in the city as \u201cmission impossible,\u201d while Antonio Jerem\u00edas, 27, told The Associated Press that he's considering moving back in with his mother, because his salary working full-time at a warehouse isn\u2019t enough to make ends meet.",
      "Andrea Dopazo, 32, tried to move out of her parents\u2019 house in a neighborhood located fully 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the city center. But her desire to continue living in the place where she grew up and community ties are strong proved futile, and she had to take something in a town outside Santiago.",
      "\u201cThe only people who have been able to stay in the neighborhoods are those who have been lucky \u2014 or unlucky \u2014 enough to inherit an apartment from their grandparents, uncles or parents,\u201d said Dopazo, who works in human resources.",

      "In the old town, tourists can stay in small hotels in former homes or huge hostels converted from former seminaries, which aren\u2019t subject to the ban. But in the hustle to cash in, some short-term rentals are apparently flouting the restriction, evidenced by tenants collecting keys from lockboxes hung outside buildings.",
      "\u201cSome follow the rules and others don\u2019t, but this is the model that is really limiting residential housing,\u201d said Montse Vilar, from another neighborhood group, Xuntanza.",
      "Santiago\u2019s City Hall told The Associated Press in a statement that it is \u201cdoing everything in its power to enforce the regulations\u201d and that it takes action whenever it detects a case of an illegal apartment housing tourists.",
      "Between 2000 and 2020, the historic center lost about half its permanent population, now reduced to just 3,000 residents who \u201cresist like the Gauls\u201d behind buildings' thick stone facades, Almu\u00ed\u00f1a said. There are no hardware stores or newsstands left, and just one bakery. A couple grocery stores coexist with cafes, ice cream parlors and souvenir shops.",
      "\u201cThe city has emptied out. You only have to take a walk to see that all we've got are closed, abandoned buildings that are falling apart,\u201d Almu\u00ed\u00f1a added.",
      "This year, the number of pilgrims reaching Santiago is on track to set another record. The surge is further souring Santiago's residents on their city's tourism-centric economic model; already half of them rejected it as of 2023, up from just over one-quarter a decade earlier, according to a study conducted by Rede Galabra, a research group focused on cultural studies at the University of Santiago.",
      "Even some of the pilgrims are noting a shift, like Spaniards \u00c1lvaro Casta\u00f1o and Ale Osteso who met on the route four years ago and have returned every year since.",
      "\u201cThe Camino is becoming more and more known, many more people are coming,\u201d Osteso said one recent morning at the end of their trek, among tour groups of pilgrims in bright, color-coordinated outfits and families snapping pictures. \u201cSpirituality seems to have been a little lost at times.\u201d",

      "Each year during Hispanic Heritage Month, huge celebrations can be expected across the U",
      "Each year during Hispanic Heritage Month, huge celebrations can be expected across the U.S. to showcase the diversity and culture of Hispanic people.",
      "This year, the Trump administration's immigration crackdowns, a federally led English-only initiative and an anti-diversity, equity and inclusion push have changed the national climate in which these celebrations occur. Organizers across the country, from Massachusetts and North Carolina to California and Washington state, have postponed or canceled heritage month festivals altogether.",
      "Celebrated each year from Sept. 15 to Oct. 15, the month is a chance for many in the U.S. to learn about and celebrate the contributions of Hispanic cultures, the country\u2019s fastest-growing racial or ethnic minority, according to the U.S. Census. The group includes people whose ancestors come from Spain, Mexico, the Caribbean and Central and South America.",
      "More than 68 million people identify as ethnically Hispanic in the U.S., according to the latest census estimates.",
      "Before there was National Hispanic Heritage Month, there was Hispanic Heritage Week, which was created through legislation sponsored by Mexican American U.S. Rep Edward R. Roybal of Los Angeles and signed into law in 1968 by President Lyndon B. Johnson.",
      "The weeklong commemoration was expanded to a month two decades later, with legislation signed into law by President Ronald Reagan.",
      "\u201cIt was clustered around big celebrations for the community,\u201d Alberto Lammers, director of communications at the UCLA Latino Policy and Politics Institute said. \u201cIt became a chance for people to know Hispanic cultures, for Latinos to get to know a community better and for the American public to understand a little better the long history of Latinos in the U.S.\u201d",
      "Sept. 15 was chosen as the starting point to coincide with the anniversary of \u201cEl Grito de Dolores,\u201d or the \u201cCry of Dolores,\u201d which was issued in 1810 from a town in Mexico that launched the country\u2019s war for independence from Spain.",
      "The Central American nations of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica celebrate their independence on Sept. 15 and Mexico marks its national day on Sept. 16, the day after the cry for independence.",
      "Also during National Hispanic Heritage Month, the South American nation of Chile observes its independence day on Sept. 18.",
      "The White House so far has not mentioned any planned events. Last year, President Joe Biden hosted a reception and issued a proclamation for the occasion.",
      "Hispanic was a term coined by the federal government for people descended from Spanish-speaking cultures. But for some, the label has a connotation of political conservatism and emphasizes a connection to Spain. It sometimes gets mistakenly interchanged with \u201cLatino\u201d or \"Latinx.\u201d",
      "For some, Latino reflects their ties to Latin America. So some celebrations are referred to as Latinx or Latin Heritage Month.",
      "Latin Americans are not a monolith. There are several other identifiers for Latin Americans, depending largely on personal preference. Mexican Americans who grew up during the 1960s Civil Rights era may identify as Chicano. Other may go by their family\u2019s nation of origin such as Colombian American or Salvadoran American.",
      "Each culture has unique differences when it comes to music, food, art and other cultural touchstones.",
      "September typically has no shortage of festivities. Events often include traditional Latin foods and entertainment like mariachi bands, folkl\u00f3rico and salsa dance lessons. The intent is to showcase the culture of Mexico, Puerto Rico, Venezuela and other Latin countries.",

      "A new date has not yet been announced. Though Mexican Independence Day falls on Sept. 16, celebrations in Chicago typically span more than a week and draw hundreds of thousands of participants for lively parades, festivals, street parties and car caravans.",
      "\u201cThe fact that the federal government is sending troops as we start these celebrations is an insult,\u201d Illinois state Sen. Karina Villa, a Democrat, said at a news conference. \u201cIt is a fear tactic. It\u2019s unforgivable.\u201d",
      "Similarly, Sacramento's annual Mexican Independence Day festival was canceled with organizers citing the political climate and safety concerns.",

      "With the Taliban barring women from college in her native Afghanistan, Bahara Saghari set her sights on pursuing higher education in the United States.",
      "Saghari, 21, practiced English up to eight hours per day for several years, eventually winning an offer to study business administration at a private liberal arts college in Illinois. She was hoping to arrive this fall, but her plans were derailed again, this time by President Donald Trump's travel ban.",
      "\u201cYou think that finally you are going to your dream, and then something came up and like, everything\u2019s just gone,\u201d Saghari said.",
      "Thousands of students are among the people affected by the Trump administration's travel ban and restrictions on citizens from 19 countries, including many who now feel stranded after investing considerable time and money to come to the U.S.",
      "Some would-be international students are not showing up on American campuses this fall despite offers of admission because of logjams with visa applications, which the Trump administration slowed this summer while it rolled out additional vetting. Others have had second thoughts because of the administration's wider immigration crackdown and the abrupt termination of some students' legal status.",
      "But none face bigger obstacles than the students hit with travel bans. Last year, the State Department issued more than 5,700 F-1 and J-1 visas \u2014 which are used by foreign students and researchers \u2014 to people in the 19 travel ban-affected countries between May and September. Citizens of Iran and Myanmar were issued more than half of the approved visas.",
      "Pouya Karami, a 17-year-old student from Shiraz, Iran, focused his college search entirely on the U.S. No other country offers the same research opportunities in science, he said. He was planning to study polymer chemistry this fall at Pittsburg State University in Kansas, but he had to shelve those plans because of the travel ban.",
      "Karami deferred admission until next year and is holding out hope. He is still preparing for his embassy interview and reaching out to U.S. politicians to reconsider the travel ban's restrictions on students.",
      "\u201cI'm doing everything I can about it,\u201d he said.",
      "The full travel ban affects citizens from 12 countries spanning Africa, Asia, the Middle East and the Caribbean. It blocks most people from obtaining new visas, although some citizens from the banned countries are exempt, such as green card holders, dual citizens and some athletes. Seven other countries have tighter restrictions that also apply to student visas.",
      "When Trump announced the travel ban in June, he cited high visa overstay rates and national security threats from unstable or adversarial foreign governments as reasons for putting countries on the list. He has called some of the countries\u2019 screening processes \u201cdeficient\u201d and said he plans to keep the ban in place until \u201cidentified inadequacies\u201d are addressed.",
      "In Myanmar, the family of one 18-year-old student made his education their top priority, saving paychecks for him to go abroad for college. They risked their stability so he could have the chance to live a better life, said the student, who asked to be identified by only his nickname, Gu Gu, because he is worried about being targeted by the Myanmar or U.S. government for expressing criticism.",
      "When he shared a screenshot of his acceptance letter to the University of South Florida in a family group chat, it exploded with celebratory emojis, Gu Gu said. He had been waiting for visa appointments to be announced when one night, his mother woke him to ask about news of a U.S. travel ban. In an instant, his plans to study at USF this fall were ruined.",
      "Many students his age in Myanmar have been drafted into the military or joined resistance groups since the military ousted the elected civilian government in 2021. While a civil war rages, he had been looking forward to simple freedoms in the U.S. like walking to school by himself or playing sports again.",

      "ATLANTA -- A popular museum in Atlanta is expanding at a critical moment in the United States \u2014 and unlike the Smithsonian Institution, the National Center for Civil and Human Rights is privately funded, putting it beyond the immediate reach of Trump administration efforts to control what Americans learn about their history.",
      "The monthslong renovation, which cost nearly $60 million, adds six new galleries as well as classrooms and interactive experiences, changing a relatively static museum into a dynamic place where people are encouraged to take action supporting civil and human rights, racial justice and the future of democracy, said Jill Savitt, the center's president and CEO.",
      "The center has stayed active ahead of its Nov. 8 reopening through K-12 education programs that include more than 300 online lesson plans; a LGBTQ+ Institute; training in diversity, equity and inclusion; human rights training for law enforcement; and its Truth & Transformation Initiative to spread awareness about forced labor, racial terror and other historic injustices.",
      "These are the same aspects of American history, culture and society that the Trump administration is seeking to dismantle.",
      "Dreamed up by civil rights icons Evelyn Lowery and Andrew Young, the center opened in 2014 on land donated by the Coca-Cola Company, next to the Georgia Aquarium and The World of Coca-Cola, and became a major tourist attraction. But ticket sales declined after the pandemic.",
      "Now the center hopes to attract more repeat visitors with immersive experiences like \u201cChange Agent Adventure,\u201d aimed at children under 12. These \u201cchange agents\u201d will be asked to pledge to something \u2014 no matter how small \u2014 that \u201creflects the responsibility of each of us to play a role in the world: To have empathy. To call for justice. To be fair, be kind. And that\u2019s the ethos of this gallery,\u201d Savitt said. It opens next April.",
      "\u201cI think advocacy and change-making is kind of addictive. It\u2019s contagious,\" Savitt explained. \"When you do something, you see the success of it, you really want to do more. And our desire here is to whet the appetite of kids to see that they can be involved. They can do it.\u201d",
      "This ethos is sharply different from the idea that young people can't handle the truth and must be protected from unpleasant challenges but, Savitt said, \"the history that we tell here is the most inspirational history.\"",
      "\"In fact, I think it\u2019s what makes America great. It is something to be patriotically proud of. The way activists over time have worked together through nonviolence and changed democracy to expand human freedom \u2014 there\u2019s nothing more American and nothing greater than that. That is the lesson that we teach here,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cBroken Promises,\u201d opening in December, includes exhibits from the post-Civil War Reconstruction era, cut short when white mobs sought to brutally reverse advances by formerly enslaved people. \u201cWe want to start orienting you in the conversation that we believe we all kind of see, but we don\u2019t say it outright: Progress. Backlash. Progress. Backlash. And that pattern that has been in our country since enslavement,\u201d said its curator, Kama Pierce.",
      "On display will be a Georgia historical marker from the site of the 1918 lynching of Mary Turner, pockmarked repeatedly with bullets, that Turner descendants donated to keep it from being vandalized again.",

Bernice King. \u201cWe wanted to lift up King's role as a man, as a human being, not just as an icon,\u201d Savitt explained.",

      "\u201cThe research says that if you tell people things are really bad and how awful they are, you motivate people for a minute, and then apathy sets in because it\u2019s too hard to do anything,\" Savitt said. \"But if you give people something to hope for that\u2019s positive, that they can see themselves doing, you're more likely to cultivate a sense of agency in people.\u201d",
      "And doubling in capacity is an experience many can't forget: Joining a 1960s sit-in against segregation.

      "The center's expansion was seeded by Home Depot co-founder and Atlanta philanthropist Arthur M.

      "LAHAINA, Hawaii -- Mia Palacio felt like she lost a piece of herself when wildfires destroyed her hometown of Lahaina.",
      "She isolated from loved ones after the 2023 disaster while struggling to process the grief, often angry that her family didn't have a permanent place to stay and that so many others were unable to evacuate.",
      "Moving between high schools, she never felt welcome, Palacio said, and the pain only intensified as the months wore on. Finally, near the first anniversary of the fires, Palacio reached out for help.",
      "Hundreds of students like Palacio have struggled mentally since the fires \u2013 and not all have received the help they need.",
      "The Hawaii Department of Education estimates more than a third of Maui students lost a family member, sustained a serious injury or had a parent lose a job after the fires, which killed 102 people and damaged more than 3,300 properties in Lahaina.",

      "AP is collaborating with Honolulu Civil Beat, CalMatters, Blue Ridge Public Radio, and Centro de Periodismo Investigativo in Puerto Rico to examine how school communities are recovering from the disruption of natural disasters.",
      "____",
      "Two years later, many in Lahaina are ready to return to normal. But therapists say students\u2019 mental health challenges continue to mount.",
      "That\u2019s common after a disaster, especially at the two-year mark, when adrenaline wears off and stress remains high, said Christopher Knightsbridge, one of several researchers at the University of Hawaii who has studied the well-being of Lahaina fire survivors. While kids may feel numb immediately following a disaster, after two years, they\u2019re facing the toll of constant uncertainty and change, he said.",
      "It\u2019s a phenomenon seen wherever schooling has been disrupted by natural disasters, reporting by Honolulu Civil Beat, The Associated Press and several other news outlets shows. But a couple years after the disaster, schools are not always prepared with extra mental health supports.",
      "On Maui, the island is dealing with an ongoing shortage of specialists. In the past few years, the number of psychiatrists serving youth has dropped from four to two, even as demand has grown.",
      "\u201cThe crisis isn\u2019t over,\u201d Knightsbridge said.",

      "Two years in, many kids still wrestle with depression and anxiety.",
      "DayJahiah Valdivia, a senior at K\u012bhei Charter School, said her stress levels spike when there are strong winds or small brush fires. Valdivia lives in Upcountry Maui, which also faced wildfires that burned over a thousand acres of land on the same day as the 2023 Lahaina fires. Her home was spared, but it took months for her family to return because their property was covered in soot and needed professional cleaning.",
      "She feels less anxious now that her family members have discussed their escape plan for future disasters. But a summer fire near a friend\u2019s home in Central Maui renewed her fears about her loved ones\u2019 safety.",
      "\u201cThe anxiety never really wore off,\u201d she said. On windy days, it was especially difficult to concentrate in class or feel safe.",
      "In a University of Hawaii study of fire survivors conducted in 2024, just over half of children reported symptoms of depression, and 30% were likely facing an anxiety disorder. Nearly half of kids in the study, ages 10 to 17, were experiencing PTSD.",
      "Children in disaster-torn towns across the U.S. can relate.",
      "In Paradise, California, where the 2018 Camp Fire took 85 lives, a protracted period of disillusionment followed what some called the \u201chero phase,\u201d when the community pulled together and vowed to resurrect their town. Both Lahaina and Paradise had housing shortages after their fires, so families had to move away or live with friends to go to school or work in the area. In general, students who don\u2019t have a permanent living arrangement tend to struggle more academically and have more behavioral challenges, research shows.",
      "Many Paradise students still struggle with anxiety and grief, seven years later, making it difficult to fully engage in school. A year after the Camp Fire, 17% of students were homeless, and the suspension rate was 7.4%, compared to 2.5% statewide. The suspension rate remained nearly triple the state average last year, and more than 26% were chronically absent.",
      "Aryah Berkowitz, who lost her home, two dogs and her family\u2019s business in the Paradise blaze, dealt with lingering behavioral challenges following the disaster. For nearly a year afterward, her family of seven, plus a pair of surviving pit bull-Labrador mixes, lived with a friend in nearby Chico, sharing two bedrooms and a bathroom. Berkowitz, then in sixth grade, slept on the couch.",
      "\u201cI was having to help my family a lot and wasn\u2019t able to handle it,\u201d said Berkowitz , once a high-achieving student who was suspended twice after the fire. \u201cI was holding it inside and took it out on other people. Some days I\u2019d just walk out of class.\u201d",

      "Some have struggled to retain class material or simply stopped attending in-person classes as they moved between hotel rooms and temporary housing, Lahainaluna High teacher Jarrett Chapin said. A few moved to online learning as their families faced continued instability.",
      "\u201cThey just sort of vanished,\u201d Chapin said.",
      "Maui has long dealt with medical workforce challenges. Even before the fires, it faced a shortage of mental health professionals because they struggled with the state\u2019s high cost of living and housing shortage.",
      "The fires brought burnout and greater economic obstacles, only exacerbating the issue. Since then, Hawaii\u2019s education department has tried to bulk up Maui\u2019s mental health staff by bringing in providers from neighbor islands and the mainland and, more recently, using a $2 million federal grant to support students.",
      "But hiring mental health staff has been so difficult that even the federal money hasn\u2019t made much of a dent. In the first nine months of the grant, the state education department primarily used the money to bus displaced students from other parts of the island to Lahaina schools.",
      "The state has used the money to hire five part-time mental health providers working with students and staff, including one specialist who works in the evenings with students living as boarders on Lahainaluna\u2019s campus, said Kimberly Lessard, a Department of Education district specialist.",
      "Two of the six behavioral health specialist positions in Lahaina schools remained unfilled this summer, as they have been for years due to Maui\u2019s housing shortage and high cost of living, Lessard said.",
      "Valdivia, who still struggles with anxiety from the Upcountry Maui fires, has seen the impacts of the provider shortage firsthand. She\u2019s on a two- to three-month waiting list to see a psychiatrist on Maui, and she\u2019s seeing an O\u02bbahu-based therapist via telehealth because there aren\u2019t enough providers who can meet with her in person.",
      "\u201cEven just to get evaluated (by a psychiatrist), it\u2019s literally months,\u201d she said. \u201cI just think that\u2019s crazy.\u201d",

      "In Puerto Rico, which has suffered from a series of disasters since Hurricane Maria struck in 2017, students have experienced high rates of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.",
      "Yet despite legislation in 2000 to create more school psychologist positions, it wasn\u2019t until the pandemic that the commonwealth\u2019s Education Department dedicated money to hire them. Today, there are 58 vacancies across the archipelago\u2019s 870 schools.",
      "The school psychologists \u201ccan\u2019t keep up,\u201d said Nellie Zambrana, a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Puerto Rico at R\u00edo Piedras. Those who are working are overstretched, according to a study by the university\u2019s Psychological Research Institute. One psychologist, the study said, was assigned to more than 100 students at three schools.",
      "Loren Lapow wasn\u2019t deterred by the storm clouds gathering one June afternoon over D.T. Fleming Beach on Maui. The social worker helped teens carry an inflatable paddleboard to the water\u2019s edge, cheering them on as they swam.",
      "Amid the fun, Lapow directed the teens to reflect on their fears and losses. He asked them how they feel when they smell smoke or think about Lahaina\u2019s famed Front Street, most of which was destroyed in the blaze.",
      "\u201cPlaces are like a friend to us,\u201d Lapow said. \u201cWhen you lose places, it hurts.\u201d",
      "Lapow founded the Maui Hero Project, which his website describes as \u201cadventure-based counseling services.\u201d The eight-week program Lapow started 25 years ago teaches teens basic disaster preparedness skills and immerses them in outdoor activities. It's also a form of mental health support, which Lapow has leaned into since the wildfires.",
      "Lapow\u2019s approach has become a common strategy for nonprofits and therapists trying to reach kids who have balked at discussing their mental health since the fires. But those efforts don't always reach the kids who need the most help.",
      "There\u2019s a strong stigma around seeking mental health services, particularly in Filipino and Latino communities that make up a large portion of Lahaina\u2019s population, said Ruben Juarez, a professor at University of Hawaii who led the research study on fire survivors. Families may see counseling as a sign of weakness, and children may be reluctant to open up to therapists out of fear of being judged or scrutinized, he added.",
      "Yet in the study, Latino teens reported the highest rates of severe depressive and PTSD symptoms. Filipino teens reported some of the highest rates of anxiety.",
      "The state is hoping struggling students will open up to their peers. A new program called YouthLine will train Hawaii teens to respond to crisis calls, said Keli Acquaro, who oversees youth mental health for the state.",
      "Keakealani Cashman, who graduated from Kamehameha Schools Maui in 2024, is hoping to be part of the state\u2019s solution to provide more mental health support to the next generation of children.",
      "After losing her home to the fires, Cashman spent her senior year talking to Native Hawaiian practitioners and researching how cultural values, such as connections to the land and her ancestors, could help her community heal from the trauma of the fires. The project helped her own mental health improve, said Cashman, who regularly met with her school\u2019s behavioral health specialist.",
      "Now, Cashman is entering her second year at Brigham Young University Hawaii and hopes to work as a behavioral health specialist in Hawaiian language immersion schools",
      "\u201cThis horrible, horrible thing happened to me and my family, but I don\u2019t have to let it kill the rest of my life,\u201d Cashman said. \u201cI can really help my family, my community in school, and just make an impact in what I know how to do.\u201d",

Even so, officials said Robinson had recently grown more political and expressed negative views about Kirk.",
      "There was other initial evidence of Robinson's potential influences. According to court papers, he carved taunting phrases into his ammunition \u2014 including one bullet casing marked with \u201cHey, fascist! Catch!\u201d \u2014 and others from the irony-laden world of memes and online video games.",
      "Experts say political assassins don\u2019t always fall into neatly sorted partisan categories. In some cases, like that of Thomas Mathew Crooks, who shot Trump at a Pennsylvania campaign rally last year, there is little record of any political stances whatsoever. The FBI has said Crooks also had researched then-President Joe Biden as a possible attack target.",
      "Bruce Hoffman, who studies terrorism at Georgetown University, noted that the FBI has created a new category, Nihilistic Violent Extremism, to track the increasing number of attacks that seem to have no clear political motivation.",
      "\u201cExtremism is becoming a salad bowl of ideologies where you can pick whatever you want,\u201d Hoffman said, adding that the increasing number of lone wolf attacks means violence is increasingly unmoored from organizations with clear political goals.",
      "What\u2019s more important than the attackers\u2019 state of mind, experts stressed, is the broader political environment. The more heated the atmosphere, the more likely it\u2019ll lead unstable people to commit violence.",
      "\u201cWhat they all share is a political ecosystem that\u2019s very permissive about violence towards political rivals,\u201d Arie Perlinger, a professor of security studies at the University of Massachusetts-Lowell, said of recent perpetrators of political violence. \u201cBecause politicians are incentivized to use extreme rhetoric and extreme language, that leads to demonization of political rivals.\u201d",
      "Pete Buttigieg, a former Democratic presidential candidate who engages frequently with the right on Fox News and other forums, sees social media as a fever swamp driving the demonization and danger.",
      "\u201cMany people around America, normal people, not dangerous people, were at a moment when we all should have still been praying for the victim and his family,\u201d he said Sunday on NBC's \u201cMeet the Press.\" Instead they were \u201cbusy online praying for some shred of evidence that the shooter would turn out to be from the other political team. That is not healthy.\u201d",
      "That certainly happened after the Kirk killing. The 31-year-old father of two young children was an icon on the new, populist right, especially among young conservatives, and a key ally of Trump. While some conservatives called for calm, others, such as conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and podcaster and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, called for \u201cwar.\u201d",
      "In a speech on the House floor on Thursday, Rep. Mary Miller, an Illinois Republican, said Kirk\u2019s \u201cdeath was not an isolated tragedy. It is part of a disturbing trend in political violence in our country, encouraged by the radical left and amplified by a corrupt media that has gone from being fake to totally evil.\u201d",

      "Hoffman said that in modern history, the right has been responsible for more political attacks on people than the left. He said that\u2019s because left-wing radicals are more likely to target property rather than people, and because the extreme right boasts organizations such as militias.",
      "He added that after Trump pardoned more than 1,500 people convicted of crimes during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol to overturn his election loss, \u201cthere\u2019s a belief in certain quarters that, if you engage in violence, the slate can be wiped clean.\u201d",

      "BACKSTORY: Trump spent weeks talking up renaming the Defense Department, saying that, back when the U.S. had a War Department, it \u201cjust sounded better.\u201d The War Department was created by George Washington in 1789, but abolished as part of the National Security Act of 1947, which created the National Military Establishment instead. Two years later, Congress amended that and changed the name to the Department of Defense. Trump recently sought to change the name himself via an executive order. Lawmakers will still need to approve making that permanent and official, however.",
      "WHERE IT STANDS: Still talking about it.",
      "BACKSTORY: Trump posted in August about a list of people he helped choose for the center\u2019s annual awards: \u201cGREAT Nominees for the TRUMP/KENNEDY CENTER, whoops, I mean, KENNEDY CENTER, AWARDS.\u201d He subsequently said, during an Oval Office event, \u201cSome people refer to it as the Trump Kennedy Center, but we\u2019re not prepared to do that quite yet. Maybe in a week or so.\u201d A GOP-backed congressional effort would rename the center after Trump and its opera house after first lady Melania Trump. But a full renaming may ultimately prove more likely than Trump\u2019s name simply being added to the existing building alongside Kennedy. The 1964 act that renamed the National Cultural Center in Washington in honor of John F. Kennedy stated that, after Dec. 2, 1983, \u201cno additional memorials or plaques in the nature of memorials shall be designated or installed\u201d \u2014 which would seemingly bar just tacking \u201cTrump\u201d up beside the existing namesake in the center's public spaces.",
      "WHERE IT STANDS: Faded away.",
      "BACKSTORY: Trump has been on all sides of the issue. He posted before retaking the White House that the GOP would work to eliminate daylight saving time. In March, he said that setting clocks back and forward was a 50-50 issue, and was therefore too hard for him to take a firm position on. The following month, the president posted online that he actually supported making daylight saving time permanent. The Senate passed a measure do just that in 2022, but it stalled in the House. Legislation reviving that effort has been introduced, but not advanced.",
      "WHERE IT STANDS: Coming soon \u2014 though not quite how it was promised.",
      "BACKSTORY: Trump is famously a Diet Coke fan. But that made his sudden announcement in July that Coca-Cola had agreed to use real cane sugar in its flagship product in the U.S. all the more surprising. The company soon confirmed that such a version was indeed coming, but would be a new product added to the company's line \u2014 not a change encompassing all domestic Cokes. Still, the promised change is notable given that U.S. Coke had been sweetened with high fructose corn syrup since the 1980s, even as Coke from Mexico and some other countries continued to use cane sugar. \u201cThis will be a very good move,\u201d Trump said. \"You\u2019ll see.

      "BACKGROUND: While threatening to impose steep tariffs on U.S. trading partners around the globe, Trump said in April that such import tariffs \"will be enough to cut all of the income tax.\u201d The president has since championed passage of the sweeping tax legislation. It included around $4.5 trillion in tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the rich, but fell well short of wiping out federal income taxes entirely. That hasn\u2019t stopped Trump from continuing to assert that the country was its wealthiest near the end of the Gilded Age, when the government relied heavily on tariffs for revenue and there was no federal income tax. Still, he's lately been less quick to suggest the U.S. is on its way back to such policies.",
      "WHERE IT STANDS: Still talking about it \u2014 but misstating what happened.",
      "BACKGROUND: Trump and top administration officials have repeatedly suggested that the tax package approved by Congress wipes out taxes paid on Social Security benefits. But it doesn\u2019t. The law has a temporary tax deduction for people 65 and older that applies to all income, not just Social Security. And not all Social Security beneficiaries can claim it. Indeed, Republicans used a congressional process known as budget reconciliation to pass the measure without the 60-vote threshold normally needed to block a filibuster from opponents \u2014 and the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 restricts budget reconciliation bills from making major changes to Social Security.",
      "WHERE IT STANDS: In limbo.",
      "BACKSTORY: Trump has long talked of offering $5 million \u201c gold cards \u201d to give \u201cvery high-level people\u201d a \u201croute to citizenship\u201d while granting foreigners visas to live and work in the U.S. In April, the president even held up a gold card featuring his name and picture, and said they would be available in \u201cless than two weeks, probably.\u201d Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick subsequently bragged about having personally sold 1,000 of them. Despite that hype, there has been no major effort by the administration to overhaul the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program, which Congress created in 1990 to offer U.S. visas to investors who spend about $1 million on a company that employs at least 10 people.",
      "WHERE IT STANDS: Political off-ramp found.",
      "BACKGROUND: Trump promised while campaigning for reelection that he\u2019d ensure in vitro fertilization was fully paid for by either the government or insurance companies. In February, Trump signed an executive order that called for studying ways to reduce the cost of IVF treatment. But the order gave no deadline for when such policy recommendations need to be completed and what might happen once they are ready is even murkier.",
      "WHERE IT STANDS: Still talking about it.",
      "BACKGROUND: Even though Trump boasted while still a candidate that he\u2019d could end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine in 24 hours, fighting rages on. The president undermined international efforts to isolate Vladimir Putin by hosting him in Alaska on Aug. 15, yet came away with no agreement to ease fighting \u2014 and has since been unable to broker a promised meeting between Russia\u2019s leader and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. In the meantime, Trump's face-to-face with Putin appears to have bought Moscow breathing room, since major economic sanctions that Trump had threatened against Russia haven't materialized. Trump has continued to say since that he's frustrated with Putin while insisting there may still be \u201csevere consequences\u201d if Russia doesn\u2019t begin showing it\u2019s serious about peace. But, so far, it's been lots of threats without follow through.",

      "High school and college educators around the country say student use of artificial intelligence has become so prevalent that to assign writing outside of the classroom is like asking students to cheat.",
      "\u201cThe cheating is off the charts. It\u2019s the worst I\u2019ve seen in my entire career,\u201d says Casey Cuny, who has taught English for 23 years. Educators are no longer wondering if students will outsource schoolwork to AI chatbots. \u201cAnything you send home, you have to assume is being AI\u2019ed.\u201d",
      "The question now is how schools can adapt, because many of the teaching and assessment tools that have been used for generations are no longer effective. As AI technology rapidly improves and becomes more entwined with daily life, it is transforming how students learn and study, how teachers teach, and it\u2019s creating new confusion over what constitutes academic dishonesty.",
      "\u201cWe have to ask ourselves, what is cheating?\u201d says Cuny, a 2024 recipient of California\u2019s Teacher of the Year award. \u201cBecause I think the lines are getting blurred.\u201d",

The chatbot ends by asking if it can do more: \u201cWould you like help writing any part of the essay? I can help you draft an introduction or outline a paragraph!\u201d",
      "Students say they often turn to AI with good intentions for things like research, editing or help reading difficult texts. But AI offers unprecedented temptation and it\u2019s sometimes hard to know where to draw the line.",
      "College sophomore Lily Brown, a psychology major at an East Coast liberal arts school, relies on ChatGPT to help outline essays because she struggles putting the pieces together herself.

      "\u201cSometimes I feel bad using ChatGPT to summarize reading, because I wonder is this cheating? Is helping me form outlines cheating? If I write an essay in my own words and ask how to improve it, or when it starts to edit my essay, is that cheating?\u201d",
      "Her class syllabi say things like: \u201cDon\u2019t use AI to write essays and to form thoughts,\u201d she says, but that leaves a lot of grey area. Students say they often shy away from asking teachers for clarity because admitting to any AI use could flag them as a cheater.",
      "Schools tend to leave AI policies to teachers, which often means that rules vary widely within the same school. Some educators, for example, welcome the use of Grammarly.com, an AI-powered writing assistant, to check grammar. Others forbid it, noting the tool also offers to rewrite sentences.",
      "\u201cWhether you can use AI or not, depends on each classroom. That can get confusing,\u201d says Valencia 11th grader Jolie Lahey, who credits Cuny with teaching her sophomore English class a variety of AI skills like how to upload study guides to ChatGPT and have the chatbot quiz them and then explain problems they got wrong.",

      "Enforcing academic integrity policies has been complicated by AI, which is hard to detect and even harder to prove, said Fitzsimmons. Faculty are allowed flexibility when they believe a student has unintentionally crossed a line but are now more hesitant to point out violations because they don't want to accuse students unfairly, and students are worried that if they are falsely accused there is no way to prove their innocence.",
      "Over the summer, Fitzsimmons helped draft detailed new guidelines for students and faculty that strive to create more clarity.

      "Morgan County Superior Court Judge Stephen Bradley, in a ruling filed Friday, said that the two lawsuits where the government agencies were seeking fees were far from frivolous, and that awarding legal fees to the government could make it harder for regular citizens to exercise their rights to challenge government actions in court.",
      "\u201cNo truly aggrieved citizen should be prohibited from suing to test the legality or constitutionality of the government\u2019s claims, and any precedent that could allow political actions and costs to be offloaded to complaining litigants would be untenable,\" Bradley wrote.",

      "After Koreans detained in a historic raid on a Georgia Hyundai plant were sent home, lawyers and social workers say the nearly 200 non-Korean workers ensnared in the crackdown remain in legal limbo",
      "Ever since a massive immigration raid on a Hyundai manufacturing site swept up nearly 500 workers in southeast Georgia, Rosie Harrison said her organization\u2019s phones have been ringing nonstop with panicked families in need of help.",
      "\u201cWe have individuals returning calls every day, but the list doesn\u2019t end,\u201d Harrison said. She runs an apolitical non-profit called Grow Initiative that connects low-income families \u2014 immigrant and non-immigrant alike \u2014 with food, housing and educational resources.",
      "Since the raid, Harrison said, \u201cfamilies are experiencing a new level of crisis.\u201d",
      "A majority of the 475 people who were detained in the workplace raid \u2014 which U.S. officials have called the largest in two decades \u2014 were Korean and have returned to South Korea. But lawyers and social workers say many of the non-Korean immigrants ensnared in the crackdown remain in legal limbo or are otherwise unaccounted for.",
      "As the raid began the morning of Sept. 4, workers almost immediately started calling Migrant Equity Southeast, a local nonprofit that connects immigrants with legal and financial resources. The small organization of approximately 15 employees fielded calls regarding people from Mexico, Guatemala, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador and Venezuela, spokesperson Vanessa Contreras said.",
      "Throughout the day, people described federal agents taking cellphones from workers and putting them in long lines, Contreras said. Some workers hid for hours to avoid capture, in air ducts or remote areas of the sprawling property. The Department of Justice said some hid in a nearby sewage pond.",
      "People off-site called the organization frantically seeking the whereabouts of loved ones who worked at the plant and were suddenly unreachable.",
      "Like many of the Koreans who were working at the plant, advocates and lawyers representing the non-Korean workers caught up in the raid say that some who were detained had legal authorization to work in the United States.",
      "Neither the Department of Homeland Security nor Immigration and Customs Enforcement responded to emailed requests for comment Friday. It is not clear how many people detained during the raid remain in custody.",
      "Atlanta-based attorney Charles Kuck, who represents both Korean and non-Korean workers who were detained, said two of his clients were legally working under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which was created by former President Barack Obama. One had been released and \u201cshould have never been arrested,\u201d he said, while the other was still being held because he was recently charged with driving under the influence.",
      "Another of Kuck's clients was in the process of seeking asylum, he said, and had the same documents and job as her husband who was not arrested.",

      "Some even had valid Georgia driver's licenses, which aren't available to people in the country illegally, said Rosario Palacios, who has been assisting Migrant Equity Southeast. Some families who called the organization were left without access to transportation because the person who had been detained was the only one who could drive.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say how they chose who they were going to release and who they were going to take into custody,\u201d Palacios said, adding that some who were arrested didn\u2019t have an alien identification number and were still unaccounted for.",
      "Kuck said the raid is an indication of how far-reaching the crackdown by President Donald Trump's administration is, despite assurances that they are targeting criminals.",
      "\u201cThe redefinition of the word \u2018criminal\u2019 to include everybody who is not a citizen, and even some that are, is the problem here,\u201d Kuck said.",
      "Many of the families who called Harrison's initiative said their detained relatives were the sole breadwinners in the household, leaving them desperate for basics like baby formula and food.",
      "The financial impact of the raid at the construction site for a battery factory that will be operated by HL-GA Battery Co. was compounded by the fact that another massive employer in the area \u2014 International Paper Co. \u2014 is closing at the end of the month, laying off another 800 workers, Harrison said.",
      "Growth Initiative doesn\u2019t check immigration status, Harrison said, but almost all families who have reached out to her have said that their detained loved ones had legal authorization to work in the United States, leaving many confused about why their relative was taken into custody in the first place.",

      "It also comes a week after a federal appellate court panel, in a separate environmental lawsuit, allowed operations to continue at the detention center by putting on hold a lower court's preliminary injunction ordering the facility to wind down by the end of October. A third federal lawsuit challenging practices at the facility claims immigration is a federal issue and Florida agencies and the private contractors hired by the state have no authority to operate the facility.",

      "The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed doing away with a program that has required large, mostly industrial polluters to report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions to the government",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday proposed doing away with a program that has required large, mostly industrial polluters to report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions to the government.",
      "The program requires refineries, power plants, oil wells and landfills to report their emissions without risk of penalty as officials seek to identify high-polluting facilities and develop policies to lower emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Experts say the reporting held the companies publicly accountable for their emissions.",
      "Since the program began in 2009, U.S. industry has collectively reported a 20% drop in carbon emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal-fired power plants.",
      "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program \u201cburdensome\u201d and unhelpful to improving human health and the environment.",
      "Removing the rule would save American businesses up to $2.4 billion in regulatory costs over 10 years while maintaining the agency\u2019s statutory obligations under the Clean Air Act, Zeldin said. If finalized, the proposal would remove reporting obligations for most large industrial facilities in the United States, as well as fuel and industrial gas suppliers and carbon dioxide injection sites.",
      "\u201cThe Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,\u201d Zeldin said in a statement.",
      "\u201cIt costs American businesses and manufacturing billions of dollars, driving up the cost of living, jeopardizing our nation\u2019s prosperity and hurting American communities,'' he said. \"With this proposal, we show once again that fulfilling EPA\u2019s statutory obligations and Powering the Great American Comeback is not a binary choice.''",
      "But experts say dropping the requirement \u2014 as Zeldin promised in March when he unleashed what he called the greatest day of deregulation in U.S. history \u2014 risks a big increase in emissions, since companies would no longer be publicly accountable for what they discharge into the air. And they say losing the data \u2014 at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere \u2014 would make it tougher to fight climate change.",
      "Joseph Goffman, who led EPA's Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden, said eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program \u201cblinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution. Without it, policymakers, businesses and communities cannot make sound decisions about how to cut emissions and protect public health.\u201d",

      "David Doniger, a senior strategist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, called the proposal \u201ca cynical effort to keep the American public in the dark, because if they don\u2019t know who the polluters are, they can\u2019t do anything to hold them responsible.\"",
      "Big polluters may want to keep their climate pollution secret, he added, but the public, states and local policymakers \u201chave depended on this data\" for more than 15 years. Public accountability and pushback from investors have led many companies to reduce their climate pollution even before EPA sets stricter standards, Doniger said.",
      "But Zeldin said reducing the overall regulatory burden on U.S. industry will allow companies to \u201cfocus compliance expenditures on actual, tangible environmental benefits.\u201d",
      "The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program covers 47 source categories and requires more than 8,000 facilities and suppliers in the U.S. to calculate their greenhouse gas emissions annually, Zeldin said.",
      "\"Following a careful review, EPA proposed that there is no requirement under (the Clean Air Act) to collect GHG emission information from businesses, nor is continuing the ongoing costly data collection useful to fulfill any of the agency\u2019s statutory obligations,'' he said.",

      "HRW noted specifically the state execution of journalist Turki Al-Jasser, who was killed in June following seven years of detention after reportedly being identified as the author of several anonymous tweets criticizing the Saudi royal family.",
      "Al-Jasser had been convicted of terrorism and high treason on the basis of posts he was accused of authoring, according to UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay. Reporters Without Borders, an organization that works to protect journalists, branded the charges against him as \"false.\"",
      "\"This execution of a journalist went forward to very little international criticism and this is clearly a result of these billions that had been invested in the country's whitewashing strategy,\" Shea said.",
      "When asked whether they believed the comedians would be able to freely tell jokes at the festival, the HRW researcher predicted there would be clear red lines drawn by organizers to prevent any criticism of Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman, who has already taken over as ruler of the highly conservative Islamic kingdom, as well as his policies and the broader royal family.",
      "Shea called on the high-profile entertainers attending the event \u2014 funding for which comes from the Saudi government's General Entertainment Authority \u2014   to mitigate the positive effect that their presence might have on the country's reputation for human rights abuses, including by \"speaking out about the abuses.\"",
      "Tom Dillon, one of the comedians scheduled to perform at the Riyadh festival, claimed on his podcast that he's being paid $315,000 for a single show, and that some of his more famous colleagues would receive around $1.6 million for their appearances.",
      "CBS News has contacted the publicists representing billed attendees Bill Burr, Mark Normand, Kevin Hart, Sebastian Maniscalco, Dave Chapelle, Louis C.K., Whitney Cummings, Tom Segura, Andrew Schulz and Jim Jeffries, but has received no comment from any of them regarding their expected appearances in Saudi Arabia.",
      "CBS News asked Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs for comment on HRW's assertions, but has not received a response.",
      "One of the highest-profile cases of the Saudis' purported efforts to change their image came in 2021, with the launch of LIV Golf, a golf league that saw seasoned professionals defect from the famed PGA Tour in exchange for highly profitable contracts.",
      "Critics accused the golfers of helping the Saudi government to \"sportswash\" its reputation, only three years after Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, an outspoken critic of the county's leadership, was brutally murdered inside a Saudi diplomatic office in Istanbul, Turkey.",
      "A CIA report concluded with a medium to high degree of confidence that the killing was likely carried out at bin Salman's orders.",
      "In a 2019 interview with CBS' 60 Minutes, bin Salman denied ordering Khashoggi's assassination, but said he took responsibility for it.",

    "summary": "Now showing at Chicago's Art Institute, an exhibition of works by Gustave Caillebotte offers a fresh perspective on a French painter ripe for rediscovery.",
    "story": [
      "Monet \u2026 Degas \u2026 Renoir. When we think of French Impressionism, it's the usual suspects who spring to mind. But one lesser-known artist is ripe for rediscovery.",
      "\"Gustave Caillebotte is probably the least-known of the Impressionist painters,\" said Gloria Groom, co-curator of a new exhibition of the works of Caillebotte, now on display at the Art Institute of Chicago. \"I think he's still not completely integrated into that story. He's still kind of the outsider.\"",
      "The museum has long been home to the artist's most recognizable painting, \"Paris Street - Rainy Day.\"",
      "\"People, they may not know Gustave Caillebotte's name, but if you say the painting with the umbrellas, they all know it,\" said Groom. \"And so you start thinking, okay, it's all about this bourgeois couple walking down the street. But it's not, because there's a painter with a ladder, the charwoman who's opening her umbrella, all these different types of people.\"",
      "\"Paris Street - Rainy Day\" played a supporting role in the beloved movie \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\". While it was out on loan, museum-goers were bereft. \"We got letters,\" said Groom. \"But you can't be part of an exhibition to be a partner if you don't lend the major work for the exhibition. So, we made that sacrifice. And now we're celebrating its return.\"",
      "The exhibition looks at Caillebotte's work from a new perspective. While his peers were painting ballerinas and landscapes, Caillebotte's canvases focused on men to a degree unusual for the time.",
      "Groom said, \"He's looking at the men in his life, he's looking at the relationships. But he's not just doing, you know, macho masculinity. He's doing men in interiors, men on sofas, men looking out a window, kind of turning the tables in many ways.\"",
      "Some of the paintings scandalized the French art establishment. \"The Floor Scrapers\" was rejected from a prestigious art exhibition.",
      "And, at another exhibition, a painting featuring a nude man was relegated to a small, inaccessible room. \"It's a male nude, but not an Adonis,\" said Groom. \"It's shocking even today. It's a beautiful, beautiful painting, and it's sensuous. Let's face it, it's sensuous!\"",
      "When this exhibition opened in Paris last year with the title \"Painting Men,\" some critics condemned what they considered the show's insinuation of Caillebotte's homosexuality. The artist never married, but shared the last decade or so of his life with a female companion.",
      "But the show moved on to Chicago with a new title \u2013 \"Painting His World\" \u2013 which has others saying the changed title minimizes the artist's focus on the same sex.",
      "Gloria Groom says, quite simply, the paintings speak for themselves: \"The paintings are the paintings, and that's what we're interested in. We try to open it up to all kinds of interpretations, and people will see what they want to see.\"",
      "Gustave Caillebotte died in 1894. He was just 45. All these decades later, people are still seeing what they want to in his beguiling artistry.",

    "summary": "The actor-comedian talks about his new horror film \"Him,\" in which he plays an aging football superstar tempting a rookie quarterback with an evil bargain, and how he learned to turn personal loss into dramatic power.",
    "story": [
      "Just a stone's throw from the concert halls of New York's Lincoln Center is another place where creative dreams come true: LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, a launching pad for the most talented teens in New York. Liza Minnelli studied here; so did Billy Dee Williams, Jennifer Aniston, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, and Adrien Brody. \"A two-time Oscar-winner, look at that!\" said Brody's former classmate, Marlon Wayans, Class of 1990. \"Makes me so proud. We used to give him wedgies!\"",
      "As an actor, writer and producer, Wayans is behind some of the best-loved projects in recent memory, like the \"Scary Movie\" franchise, a comic satire of horror films. There have been five \"Scary\" movies (some without the Wayans brothers), but they're back at the helm for the upcoming #6 next year.",
      "And when he's not making movies, Marlon Wayans tours on the live stand-up comedy circuit. He also turns out streaming comedy specials like clockwork. \"Probably a year that I had a day off,\" he said. \"Probably three years since I had a vacation.\"",
      "I asked, \"What are you chasing?\"",
      "\"I don't know if I'm chasing, or if I'm running from something!\" he laughed. And for his latest role, he had to do both.",
      "In the new psychological horror film \"Him,\" a rookie quarterback (played by Tyriq Withers) wants to be the greatest. Marlon Wayans is an aging football superstar who's going to help him. At first he's a likeable coach, but he morphs into a something evil.",
      "Is he the Devil in this film? \"No, I think I'm just one of the people that the Devil uses to entice the people who sell their soul,\" Wayans said.",
      "To watch a trailer for the film \"Him,\" click on the video player below:",
      "The notion of trading your soul for athletic immortality is one of the all-time great storylines. You might recall \"Damn Yankees,\" with a hopeful fan striking a deal with the Devil. And as the Devil's advocate in \"Him,\" Wayans' character puts the rookie quarterback through hell. \"The movie seems like, 'Oh, you're selling your soul to the Devil.' The Devil exists every day, everywhere,\" Wayans said. \"At least 20 times a day you are gonna be faced with God or the Devil. So, it's a choice. Everything you do is a choice.\"",
      "It's a big change for someone raised on comedy. Marlon Wayans is the youngest of 10 siblings, in the comedy dynasty known as the Wayans family. He often worked with his brothers, like when he teamed up with Shawn as an undercover FBI agent in the 2004 cult favorite \"White Chicks.\"",
      "Family is still the bedrock of Wayans' life, and the passing of some close relatives and friends over the past few years hit especially hard, as he described in his 2024 special \"Good Grief\":",
      "\"I've been dodging depression for the last three years. I lost my momma three years ago. And let me tell you y'all something, ain't no pain, ain't no nothing like losing your momma.\"",
      "I asked, \"Do you think losing all these people in such a short span of time, that pain, informs your acting?\"",
      "\"Yes, because I used to have to manufacture tears,\" Marlon said. \"My mother died ... it's all I gotta think about. It's right there. It's right behind my eyes. I don't need 20 minutes to go think about stuff no more.\"",
      "Wayans has learned how to turn personal loss into dramatic power. He was told he was the only one considered for his role in \"Him,\" a sign that his time may have finally come.",
      "He said, \"It took me doing the work for 53 years to feel special.\"",
      "\"You didn't feel special?\" I asked.",
      "\"I felt like I was working towards something.\"",
      "\"And now you feel like that something is here?\"",
      "\"I feel like it's never there, but it's getting closer,\" he replied.",
      "To date, Marlon Wayans' movies alone are said to have grossed nearly $2 billion, and there are more on the way. But he says he'll never forget LaGuardia, the unique school where it all started. \"I'll always love this city, and I'll always love this school. This is my baby for life. I hope these kids know how good they got it.\"",
      "He almost didn't get to go. His father didn't want him to attend. \"Nah, my dad, he was super-religious, and he was kind of a homophobe; he didn't want me wearing tights! 'Cause you have to wear tights when you come to this school.\"",
      "The late LaGuardia drama teacher Peter Treitler gave him permission to wear sweatpants instead, a little thing that changed Marlon's life forever.",
      "Mr. Treitler's words are still alive in Marlon's heart: \"He said, 'I'll make a deal with you: If you go to this school, you work harder than anybody else here, and you be special.' Young people need people that believe in them and see they're great. But young people gotta do the work so they can see they're great.\"",
      "\"Well, that's the thing, is you took that and ran with it,\" I said.",
      "Wayans replied, \"I'm still running with it.\"",

      "In 2010, their namesake label, Veronica Beard, was born, along with its now-iconic Dickey Jacket. The early days were anything but glamorous. Swanson Beard set up a makeshift showroom in her apartment, juggling young children and a dog, while Miele Beard announced mid-launch that she was pregnant with her fifth child. Between the two, they had eight children and a fledgling business.",
      "Their breakthrough came with Saks Fifth Avenue, which gave the brand its first major retail platform. From there, Veronica Beard rapidly grew, and today boasts 42 stores worldwide, including a flagship location on Madison Avenue in New York City.",
      "\"It was the most thrilling moment of our career,\" Swanson Beard said of the store opening. \"It was the physical manifestation of all of our hopes and dreams.\"",
      "Fifteen years later, the brand has evolved into a full lifestyle label, offering ready-to-wear, denim, shoes, and handbags, while still promoting the power of a great blazer.",
      "\"We love the idea of the uniform being your blazer with jeans,\" said Miele Beard. \"Get your best pair of jeans, throw on a white tank and a jacket, and you're done. You've just elevated your style.\"",
      "The Dickey Jacket remains the brand's signature piece. When Gwyneth Paltrow featured it on Goop, the Beards knew they had made it.",
      "\"For us, that was like being on Oprah's list,\" Swanson Beard said.",
      "Beyond fashion, the duo is committed to giving back. Their philanthropic initiative, Veronica Beard Gives Back, supports causes including Feeding America, the American Heart Association, and the Council of Fashion Designers of America.",
      "Their mission resonates with the women who choose their clothes. Recently, Katherine, Princess of Wales wore a Veronica Beard dress to announce she had completed her cancer treatment.",
      "\"She could have chosen a power suit to say, 'I'm strong,'\" said Swanson Beard. \"Instead, she chose something feminine and earthy. I was so emotional about it.\"",
      "At its heart, Veronica Beard is more than a label; it's a mantra.",
      "\"We always say our battle cry is 'make it happen,'\" Swanson Beard explained. \"For us, being the clothes on a woman's back when she's making it happen is the greatest thing in the world.\"",

      "Ed Sheeran is trading heartbreak for happiness with the release of his eighth studio album, \"Play,\" a deliberate creative about-face that finds the Grammy winner embracing pure joy after battling through what he calls \"the darkest periods\" of his life.",
      "The 33-year-old singer-songwriter wrote his first album in nearly two years as \"the polar opposite\" of his previous release,\u00a0\"Subtract,\" which chronicled heavy personal struggles that included his wife's cancer diagnosis and his own mental health battles.",
      "\"It's quite a heavy album, all the interviews around it was heavy. All the gigs around it were heavy,\" Sheeran told \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King. \"So I just wanted to kind of do the polar opposite of that with this record.\"",
      "The album marks a return to creative play, with Sheeran focused on getting back to pure artistic expression. He wrote approximately 300-400 songs during the creative process, ultimately selecting tracks that prioritized experimentation over commercial safety.",
      "When asked what he hopes listeners will take away from the album, Sheeran said his goal is for people to connect with at least a few of the songs, but ultimately the record was something he created for himself.",
      "\"It made me feel good. And I'm just putting it in the universe and it all exist in people's lives however it exists. But I think records have to be made primarily for the artist first, cause then like, I don't know, otherwise it's just a product,\" said Sheeran.",
      "The artist's promotional strategy he said reflects the album's adventurous spirit, featuring surprise pop-up performances in locations from Mexico to India rather than traditional media circuits.",
      "\"We would pop up anywhere and play, and it would be chaos and creative,\" he said.",
      "The album also marks a new chapter for Sheeran.",

      "Harry has said previously that he wants to rebuild his relationship with his family, which has been strained since he and his wife Meghan formally stepped down from their roles as working royals and moved to California.",

      "In an interview with CBS News' partner network BBC News in May, Harry said he couldn't envision bringing them all back to the U.K. with him since he has lost a legal bid to have his downgraded state security detail restored.",
      "Harry said his battle with the U.K. government to get full state-security restored for himself and his family during visits back to Britain caused a rift between himself and his father.",
      "\"Life is precious. I don't know how much longer my father has. He won't speak to me because of this security stuff, but it would be nice to reconcile,\" he told the BBC.",

So, there's been no contact,\" Roya Nikkhah, the royal editor for the Sunday Times newspaper, told CBS News on Tuesday. \"There's no chance that William and Harry are going to meet up anytime soon...

    "summary": "The Trump administration wants an appeals court to lift a ruling that blocked President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook before an interest rate meeting next week.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration asked a federal appeals court Thursday to lift a ruling that blocked President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, in time for a crucial meeting next week when Fed officials will decide whether to lower interest rates.",
      "Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook from the Federal Reserve's powerful Board of Governors last month, accusing her of falsely claiming two different homes as her principal residence in mortgage documents. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb blocked the firing on Tuesday, concluding that the president \"has not stated a legally permissible cause for Cook's removal.\" Under federal law, Fed board members serve for 14-year terms and can only be removed \"for cause.\"",
      "On Thursday, the Trump administration asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to stay that ruling while the government appeals it. The Justice Department argued that the president has broad discretion to remove federal officials, including to decide whether \"cause\" exists, and courts have \u2014 at most \u2014 extremely narrow authority to review those decisions.",
      "\"Here, the evidence\u2014which Cook has yet to offer contrary explanation for\u2014was that she applied for two loans for her personal benefit, and was able to obtain favorable interest rates by misrepresenting where she lived,\" the government argued Thursday. \"Regardless of whether that misconduct occurred before or during office, it indisputably calls into question Cook's trustworthiness and whether she can be a responsible steward of the interest rates and economy for the whole Nation.\"",
      "Those allegations surfaced in a letter from Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee who cited mortgage papers for homes that Cook bought in Georgia and Michigan in 2021. Abbe Lowell, an attorney representing Cook, called the government's accusations \"unsubstantiated and vague.\"",
      "The government requested that the appeals court act by the end of the day on Monday, noting that the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, is set to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday.",
      "Cook's attorneys asked the appellate court to deny the Trump administration's request, calling it \"wholly unwarranted.\"",
      "\"An administrative stay would threaten Governor Cook's participation in next week's meeting and potentially plunge the FOMC's vote into turmoil,\" Cook's attorneys wrote in court papers. \"In addition, it has the real potential of impacting domestic and foreign markets. The Government has provided no justification for such a grave disruption of the status quo.\"",
      "The appeals court directed the government to reply to Cook's filing by Sunday at 3 p.m., making a ruling before then unlikely.",
      "Why does the Fed committee matter?",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee \u2014 which includes Cook, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and 10 other top central bank officials \u2014 is responsible for setting the Fed's interest rate targets, which have a major impact on economic growth, inflation and borrowing costs. The panel typically acts independently, with little input from elected officials.",
      "The committee has voted to leave interest rates relatively high so far this year, but investors and economists widely expect it to reduce rates at next week's meeting. Rate cuts could lead to stronger economic growth, but at the risk of causing inflation to heat up.",
      "Mr. Trump has tangled with the Fed for months over its decision to keep rates steady, nicknaming Powell \"Mr. Too Late\" and arguing the rate-setting committee should overrule him. Powell's term ends in May.",
      "Amid that pressure, Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook in late August. A Biden appointee, Cook's term on the Fed's seven-member Board of Governors is set to end in 2038. The allegations against Cook are not related to Mr. Trump's push against the Fed, but if she is removed from the board, the president could pick her replacement, giving him more influence over the central bank.",

      "Consumer sentiment continued to slide in September, falling to its lowest point since May, as\u00a0tariffs seep into product prices\u00a0and Americans start to spend more cautiously.",
      "The University of Michigan's preliminary September sentiment index, released Friday, declined 4.8% to 55.4 from 58.2 in August.",
      "\"Consumers continue to note multiple vulnerabilities in the economy, with rising risks to business conditions, labor markets, and inflation. Likewise, consumers perceive risks to their pocketbooks as well,\" Joanne Hsu, director of the Surveys of Consumers at U. of Michigan,\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "Tariff policies are top of mind for many Americans, too, she said, noting that about 60% of consumers raised the topic in interviews.",
      "Inflation expectations for the year remained steady at 4.8%. Consumers' long-run inflation expectations, however, rose for a second straight month to 3.9% in September, according to the survey, as consumers become aware of \"what tariffs mean for them,\" High Frequency Economics analysts said in a research note.",
      "A separate U. of Michigan report on trade policy and consumer spending found that most U.S. adults plan to spend less on goods that are subject to tariff-related price hikes. Just 24% of consumers surveyed said they expected to spend as usual on items that have large price increases, according to the August report.",
      "\"The corrosive uncertainty surrounding tariffs, other economic policies and immigration, continues to weigh on consumer sentiment, High Frequency Economics analysts said in a research note. \"Rising consumer prices and the reality of the consequences of tariffs are just starting to be felt by consumers. They are saying, 'Ouch!'\"",
      "Sentiment declined most among low-income households, who are most vulnerable to the effects of tariffs, which are a regressive tax. Such households \"won't benefit from recent equity gains and will feel the sticker shock of tariffs most acutely,\" Oxford Economics analysts said in a research note. \"We expect tariffs and fiscal policy changes will widen the bifurcation of American consumers.\"",

    "summary": "The Trump administration's tariffs are slowly rippling through the economy and starting to push up prices for some products, government data shows.",
    "story": [
      "For much of 2025, the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs defied forecasts\u00a0that the import duties would drive up inflation. But that reprieve appears to be over, with economic data this week showing the tariffs are now pushing prices higher.",
      "The Consumer Price Index in August rose at a rate of 2.9% from a year ago, accelerating from the previous month as President Trump's tariffs filtered through the economy. Heavily imported goods saw some of the steepest price hikes last month, the data show. The increase represents the fastest rate of inflation since January, when Mr. Trump was inaugurated for his second term.",
      "Although the tariffs were first announced in April on what Mr. Trump called \"Liberation Day,\" their implementation was largely delayed as the administration negotiated new trade deals with multiple nations over the ensuing months. That gave U.S. companies time to prepare for the new import duties, which are paid by U.S. businesses directly to the federal government.",
      "Facing the prospect of sharply higher tariffs, some American companies scrambled to stock up on the imported goods and parts they use in their business, postponing the need to raise customer prices. Others absorbed the levies instead of passing them along to consumers.",
      "But many companies are now pulling back from those strategies, economic data shows. According to the Federal Reserve's latest \"Beige Book\" survey, which includes responses from businesses, economists and other sources, tariff-related price hikes were visible across the U.S. in August.",
      "Beth Hammack, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland,\u00a0recently told CBS News that some companies facing a hit to their profit margins have no choice but to start passing on tariff-related costs to consumers.",
      "Among the companies to say they are raising prices for some goods as tariffs take effect are\u00a0home improvement giant Home Depot, retailer Macy's and camera maker Nikon.",
      "\"The pass-through from tariffs is gradual because some businesses may have held on to a greater share of the costs and may have shared a greater burden of tariffs,\" said EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco. \"But there is a limit to how long and how much of that they can do \u2014 so there may be more of a push to pass those costs onto consumers.\"",
      "The White House said inflation remains low and that Mr. Trump's policies are boosting the economy.",
      "\"Since President Trump took office, CPI is tracking at a 2.3% annualized rate, consistent with low and stable inflation,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Leavitt also noted that data on producer prices out this week point to a decline in wholesale inflation. \"As the Trump economic agenda continues to take effect, the trillions of dollars in private sector and foreign investments, historic tax cuts, massive deregulation and energy dominance that the president is spearheading will fuel an economic boom,\" she added.",
      "Tariff-fueled price hikes",
      "Many types of goods that rely heavily on imports saw significant price hikes last month, the latest CPI report shows.",
      "Coffee, for instance, is largely imported because there are only a handful of places in the U.S. where the beans can be grown, such as Hawaii and Puerto Rico. About 80% of unroasted coffee imports are sourced from Latin America, primarily from Brazil, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Products from Brazil that are shipped to the U.S. now face a 50% tariff, according to the White House. Once those import taxes kicked in, U.S. consumers in August shelled out 21% more for beans than a year earlier, according to CPI data.",
      "Other products that are heavily imported and that, as of August, are seeing large price increases compared with a year ago include:",

      "Motor vehicle parts: +3.4%",
      "Strain on consumers",
      "Prices are edging higher as worker wages are growing more slowly, straining lower-income households.",
      "\"It's troubling that so many basic necessities now cost more. Food, gas, clothing and shelter all had big cost jumps in August,\" Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, said in an email.\u00a0 \"And this is only the beginning of the price hikes. The situation will worsen in the coming months as more costs are passed along to American consumers.\"",
      "Clara Moore, 44, a public-sector researcher who lives in Newark, New Jersey, told CBS MoneyWatch she is seeing prices \"rising all over the place.\" Her grocery bill has risen to about $250 per haul, from roughly $175 one year ago, she said.",
      "Some economists think tariffs are likely to continue pushing inflation higher throughout the rest of the year, putting more financial pressure on families. As a result, many consumers will spend with more restraint, according to Daco.",
      "\"They are more cautious when it comes to their outlays. They haven't stopped spending, but they'll be more judicious from one month to the next. They'll adjust their spending according to what they need and what's affordable,\" he said.",
      "Moore said she's had to cut back her spending on discretionary goods in order to afford the basics.",
      "\"I'm in the process of cutting out all of my streaming. I stopped ordering anything from Amazon \u2014 any impulse buying I have cut out,\" she said.",
      "Ryan Sweet, Oxford Economics' chief U.S. economist, said consumers should expect to pick up about two-thirds of the cost of new U.S. tariffs on foreign goods.",

      "The cost-of-living adjustment has averaged 2.6% over the last 20 years, according to the Senior Citizens League. A COLA of 2.7% would be higher than this year's adjustment of 2.5%, but below the 3.2% boost seniors received in 2024.",
      "The Social Security Administration (SSA) makes a cost-of-living adjustment each year based on inflation data from July, August and September. Thursday's CPI report shows that the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), the figure the SSA uses to make its annual adjustment, increased 2.8% on an annual basis in August, up from 2.5% the month prior.",
      "The SSA is scheduled to announce its adjustment in October, which would go into effect in January 2026. \"This year, the COLA will be determined on October 15, when the Bureau of Labor and Statistics releases the CPI-W for September,\" the agency told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The COLA is intended to ensure that benefits payments for U.S. seniors keep pace with inflation. However, economists have warned that a 2.7% adjustment may not be enough to stave off the inflationary pressures Americans are facing.",
      "The CPI report released Thursday suggest that inflation is on the rise with CPI rising 2.9% on an annual basis in August compared to 2.7% in July. Imported products such as coffee and furniture have grown more expensive since last year, which economists point out could be due to tariffs pushing up prices.",
      "Routine monthly paycheck reductions for certain Social Security recipients could also cancel out the cost-of-living adjustment, Shannon Benton, the executive director of the Senior Citizens League, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "\"The latest projection of a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment for 2026 is certainly better than nothing,\" said Benton, \"but for many seniors, that gain may quickly disappear once higher Medicare Part B premiums are deducted, turning what should be a raise into a wash.\"",
      "She added, \"For those living on fixed incomes, it's another reminder of the gap between benefits and real-world costs.\"",

    "summary": "The ICE raid that swept up 300 South Koreans in Georgia has strained an important bilateral relationship, and highlighted a significant challenge.",
    "story": [
      "More than 300 South Korean nationals detained by federal agents in a massive immigration raid last week on a Hyundai plant in Georgia for alleged visa violations were released from a detention center early Thursday and boarded a charter flight back to their country.",
      "The flight, which departed Atlanta, is expected to land in South Korea on Friday afternoon, according to The Associated Press.",
      "The South Korean workers were among some 475 people detained on Sept. 4 by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents at a still-under construction joint Hyundai-LG electric vehicle battery facility near Savannah. ICE said they were suspected of living and working in the U.S. illegally.",
      "Earlier Thursday, CBS News photographer Darrall Johnson watched as the Koreans boarded eight buses that then left for the airport, where a Korean Air charter flight was waiting to fly them home. Johnson said a cart full of documents was loaded onto one of the buses.",
      "South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, in an address delivered Thursday in Seoul, said 316 South Koreans would be on the flight, including 10 women. He said one South Korean had decided to remain in the U.S. as they have family members in the country.   The Foreign Ministry said there were also 14 non-Korean nationals boarding the plane, three Japanese, 10 Chinese and one Indonesian.",
      "The ministry had said the flight was expected to take off on Wednesday, but that it was delayed due to unspecified circumstances in the U.S. On Thursday, President Lee said the delay was caused by discussion that was ongoing Wednesday over the details of the transport arrangements for the South Korean nationals between the ICE detention facility and the Atlanta airport.",
      "The detention of hundreds of South Koreans in an ICE facility tested U.S.-South Korea ties that are important politically, militarily and economically. South Korea is the biggest foreign direct investor in the U.S. and the sixth biggest trading partner overall.",
      "President Lee Jae Myung, visiting the White House in July, pledged $350 billion in new U.S. investment to sweeten a trade-and-tariff deal with President Trump.",
      "\"The sentiment is obviously very, very negative,\" James Kim, Chairman and CEO of the American Chamber of Commerce in Seoul, told CBS News. \"In my office, I usually have my TV turned on to the news \u2014 and this is obviously covered from morning to evening constantly. But everyone who I speak to, they view America as its number-one partner here from South Korea. Yes, we're going to have some challenging times.\"",
      "South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun, was peppered with demands from angry lawmakers during a parliamentary session in Seoul on Sept. 8, before he departed for meetings with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other U.S. officials.",
      "Lawmaker Kim Joon-hyun demanded that Cho respond to the ICE raid by launching investigations into every U.S. national teaching English in South Korea who could be working illegally on a tourist visa.",
      "\"Are we giving our money, technology, and investment to the United States only to be treated like this?,\" Kim asked.",
      "Cho replied by saying he would try to negotiate with Rubio to increase the number of visas issued to highly skilled Korean nationals to work in specialty occupations in the U.S.",
      "The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said the ICE raid was the biggest single-site enforcement action in the agency's history. ICE alleges that the South Korean workers either overstayed their visa waiver permits, known as ESTAs, which allow business visits of up to 90 days, or were holding visas that did not permit them to perform manual labor, called B-1 business visas.",
      "Kim, at the American Chamber in Seoul, called it a \"blip\" in U.S.-Korea ties and said he was \"very, very optimistic about a much brighter future between the two\" countries.",
      "South Korea's president, however, took a more critical tone.",
      "\"As the president who is in charge of national safety, I feel a great responsibility,\" Lee said Tuesday. \"I hope that the unfair infringement of our people and corporate activities for the joint development of both Korea and the United States will not happen again.\"",
      "A poll conducted in South Korea found that almost 60% of respondents said they were disappointed by the U.S. crackdown and called the measures \"excessive,\" while about 31% said the ICE action was \"inevitable\" and that they could understand the reasoning.",
      "President Trump, in a Sunday post on his Truth Social platform, addressed all foreign companies operating in the U.S., saying \"your investments are welcome, and we encourage you to LEGALLY bring your very smart people.\"",
      "Kim at the chamber of commerce urged companies to heed the advice.",
      "\"My key message is listen to what President Trump said today. He wants to encourage more foreign companies to invest in America. Bring your people, bring your resources into America, but do it legally,\" he told CBS News.",
      "\"An opportunity to really fix some things\" with a key U.S. ally",
      "Industry experts caution, however, that it may be difficult to maintain investment levels under those guidelines, as securing visas can take years, while many projects face strict deadlines and delays can drive up costs. There is a shortage of highly skilled workers in the U.S., meanwhile, for battery manufacturing, semiconductor and modern shipbuilding industries \u2014 all arenas in which South Korea has been investing heavily for years.",
      "Such jobs can require years of experience, not just a few months of on-the-job training.",
      "A spokesperson for South Korea's Foreign Ministry told CBS News that since Mr. Trump's second term began, it had already reached out 52 times on the matter of securing more visas for highly-skilled workers.",
      "Kim, the U.S. chamber of commerce leader, said the current upset in relations represented \"an opportunity to really fix some things that could be in the grey area, make it a lot more clear, so that they can have an even better relationship.\"",
      "He said that, given Seoul's importance as an investor in the U.S., it may be a good time for Washington to consider adopting a new policy that allows South Koreans to more easily come and work in the U.S.",
      "\"I think that in the past, Korea may not have been a significant investor in the United States, but now they are,\" he said. \"So I think it's worthy and deserving of that kind of a new status.\"",
      "Mr. Trump gave a nod in his Truth Social post to the notion that the U.S. does need foreign expertise, saying foreign companies should bring people over to help train American workers \u2014 and then hire them to do the work themselves.",
      "Rubio, during his meeting Wednesday in Washington with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho, \"said the United States welcomes ROK (South Korea) investment into the United States and stated his interest in deepening cooperation on this front,\" according to a readout shared by the State Department, which did not mention the ICE raid in Georgia.",
      "Rubio and Cho discussed advancing U.S.-South Korean ties \"through a forward-looking agenda\" that \"revitalizes American manufacturing through ROK investment in shipbuilding and other strategic sectors, and promotes a fair and reciprocal trade partnership,\" the State Department said.",
      "According to South Korea's Foreign Ministry, \"Cho expressed deep concern over the public disclosure of the detention of Korean workers who came to the United States to share technology and know-how and contribute to the Trump administration's efforts to revitalize American manufacturing, which has deeply hurt and shocked all Koreans.\"",
      "The ministry's statement said Cho had \"strongly requested the U.S. administration's special attention and support to ensure that these workers, who are not criminals, can quickly depart the US without physical restraint, such as handcuffs, and that they will not face any disadvantages in future visits to the U.S. He also proposed the establishment of a working group between the U.S. and South Korea to discuss various measures, including the creation of new visa categories, to prevent similar incidents from recurring.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Consumer Price Index rose 2.9% in August from a year earlier, matching economists' forecasts that prices would pick up slightly as President Trump's tariffs filtered through the economy.",

      "Despite that, inflation has been creeping higher in recent months, edging away from the Federal Reserve's\u00a02% annual target.\u00a0That's causing some Americans to feel more sour about the economy, with a recent\u00a0CBS News poll\u00a0finding that two-thirds of consumers said prices in the past few weeks have continued to rise.",
      "What economists say",
      "Some economists point to the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs as pushing prices higher. That's because U.S. businesses pay the import duties to the federal government and then pass on some of those costs to consumers in the form of costlier goods.",
      "So far in 2025, the Federal Reserve has held off on cutting rates due to the potential for tariffs to reignite inflation. Because rate reductions make it cheaper to borrow, they can spur businesses and consumers to open their wallets, adding to inflationary pressures.",
      "Yet with the labor market showing signs of strain, Fed Chair Jerome Powell last month signaled that the door may be open for a rate cut at the central bank's Sept. 17 meeting. Cutting rates can spur hiring by making it cheaper for businesses to borrow, and therefore easier to expand and add employees.",

Imports are subject to U.S. tariffs based on country of origin, with the Trump administration adding new duties that start at 10% and scale higher.",
      "\"There were once again some signs of tariff effects putting upward pressure on goods prices,\" noted Capital Economics in a research note, pointing to higher costs for appliances and other home products.",

It takes an average of 30 days between when you start planning a trip and when it's fully finished,\" Skylar Erickson, co-founder of Gondola AI, which helps consumers maximize their loyalty points, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You have 40 tabs open on your browser, so it takes a lot of work to get to that right answer.\"",

AI-powered bots can help travelers dream up trip ideas, turn visual inspiration into ready-to-go itineraries, and complete bookings and payments while maximizing the consumer's own loyalty points and other rewards so that they save money.

It gets to know you as a traveler,\" she said of a Gondola AI, one of her favorite new tools. \"If you've been booking stays at Ritz Carltons, it won't suggest a Marriott Residence Inn as a first option; it will suggest a stay of a similar caliber.\"",
      "\"I used it dozens of times\"",
      "Other travel industry pros say they see more value in AI's ability to help them navigate locales once they've arrived.",
      "\"ChatGPT totally revolutionized how we were able to get along in China \u2014 I used it to scan menus and translate them into English,\" Scott Keyes, founder of flight deals site Going.com, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I used it dozens of times a day.\"",

    "summary": "The Consumer Price Index likely inched higher in August, reflecting higher costs for food and other items, economists say.",
    "story": [
      "For Kasey McBlais, a 42-year-old single mom who lives in Maine with her two elementary school-aged children, the cost of running a household is only getting more expensive, from buying groceries to paying for her home's upkeep.",
      "\"It's really challenging,\" McBlais, who works at a nonprofit, says of managing her expenses. \"It's paycheck to paycheck.\"",
      "Cleaning her chimney cost $500 this year, up from about $200 when she bought her house in 2019. And grocery money isn't going as far either, prompting McBlais to stretch meals to make sure the family has leftovers. \"I honestly don't expect anything to go back to the way they were \u2014 it's a matter of things leveling off where they are at,\" she said.",
      "McBlais' concerns and struggles come as the pace of inflation continues to creep higher, remaining well above the Federal Reserve's goal of driving it down to an annual 2% rate. The situation is leaving some consumers feeling frustrated by stubbornly high prices on everything from groceries to housing,\u00a0souring their views\u00a0about the health of the U.S. economy.",
      "In a recent\u00a0CBS News poll, two-thirds of Americans said that prices in the past few weeks have continued to rise, with nearly all saying they expect the rise in costs to continue.",
      "On Thursday, the Consumer Price Index is expected to show that prices rose at an annualized rate of 2.9% in August, up from 2.7% in July. Some economists point to the Trump administration's tariffs as a contributing factor.",
      "\"Tariffs will raise prices, and that does of course lead to inflation \u2014 there's no way around that,\" said Erasmus Kersting, an economics professor at the Villanova School of Business.",
      "To be sure, inflation is well below its pandemic peak. But the Federal Reserve's progress has been slipping, with recent CPI data showing price growth picking up again after reaching a low point this spring.",
      "At the same time, President Trump is pushing the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark rate, posting on social media on Wednesday that there is \"no inflation!!!\" He also urged the Fed to \"lower the RATE, BIG, right now.\"",
      "In July 2024, when Mr. Trump pledged to end the \"inflation nightmare,\" the CPI rate stood at 2.9%, or the same pace that economists forecast for tomorrow's report.",
      "\"The president would like people to stop paying attention to inflation now because it's not helping it,\" Kersting noted. \"In the past he wanted people to pay attention to it, because back then it did help him win the election.\"",
      "Asked for comment on forecasts the CPI will show an uptick in inflation, the White House said the president is delivering on his promises.",
      "\"Joe Biden unleashed the worst inflation crisis in nearly four years \u2014 President Trump ended it. Despite the media's false narrative, core inflation has run at a 2.4% average pace since President Trump took office which is the lowest 6-month pace since March 2021. The so-called 'experts' have been wrong month after month: tariffs have not hiked prices and President Trump is delivering on his promise to make America affordable again,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Federal Reserve's complicated decision",
      "A hotter CPI report would complicate the Federal Reserve's task of deciding its next interest rate move on Sept. 17, given that the labor market has stalled out this summer. The Fed's so-called \"dual mandate\" requires it to promote full employment while keeping inflation in check.",
      "So far in 2025, the Fed has held its benchmark rate steady, with Chair Jerome Powell saying he wanted to keep the central bank's powder dry in case tariffs caused inflation to reignite. Because rate reductions make it cheaper to borrow, they can spur businesses and consumers to open their wallets, adding to inflationary pressures.",
      "But two consecutive disappointing jobs reports signal that the labor market is stalling out, putting pressure on the Fed to cut rates, which can help bolster hiring by making it cheaper for businesses to borrow and add more workers. Powell last month signaled the Fed may be open to a cut, pointing to the labor market's risks.",
      "The probability of a 0.25 percentage point rate cut is pegged at 90% by CME FedWatch, which bases its forecast on 30-day Fed Funds futures prices. There's a slimmer 10% likelihood that the Fed could usher in a jumbo cut of 0.5 percentage points, its data shows.",
      "A rate cut could help some consumers by lowering their borrowing costs, with interest fees on credit cards, home equity lines of credit and other loans likely to drop after a reduction. But households are still continuing to face higher prices at the grocery store and for household bills, experts note.",
      "\"Budget pressure has never fully let up for many households, even as inflation subsided during 2024 and early 2025,\" Stephen Kates, a certified financial planner and Bankrate financial analyst, said in an email. \"Current and future inflation expectations feel like a slow, painful walk down memory lane.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump has said he is firing Cook from her role over allegations she made false representations on mortgage agreements several years ago.",
    "story": [
      "A federal Judge on Tuesday ruled that\u00a0Lisa Cook can remain in her role on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors while her lawsuit challenging President Trump's attempt to fire her from her post plays out.",
      "\"President Trump has not stated a legally permissible cause for Cook's removal,\" U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden, wrote in her ruling, which is likely to be appealed.",
      "Mr. Trump said he is firing Cook over allegations she made false representations on mortgage agreements several years ago, resulting in more favorable loan terms.",
      "\"President Trump's stated cause refers only to allegations regarding Cook's conduct before she began serving on the Federal Reserve Board,\" Cobb wrote. \"As discussed above, such allegations are not a legally permissible cause.\"",
      "In addition to casting doubt on whether Mr. Trump established cause for Cook's firing, in issuing the stay, Cobb also ruled that Cook's right to due process was violated and that she would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction was not granted.",
      "Abbe David Lowell, an attorney representing Cook in her lawsuit, said in a statement to CBS News on Tuesday night, \"This ruling recognizes and reaffirms the importance of safeguarding the independence of the Federal Reserve from illegal political interference. Allowing the President to unlawfully remove Governor Cook on unsubstantiated and vague allegations would endanger the stability of our financial system and undermine the rule of law. Governor Cook will continue to carry out her sworn duties as a Senate-confirmed Board Governor.\"",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement that Tuesday's ruling \"will not be the last say on the matter.\"",
      "\"President Trump lawfully removed Lisa Cook for cause due to credible allegations of mortgage fraud from her highly sensitive position overseeing financial institutions on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors,\" Desai said.",
      "Under federal law, Fed board members\u00a0serve for 14-year terms\u00a0and can only be fired by the president \"for cause.\" Cook has served on the Fed since being appointed to complete another member's unexpired term in 2022, and her current term would run until 2038.",
      "Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook on Aug. 26, writing in a letter\u00a0terminating her\u00a0from the Fed Board of Governors that he had \"sufficient cause\" to remove her from the position. The president cited a previous letter from Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, that was sent to Attorney General Pam Bondi alleging Cook made false statements on mortgage agreements.",
      "Pulte, an appointee of Mr. Trump's, alleged that Cook in 2021 claimed two different properties in Michigan and Georgia as her primary residence on mortgage documents to get better lending terms. Cook has not been charged with any civil or criminal offense.",
      "Cook's lawyers have previously said in court filings that Mr. Trump's \"unsubstantiated allegation that Governor Cook 'may have' or 'seems' to have erred in filling out a mortgage form in her capacity as a private citizen-does not amount to 'cause' for removal within the meaning of the FRA [Federal Reserve Act].\"",
      "\"None of the alleged misconduct occurred during the performance of Governor Cook's duties as a Federal Board member,\" they wrote. \"And the President and Director Pulte have not even alleged explicitly that Ms. Cook benefited from any clerical error, or that such an error was intentional.\"",
      "In court arguments Friday, Lowell said Cook was not given notice of the allegations or a chance to respond to them, violating, he argued, her due process rights.",
      "Cook's lawsuit argues that Mr. Trump's attempt to oust her is \"unprecedented and illegal,\" noting it would be the first removal of a governor by the president in the Fed's 112-year history.",
      "\"The President's effort to terminate a Senate-confirmed Federal Reserve Board member is a broadside attack on the century-old independence of the Federal Reserve System,\" Cook's lawyers wrote in a filing.",
      "They warned that Mr. Trump's theory of \"cause\" would allow him to remove any Fed Board member with whom he disagrees on policy, eroding the central bank's independence and threatening its mission of providing economic stability.",
      "Cobb appeared to agree with their argument, writing in her ruling on Tuesday, \"Taken to its logical conclusion, the Government's argument leads to an absurd result: While admitting that the President cannot remove an official for policy disagreements, the Government claims that under Reagan, a removal on the grounds of a policy disagreement would nevertheless be unreviewable. ... This cannot be the case. Such a rule would provide no practical insulation for the members of the Board of Governors. It would mean that the President could, in practice, 'remove a member ... merely because he wanted his own appointees.'\"",
      "Cobb also wrote that Mr. Trump \"does not address her [Cook's] in-office conduct at all, let alone provide any examples of how Cook's performance or personal conduct since assuming the role has been in any way deficient in carrying out her statutory duties,\" adding that Mr. Trump's termination letter \"does not identify any conduct that Cook has engaged in while serving as a member of the Board that indicates that Cook lacks the competence or trustworthiness for the role.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's move to fire Cook came amid his repeated\u00a0attacks on the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, over the central bank's handling of interest rates.",
      "Cook, Powell and 10 other Fed officials sit on a committee that controls the nation's monetary policy and sets target interest rates, with a dual mandate of keeping inflation low and employment levels high. This work is typically done independently, with little to no input from political leaders.",
      "While the Fed did cut interest rates last year, after they had reached their highest point in decades in 2022 and 2023 in a bid to fight off inflation, the central bank has recently kept rates at relatively high levels. Powell has cited concerns that lowering rates could again lead to a swift rise in inflation and that Mr. Trump's tariffs could also lead to an increase in consumer prices.",

      "Getting cash from an ATM is growing increasingly expensive as fees reach record highs.",
      "Americans are now paying an average of $4.86 for out-of-network ATM withdrawals, up 1.9% from $4.77 last year, according to a new\u00a0survey\u00a0from Bankrate.com. That's the highest on record, according to the personal finance website, which starting tracking ATM fees 27 years ago.",
      "\"ATM fees are just one of those avenues that the bank can very freely continue to charge fees,\" Bankrate financial analyst Stephen Kates told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Those costs include charges from both ATM owners and banks. According to the survey, the average fee from cash machine providers is $3.22. Banks charge $1.64 on average, up 3.8% from 2024 \u2014 the highest since 2018. As a result, Americans in certain metro areas could see average combined fees of more than $5.",
      "For its survey, Bankrate polled a total of 10 banks and financial institutions in 25 of the nation's largest metro areas. Atlanta topped the list for highest ATM costs, with an average out-of-network fee of $5.37. Behind Atlanta are Phoenix and San Diego, where ATM charges average $5.35 and $5.31, respectively.",
      "Boston and Seattle had the lowest average rates among the metro areas surveyed \u2014 $4.37 and $4.42, respectively.",
      "What's behind the rising charges?",
      "The problem, said Kates, is that while there have been regulatory rumblings around curbing overdraft fees, resulting in voluntary caps by financial institutions, there are no limits on how much banks can charge for ATM withdrawals, giving them free rein to hike fees as much as they want. And since the charges apply to people outside the bank's network, there's no risk of it losing customers.",
      "\"It's one of the ways for the bank to certainly make money, and it's one of the ways to do so that doesn't really hurt their own customers,\" Kates said.",
      "Higher fees also help ATM owners and banks make up for lost revenue as consumers gravitate away from using cash and toward digital payments, said Kates. Also, online banking has nearly eliminated the need for automated bank tellers. According to a\u00a0survey\u00a0conducted by Morning Consult on behalf of the American Bankers Association last year, only 5% of customers relied on ATMs to manage their bank accounts.",
      "To be sure, reliance on cash hasn't disappeared altogether. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta found that cash was still Americans' primary form of payment as of October 2024 \u2014 whether for a trip to an old-school laundromat or a vexingly cash-only restaurant.",
      "\"Fewer and fewer people need to use cash for certain things, but there are some times when you have to have it,\" said Kates.",
      "How to avoid high ATM fees",
      "Avoiding high ATM fees requires a bit of strategy and forethought, as you may not always be near a bank-affiliated ATM when you need to withdraw cash.",
      "In such a situation, one option is to get cash back at a local store. Kates also encourages people to look at their banking app to see which ATMs are close to them.",
      "If you need to withdraw cash on a regular basis, but live in an area where there aren't any ATMs in-network, you may want to consider changing where you bank to accommodate your needs. Certain online financial services like Fidelity, for instance, reimburse customers for ATM fees \u2014 making them a more attractive option.",

      "\"It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs,\" the appeals court wrote. \"The statute neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the President's power to impose tariffs.\"",
      "The appeals court did not decide whether IEEPA authorizes any tariffs at all. Instead, it only resolved whether sweeping duties that Mr. Trump imposed through a series of executive orders earlier this year are allowed under the law.",
      "The second case involves a pair of Illinois-based companies that sell educational toys and products. A federal district judge in Washington, D.C., ruled in May that IEEPA \"does not authorize the president to impose the tariffs set forth\" in his executive orders. The decision from U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras was more narrow, barring the Trump administration only from collecting any tariff from the two companies. Contreras paused his decision while the Justice Department appealed to the D.C. Circuit.",
      "The two companies asked the Supreme Court in June to fast track the case and leap frog the appeals court in Washington, D.C.",
      "A spokesperson for one of the companies, Learning Resources, said in a statement it was \"gratified\" that the Supreme Court would hear the case.",
      "\"There is a lot riding on this historic case,\" the spokesperson said. \"The unlawful IEEPA tariffs have wreaked havoc in our economy for too long now.\"",
      "The duties at issue include those announced by Mr. Trump in early April \u2014 which he refers to as \"Liberation Day\" \u2014 that set a 10% baseline rate for nearly every country, and higher \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners. It also involves a set of levies on imports from Canada, Mexico and China in response to what Mr. Trump said is their failure to address the trafficking of fentanyl across U.S. borders.",
      "The president has used the tariffs, and the threat of additional duties, to try to force trading partners to negotiate trade deals with his administration. So far, \u00a0he has announced frameworks of trade agreements with the European Union and six countries: the United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines.",
      "Mr. Trump is the first president to use IEEPA to impose tariffs, though it has been used by his predecessors to hit foreign nations with economic sanctions. His administration has argued that a denial of tariff authority would put the U.S. on the brink of \"economic catastrophe\" and make the nation poorer.",
      "In urging the Supreme Court to move quickly, Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing that the Federal Circuit's \"erroneous decision has disrupted highly impactful, sensitive, ongoing diplomatic trade negotiations, and cast a pall of legal uncertainty over the President's efforts to protect our country by preventing an unprecedented economic and foreign-policy crisis.\"",
      "The Trump administration has argued that IEEPA gives the president broad powers to regulate trade, including imposing tariffs, \"to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat\" to U.S. national security, foreign policy or the economy.",
      "Mr. Trump has said that trade deficits and the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. constituted threats to the national security and economy of the U.S., and invoked IEEPA to impose tariffs to address them.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs have remained in effect, since the Federal Circuit put its decision on hold until Oct. 14 to give the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court.",
      "The plaintiffs \u2014 the five small businesses and 12 states \u2014 agreed that the Supreme Court needs to resolve the legality of Mr. Trump's tariffs, calling it an issue of \"great\" and \"undoubted importance.\" They argued that the tariffs are illegal and urged the high court to affirm the Federal Circuit's decision.",
      "\"The government's case rests entirely on the notion that the phrase 'regulate \u2026 importation' in IEEPA constitutes a boundless power to impose tariffs on the American people whenever the President wants, at whatever level he wants, for whatever countries and products he wants, and for as long as he wants, merely by declaring that longstanding U.S. trade deficits are a national 'emergency' and an 'unusual and extraordinary threat' \u2014 assertions the government claims are effectively unreviewable,\" lawyers for the small businesses wrote in a Supreme Court filing. \"There are no limits.\"",
      "The states, meanwhile, said that the Constitution gives Congress the power to collect taxes, and the Trump administration is claiming that the president has sweeping authority to impose tariffs \"on any country, at any rate, and for however long he likes.\"",
      "\"The President's chaotic implementation of that purported authority, which changed by the day and wreaked havoc on capital markets and the economy, illustrates both the breadth of powers that the President claims and the danger of unlimited authority in this domain,\" they warned in court papers.",
      "The legal challenge to Mr. Trump's tariffs is likely to be one of several involving the president's second-term policies that the Supreme Court takes up. Other cases involving his immigration policies and efforts to remove members of independent agencies have progressed through the lower courts, and the Trump administration is likely to seek Supreme Court review of decisions against it.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bls-jobs-revisions-annual-benchmark-decline-911000-biden-trump/",
    "published": "Tue, 09 Sep 2025 19:56:54 -0400",
    "summary": "The downward revision from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the job market was slowing in 2024 and early 2025.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. labor market added 911,000 fewer jobs in the 12-month period that ended March 2025 than had earlier been reported, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Tuesday. The major downward revision signals that the labor market was slowing more last year than had earlier been reported.",
      "The so-called preliminary benchmark revision, produced annually by the BLS, was bigger than a decline of roughly 800,000 that economists had forecast prior to the release. The revision aims to better account for businesses that have opened or closed in the 12-month period it covers, as these changes are sometimes missed by the BLS' monthly jobs report.",
      "The downward revision comes as the labor market appears to be ailing, with Friday's\u00a0disappointing August jobs report\u00a0sending warning signals about the pace of hiring across the U.S. At the same time, the BLS is in the crosshairs of the Trump administration, with the president last month\u00a0questioning the validity\u00a0of the monthly jobs report after the data included a significant downward revision, prompting him to\u00a0fire the commissioner\u00a0of the BLS.",
      "Revisions are a normal part of the statistical process at the BLS, economists note. That's because the monthly jobs data is based on a survey of businesses, and some companies respond after the agency's initial jobs report has been issued. Because of that, the BLS updates its data to reflect the new information.",
      "The sharp downward annual revision signals that the job market was facing bigger headwinds in 2024 and early 2025 than earlier reported, and could add to the Federal Reserve's case for cutting its benchmark rate at its Sept. 17 meeting, economists said.",
      "\"Today's data suggests cooling in the labor market is more dramatic than previously thought,\" said Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet, in an email.",
      "She added, \"This strengthens the likelihood that the Fed will cut rates next week, as it's additional evidence that the labor market side of the dual mandate needs some attention.\"",
      "Less momentum in job gains",
      "With the new revisions, job growth in 2025 has averaged 44,000 per month, down from 75,000 prior to the revamped numbers, Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said in an email. In 2024, payroll gains factoring in the revisions averaged 106,000, down from 168,000 previously.",
      "\"The revision shows the economy entered 2025 with less momentum than previously understood,\" he said. \"It's now a lock that the Fed will cut interest rates at their meeting next week and that further rate cuts will follow in the months ahead. The question is by how much.\"",
      "The probability of a 0.25 percentage point rate cut at the Fed's Sept. 17 meeting is now projected at 94%, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "The annual revisions are based on fresh data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), which tracks employment and wages reported by employers that cover more than 95% of U.S. jobs, or about 11 million workplaces.",
      "The QCEW tracks when businesses open or close, something that is difficult for the monthly jobs report to track. For instance, if a business doesn't respond to the monthly survey, the BLS doesn't immediately know if the company simply isn't responding or if it has shut down.",
      "The large revision is likely due to the QCEW's tracking of businesses that have either been newly created or recently closed, with some of those new companies likely having slower hiring than the BLS had earlier estimated, Pantheon Macroeconomics chief U.S. economist Samuel Tombs said in a research note.",
      "\"Probably about two-thirds of the downward benchmark revision looks set to be due to weaker job creation at new firms than the BLS initially inferred from its model,\" he said.",

    "summary": "The typical U.S. taxpayer could see their taxes decrease by more than $3,750 next year thanks to fresh cuts, deductions and other provisions, according to a recent analysis.",
    "story": [
      "The \"big, beautiful bill\" signed into law by President Trump in July provides a bevy of new tax cuts and deductions that could lower taxes for millions of Americans, according to a recent analysis from the Tax Foundation.",
      "The typical filer could see a tax cut of $3,752 in 2026, the nonpartisan think tank found. But the impact will also vary geographically, with some residents in some states likely receiving a bigger tax benefit than others under the new law, Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "For instance, the biggest average cut will go to residents of Wyoming, with a reduction of $5,374, according to his analysis of the law's impact.",
      "The geographic differences are due partly to variations in the average income of each state, given that the law provides bigger tax cuts to high-income Americans\u00a0compared with low-income households, Watson noted. Other provisions also could help some regions more than others. That includes the higher deduction cap for state and local taxes, which will give more of a lift to people in states with high property taxes, such as New Jersey and New York.",
      "\"Places with higher incomes are going to have higher nominal tax cuts,\" Watson said. \"The largest tax benefits are going to the mountain states \u2014 it's due to a subgroup of higher-income business owners.\"",
      "Residents of Mississippi and West Virginia are likely to see the smallest tax cuts next year, the analysis found. Incomes in those states tend to be lower than the national average, with median household income in Mississippi standing at about $55,000 as of 2023 and $60,000 for West Virginians, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The national household median income is about $80,600.",
      "The Tax Foundation analysis projects the average tax cut in tax year 2026, meaning that these numbers reflect the reductions for the next calendar year. Although many of the law's provisions are effective in 2025, the IRS is still working out the details on some of them, which means lower tax withholding for the new provisions won't be fully in place until 2026, Watson said.",
      "Bigger refunds?",
      "Tax refunds are also likely to be larger in early 2026, when people file their taxes for the 2025 calendar year, Watson said, although he hasn't calculated the potential impact.",
      "Seniors who can claim a new $6,000 deduction for people over 65 under the law may get a bigger refund, as well as taxpayers across the board due to the higher standard deduction, said Mark Steber, chief tax officer at Jackson Hewitt.",
      "Because of the tax changes in the new law, Steber recommends that people start preparing now. For example, workers who are newly eligible for tax breaks on tips and on overtime pay should keep track of such income.",
      "\"Having this much time left in the year allows taxpayers to make any necessary adjustments to help increase a refund or lower an amount due, and can be as simple as adjusting the withholding on a W-4,\" Steber told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The top 1% of earners around the U.S. \u2014 those with incomes over $1.1 million \u2014 will receive a $75,410 annual tax break from the new law in 2026, according to a\u00a0separate analysis\u00a0from the Tax Policy Center, nonpartisan think tank. That compares with an average tax break of $150 for households in the bottom 20% of the income distribution, or people earning less than $36,000 a year, and of $1,780 for earning $66,801 to $119,200.",
      "To be sure, many of new law's tax cuts will depend on an individual's financial circumstances. For instance, a low-income worker who earns tips or overtime could see a much bigger tax cut due to the law's \"no tax on tips\" and \"no tax on overtime\" provisions, Watson noted.",
      "\"If a taxpayer isn't taking tips or overtime or new car loan deduction, they may see a lower benefit,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Manufacturers in the U.S. are cutting thousands of jobs even as President Trump pushes economic policies that he says will revitalize the industry.",
      "Employers shed 12,000 manufacturing jobs\u00a0in August, while payrolls in the sector have shrunk by 42,000 since April, according to a new\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the Center for American Progress (CAP) that draws on government labor data.",
      "The nonpartisan policy institute attributes that decline to the Trump administration's steep new tariffs; hardline stance on immigration; and the Republican-backed \"big, beautiful bill,\" a tax and spending package enacted by Mr. Trump in July that CAP says hurts renewable energy companies by phasing out certain tax credits.",
      "For all of 2025, manufacturing employment in the U.S. has sunk by a total of 33,000 jobs, according to Labor Department\u00a0figures. Most of those job losses have been among companies that make durable goods, such as cars, household appliances and electronics. The drop comes as hiring overall has slowed sharply in recent months, with employers adding only 22,000 jobs in August, well below forecasts.",
      "The number of manufacturing jobs in the U.S. has declined for the past six decades, according to\u00a0data\u00a0from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. In 1960, manufacturing represented about 34% of total employment, while the number of jobs in the sector peaked in 1970 at 19.5 million. As of August this year, 12.7 million Americans were employed in manufacturing, while the industry lost 87,000 jobs in 2024,\u00a0data shows.",
      "Uncertainty hurting businesses",
      "When Mr. Trump in April announced a range of levies on dozens of other countries, the White House said tariffs would protect American workers by reducing the U.S. trade deficit with its economic partners and spurring employers to move manufacturing jobs to the U.S.",
      "For now, however, confusion over the scale and scope of U.S. tariffs has put manufacturers on the defensive, increasing their costs and discouraging them from hiring, economist Sara Estrep, one of the authors of the CAP report, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Companies are uncertain about what's happening,\" she said. \"Everything has been changing on a day-to-day basis, so it's not clear what production should look like. That's why they aren't hiring.\"",
      "In August, for example, farm equipment giant John Deere cited tariffs in announcing that its sales and operating profits had dipped from a year ago. In an earnings call, an executive with the company noted that it had racked up roughly $300 million in tariff-related costs, including on steel and aluminum imports. John Deere also announced it was laying off more than 200 workers at plants in Illinois and Iowa, according to AgWeb, a trade publication.",
      "Automakers pointed partly to tariffs in announcing nearly 5,000 job cuts in July, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, while it noted that the retail sector has also stepped up layoffs and store closures because of economic uncertainty.",
      "Another factor fueling uncertainty for manufacturers are the ongoing legal challenges to the Trump tariffs, making it hard to plan and invest for the future, according to experts.",
      "A federal appeals court in August ruled that Mr. Trump unlawfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose sweeping tariffs on U.S. trade partners. Mr. Trump on September 3\u00a0asked the Supreme Court\u00a0to review the lower court's decision before it takes effect in October.",
      "The outcome of the case leaves many manufacturers in doubt about how to proceed, making them reluctant to expand their workforce as they seek to control costs, Daco told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The slowdown is symptomatic of an environment where purchasing managers are all under stress, and they are being squeezed by higher costs of goods and reduced demand,\" said EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco. \"And so in that squeeze, they are having to find ways to offset the higher costs, and one of the avenues to do that is to streamline their operations and make sure that they only have the essential talent on hand.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to several requests for comment on CAP's findings. The Office of the United States Trade Representative and National Association of Manufacturers, a trade group, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Immigration effect",
      "The Trump administration's crackdown on U.S. immigrants is also weighing on hiring in manufacturing, said Daniel Altman, an economist and author of the High Yield Economics newsletter.",
      "\"Immigration has been an important source of employment in manufacturing for some industries, and if you take away some of their labor supply, that's just gives them more incentive to pursue automation and other forms of capital intensive manufacturing,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The government stepped up its campaign last week when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents\u00a0detained 475 immigrants, most of them Korean, at a Hyundai plant in Georgia because they were suspected of living and working in the U.S. illegally.",
      "Border patrol agents have also\u00a0conducted raids targeting immigrants working in retail, according to CBS News. In sectors like farming, food processing and construction, undocumented immigrants make up to 20% of the workforce, according to\u00a0Goldman Sachs.",
      "White House \"border czar\" Tom Homan on Sunday said the White House will expand such efforts.",
      "\"We're going to do more worksite enforcement operations,\" Homan told CNN. \"No one hires an illegal alien out of the goodness of their heart. They hire them because they can work them harder, pay them less, undercut the competition that hires U.S. citizen employees.\"",
      "Other long-term factors that go beyond the Trump administration's policies are also contributing to the ongoing contraction in manufacturing jobs. During the pandemic, manufacturers invested heavily in technologies to automate their operations, Altman noted.",
      "\"We've seen a lot of automation, which means companies do not need as many workers to provide the same output,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Output per worker has been increasing, and when we see that kind of increase in labor productivity, it usually means workers have access to more capital, or better technology or both, and that's what you'd expect with automation.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/utah-governor-cox-charlie-kirk-assassination-suspect-authorities/",
    "published": "Mon, 15 Sep 2025 07:20:59 -0400",
    "summary": "Tyler Robinson, 22, was arrested on charges of aggravated murder, obstruction of justice and felony discharge of a firearm for the assassination of Charlie Kirk.",
    "story": [
      "The 22-year-old suspect behind the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk is \"not cooperating\" with investigators, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox and two law enforcement sources said.",
      "Cox stressed on several Sunday morning news shows that investigators are still trying to pin down a motive for the attack and said more information may come out once the suspect, Tyler Robinson, appears in court on Tuesday.",
      "\"There's so much more that we're learning, and so much more that we will learn,\" Cox said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"There will be official charges filed on Tuesday, and there will be much more evidence and information available then. And again, we're interviewing all kinds of people, everyone that knows him, and trying to learn more about what that motive actually was.\"",
      "Kirk, who co-founded the right-wing advocacy group Turning Point USA and was a confidant of President Trump, was shot and killed at Utah Valley University on Wednesday as he addressed a large crowd at an outdoor debate. He was 31 and is survived by his wife, Erika, and two young children.",
      "Robinson was arrested Friday on charges of aggravated murder, obstruction of justice and felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury, according to an inmate booking sheet from the Utah County Sheriff's Office.",
      "Officials described the shootings as a \"targeted attack,\" and it drew condemnation from both sides of the political aisle.",
      "Cox, a Republican who has called on both the left and right to tone down their rhetoric after the attack, said: \"I really don't have a dog in this fight. If this was a radicalized MAGA person, I'd be saying that as well.\"",
      "The governor said investigations have unearthed that Robinson had left-leaning political beliefs and disliked Kirk.",
      "\"That information comes from people around him, his family members and friends,\" he said on CNN.",
      "Cox also said the suspect's partner was transgender but that he was unsure if it was relevant to the case.",
      "\"The roommate was a romantic partner, a male transitioning to female,\" Cox said. \"I can say that he has been incredibly cooperative, this partner has been very cooperative, had no idea that this was happening.\"",
      "State records show that Robinson registered as an unaffiliated voter. He is listed as an inactive voter in state records, meaning he didn't vote in the last two elections. He was not old enough to vote in 2020.",
      "Robinson had no prior felony or misdemeanor convictions and no prior violent offenses, according to a Public Safety Assessment Report filed in Utah state court.",
      "Robinson grew up around St. George, in the southwestern corner of Utah. He became a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints at a young age, church spokesperson Doug Andersen told the Associated Press.",
      "Ammunition found with the weapon used to kill Kirk was engraved with taunting, anti-fascist and meme-culture messages. Court records show that one bullet casing had the message, \"Hey, fascist! Catch!\"",

    "published": "Mon, 15 Sep 2025 07:04:00 -0400",
    "summary": "ICE raids, the federally led English-only initiative and an anti-DEI push have changed the national climate in which Hispanic Heritage Month celebrations occur -- when they do at all.",
    "story": [
      "Each year during Hispanic Heritage Month, huge celebrations can be expected across the U.S. to showcase the diversity and culture of Hispanic people.",
      "This year, the Trump administration's immigration crackdowns, a federally led English-only initiative and an anti-diversity, equity and inclusion push have changed the national climate in which these celebrations occur. Organizers across the country, from Massachusetts and North Carolina to California and Washington state, have postponed or canceled heritage month festivals altogether.",
      "Celebrated each year from Sept. 15 to Oct. 15, the month is a chance for many in the U.S. to learn about and celebrate the contributions of Hispanic cultures, the country's fastest-growing racial or ethnic minority, according to the U.S. Census. The group includes people whose ancestors come from Spain, Mexico, the Caribbean and Central and South America.",
      "More than 68 million people identify as ethnically Hispanic in the U.S., according to the latest census estimates.",
      "Before there was National Hispanic Heritage Month, there was Hispanic Heritage Week, which was created through legislation sponsored by Mexican American U.S. Rep Edward R. Roybal of Los Angeles and signed into law in 1968 by President Lyndon B. Johnson.",
      "The weeklong commemoration was expanded to a month two decades later, with legislation signed into law by President Ronald Reagan.",
      "\"It was clustered around big celebrations for the community,\" Alberto Lammers, director of communications at the UCLA Latino Policy and Politics Institute said. \"It became a chance for people to know Hispanic cultures, for Latinos to get to know a community better and for the American public to understand a little better the long history of Latinos in the U.S.\"",
      "Sept. 15 was chosen as the starting point to coincide with the anniversary of \"El Grito de Dolores,\" or the \"Cry of Dolores,\" which was issued in 1810 from a town in Mexico that launched the country's war for independence from Spain.",
      "The Central American nations of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica celebrate their independence on Sept. 15 and Mexico marks its national day on Sept. 16, the day after the cry for independence.",
      "Also during National Hispanic Heritage Month, the South American nation of Chile observes its independence day on Sept. 18.",
      "The White House so far has not mentioned any planned events. Last year, President Joe Biden hosted a reception and issued a proclamation for the occasion.",
      "Hispanic was a term coined by the federal government for people descended from Spanish-speaking cultures. But for some, the label has a connotation of political conservatism and emphasizes a connection to Spain. It sometimes gets mistakenly interchanged with \"Latino\" or \"Latinx.\"",
      "For some, Latino reflects their ties to Latin America. So some celebrations are referred to as Latinx or Latin Heritage Month.",
      "Latin Americans are not a monolith. There are several other identifiers for Latin Americans, depending largely on personal preference. Mexican Americans who grew up during the 1960s Civil Rights era may identify as Chicano. Other may go by their family's nation of origin such as Colombian American or Salvadoran American.",
      "Each culture has unique differences when it comes to music, food, art and other cultural touchstones.",
      "September typically has no shortage of festivities. Events often include traditional Latin foods and entertainment like mariachi bands, folkl\u00f3rico and salsa dance lessons. The intent is to showcase the culture of Mexico, Puerto Rico, Venezuela and other Latin countries.",
      "Masked ICE agents carrying out President Trump's policies via workplace raids at farms, manufacturing plants and elsewhere - which has included detaining legal residents - led some to fear large gatherings would become additional targets for raids. Another obstacle heritage celebrations face is the perception that they'd violate bans on DEI programming - something Mr. Trump has discouraged across federal agencies. Some companies and universities have followed suit.",
      "Early in September, organizers of a Mexican Independence festival in Chicago announced they would postpone celebrations due to Trump's promises of an immigration crackdown in the city.",
      "\"It was a painful decision, but holding El Grito Chicago at this time puts the safety of our community at stake - and that's a risk we are unwilling to take,\" said the organizers of the festival.",
      "A new date has not yet been announced. Though Mexican Independence Day falls on Sept. 16, celebrations in Chicago typically span more than a week and draw hundreds of thousands of participants for lively parades, festivals, street parties and car caravans.",
      "\"The fact that the federal government is sending troops as we start these celebrations is an insult,\" Illinois state Sen. Karina Villa, a Democrat, said at a news conference. \"It is a fear tactic. It's unforgivable.\"",
      "Similarly, Sacramento's annual Mexican Independence Day festival was canceled with organizers citing the political climate and safety concerns.",
      "Other events that have been canceled include the Hispanic Heritage Festival of the Carolinas, Hispanic Heritage Fest in Kenner, Louisiana and FIESTA Indianapolis.",
      "Ivan Sandoval-Cervantes, an anthropology professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said when celebrations are canceled from the top down it affects how we see them throughout the country. Used to seeing celebrations in Las Vegas advertised, he has seen very little leading up to this year's heritage month.",
      "\"If it's not being celebrated by a specific state that doesn't mean they won't be celebrated but they might go into the private sphere,\" Sandoval-Cervantes said. \"Where it's safer to embrace the symbols or even speak Spanish.\"",
      "In Mexico, the government launched a new appeal to raise awareness among Mexican migrants to take every possible precaution during the holidays because any incident, such as while driving, could lead to a deportation.",
      "\"Rather than not celebrating, be cautious\" and gather at the consulates, President Claudia Sheinbaum said Friday.",
      "On Thursday, Mexico's foreign affairs secretary said there would be more consular staff on duty to respond to any emergency. Mexican nationals stopped by U.S. authorities are advised to not flee, remain silent and not sign any documents.",
      "Chicago Latino leaders called on residents to remain peaceful during expected protests at Mexican Independence Day celebrations, arguing that any unrest could be used as justification for sending federal troops to the city.",
      "\"We will not allow others to use our fear or our anger against us,\" said Berto Aguayo, of the Chicago Latino Caucus Association. \"We will not take the bait. We will know our rights. We will protect each other and peacefully protest.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 15 Sep 2025 05:03:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Unlike the Smithsonian, the National Center for Civil and Human Rights is privately funded, putting it beyond the immediate reach of Trump administration efforts to control what Americans learn about their history.",
    "story": [
      "Atlanta \u2014 A popular museum in Atlanta is expanding at a critical moment in the United States - and unlike the Smithsonian Institution, the National Center for Civil and Human Rights is privately funded, putting it beyond the immediate reach of Trump administration efforts to control what Americans learn about their history.",
      "The months-long renovation, which cost nearly $60 million, adds six new galleries as well as classrooms and interactive experiences, changing a relatively static museum into a dynamic place where people are encouraged to take action supporting civil and human rights, racial justice and the future of democracy, said Jill Savitt, the center's president and CEO.",
      "The center has stayed active ahead of its Nov. 8 reopening through K-12 education programs that include more than 300 online lesson plans; a LGBTQ+ Institute; training in diversity, equity and inclusion; human rights training for law enforcement; and its Truth & Transformation Initiative to spread awareness about forced labor, racial terror and other historic injustices.",
      "These are the same aspects of American history, culture and society that the Trump administration is seeking to dismantle.",
      "Dreamed up by civil rights icons Evelyn Lowery and Andrew Young, the center opened in 2014 on land donated by the Coca-Cola Company, next to the Georgia Aquarium and The World of Coca-Cola, and became a major tourist attraction. But ticket sales declined after the pandemic.",
      "Now the center hopes to attract more repeat visitors with immersive experiences like \"Change Agent Adventure,\" aimed at children under 12. These \"change agents\" will be asked to pledge to something - no matter how small - that \"reflects the responsibility of each of us to play a role in the world: To have empathy. To call for justice. To be fair, be kind. And that's the ethos of this gallery,\" Savitt said. It opens next April.",
      "\"I think advocacy and change-making is kind of addictive. It's contagious,\" Savitt explained. \"When you do something, you see the success of it, you really want to do more. And our desire here is to whet the appetite of kids to see that they can be involved. They can do it.\"",
      "This ethos is sharply different from the idea that young people can't handle the truth and must be protected from unpleasant challenges but, Savitt said, \"the history that we tell here is the most inspirational history.\"",
      "\"In fact, I think it's what makes America great. It is something to be patriotically proud of. The way activists over time have worked together through nonviolence and changed democracy to expand human freedom - there's nothing more American and nothing greater than that. That is the lesson that we teach here,\" she said.",
      "\"Broken Promises,\" opening in December, includes exhibits from the post-Civil War Reconstruction era, cut short when white mobs sought to brutally reverse advances by formerly enslaved people. \"We want to start orienting you in the conversation that we believe we all kind of see, but we don't say it outright: Progress. Backlash. Progress. Backlash. And that pattern that has been in our country since enslavement,\" said its curator, Kama Pierce.",
      "On display will be a Georgia historical marker from the site of the 1918 lynching of Mary Turner, pockmarked repeatedly with bullets, that Turner descendants donated to keep it from being vandalized again.",
      "\"There are 11 bullet holes and 11 grandchildren living,\" and the family's words will be incorporated into the exhibit to show their resilience, Pierce said.",
      "Items from the Morehouse College Martin Luther King Jr. collection will have a much more prominent place, in a room that recreates King's home office, with family photos contributed by the center's first guest curator: his daughter, the Rev. Bernice King. \"We wanted to lift up King's role as a man, as a human being, not just as an icon,\" Savitt explained.",
      "Gone are the huge images of the world's most genocidal leaders - Hitler, Stalin and Mao among others - with explanatory text about the millions of people killed under their orders. In their place will be examples of human rights victories by groups working around the world.",
      "\"The research says that if you tell people things are really bad and how awful they are, you motivate people for a minute, and then apathy sets in because it's too hard to do anything,\" Savitt said. \"But if you give people something to hope for that's positive, that they can see themselves doing, you're more likely to cultivate a sense of agency in people.\"",
      "And doubling in capacity is an experience many can't forget: Joining a 1960s sit-in against segregation. Wearing headphones as they take a lunch-counter stool, visitors can both hear and feel an angry, segregationist mob shouting they don't belong. Because this is \"heavy content,\" Savitt says, a new \"reflection area\" will enable people to pause afterward on a couch, with tissues if they need them, to consider what they've just been through.",
      "The center's expansion was seeded by Home Depot co-founder and Atlanta philanthropist Arthur M. Blank, the Mellon Foundation and many other donors, for which Savitt expressed gratitude: \"The corporate community is in a defensive crouch right now - they could get targeted,\" she said.",
      "But she said donors shared concerns about people's understanding of citizenship, so supporting the teaching of civil and human rights makes a good investment.",
      "\"It is the story of democracy - Who gets to participate? Who has a say? Who gets to have a voice?\" she said. \"So our donors are very interested in a healthy, safe, vibrant, prosperous America, which you need a healthy democracy to have.\"",

      "MAJOR GARRETT: I'm Major Garrett in Washington.",
      "And this week on Face the Nation: What will America do after the killing of political activist Charlie Kirk? Is the assassination of a high- visibility and effective conservative thought leader and vote mobilizer a moment when national divisions begin to close or will attitudes harden?",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "ERIKA KIRK (Widow of Charlie Kirk): To everyone listening tonight across America, the movement my husband built will not die.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The criminal investigation continues, as does the quest to deduce a motive. Charges will be filed later this week.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson joins us on the path ahead and a range of issues facing Congress, from avoiding a government shutdown to Russian sanctions.",
      "And a conversation with Democratic Senator Chris Coons and Republican Senator James Lankford, longtime advocates both of finding common ground and minimizing political strife.",
      "Also, University of Chicago Professor Robert Pape, one of the country's foremost researchers on political violence, with a warning about where things stand.",
      "Then: As consumers turn gloomy and the job market freezes up, high expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut. CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger will break it all down.",
      "It is all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. Margaret is on assignment for \"60 Minutes.\" I'm Major Garrett.",
      "We have a lot to get to today, and I want to begin with justice correspondent Scott MacFarlane with the latest on the assassination of political activist Charlie Kirk and the ongoing investigation.",
      "Utah Republican Governor Spencer Cox has been the most authoritative voice in this matter since it happened, Scott. We have some new comments from him this morning.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: It sounds like they have a lot to work with to start.",
      "First of all, as the weekend began, they executed a search warrant on the family home in Washington County, Utah. It's about three or four hours from the site of the shooting. The governor, though, says multiple people are talking here, including the roommate of the suspect, who he describes as incredibly cooperative.",
      "The roommate, he says, had no idea this was happening, and he also says the roommate may have been in a romantic relationship with Tyler Robinson, may have been gender transitioning, but the governor says there's no indication or no idea yet if that's at all relevant to this case.",
      "As for Robinson, he's in the Utah County Jail, the one where Utah Valley University is. He's in a special watch area. He's inmate 460956. A special watch means they're ensuring he's not harmed or can do any self-harm. It doesn't mean there's a mental health issue, Major, but the severity of the crime, commonly in correctional facilities across the country, puts you in a special watch.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: State charges due to be filed later this week. And because of Utah's approach to state charges, this will be a high-visibility prosecution when it comes.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: Yes, the district attorney is Jeff Gray. We expect him to speak Tuesday. The probable cause statement already submitted for this arrest indicates the possible charges, aggravated murder, felonious discharge of a firearm. Those are possible come Tuesday in Utah County Court.",
      "Whether the feds get involved, whole different issue. There may not be a foothold for federal charges here for the U.S. Department of Justice, unless they see something in the firearms or in the motives here that makes it federal, though we saw in Charlotte last week they brought federal charges in the alleged murder of a Ukrainian refugee.",
      "In that case, they found mass transit system foothold to bring the federal case.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Scott, as you well know, in instances like this, authorities struggle to stay with the facts as they are known and as they evolve.",
      "But there is rampant online speculation, rumormongering about motive. Authorities still very early in the stages of trying to identify one, if it exists\u2026",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: And the F\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: \u2026 and can properly characterized.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: And it's happening at a moment of change inside the U.S. Department of Justice. The FBI has new leadership, and this really is a first big test for the new FBI leadership.",
      "And the grades are incomplete right now. It was the father who seems to have turned in his son in this case, and the FBI director was called on some social media posts that were conflicting with other information, saying a subject was in custody, then a subject was released.",
      "And the FBI director also posted this weekend: \"Against all law enforcement recommendations, we released that video of the suspect.\" Governor of Utah today said: \"We certainly never recommended against releasing video.\"",
      "So there's some questions to answer for the FBI as this week begins.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Little bit of tension there.",
      "Scott MacFarlane, thank you very much.",
      "We turn now to the speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, who joins us this morning from Baton Rouge, Louisiana.",
      "Mr. Speaker, it's good to see you. I appreciate your time.",
      "The burdens of speakership are always manifold. You know that. Previous speakers I have covered know that, but they feel particularly heavy after the events of this week. I just want to ask you, Mr. Speaker, how are you doing?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON (R-Louisiana): I'm doing OK, Major. Thanks for asking it.",
      "No question, it was a difficult week for the country. Certainly, it was felt on Capitol Hill. There's a mixture of anger and sadness and fear, frankly, on the part of a lot of people. It cast a large shadow across the country and the nation's capital.",
      "But what I do know, Major, is that my good friend Charlie would not want any of us to be consumed by despair. He would want us to go forward boldly. That was his message, and to do it in love. And I think that, I hope, is the message that continues in the days ahead.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: It's not common for this show to pick up on something said by Connecticut's Young Democrats and Connecticut's Young Republicans, but they put out a statement that has gotten quite a bit of attention on the Internet, saying, as follows: \"There is no place in our country for such acts, regardless of political disagreements.\"",
      "Do you believe, on Capitol Hill, there will be a method to forge any sort of bipartisan remembrance of Charlie Kirk?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: There will be.",
      "We had a moment of prayer and silent reflection on the floor on Wednesday, within an hour of his passing. There will be \u2013 I participated in a large vigil here in Baton Rouge at LSU, my alma mater, on Friday night. Tonight, we will have a big, I hope, bipartisan prayer and reflection vigil in Capitol Hill, at the Kennedy Center.",
      "There will be a members reflection and prayer moment that I will lead on Monday night. This will continue. I think that the country needs to see leaders in Congress and leaders with platforms all around the country speaking truth and bringing calm to the situation.",
      "We should appeal, as Lincoln reminded us so many years ago, to the better angels among us all. And I think this is a real moment for Amer (AUDIO GAP) affirmatively. And I think one of the ways to do that, Major, is to adopt the manner of Charlie Kirk, because while he loved vigorous debate and he believed in the free marketplace of ideas and advancing truth boldly, he also was motivated by love for his fellow man, because he never hated the person on the other side of the table.",
      "And I think everyone would do well to be reminded of that model.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Mr. Speaker, you mentioned the word fear a moment ago. It is on the lips of members of Congress in ways I have never experienced before. They are talking openly. They already have canceled events.",
      "Other members are talking about whether or not it's proper, and there are family conversations, to seek reelection. How do you feel this particular space of anxiety for your membership, Republican and Democrat?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Yes.",
      "Well, I have been talking with a lot of them over the last few days about that and trying to calm the nerves to assure them that we will make certain that everyone has the level of security that's necessary, that the resources will be there for their residential security and their personal security.",
      "We're evaluating all the options for that, but also to be reminded that it does take a certain measure of courage to step out and to lead. I mean, our first responders do it every day. Our members of the military do it every day and political figures as well.",
      "But I think, if we all adopt these practices together and we turn down the rhetoric, we cease with this idea that policy disputes are somehow an existential threat to democracy or the republic, we stop calling one another names \u2013 I mean, calling people Nazis and fascists is not helpful.",
      "Look, there are some deranged people in society. And when they see leaders using that kind of language so often now, increasingly, it spurs them on to action. We have to recognize that reality and address it appropriately.",
      "And I'm heartened to know, Major, and to see that many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are stepping up and saying that and addressing it. I think this could be a turning point, frankly, to use Charlie's term, for the country. And I hope that's true.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Would that turning point, from your vantage point, Mr. Speaker, because I know you had a long conversation with President Trump, extend to the White House itself?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Well, of course.",
      "Look, the president knew Charlie very well. He was like a family member to the Trumps. Many of us felt that close association with him. And he admired Charlie's approach to public debate. And you have heard him say that publicly. He was \u2013 Charlie was a good man.",
      "And I think the best way we honor his memory is to continue to do that very thing and not shy away from debate, to keep the free marketplace of ideas going, but to work on the tone of those debates, because I think that serves the best of our principles, our Judeo-Christian heritage as a nation, our civil discourse, and we got to return to that.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Mr. Speaker, several issues pending before Congress, not the least of which is keeping the government open.",
      "I know you prefer a seven-week clean C.R., but there is a press for other issues, extending Obamacare tax subsidies. There's been a push this weekend for Russia sanctions backed by Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, in the Senate. Will either of those, from your vantage point, get into something to keep the government open?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Well, listen, we have been working very hard in the House to restore regular order in the appropriations government funding process, and that's something that no one's really seen for a long time on Capitol Hill.",
      "But I'm encouraged that, in a bipartisan fashion, our House Appropriations Committee has passed all 12 of the annual appropriations bills through the committee. We have got three off the House floor. The Senate's passed a few. And then last week we voted to move into a conference\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: OK, Mr. Speaker, I believe there's a technical glitch that has forced us to lose your audio.",
      "We're going to take a quick break, and we will come right back to House Speaker Mike Johnson in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in just a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to Face the Nation.",
      "Because technical gremlins lurk everywhere, they got in between my conversation with House Speaker Mike Johnson.",
      "Mr. Speaker. I'm glad to have you back.",
      "You were in the middle of answering about Obamacare tax subsidies, possible sanctions against Russia and a government funding mechanism. Please continue.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Yes, sorry about the interruption there.",
      "Listen, we're very encouraged that we have been able to restore the regular appropriations, regular order process in the House.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Right, but are we going to get this done? Are those two other things going to be added to the process, Mr. Speaker?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: We will have to see.",
      "I have got to build consensus around all of it, but I think we will need a short-term funding measure, a clean C.R. that will allow more time to figure all this out. And we certainly hope that Democrats will go along on that, because, if not, they really have no excuse.",
      "If they shut the government down, it would be their unilateral decision to do so.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And when Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, says, as he did this weekend, now is the time for Russia sanctions, President Trump opened the door on tariffs against India and China as a way to create economic leverage to end the war in Ukraine, where do you stand on all that?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Well, listen, I do believe that desperate times call for desperate measures.",
      "And I think appropriate sanctions on Russia are far overdue. I mean, I think there's a big appetite for that in Congress. So we're willing to work with the White House and our Senate colleagues in the House to get that done, and I'm anxious to do it personally.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Are you waiting for the president to give you the green light, or might Congress act on this on its own volition?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Well, Congress really can't do this on its own volition, because, of course, the president would need to sign whatever you do into law. So it has to be a partnership.",
      "But we have defer to the commander in chief. I mean, the president is a strong and bold leader on the world stage. He has brokered peace around the world in other conflicts in a way that no one before him has been able to do. And so we're trusting that he can use that same force and that same approach to bring about finally an end to this war in Ukraine.",
      "Everyone in America wants that bloodshed to end, and President Trump is forcing that. And I certainly\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: OK, Mr. Speaker, I'm told that the technical difficulties keep arising, so a bit prematurely, we're going to end our conversation here to spare you and spare our audience from continued mayhem by technical gremlins.",
      "Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the time. Thank you for joining us on Face the Nation very much.",
      "Jill Schlesinger joins now \u2013 joins us now. She's CBS News business analyst. She's on Long Island, as she often is when we talk.",
      "Jill, I'm pleased to see you.",
      "Look, everyone expects the Federal Reserve to cut rates this coming week. That's not a mystery. I guess the only mystery is, is it 25 basis points or 50 basis points? And if it's 50, how much more of a difference might that make?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Well, I think it's more likely to be a quarter-of-a- percentage point, at least for this meeting.",
      "And, remember, what is the Fed's job? It's got \u2013 they have got to keep into balance two big priorities. And these are big. One is to make sure the economy grows enough to create jobs for anyone who wants a job. And the other priority is to kind of keep a lid on prices, to control inflation or deflation.",
      "Right now, if you look at the Fed's job, it's a real tough one, because the job market is weakening at the same time that inflation is reaccelerating. Now, remember, we are not going back to scary post-pandemic inflationary surge, but inflation is starting to move in the wrong direction.",
      "But I think the Fed's outlook is, hey, it's the job market that is getting slower, faster. We have got to concentrate on that. I think they go a quarter-of-a-percentage point, rather than a half-of-a-percentage point, at least to get things restarted.",
      "Major, it was exactly a year ago when they began their rate cuts. Back in September of last year, they cut by a half-a-percentage point because they felt like inflation was moving down very quickly. I don't think that's the case this time.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jill, the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, frequently says the Fed and he are data-dependent. That's probably a virtue, except when the data is messy and cloudy and full of conflicting signals.",
      "That seems to be prevalent right now.",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Well, I think there is a real problem, in that, if you look at the last five years, our data is all over the place. The pandemic really did create a doozy of a problem on the economy, but also the way we track the economy.",
      "And I know people got really freaked out about those preliminary estimates to the revisions to all that data for the 12 months through March of this year. That preliminary revision showed 911,000 fewer jobs than we originally thought. Now, this is always part of an annual process. We will get the final number in February.",
      "But what I guess is important is, there are so many different aspects to what's going on in the economy right now. The crosscurrents are really difficult. So, yes, we know the labor market is weakening, but we're not seeing widespread job losses, thank goodness. There is no evidence that we are in a recession currently.",
      "The economy is growing. But we do have that niggling problem of prices starting to rise again. And I think that that price increase, because of those tariffs, because of certain aspects, even the service economy, I think that's a real crosscurrent.",
      "And, to be clear, the Fed, the amazing people who work there, the amazing economists that are out there doing the research, so many of them say to me, you know what, this is the most difficult time to judge the next steps of the economy in the last 40 years.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jill, as you know, there's a phrase going around describing the job market, and it goes as follows: \"No fire, no hire.\"",
      "What does that mean practically for somebody in the job market or just graduating from college trying to break in?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Yes, this is a very difficult labor market. I mean, granted, we are \u2013 again, we are not like we are in a recession. We are not seeing widespread layoffs, thank goodness. There are pockets of layoffs that are happening in different sectors. We are seeing contractions. We're seeing people who are retiring and those jobs not being refilled.",
      "But I think that if anyone who has a job right now, when I talk to H.R. people, they basically say to me, hey, you know what? Tell people to stay where they are. Don't fly off the handle, the job-hugging, staying engaged with your boss, engaged with the company, very important right now.",
      "If you are seeking a job, you know, where the jobs are right now, we see the most activity in health care, health services. So, you're \u2013 if you're somebody who is trained to do one job, try to find a job in the sector at least that is adding positions. I might be a programmer and I might not have an ability to get a job at a big tech company.",
      "Maybe I go to a big hospital chain. These are the kinds of things. We have to kind of get outside of ourselves. The adaptable candidate is going to be the one that wins in this economy.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jill, let's talk about tariffs, because it is a conversation and a way of trying to assess that this country has no recent experience with, at least 50 or 60 years, of trying to assess what a tariff does when it is widespread throughout the global economy.",
      "So a lot of us are trying to get used to this. Economists are trying to get used to it. Policymakers are trying to get used to it. Our trading partners are trying to get used to it. What is the story of tariffs so far, and has it been fully written?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Nothing fully written, so very important here, because when those tariffs were announced in April, and then they were moved higher, and then they were frozen for a while, the tariff story was an uncertain one.",
      "I think it is that cloud of uncertainty that was really hanging over the labor market over the past four months. But, right now, what we do know is that the industries most directly impacted by tariffs are not hiring as much. We know that. We know that they are losing some jobs. We also know that tariffs are creeping into the economy, and not in a huge way yet.",
      "But what we are clear about is that prices are set to rise over the next, say, six months or so. Not great for holiday shopping, I know. But what we also know is that we consumers, we are very canny. Once those prices go up, we will switch and make different choices.",
      "So that is why economists believe that this kind of tariff regime is one where we will see prices rise, but not keep rising. Now, that does not really help you if you are going out and shopping. I understand that. But maybe the best news that I can have is that you are not going to feel like you did from the year 2021 to 2022, where it just felt like prices were going up, up, up, up, up.",
      "It is likely to be that prices and the Consumer Price Index, from the way that the Fed looks at this, the PCE index, these measures of inflation will start to rise over the next few weeks \u2013 few months. Then they will kind of steady.",
      "But the problem, Major, is that consumers are going to be stuck with price levels that are higher. And I think that is going to be very hard to swallow for anyone who is in the lower to middle earning category.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jill, one other part of the economic scenario I want to discuss with you, because when people talk about inflation, they say, just tell me what energy cost is and I will tell you what inflation is going to be.",
      "But yet there is a dual reality there.",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Yes.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Natural gas and prices at the pump are down, but electricity paid for by consumers, either businesses or at home, are up.",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Yes.",
      "I mean, the great news is that prices at the pumps, OK, totally happy with that. Everyone's good. The price of crude oil sort of in the low 60s, no problem. That electric \u2013 the electricity story is a story of artificial intelligence, because, to build artificial intelligence, it needs a lot of energy in the term \u2013 in terms of electricity or in the form of electricity.",
      "That's why you are seeing those prices go up. But, again, what I have come back to over this process of the last few years, the last five years of the \u2013 all these different impacts on the economy, we have never been here before. And so what I want to try to emphasize is that we can't hang our hat on what has happened in the past.",
      "Right now, I can look at a lot of different companies and say, wow, these companies are making a ton of money, big technology companies. We are seeing the S&P 500, the Nasdaq, the Dow all at all-time highs. And you have to reckon with the problem, the other side of that, which is, consumers feel burdened.",
      "And I think that's going to be the story of this year and next. How will consumers get out of this? If the labor market weakens from here, I think that's a problem. If we see a resumption of growth and the labor market starts to strengthen, the average worker will be able to afford what's going on in the economy.",
      "But it does come down to that labor market.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jill, deeply unfair, 40 seconds. What has A.I.'s influence been on the labor market?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: You know, hard to say. In 40 seconds, what I can tell you is, not yet. That's the major takeaway, because we know that there are some areas where there's a lot of hiring within A.I.",
      "There are companies that are using A.I. to increase their productivity. But there is no evidence yet that A.I. is taking everybody's job, so whew, whew. We have got a few minutes to worry about that.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: A few minutes to worry about that, among many other things.",
      "Jill Schlesinger, always a pleasure. Thank you so much for joining us.",
      "And we will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. I invite you to please stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: For a daily dose of political news, analysis, and so much more throughout the week, please join me for The Takeout. We're on every weeknight at 5:00 p.m. on our CBS News 24/7 streaming channel, also available on our apps, CBS News and Paramount+.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: We will be right back with Senators Chris Coons and James Lankford for a bipartisan conversation on uniting America, plus the leading researcher on political violence, University of Chicago Professor Robert Pape.",
      "Please stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to \"FACE THE NATION.\"",
      "For a look at how Congress may, may help bridge political divisions the country presently, we turn to a couple of lawmakers with a lot of experience in that space. Democratic Senator Chris Coons, who joins us from Wilmington, Delaware, Republican Senator James Lankford, who joins us from Oklahoma City.",
      "Gentlemen, you have a well-earned reputation both for preaching bipartisanship, taking the rhetorical temperature in Washington and nationwide down a notch or two.",
      "Senator Coons, I want to start with you. After the events of this week, do you feel that's harder than ever to achieve?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS COONS (D-DE): It is. And, Major, thank you for a chance to be on with you and with my friend, Senator Lankford.",
      "The brutal assassination of Charlie Kirk, while he was in the middle of a debate on a college campus, goes to the very heart of what it means to be American, of the importance of the First Amendment of free speech. And someone like Charlie Kirk, who was a nationally known figure, who dedicated himself to debate, to engagement with his political adversaries, should not have paid with his life for the opportunity to speak out. No matter how much I might deeply disagree with his political views, the idea that he would be killed in such a grotesque and public way has to bring all of us to reflect about how hard it's getting because the internet is an accelerant. It is driving extremism in our country. It's driving us apart left and right. And leaders like Senator Lankford, Governor Cox have an obligation and an opportunity to join with leaders from my party in urging folks to set aside any thought of political violence and to respect each other, even as we keep advancing our political differences through discourse.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Lankford, do you ever, at times, feel as if your appeals for better angels, calmer rhetoric, more bipartisanship is shouting into an internet void?",
      "SENATOR JAMES LANKFORD, (R-OK): It is because the algorithm pushes people to the most extreme. The algorithm is all \u2013 on social media is always pushing, who's the angriest, who's the loudest, who says the craziest things. That's what gets repeated over and over and over again. So, any time that there is cogent dialogue or an issue on something where people may disagree, but they're having a \u2013 a civil conversation on it, that gets pushed aside towards someone that's just angry and \u2013 and focused.",
      "This is somewhat human nature to be able to say we disagree. We find areas where we disagree, and we try to be able to solve those. The best way to be able to solve those is through words, talking it out, finding an opportunity to be able to do it. But I would tell you, this kind of anger is as old as Cain and Abel, to be able to go back and say, I'm mad at you, so I'm going to try to destroy you. Whether it's destroy you online or to try to humiliate you or to cancel you or to, in this case, try to murder you publicly. It is \u2013 it is painful to be able to see that part of humanity. And it is better for us to be able to push better angels.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Lankford, first to you, then Senator Coons.",
      "Senator Lankford, are you afraid for your own security right now?",
      "SENATOR JAMES LANKFORD: I am \u2013 I am attentive to my own security, how about that, for myself and for my family. My staff and I have to \u2013 have to talk through each public event. But we've had to do that for a while.",
      "As you may know well, there have been 14,000 threats against members of Congress just this calendar year. This is not new. But it continues to be able to rise. as we've seen Democratic lawmakers in Minnesota, in their own home, have a home invasion and be murdered in their home. As we've seen a governor in Pennsylvania have his home set on fire. It's not just public events, it's also in our private spaces as well that we're keenly aware that there are people that are irrational, that do irrational acts.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Coons?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS COONS: I agree that for all of us who serve in public life, whether it's leading a non-profit or a church, teaching in a school, or being a public advocate, someone engaged in public debate, as Charlie Kirk was, the risk is getting higher. And to have to worry about the safety of your own family, if you step forward to serve as a judge, if you write editorials, if you lead a non-profit or if you serve in Congress or run for president, to have to worry not just about your own physical safety but the safety of your spouse and children, I think, weakens our ability to have good and robust debates, to have a well-led nation and to demonstrate to the world that we're a nation committed to free speech, but where we reject political violence.",
      "So, of course, anyone in public life today is more concerned about the tragedy in Utah, about the incidents that Senator Lankford just referenced, the attempt to kidnap the governor of Michigan, to assault Speaker Pelosi's husband, the shooting of Steve Scalise and the shootings at other members of Congress. The recent incidents have gotten worse and worse, and I think I know the reason. It's principally because the internet is fueling and accelerating those deep-seated inclinations towards violence and seeing others as enemies, that James was referencing, and there are steps we can and should take in Congress to address that.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The administering this weekend, as I'm sure you two are both aware, putting before Congress $58 billion in security for members of Congress, the judiciary and the like.",
      "Senator Coons, you believe Congress will be disposed to agree to that?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS COONS: I hope that we will step up and invest more. I just hosted a bipartisan event last week on protecting state judges, and we had state judicial leaders from across the country, from Delaware and Texas and many other states, talk about harrowing incidents and tragic killings of the members of the judiciary. I hope we will invest in securing our public life because incidents like this tragedy in Utah, like the murder of Melissa and her husband, Mark Hortman, in Minnesota, frankly, fuel further anger in our country. And the ways in which folks are then taking the horrific images of these incidents and propagating them on the internet adds fuel to the fire.",
      "We can and should pass bills, as we just did, Senator Cruz and Senator Klobuchar worked together to pass, and President Trump signed into law, the Take It Down Act, to remove some of the most harmful pornographic revenge porn images from the internet. And we have a bill right in front of us, the Kids Online Safety Act, that's broadly bipartisan, that we should pass to help reduce some of the risks and harms to our families and our country from the internet.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Lankford, I misspoke, that's $58 million, not $58 billion, but it's a substantial sum.",
      "SENATOR JAMES LANKFORD: Yes, it is a substantial sum. What was funny was I was going to actually correct you on that, let you know it's an \"m\" not a \"b\" on that particular one. But it is something to be able to set aside and say, what are we doing? It's not \u2013 it is about the person and their family, but it's also about the title. It's about the task. Because that person represents that state, that \u2013 that part of the nation, that particular task.",
      "My wife and I often talk about the fact that I have this title of senator for a season. Someone else had it before me. Someone else will have it after me. But while I have it, I'm a steward of that task and that responsibility. And so, when we're talking about protecting judges and protecting individual, it's not just their personal safety, it is really declaring to the nation that we believe that these tasks are hard, that they should be intense debate, that we have very difference perspective. Chris Coons and I are very close friends, but have very different ideas on some things, but we have the ability to represent our individual states and set of ideas and to be able to talk those two things out and to be able to bring things together and say, I know areas where we disagree. Where do we agree? How can we solve it? That is where we are at our best as Americans is to say, we don't oppress each other. We try to be able to find common ground and to be able to move forward as we can.",
      "But as Chris has mentioned, the Oline Kids Safety Act is a great piece of legislation to be able to protect our kids. We are seeing people radicalized online on social media and through the internet in the United States by other Americans and by the algorithm that's there. And I will tell you, as recently as just a couple of weeks ago, I was in a school in Oklahoma, that now Oklahoma schools have banned all cellphones from bell to bell at school. You cannot have a cellphone on your \u2013 on your \u2013 on from bell to bell on campus. And the principals and the teachers all talk about how dramatically different the environment is on campus right now because people are looking up, people are interacting, people are talking again. They're not just staring at their phone. They're not getting fed all this vitriol all day long. And so, it changes the mood of everything just by looking at each other in the face and saying, let's see if we can work this out.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Lankford, I'm going to bring up something that's playing out through the country right now, and it's making all the things you and Senator Coons have talked about more difficult, which is, people who have posted about Charlie Kirk have jobs and are being fired because what they posted online has been viewed by their personnel directors or leaders as inappropriate. At any governmental level or in the private sector, are you comfortable having someone fired for an utterance about Charlie Kirk's death?",
      "SENATOR JAMES LANKFORD: Yes, this is about protecting the individual businesses. And what people are seeing is, in this cancel culture that still persists, that if you voice something that becomes a big pushback from the community, the employer will step up and say, hey, you're about to kill our business based on what you're saying online. Everyone has to understand what they say privately online can get connected to their business.",
      "We have a veterinarian clinic in Oklahoma City right now that \u2013 that one of the veterinarians posted something just absolutely horrific about now we're culling out the sick ones right after Charlie Kirk was murdered, that now there's been big pushback through that veterinary clinic because people are say, OK, this is the person \u2013 do I want to do business with that person if they have that belief?",
      "So, this is part of the challenge that we have with social media and with employments. Employers are going to say, don't hurt our business based on the foolish things that you choose to say to be able to say online.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Coons, how about within the federal government?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Well, the way James put it there, I think, is a good balance between, it's OK to have codes of conduct, to say to an employee, you shouldn't be speaking out on behalf of this company or this department of the federal government. Where your role, for example, requires that you be trusted, and that you not take partisan political positions. One of the challenges of the intersection of the line between social media and one's conduct on behalf of the government is that today we can see into your internal views.",
      "But it's not that new. So, let's imagine that you're a career federal prosecutor or you're a judge. Historically, there have been clear rules against engaging in partisan politics while you are performing those functions. The internet just makes it easier for folks to police and punish those who make statements that are considered extreme or out of the mainstream.",
      "Cancel culture is a real challenge to us, to balancing free speech with positions of responsibility. And we have to find our way through this together in a way that offers some grace and humility while celebrating the free speech that is the foundation of our republic and urging people to think twice before they post things that are outrageous online.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Lankford, the country's going to look to Congress here in the next couple of weeks to avert a government shutdown, also possibly extend soon to expire Affordable Care Act subsidies that help afford insurance. In this climate, and with those eyes on the nation upon Congress, how do you expect that to play out?",
      "SENATOR JAMES LANKFORD: I expect us to be able to solve the budget issues, which the American people expect to be able to do as well. These are hard issues. We're sent to be able to do hard things. We should do hard things on it. We should not, first and foremost, have a government shutdown. We have $37 trillion in debt right now. We should have hard conversations about debt and deficit, but they shouldn't be during a government shutdown.",
      "What we're currently arguing right now about is a seven-week extension on the current budget spending to say, we're not changing anything, but for the seven \u2013 next seven weeks, let's just hold it until we get a longer budget agreement and can actually come to agreement. What has been floated is a $300 billion requirement by some of my Democratic colleagues to say, if we don't spend an additional $300 billion, we're not going to keep the government open the next seven weeks. This is also a subsidy, an insurance subsidy, that was put in place during Covid, and just after Covid to say, due to the health care issues around Covid, we're going to extend additional insurance coverage that's there.",
      "Covid and the crisis of Covid is now past on it. It's difficult to say we should spent an additional $300 billion just to stay open the next seven weeks due to a Covid emergency at this point.",
      "So, yes, we'll have \u2013 we'll have hard conversations. But let's have it. Let's \u2013 let's talk it out and let's figure it out.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Coons, you're going to get the last word. Respond to Senator Lankford on that.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Well, this is an area where Senator Lankford and I disagree. We are both appropriators. We both want to find a way to work together, to keep the government open. But the Republican-only bill that was passed earlier this year, the so-called big, beautiful bill, threatens to raise rates for health care for millions of Americans and to throw millions more off of health care.",
      "I think there are ways we can reduce the harm to Americans' health care through the appropriations process. The bill that we both voted for in our committee in July would restore many of the proposed deep cuts to the National Institutes of Health, for example, one positive step forward. We have to find a way to resolve these issues and reduce or reverse some of the harm that's being done to Americans' health care.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Chris Coons, Delaware Democratic, James Lankford, Oklahoma Republican, thank you both. I appreciate it.",
      "And we'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back.",
      "We're going to take a closer look at the problem of political violence in America. And we're joined now, I'm glad to say, by University of Chicago Professor Robert Pape. He is the founding director of the Chicago Project on Security and Threats.",
      "Professor, it's great to have you with us. Thanks for joining us.",
      "What are the trend lines and what is the key terminology you want my audience to understand?",
      "ROBERT PAPE (Professor of Political Science, University Of Chicago): We are now in a watershed moment for what I call the era of violent populism in America. This era is defined, first and foremost, by two factors. Number one, a rising tide of political violence on both the right and the left. And just think, and I'll only go back to 2002. Just think of the attack \u2013 the assassination attempt on Nancy Pelosi, Democratic leader of the House. Missed her. Almost killed her husband. The attempt on Brett Kavanaugh, conservative Supreme Court justice. Two attempts on Republican candidate Donald Trump. And then the \u2013 in Minnesota, just a few months ago, not just attempts, but actual assassinations of Democratic leaders. Josh Shapiro, governor of Pennsylvania. And now we see Charlie Kirk assassinated. And what we are seeing is this clear rising trend in numbers of attacks.",
      "Side by side with that, though, we are also seeing a rising tide, a groundswell of support for political violence on both the right and the left that corresponds with this rising trend of political violence on both the right and the left.",
      "Our center at the University of Chicago Project on Security and Threats, we have been conducting highly reliable national surveys on political violence \u2013 the support for political violence among Americans for over four years. We started this in the summer of 2021. Our most recent survey in May found higher levels of support for political violence on both the right and the left than we have ever seen. And that's one of the reasons why I rang the alarm bell with that big op-ed in \"The New York Times\" in June, saying, we're on the cusp of major political violence. And I'm sorry to say, we're now right in the grip of violent populism.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And in that survey data, is it that people who respond to your surveys say to reconcile myself to the political outcome I want, I will be willing to resort to violence. Is that the key connection point?",
      "ROBERT PAPE: The key connection is the particular political grievance. So, we asked, just give you an example, 39 percent of Democrats say they agree that the use of force is justified to remove Donald Trump from the presidency. When we go deeper to probe, what do they mean by use of force? Fifty-five percent are talking about assassinations. They're talking about lethal uses of force. That's why we use that term.",
      "On the right, we also asked \u2013 very same survey, we found 24 percent of Republicans agree that Donald Trump is justified in using the U.S. military to suppress Democratic protesters. So, these are very specific questions. We have a whole slew of these questions so that we really can speak with great precision about what are the grievances that people want to say use of force is justified. We know what the meaning of that term is. And then we can see, Democrat, Republican in the cross tabs.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Does your research buttress the point that both Senator Lankford and Senator Coons made, which is, the internet is an accelerant and amplifier?",
      "RICHARD PAPE: It's an accelerant, but it's not the root cause. So, studying this problem now for five years, I have found that, just as around the world, big, social change drives political violence. We see this in other countries around the world. But the details of the change vary.",
      "We are now moving, for the first time in our country's 250-year history, from a white majority democracy to a white minority democracy. In 1990, we were 76 percent non-Hispanic white. Today, we're 57 percent non-Hispanic white. It will be another ten years, maybe 15 if we deport a lot of those undocumented illegal immigrants, before we make the transition to a truly white minority democracy.",
      "Well, this generational change is happening \u2013 it started about ten years ago where the real tipping point generation and corresponds with the rise of Donald Trump, why his issue of immigration is meteoric, why it's morphed from immigration, meaning stop people costing the border, to now deporting mass numbers of people because there are people on the right who want to stop or reverse this, and also the virulent reaction to Donald Trump on the left, on parts of the left, who want to keep this going. This is really the taproot, and that's why we need to expect \u2013 this, left to its own devices, will get worse and be with us for ten years.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: So, this is a demographic story that is creating a political backlash that gets amplified and accelerated online? Do I have that right?",
      "RICHARD PAPE: Yes. You've got it exactly right. And these are why \u2013 it's not the internet is not important, it's a reinforcing factor. And there is a \u2013",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: In other words, it's too simplistic to say it's the internet?",
      "RICHARD PAPE: Exactly, because that's what \u2013 a few years ago, people challenged my findings and I said, oh, no, no, we'll just deplatform people. So, the problem here is just the internet, so we're going to de- platform x, y, and z. We de-platformed x, y, and z. And, you know what, didn't miss a beat.",
      "And the reason is because, yes, it is an additional \u2013 it's like throwing gasoline on the fire, but the internet is not the fire itself. There's something going on, which is really radicalizing our politics. And I'm sorry to say, this is a story that we see around the world, in other countries, other times, and so this is \u2013 this is the social change leading to radicalized politics that changes winners and losers in our society for real, and that's leading to political violence.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Professor, it has always been a hallmark of this country, we have sort of thought about ourselves as having this experiment that has lots of differences of opinion, spasms of violence, but in the end we reconcile and move forward. Are you any more or less optimistic about that and that underlying assumption about the core ability of America than you were previously?",
      "RICHARD PAPE: The future is in our hands. This is not locked in with destiny. That said, if we do nothing, this will keep getting worse. The number one thing we have to do is we need our political leaders to step up. And we just saw an instance of that, just previously, where we have senators from both sides of the aisle making a joint video appearance. Well, that's really quite \u2013 to condemn violence. That's important because the leaders can restrain their own constituents. When they bad-mouth the other side's constituents, our data shows, that makes everything worse. That's the worst of all possible worlds because it produces defiance. We need to step that up. What would step that up? A summit between President Trump, Governor Newsom and Governor Pritzker, a public session where they all together condemn political violence.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Professor Pape, I am very glad you're here. Modeling behavior matters in many contexts in life, political and otherwise. Thank you very much.",
      "We'll be back in just a moment.",

    "summary": "Rep. Michael McCaul, a foreign policy leader who had strongly supported Ukraine, warned Sunday that Russian President Vladimir Putin is \"testing the resolve of NATO.\"",
    "story": [
      "Texas Republican Rep. Michael McCaul, a foreign policy leader who formerly chaired the House Homeland Security and Foreign Affairs Committees, announced Sunday that he will not seek reelection in 2026 after 11 terms.",
      "On ABC's \"This Week,\" McCaul called it \"the honor of a lifetime\" to serve his constituents of central Texas and chair the two Congressional House committees.",
      "He said he will serve out the remainder of his term but is looking for a \"new challenge\" in the national security and foreign policy realm. In a post on X shortly after the announcement, McCaul wrote that he's \"ready for a new challenge in 2027\".",
      "\"I want to continue to serve the people in this country in national security and foreign policy, and do what I've done the last two decades \u2013 make America stronger and the world safer,\" McCaul said.",
      "McCaul had served as chairman of the powerful House Foreign Affairs Committee and had been one of the strongest advocates for U.S. support for Ukraine. On Sunday, he disputed Mr. Trump's comments last week that the incursion of Russian drones over Poland's airspace could be a mistake.",
      "\"With all deference to the president, I don't think that was a mistake. I think [Russian President Vladimir] Putin is testing the resolve of NATO,\" McCaul said.",
      "McCaul did not announce any plans to run for another office, joining two other House Republicans who have announced they plan to retire. McCaul is one of only four Republicans from Texas whose time in the House predates President Trump's first term.",
      "His announcement comes amid a time of change for Texas Republicans as state lawmakers have pushed through a rare mid-decade redistricting in an effort to gain more seats for the party in the U.S. House. Although according to a CBS News analysis of the districts based on the 2024 vote for Mr. Trump, the ideological makeup of McCaul's district is not likely to change much.",
      "McCaul joins two other Texas Republicans who have already announced they will not seek reelection, although one of them, Rep. Chip Roy, has announced he will instead run for Texas Attorney General.",
      "McCaul most recently led a multi-year investigation into the U.S. withdrawal from Aghanistan, in which 13 service members were killed in a suicide bombing in Kabul. He spoke to \"Face the Nation\" last year about the report, criticizing President Biden who he claimed \"[prioritized] politics and his personal legacy over America's national security interests\".",
      "In 2023 as chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, McCaul led a bipartisan delegation of House members to Taiwan to meet with Taiwanese business leaders and senior government officials in an effort to strengthen economic and defense relationships. The representative was sanctioned by the Chinese Communist Party after the visit, which McCaul wore as \"a badge of honor\".",
      "McCaul told \"This Week\" that the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks changed his life. Before becoming a member of Congress, he worked as a counterterrorism federal prosecutor with the Department of Justice. Looking back at his career as a congressmember, McCaul recounted the events he's seen.",
      "\"I saw the rise of ISIS in the caliphate. As chairman of Foreign Affairs, I saw Afghanistan fall and Putin invade Ukraine, and the Middle East on fire, and then the threat from Chairman Xi and China and the Indo-Pacific,\" McCaul said.",
      "Rep. Brian Mast, the Florida Republican who now serves as chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, thanked McCaul in a statement on X \"for being a great leader in the U.S. House\" and \"for setting the example of how to be a diplomat and statesman\".",
      "Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican who is also a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, called McCaul his \"mentor and friend\" and said he is a \"tremendous leader protecting America at home and abroad\" in a post on X.",
      "McCaul's announcement comes at a time when a number of Representatives are leaving their seats at the end of the term to seek other offices, primarily in the U.S. Senate and at the gubernatorial level.",

      "\"No matter how much I might deeply disagree with his political views, the idea that he would be killed in such a grotesque and public way has to bring all of us to reflect about how hard it's getting, because the internet is an accelerant,\" Coons said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Kirk was shot and killed at Utah Valley University last week in what officials described as a \"targeted attack.\" The assassination has spurred calls for lowering the political temperature nationwide, along with efforts to improve bipartisan dialogue in Washington.",
      "Sen. James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican, appeared alongside Coons on Sunday as the two men made an appeal to bipartisanship amid the divisive political climate. Lankford echoed Coons' concerns about the internet and extremism to CBS News' chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett, saying calls for bipartisanship can be drowned out because \"the algorithm pushes people to the most extreme.\"",
      "\"Social media is always pushing who's the angriest, who's the loudest, who says the craziest thing\u00a0\u2014\u00a0that's what gets repeated over and over and over again,\" Lankford said. \"So anytime that there is cogent dialog or an issue on something where people may disagree, but they're having a civil conversation on it, that gets pushed aside towards someone that's just angry and focused.\"",

Coons noted that the measure has broad bipartisan support, saying it should be passed \"to help reduce some of the risks and harms to our families and our country from the internet.\"",
      "Lankford called the bill \"a great piece of legislation to be able to protect our kids,\" adding that \"we are seeing people radicalize online.\" And he pointed to a cell phone ban in Oklahoma schools that he said teachers have touted for creating a \"dramatically different\" environment.",
      "\"People are looking up, people are interacting, people are talking again,\" Lankford said. \"They're not just staring at their phone. They're not getting fed all this vitriol all day long. And so it changes the mood of everything just by looking at each other in the face and saying, 'let's see if we can work this out.'\"",
      "The comments come after Utah Gov. Spencer Cox called social media a \"cancer on our society\" in the aftermath of Kirk's assassination last week. Cox encouraged people to \"log off, turn off, touch grass, hug a family member, go out and do good in your community.\"",
      "Cox built on the sentiment Sunday, saying on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that social media has \"played a direct role in every single assassination and assassination attempt that we have seen over the last five, six years.\"",

      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to \"Face The Nation.\" For a look at how Congress may- may help bridge political divisions in the country presently, we turn to a couple of lawmakers with a lot of experience in that space. Democratic Senator Chris Coons, who joins us from Wilmington, Delaware, Republican Senator James Lankford, who joins us from Oklahoma City. Gentlemen, you have a well-earned reputation, both, for preaching bipartisanship, taking the rhetorical temperature in Washington and nationwide down a notch or two. Senator Coons, I want to start with you. After the events of this week, do you feel that's harder than ever to achieve?",
      "SEN. CHRIS COONS: It is. And, Major, thank you, for a chance to be on with you and with my friend, Senator Lankford. The brutal assassination of Charlie Kirk, while he was in the middle of a debate on a college campus, goes to the very heart of what it means to be American, of the importance of the First Amendment, of free speech, and someone like Charlie Kirk, who was a nationally known figure, who dedicated himself to debate, to engagement with his political adversaries, should not have paid with his life for the opportunity to speak out. No matter how much I might deeply disagree with his political views, the idea that he would be killed in such a grotesque and public way has to bring all of us to reflect about how hard it's getting, because the internet is an accelerant. It is driving extremism in our country. It's driving us apart, left and right, and leaders like Senator Lankford, Governor Cox, have an obligation and an opportunity to join with leaders from my party in urging folks to set aside any thought of political violence and to respect each other, even as we keep advancing our political differences through discourse.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Lankford, do you ever at times feel as if your appeals for better angels, calmer rhetoric, more bipartisanship, is shouting into an internet void?",
      "SEN. JAMES LANKFORD: It is, because the algorithm pushes people to the most extreme. The algorithm is all- on social media is always pushing who's the angriest, who's the loudest, who says the craziest thing, that's what gets repeated over and over and over again. So anytime that there is cogent dialogue or an issue on something where people may disagree, but they're having a civil conversation on it, that gets pushed aside, towards someone that's just angry and focused. This is somewhat human nature, to be able to say, we disagree. We find areas where we disagree, and we try to be able to solve those. The best way to be able to solve those is through words, talking it out, finding an opportunity to be able to do it. But I would tell you, this kind of anger is as old as Cain and Abel. To be able to go back and say, I'm mad at you, so I'm going to try to destroy you, whether it's destroy you online, or to try to humiliate you, or to cancel you, or to, in this case, try to murder you publicly. It is- it is painful to be able to see that part of humanity, and it is better for us to be able to push better angels.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Lankford, first you, then Senator Coons. Senator Lankford, are you afraid for your own security right now?",
      "SEN. LANKFORD: I am- I am attentive to my own security, how about that, for myself and for my family. My staff and I have to- have to talk through each public event, but we've had to do that for a while. As you may know well, there have been 14,000 threats against members of Congress just this calendar year. This is not new, but it continues to be able to rise. As we've seen, Democratic lawmakers in Minnesota, in their own home, have a home invasion, to be murdered in their home, as we've seen a governor in Pennsylvania have his home set on fire. It's not just public events, it's also in our private spaces as well, that we're keenly aware that there are people that are irrational, that do irrational acts.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Coons?",
      "SEN. COONS: I agree that for all of us who serve in public life, whether it's leading a nonprofit or a church, teaching in a school, or being a public advocate, someone engaged in public debate as Charlie Kirk was, the risk is getting higher. And to have to worry about the safety of your own family, if you step forward to serve as a judge, if you write editorials, if you lead a nonprofit, or if you serve in Congress or run for president, to have to worry not just about your own physical safety, but the safety of your spouse and children, I think, weakens our ability to have good and robust debates, to have a well-led nation, and to demonstrate to the world that we're a nation committed to free speech, but where we reject political violence. So of course, anyone in public life today is more concerned about the tragedy in Utah, about the incidents that Senator Lankford just referenced, the attempt to kidnap the governor of Michigan, to assault Speaker Pelosi's husband, the shooting of Steve Scalise and the shootings at other members of Congress. The recent incidents have gotten worse and worse and I think I know the reason. It's principally because the internet is fueling and accelerating those deep-seated inclinations towards violence and seeing others as enemies that James was referencing. And there are steps we can and should take in Congress to address that.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The administration this weekend, as I'm sure you two are both aware, putting before Congress $58 billion in security for members of Congress, the judiciary and the like. Senator Coons, you believe Congress will be disposed to agree to that?",
      "SEN. COONS: I hope that we will step up and invest more. I just hosted a bipartisan event last week on protecting state judges, and we had state judicial leaders from across the country, from Delaware and Texas and many other states, talk about harrowing incidents and tragic killings of members of the judiciary. I hope we will invest in securing our public life, because incidents like this tragedy in Utah, like the murder of Melissa and her husband Mark Hortman in Minnesota, frankly, fuel further anger in our country, and the ways in which folks are then taking the horrific images of these incidents and propagating them on the internet, adds fuel to the fire. We can and should pass bills, as we just did. Senator Cruz and Senator Klobuchar worked together to pass, and President Trump signed into law, the TAKE IT DOWN Act, to remove some of the most harmful pornographic, revenge porn images from the internet. And we have a bill right in front of us, the Kids Online Safety Act that's broadly bipartisan, that we should pass to help reduce some of the risks and harms to our families in our country, from the internet.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Lankford, I misspoke that's 58 million, not 58 billion, but it's a substantial sum.",
      "SEN. LANKFORD: Yeah, it is a substantial sum. What was funny was I was going to actually correct you on that, to let you know it's an 'M', not a 'B' on that particular one, but it is something to be able to set aside and say, what are we doing? It's not- it is about the person and their family, but it's also about the title. It's about the task, because that person represents that state, that- that part of the nation, that particular task, my wife and I often talk about the fact that I have this title of senator for a season. Someone else had it before me, someone else will have it after me. But while I have it, I'm a steward of that task and that responsibility. And so when we're talking about protecting judges and protecting individuals, it's not just their personal safety. It is really declaring to the nation that we believe that these tasks are hard, that there should be intense debate, that we have very different perspectives. Chris Coons and I are very close friends, but we have very different ideas on some things. But we have the ability to be able to represent our individual states instead of ideas, and to be able to talk those two things out, and to be able to bring things together and say, I know areas where we disagree, where do we agree? How can we solve it? That is where we are at our best as Americans is to say we don't oppress each other. We try to be able to find our common ground and to be able to move forward as we can and- but as Chris has mentioned, the online kids safety Act is a great piece of legislation to be able to protect our kids. We are seeing people radicalize online, on social media and through the internet in the United States, by other Americans and by the algorithm that's there. And I would tell you, as recently as just a couple of weeks ago, I was in a school in Oklahoma that now Oklahoma schools have banned all cell phones from bell to bell at school. You cannot have a cell phone on your- on your- on from bell to bell on campus. And the principals and the teachers all talk about how dramatically different the environment is on campus right now because people are looking up, people are interacting. People are talking again. They're not just staring at their phone. They're not getting fed all this vitriol all day long. And so it changes the mood of everything just by looking at each other in the face and saying, let's see if we can work this out.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Lankford, I'm going to bring up something that's playing out through the country right now, and it's making all the things you and Senator Coons have talked about more difficult, which is people who have posted about Charlie Kirk have jobs and are being fired because what they've posted online has been viewed by their personnel directors or leaders as inappropriate. At any governmental level or in the private sector, are you comfortable having someone fired for an utterance about Charlie Kirk's death?",
      "SEN. LANKFORD: Yeah, this is about protecting the individual businesses. And what people are seeing is this cancel culture that still persists, that if you voice something that becomes a big push back from the community, the employer will step up and say, hey, you're about to kill our business based on what you're saying online. Everyone has to understand what they say privately online can get connected to their business. We have a veterinarian clinic in Oklahoma City right now that one of the veterinarians posted something just absolutely horrific about--and now we're calling out the sick ones right after Charlie Kirk was murdered that now there's been big pushback through that veterinary clinic, because people are saying, okay, this is the person- do I want to do business with that person if they have that belief? So this is part of the challenge that we have with social media and with employments. Employers are going to say, don't hurt our business based on the foolish things that you choose to say, to be able to say online.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Coons, how about within the federal government?",
      "SEN. COONS: Well, the way James put it there, I think, is a good balance between it's okay to have codes of conduct to say to an employee, you shouldn't be speaking out on behalf of this company or this department of the federal government, where your role, for example, requires that you be trusted and that you not take partisan political positions. One of the challenges of the intersection of the line between social media and one's conduct on behalf of the government is that today we can see into your internal views. But it's not that new. So, let's imagine that you're a career federal prosecutor or you're a judge. Historically, there have been clear rules against engaging in partisan politics while you're performing those functions. The internet just makes it easier for folks to police and punish those who make statements that are considered extreme or out of the mainstream. Cancel culture is a real challenge to us, to balancing free speech with positions of responsibility, and we have to find our way through this together in a way that offers some grace and humility while celebrating the free speech that is the foundation of our republic, and urging people to think twice before they post things that are outrageous online.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Lankford, the country is going to look to Congress here in the next couple of weeks to avert a government shutdown. Also possibly extend soon to expire Affordable Care Act subsidies that help people afford insurance. In this climate and with those eyes of the nation upon Congress, how do you expect that to play out?",
      "SEN. LANKFORD: I expect us to be able to solve the budget issues, which the American people expect to be able to- to do as well. These are hard issues. We're sent to be able to do hard things. We should do hard things on it. We should not, first and foremost, have a government shutdown. We have $37 trillion in debt right now. We should have hard conversations about debt and deficit, but they shouldn't be during a government shutdown. What we're currently arguing right now about is a seven-week extension on the current budget spending, to say we're not changing anything, but for the next seven weeks, let's just hold it until we get a longer budget agreement and can actually come to agreement. What has been floated is a $300 billion requirement, by some of my Democratic colleagues, to say, if we don't spend an additional $300 billion, we're not going to keep the government open the next seven weeks. This is also a subsidy, an insurance subsidy, that was put in place during COVID and just after COVID, to say, due to the health care issues around COVID, we're going to extend additional insurance coverage that's there. COVID and the crisis of COVID has now passed on it, it's difficult to say we should spend an additional $300 billion just to stay open the next seven weeks due to a COVID emergency at this point. So yes, we'll have- we'll have hard conversations, but let's have it. Let's- let's talk it out. Let's figure it out.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Coons, you're going to get the last word. Respond to Senator Lankford on that.",
      "SEN. COONS: Well, this is an area where Senator Lankford and I disagree. We are both appropriators. We both want to find a way to work together to keep the government open, but the Republican-only bill that was passed earlier this year, the so-called Big Beautiful Bill, threatens to raise rates for health care for millions of Americans and to throw millions more off of health care. I think there are ways we can reduce the harm to Americans' healthcare through the appropriations process. The bill that we both voted for in our committee in July would restore many of the proposed deep cuts to the National Institutes of Health for example, one positive step forward. We have to find a way to resolve these issues and reduce or reverse some of the harm that's being done to Americans' health care.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Chris Coons, Delaware Democrat. Senator James Lankford, Oklahoma Republican. Thank you both. I appreciate it. And we'll be right back."

    "summary": "House Speaker Mike Johnson said \"I think this could be a turning point\" for the country in the aftermath of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's death, urging leaders to \"turn down the rhetoric.\"",
    "story": [
      "In the wake of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, House Speaker Mike Johnson said Sunday that \"I think this could be a turning point\" for the country, while urging leaders to \"turn down the rhetoric\" amid a divisive political climate.",
      "Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that lawmakers should stop treating policy disputes as an \"existential threat to democracy or the Republic,\" while urging them to stop \"calling one another names.\"",
      "\"Calling people Nazis and fascists is not helpful,\" Johnson said. \"There are some deranged people in society, and when they see leaders using that kind of language so often now increasingly, it spurs them on to action. We have to recognize that reality and address it appropriately.\"",
      "The speaker told CBS News' chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett that he's \"heartened to know\" that lawmakers on both sides of the aisle \"are stepping up and saying that and addressing it.\"",
      "Kirk was shot and killed at Utah Valley University last week in what authorities have described as a \"targeted attack.\" Authorities have arrested 22-year-old Tyler Robinson on charges of aggravated murder, obstruction of justice and felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury, according to an inmate booking sheet from the Utah County Sheriff's Office. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said Sunday that the suspect is not cooperating with authorities as they try to \"to learn more about what that motive actually was.\"",
      "The speaker outlined how Kirk's assassination has been felt on Capitol Hill, saying there's \"a mixture of anger and sadness and fear, frankly, on the part of a lot of people \u2014 it cast a large shadow across the country, and the nation's capital.\"",
      "\"My good friend Charlie would not want any of us to be consumed by despair,\" Johnson said. \"He would want us to go forward boldly, that was his message, and to do it in love. And I think that, I hope, is the message that continues in the days ahead.\"",
      "Johnson described the efforts to honor Kirk's memory in Congress, including a moment of prayer and silent reflection on the House floor Wednesday, shortly after Kirk's death, while outlining that a prayer and reflection vigil will be held at the Kennedy Center in Washington later Sunday, along with a moment for members' reflection and prayer that he will lead Monday.",
      "\"This will continue,\" Johnson said. \"I think that the country needs to see leaders in Congress and leaders with platforms all around the country speaking truth and bringing calm to the situation.\"",
      "Johnson invoked President Abraham Lincoln's appeal to the nation's \"better angels,\" while urging the adoption of \"the manner of Charlie Kirk.\"",
      "\"While he loved vigorous debate and he believed in the free marketplace of ideas and advancing truth boldly, he also was motivated by love for his fellow man, because he never hated the person on the other side of the table,\" Johnson said. \"And I think everyone would do well to be reminded of that model.\"",
      "The speaker said he's been speaking with members in recent days about the fear that those holding public office are feeling in the aftermath of Kirk's death and has been \"trying to calm the nerves to assure them that we will make certain that everyone has a level of security that's necessary.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the White House is sending a $58 million request to Congress to increase security for the executive and judicial branches in the wake of Kirk's assassination, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CBS News on Saturday. And the Trump administration expressed support for increased funding to protect congressional lawmakers, but may defer to the legislative branch.",
      "Johnson said House GOP leaders are \"evaluating all the options\" to ensure resources will be available for lawmakers' residential security and personal security. And he added that \"it does take a certain measure of courage to step out and to lead,\" saying first responders, members of the military and political figures do it every day.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with House Speaker Mike Johnson that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 14, 2025.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, who joins us this morning from Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, it's good to see you. I appreciate your time. The burdens of speakership are always manifold. You know that. Previous speakers I've covered know that, but they feel particularly heavy after the events of this week. I just want to ask you, Mr. Speaker, how are you doing?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: I'm doing okay, Major. Thanks for asking. No question, it was a difficult week for the country. Certainly, it was felt on Capitol Hill. There's a mixture of, you know, anger and sadness and fear, frankly, on the part of a lot of people. It cast a large shadow across the country and the nation's capital. But what I do know, Major, is that my good friend Charlie would not want any of us to be consumed by despair. He would want us to go forward boldly, that was his message, and to do it in love. And I think that, I hope, is the message that continues in the days ahead.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: It's not common for this show to pick up on something said by Connecticut's Young Democrats and Connecticut's Young Republicans, but they put out a statement that has gotten quite a bit of attention on the internet, saying as follows, \"there is no place in our country for such acts, regardless of political disagreements.\" Do you believe on Capitol Hill there will be a method to forge any sort of bipartisan remembrance of Charlie Kirk?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: There will be. You know, we had a moment of prayer and silent reflection on the floor on Wednesday within an hour of his passing. There will be, I participated in a large vigil here in Baton Rouge at LSU, my alma mater, on Friday night. Tonight, we'll have a big, I hope, bipartisan prayer and reflection vigil in Capitol Hill at the Kennedy Center. There will be a members reflection and prayer moment that I'll lead on Monday night. This will continue. I think that the country needs to see leaders in Congress and leaders with platforms all around the country speaking truth and bringing calm to the situation. We should appeal, as Lincoln reminded us so many years ago, to the better angels among us all. And I think this is a real moment for America [TECHNICAL DISRUPTION] -- affirmatively. And I think one of the ways to do that, Major, is to adopt the manner of Charlie Kirk because while he loved vigorous debate and he believed in the free marketplace of ideas, and advancing truth boldly, he also was motivated by love for his fellow man because he never hated the person on the other side of the table. And I think everyone would do well to be reminded of that model.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Mr. Speaker, you mentioned the word fear a moment ago. It is on the lips of members of Congress in ways I've never experienced before. They are talking openly. They already have canceled events. Other members are talking about whether or not it's proper in their family conversations to seek re-election. How do you feel this particular space of anxiety for your membership, Republican and Democrat?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: Yeah, well, I've been talking with a lot of them over the last few days about that and trying to calm the nerves, to assure them that we will, we will make certain that everyone has a level of security that's necessary, that the resources will be there for their residential security and their personal security. We're evaluating all the options for that. But also, to be- to be, you know, reminded that it does take a certain measure of courage to step out and- and to lead. I mean, our first responders do it every day, our members of the military do it every day and political figures as well. But I think if we all adopt these practices together and we turn down the rhetoric, we, you know, cease with this idea that, you know, policy disputes are somehow an existential threat to democracy or the republic, we stop calling one another names. I mean calling people Nazis and fascists is not helpful. Look, there are some deranged people in society and when they see leaders using that kind of language, so often now, increasingly, it spurs them on to action. We have to recognize that reality and address it appropriately. And I'm heartened to know, Major, and to see that many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are stepping up and saying that and addressing it. I think this could be a turning point, frankly, to use Charlie's term, for the country, and I hope that's true.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Would that turning point, from your vantage point, Mr. Speaker, because I know you had a long conversation with President Trump, extend to the White House itself?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: Well, of course. Look, the President knew Charlie very well. He was like a family member to the Trumps. Many of us felt that close association with him, and he admired Charlie's approach to public debate. And you've heard him say that publicly. He was- Charlie was a good man, and I think the best way we honor his memory is to continue to do that very thing, and not shy away from debate, to keep the free marketplace of ideas going, but to work on the tone of those debates. Because I think that- I think that serves the best of our principles, our Judeo-Christian heritage as a nation, our civil discourse, and we got to return to that.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Mr. Speaker, several issues pending before Congress, not the least of which is keeping the government open. I know you prefer a seven-week clean CR, but there is a press for other issues. Extending Obamacare tax subsidies. There's been a push this weekend for Russia sanctions backed by Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, in the Senate. Will either of those, from your vantage point, get into something to keep the government open?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: Well, listen, we've been working very hard in the House to restore regular order in the appropriations government funding process, and that's something that no one's really seen for a long time on Capitol Hill. But I'm encouraged that, in a bipartisan fashion, our House Appropriations Committee has passed all 12 of the annual appropriations bills through the committee. We've got three off the House floor. The Senate's passed a few, and then last week, we voted to move into a conference [TECHNICAL DISRUPTION] --",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: -- Okay, Mr. Speaker, I believe there's a technical glitch that has forced us to lose your audio. We're going to take a quick break, and we'll come right back to House Speaker Mike Johnson in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in just a moment.",
      "[COMMERCIAL BREAK]",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to Face the Nation. Because technical gremlins lurk everywhere, they got in between my conversation with House Speaker Mike Johnson. Mr. Speaker, I'm glad to have you back. You were in the middle of answering about Obamacare tax subsidies, possible sanctions against Russia and a government funding mechanism. Please continue.",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: Yeah, sorry about the interruption there. Listen, we're very encouraged that we've been able to restore the regular appropriations, regular order process --",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: -- Right, but are we going to get this done? Are those two other things going to be added to the process, Mr. Speaker?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: We'll have to see. I got to build consensus around all of it, but I think we'll need a short-term funding measure. A clean CR that will allow more time to figure all this out. We certainly hope that Democrats will go along on that, because, if not, they really have no excuse. If they shut the government down, it would be their unilateral decision to do so.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And when Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, says, as he did this weekend, now is the time for Russia sanctions. President Trump opened the door on tariffs against India and China as a way to create economic leverage to end the war in Ukraine. Where do you stand on all that?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: Listen, I do believe that desperate times call for desperate measures, and I think appropriate sanctions on Russia are far overdue. I mean, I think there's a big appetite for that in Congress, so we're willing to work with the White House and our Senate colleagues in the House to get that done and I'm anxious to do it, personally.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Are you waiting for the President to give you the green light or might Congress act on this on its own volition?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: Well, Congress really can't do this on its own volition because, of course, the President would need to sign whatever we do into law. So it has to be a partnership, but we defer to the commander in chief. I mean, the President is a strong and bold leader on the world stage. He has brokered peace around the world and other conflicts in a way that no one before him has been able to do, and so we're trusting that he can use that same force and that same approach to bring about, finally, an end to this war in Ukraine. Everyone in America wants that bloodshed to end, and President Trump is forcing that, and I certainly [TECHNICAL DISRUPTION]--",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Okay. Mr. Speaker, I'm told that the technical difficulties keep arising, so a bit prematurely we're going to end our conversation here to spare you and spare our audience from continued mayhem by technical gremlins. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the time. Thank you for joining us on Face the Nation."

      "Conservative activist Charlie Kirk was shot and killed at Utah Valley University on Wednesday as he addressed a large crowd at an outdoor debate. Officials described it as a \"targeted attack,\" and it drew\u00a0condemnation from both sides of the political aisle as authorities launched a massive search for the suspect.",
      "On Friday, officials announced they have a person in custody for the fatal shooting. They identified him as 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, who resides in southern Utah. Robinson was arrested on charges of aggravated murder, obstruction of justice and felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury, according to an inmate booking sheet from the Utah County Sheriff's Office.",
      "Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray is reviewing the evidence to determine the appropriate charges and plans to file them on Tuesday, Christopher Ballard, chief of staff for the Utah County Attorney's Office, confirmed to CBS Saturday. Robinson could make his first court appearance Tuesday afternoon, Ballard said.",
      "Kirk, who co-founded the right-wing advocacy group Turning Point USA, was 31. He is survived by his wife, Erika, and two young children.",
      "Turning Point USA announced Saturday that a public funeral for Kirk will be held on Sunday, Sept. 21, at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.",
      "Here is what we know so far about the assassination and ongoing investigation.",
      "Who is the suspect?",
      "More details about Robinson and what happened before and after the attack are emerging.",
      "Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said Robinson is not a student at Utah Valley University, where the attack took place, and has been living with his family in Washington County, located in the southwestern corner of the state. Family members said Robinson had \"become more political\" in recent years, the governor said.",
      "Utah State University said Robinson briefly attended the school for one semester in 2021. According to the Utah System of Higher Education, Robinson was a third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship program at Dixie Technical College in St. George, Utah.",
      "Robinson's father owns a business installing kitchen countertops and cabinets and his mother is a licensed social worker, according to public records and their social media accounts. Robinson is the oldest of three brothers.",
      "\"They are very supportive parents who loved their boys and are involved in the community,\" a neighbor who said she knew the Robinson family well but had not seen Robinson in a few years told CBS News. She also said the parents were supportive of the country and of President Trump.",
      "State records show that Robinson registered to vote as unaffiliated. He is listed as an inactive voter in state records, meaning he didn't vote in the last two elections. He was not old enough to vote in 2020.",
      "Robinson had no prior felony or misdemeanor convictions and no prior violent offenses, according to a Public Safety Assessment Report filed in Utah state court.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel said he was taken into custody at 10 p.m. local time Thursday night, though Utah officials said it was in the early hours of Friday. Records from the Utah County Sheriff's Office Corrections Division show he was booked into jail at 7:58 a.m. local time (9:58 a.m. ET).",
      "Mr. Trump first broke the news on \"Fox and Friends\" that someone had been taken into custody.",

      "Cox said messages on Discord, an instant messaging and social media platform, that were reviewed by investigators referenced a rifle wrapped in a towel that was left in the woods and engravings on bullets. The messages came from a person named \"Tyler\" and were shared with an unidentified individual, Cox said.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, a spokesperson for Discord said it had removed an account associated with Robinson for violating the company's \"off-platform behavior policy,\" which prohibits users from engaging in various forms of violence, and will continue to coordinate closely with law enforcement. The spokesperson also said Discord \"found no evidence that the suspect planned this incident or promoted violence\" on the platform itself.",
      "\"We are deeply saddened by this tragedy and extend our condolences to the Kirk family and everyone affected,\" the statement said. \"The messages referenced in recent reporting about planning details do not appear to be Discord messages. These were communications between the suspect's roommate and a friend after the shooting, where the roommate was recounting the contents of a note the suspect had left elsewhere.\"",
      "The governor said authorities believe Robinson acted alone and said there is currently no information that would lead to additional arrests. He told reporters Friday morning he can't answer questions about the possible motive of the suspect.",
      "Robinson is currently on \"special watch\" at the Utah County Jail while he is being evaluated to determine if he is a risk to himself or others, Utah County Sheriff's Spokesperson Sgt. Raymond Ormond told CBS News. Inmates are held in a special housing unit while on special watch.",
      "All inmates are given an initial screening after booking, but some are put on the more intensive special watch until they're screened, depending on the crimes they committed or things they said, Ormond said.",
      "How the suspect was captured",
      "Cox said Robinson's father recognized his son as the subject of photos that were released by law enforcement and urged him to turn himself in.",
      "Robinson admitted to his father that he was the person in the photos, two federal law enforcement sources told CBS News. Robinson said he would rather die by suicide than turn himself in, the federal law enforcement sources said.",
      "Robinson's father called a youth pastor who knows the 22-year-old and is close to the family, and he and the pastor tried to calm Robinson down. The sources said the pastor, who also serves as a court security officer, called the U.S. Marshals Service and other law enforcement agencies. Marshals  then detained Robinson and kept him secure while waiting for the FBI. The FBI later took him into custody.",
      "Investigators reviewed video footage and said they identified Robinson arriving on Utah Valley University's campus in a gray Dodge Challenger at around 8:29 a.m. local time Wednesday, the day of the shooting, according to the governor. Robinson was wearing a plain maroon T-shirt, light-colored shorts, a black hat with a white logo and light-colored shoes, Cox said.",
      "He is believed to have changed clothing on the roof, where the shot was fired from, before changing back into what he was originally wearing. When investigators encountered Robinson, he was wearing clothing consistent with that outfit, the governor said.",
      "Tracking the suspect",
      "On Thursday, Utah Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason described the suspect they were seeking as a male who \"blended in\" with the college community and appeared to be college age.",
      "The public safety department and the Salt Lake City FBI office posted images of someone they called a \"person of interest,\" showing an individual appearing to wear a dark long-sleeve shirt, a hat and sunglasses. More photos posted later on Thursday showed the person wearing a backpack.",
      "Mason said investigators were able to track the shooter's movements before and after the assassination.",
      "According to a probable cause statement filed by investigators after Robinson's arrest, investigators were able to track his movements on campus starting at approximately 11:50 a.m. local time on Wednesday. He was observed entering a building called the Losee Center near where Kirk's event was taking place, which was the shooting location, and going up to the roof, according to the statement.",
      "Mason said the shooter moved to the other side of the building after firing a single shot, then jumped off and fled into a neighborhood off campus. Investigators contacted homeowners with cameras and witnesses to identify leads, he said.",
      "In a news briefing Thursday evening in Orem, Utah, with Patel in attendance, officials released security video that showed a man \u2014 who Mason called a suspect \u2014 running across the roof and then climbing down the side of the building immediately after the shooting.",
      "As he climbed off the edge of the building and dropped down, he \"left some palm impressions, some smudges, some places we're looking to collect DNA,\" along with a shoe print that indicated he was wearing Converse tennis shoes, Mason told reporters while showing the video.",
      "\"It's important to note his black t-shirt, his black pants, and there appears to be some white on the soles of those Converse tennis shoes,\" Mason said. \"Those are all identifiable items that we're looking for.\"",
      "After dropping off the building, the video showed the man moving across a grassy area before entering traffic. Mason said he crossed the street into a wooded area, where the firearm believed to have been used in the shooting was later found.",
      "The FBI said it was offering a reward of up to $100,000 for information that leads law enforcement to identify and arrest the person or people involved in Kirk's assassination. Patel said authorities had received more than 11,000 leads as of Friday morning.",
      "Gun and bullet casings recovered",
      "FBI special-agent-in-charge Robert Bohls said Thursday that investigators recovered a \"high-powered, bolt-action rifle,\" which they believe was the weapon used in the assassination. It was found in a wooded area where the shooter fled and was wrapped in a towel, according to Bohls. The rifle was determined to be a Mauser .30-06-caliber bolt-action rifle, according to the probable cause statement.",
      "Cox said that there were inscriptions on the casings of the bullet that was fired, as well as on the casings of three bullets that were not fired.",
      "According to the probable cause statement, the fired bullet casing contained the inscription, \"Notices Buldge OWO what's this?\" An unfired bullet casing read, \"hey fascist! CATCH!\" followed by an up arrow symbol, a right arrow symbol and three down arrow symbols. And a second unfired casing read, \"O Bella ciao, Bella ciao, Bella ciao, Ciao, ciao!\" A third unfired casing said, \"If you read This, you are GAY Lmao.\"",
      "Cox didn't speculate on the meaning of the inscriptions.",
      "Investigators also have a footwear impression, palm print and forearm imprints that will be analyzed, the FBI official said.",
      "Timeline of \"targeted attack\"",
      "The event where Kirk was speaking was scheduled to begin in the UVU courtyard at noon.",
      "A CBS News review of livestream footage and video metadata indicates Kirk was shot around 12:23 p.m., which is also when the FBI's Patel said Kirk was shot. He was struck in the neck by a single gunshot.",
      "A map produced by CBS News' Confirmed team shows where Kirk was when he was shot \u2014 in the central courtyard of Utah Valley University, which is surrounded by campus buildings.",
      "A university spokeswoman said Wednesday that they believed the shot was fired from the Losee Center. A law enforcement source told CBS News that the gunman appeared to have fired from the building's roof.",
      "The FBI released a video\u00a0\u2014 timestamped at 12:23 p.m. local time \u2014 that appears to show a person climbing off a roof at Utah Valley University and fleeing the scene. Dispatch audio reviewed by CBS News described a person on the roof of a nearby building wearing black clothing and carrying a long rifle.",
      "Video captured at 2:37 p.m. shows officers searching an area around a quarter mile north of the campus.",
      "At 2:40, more than two hours after the shooting, Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social that Kirk had died.",
      "While authorities have not specified a potential motive for the shooting, Mason said they believe it was a \"targeted attack toward one individual.\" Only one shot was fired, and Kirk was the only victim, the commissioner said.",
      "Cox called the shooting \"a political assassination,\" while Mr. Trump, in a video posted to Truth Social, blamed it on \"radical left political violence,\" which he said \"has hurt too many innocent people and taken too many lives.\"",
      "Charlie Kirk's influence in politics",
      "Kirk was shot while he was speaking at a \"Prove Me Wrong\" debate, a trademark event for Kirk's Turning Point USA, which is a conservative organization focused on young people. He would hold political debates with a group that usually consisted of left-leaning attendees.",
      "Kirk had visited the Utah university as part of a nationwide tour of college campuses that was scheduled to continue for the next two months. About 3,000 people attended the outdoor event where he was assassinated, the Utah Department of Public Safety said in a statement.",
      "Mr. Trump called Kirk legendary, saying, \"No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie. He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us.\"",
      "Kirk was a close Trump ally and was credited with galvanizing younger voters during his campaign. He made it his mission to engage more young people in politics and register them to vote. Kirk was also a close friend of the president's son, Donald Trump Jr.",
      "Kirk was the host of \"The Charlie Kirk Show,\" a daily conservative talk radio show and amassed millions of followers on social media.",
      "Kirk's politics, however, weren't without controversy. He pushed false claims about voter fraud after Mr. Trump lost the 2020 presidential election, stoked skepticism about the COVID-19 pandemic and spread anti-trans rhetoric. He also amplified the \"Great Replacement\" conspiracy, which is based on the belief that there's a plot to replace White people with minorities.",
      "He was a friend of JD Vance, who said Kirk advocated \"in public and private\" for Mr. Trump to pick him as his running mate last year.",
      "\"So much of the success we've had in this administration traces directly to Charlie's ability to organize and convene,\" Vance said after Kirk was killed. \"He didn't just help us win in 2024, he helped us staff the entire government.\"",

    "summary": "The murder of Charlie Kirk last week follows a litany of violent acts against political targets. Historian Jon Meacham talks about the existential questions now facing America.",
    "story": [
      "For Jon Meacham, the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian, and author of \"The Soul of America: The Battle for Our Better Angels,\" this past week has been disturbing \u2014 and all too familiar. Asked what is the state of America's soul today, he replied, \"I think that we are in a dangerous place. There's never been a once-upon-a-time in American history. There's not going to be a happily-ever-after. But there are moments that you and I could agree we would like to see replicated \u2014 and this is not one of them.",
      "\"Political violence erupts in America when there is an existential question \u2014 who is an American? Who deserves to be included in 'We the people,' or 'All men being created equal'?\" he said. \"When that is in tension, when we don't have common agreement about that, then, if you look at it historically, violence erupts.\"",
      "And on Wednesday, it did.",
      "At Utah Valley University, the crack of a gunshot once again rattled America. Charlie Kirk, a prominent 31-year-old conservative activist, was assassinated as he engaged in public debate.",
      "By Thursday, a suspect was in custody: 22-year-old Utah resident Tyler Robinson.",
      "Kirk had a fervent following on the right, and was a key organizer in President Donald Trump's movement. (At the 2020 GOP Convention, Kirk referred to Trump as \"the bodyguard of Western civilization.\") He also had his critics, who called him an incendiary voice [as when, on his eponymous show, he exclaimed, \"The entire Democrat Party project is how quickly we can turn America into a third-world hellhole\"].",
      "His death has become the latest convulsion in a divided country.",
      "Meacham told Robert Costa, \"We do not want to be in a place where because you disagree with someone, you pick up a gun. That is not what the country can be. And if it is, then it's something different.\"",
      "It's not America? \"It's not the America we want,\" he said.",
      "Kirk's murder is the latest of numerous acts of political violence since last summer, when we saw the first of two assassination attempts on candidate Trump, followed by (to name just a few) the firebombing of the home of Pennsylvania's governor, Democrat Josh Shapiro; the killing of Democratic lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband in Minnesota; the murder of two Israeli embassy workers\u00a0in Washington; and the killing of police officer David Rose\u00a0in a shooting outside\u00a0CDC headquarters in Atlanta.",
      "Costa asked Meacham, \"Are we in a particular time in America when all of this seems to keep happening?\"",
      "\"We are, self-evidently,\" Meacham replied. \"And I think it's because we are experiencing an era in which we are debating, not only the means of politics, but the purpose of politics.\"",
      "Meacham says the purpose of America is an urgent cause for leaders, and for citizens: \"When we lose the capacity to engage in argument and dissent and debate peaceably, we are breaking faith with the American covenant,\" he said. \"And the American covenant is that we live in contention with each other, but we're not at each other's throats.\"",
      "Asked what our political leaders can do to keep that covenant, Meacham said, \"Make the case. Tell the story. What do you want the country to be? This is why history matters, I think, more than ever, because there's not a hell of a lot going on in the present that you want to say, 'Yeah, we want more of that,' right?",
      "\"You want to tell the story of Omaha Beach. You want to tell the story of the Pettus Bridge. You want to tell the story of Gettysburg. Because those were moments where imperfect people actually created a more perfect union. It's not that they were superhuman. Quite the opposite,\" he said.",
      "They got through it, Meacham said, \"barely.\"",
      "But even if Americans can just barely carry on this weekend, Meacham says we must: \"If they could do it, then we can, too, if we decide that this country is about a more perfect union, it is about dissent, it is about respecting each other, and it is not about hunting each other down.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump said that NATO's commitment to winning the war in Ukraine \"has been far less than 100%.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said he believes the more than three-year war in Ukraine would end if all NATO countries stopped buying oil from Russia and placed tariffs on China for its purchases of Russian petroleum. The announcement came as Romania became the second NATO country to report a Russian drone incursion.",
      "Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social on Saturday a letter purportedly sent to NATO in which he said he is \"ready to do major Sanctions on Russia\" on the condition that all NATO countries stop buying Russian oil. The president said the military alliance's commitment to winning the war in Ukraine \"has been far less than 100%\" and the purchase of Russian oil by some members is \"shocking.\"",
      "\"It greatly weakens your negotiation position, and bargaining power, over Russia,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "Since 2023, NATO member Turkey has been the third largest buyer of Russian oil, after China and India, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. Other members of the 32-state alliance involved in purchasing Russian oil include Hungary and Slovakia.",
      "Mr. Trump's letter comes at a tense moment in the conflict for NATO after the recent incursion by\u00a0multiple Russian drones into the airspace of alliance member Poland. It's being seen as an escalatory move by Russia and Poland shot down several of the drones.",
      "Earlier this week, Mr. Trump appeared to play down the significance of the incident, saying the incursion may not have been deliberate",
      "\"It could have been a mistake,\" he told journalists late Thursday. A day earlier, Mr. Trump issued a brief reaction on his Truth Social platform: \"What's with Russia violating Poland's airspace with drones? Here we go!\"",
      "The White House did not offer any clarification of Mr. Trump's remarks and Poland's most senior officials dismissed his suggestion\u00a0that it had been a mistake on Friday.",
      "On Saturday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters that NATO responded to the drones \"appropriately\" and that the U.S. believes it was an \"unacceptable and unfortunate and dangerous development.\"",
      "\"There's no doubt about the drones were intentionally launched,\" he said. \"The question is whether the drones were targeted to go into Poland specifically. If that's the case, that if the evidence leads us there, then, obviously, that'll be a highly explanatory move.\"",
      "Polish and allied aircraft were deployed in a \"preventive\" operation in Poland's airspace on Saturday because of a threat of drone strikes in neighboring areas of Ukraine, and the airport in the eastern Polish city of Lublin was closed, authorities said. The alert lasted around two hours.",
      "The Polish military's operational command posted on X on Saturday afternoon that ground-based air defense and reconnaissance systems were on high alert. It stressed that \"these actions are preventive in nature,\" and were aimed at securing Poland's airspace and protecting the country's citizens. It cited a threat of drone strikes in regions of Ukraine bordering Poland, but didn't give further details.",
      "Separately, Romania said it deployed two F-16 jets to intercept a drone that briefly entered its airspace on Saturday afternoon.",
      "\"The drone did not fly over inhabited areas and did not represent an imminent danger to the security of the population,\" the NATO member's defense ministry said in a statement.",
      "The ministry said that teams of specialists would conduct searches for potential debris. Romanian authorities didn't specify where they thought the drone originated from.",
      "During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump promised to end the war quickly. Some lawmakers in Congress are trying to persuade Mr. Trump to support a bill that toughens sanctions, after the president hosted Putin in Alaska for talks that failed to deliver on progress toward peace.",
      "The president in his post said a NATO ban on Russian oil plus tariffs on China would \"also be of great help in ENDING this deadly, but RIDICULOUS, WAR.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said NATO members should impose 50% to 100% tariffs on China and withdraw them if the war that was launched with Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine ends.",
      "\"China has a strong control, and even grip, over Russia,\" he posted, and powerful tariffs \"will break that grip.\"",
      "The U.S. president has already placed an additional 25% import tax on goods from India, which he has said is to punish it for buying Russian energy products.",
      "In his post, Mr. Trump said responsibility for the war fell on his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. As in past statements on the issue, he did not include in that list Russian President Vladimir Putin, who launched the invasion.",
      "Mr. Trump's post builds on a call Friday with finance ministers from the Group of Seven, a forum of industrialized democracies. During the call, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called on their counterparts to have a \"unified front\" to cut off \"the revenues funding Putin's war machine,\" according to Greer's office.",

Instead, it carries a drill to penetrate rocks and tubes to hold the samples gathered from places judged most suitable for hosting life billions of years ago. The samples are awaiting retrieval to Earth \u2014 an ambitious plan that's on hold as NASA seeks cheaper, quicker options.",
      "Calling it an \"exciting discovery,\" a pair of scientists who were not involved in the study \u2014 SETI Institute's Janice Bishop and the University of Massachusetts Amherst's Mario Parente \u2014 were quick to point out that non-biological processes could be responsible.",

    "summary": "Exoplanet TRAPPIST-1 e may contain an atmosphere and liquid water, NASA scientists said. Research into the exoplanet is ongoing.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists are observing an Earth-like exoplanet that may contain water using NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, the space agency said in a news release.",
      "The exoplanet, known as TRAPPIST-1 e, orbits the red dwarf star TRAPPIST-1. The system was discovered in 2017. There are seven Earth-sized worlds orbiting the star, but planet e is the only one that is at a distance where water on the surface is \"theoretically possible,\" NASA said. However, astronomers still need to determine if the planet has an atmosphere.",
      "To look for an atmosphere, NASA scientists directed the Webb telescope's Near-Infrared Spectrograph instrument at the TRAPPIST-1 system as planet e passed in front of the star. If the planet has an atmosphere, the starlight that passes through it will be partially absorbed. That will create dips in the light spectrum that reaches the spectrograph. Those dips will allow scientists to determine if the planet has an atmosphere and what chemicals it might be made of.",
      "Scientists are also studying the light spectrum of another exoplanet in the system called TRAPPIST-1 b. Researchers have determined that planet has no atmosphere, NASA said, so comparing its output to that of TRAPPIST-1 e allows for a fuller picture of the potential atmosphere on that planet.",
      "\"Webb's infrared instruments are giving us more detail than we've ever had access to before, and the initial four observations we've been able to make of planet e are showing us what we will have to work with when the rest of the information comes in,\" said N\u00e9stor Espinoza of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland, a principal investigator on the research team. Espinoza and the research team recently published two\u00a0scientific\u00a0papers\u00a0outlining their initial results.",
      "Researchers \"feel confident\" that TRAPPIST-1 e does not have a primary atmosphere. A primary atmosphere would be made of hydrogen and helium that would have been present when the planet was formed. But the star the planet orbits is \"very active,\" with \"frequent flares,\" NASA said, which create stellar radiation that may have \"stripped off\" that primary atmosphere. However, TRAPPIST-1 e may have built up a \"heavier secondary atmosphere.\" Many planets, including Earth, have done this, NASA said. Further research with the Webb telescope and its instruments will determine the types of atmosphere and its makeup.",
      "There are also many possibilities for water on the planet. There may be none at all, NASA said. TRAPPIST-1 e might also contain an ocean or wide swath of water. One side of the planet is always in darkness, so there may also be ice, NASA said. If there is liquid water on the planet, the NASA researchers say there would also be a greenhouse effect, where gases like carbon dioxide keep the atmosphere stable and warm the planet.",
      "\"We are really still in the early stages of learning what kind of amazing science we can do with Webb. It's incredible to measure the details of starlight around Earth-sized planets 40 light-years away and learn what it might be like there, if life could be possible there,\" said Ana Glidden, a post-doctoral researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, who led the research on possible atmospheres for planet e, in NASA's news release. \"We're in a new age of exploration that's very exciting to be a part of,\" she said.",

      "A teen who opened fire in a Colorado high school this week was active on a so-called \"violent gore\" site months before the attack, the Anti-Defamation League said in a\u00a0report\u00a0released Friday.",
      "Colorado officials said Desmond Holly, 16, who died of a self-inflicted gunshot after injuring two students at Evergreen High School, had been \"radicalized by an extremist network,\" but did not provide further details.",
      "According to the ADL report, several school shooters in the past year, including Holly, had been active on the same website, which the organization says is known for hosting content backing white supremacist ideas as well as material portraying graphic violence against both people and animals. People can navigate to the website, WatchPeopleDie, and access a forum where they can watch real images of beheadings, shootings and other violence. The site started on Reddit before being banned in March 2019.",
      "\"We're talking about thousands of people who are on these spaces,\" ADL Senior Vice President of Counter-Extremism and Intelligence, Oren Segal, told CBS News. \"There's no friction to access \u2014 anybody can do it.\"",
      "Beverly Kingston, the director of Colorado University's Center For The Study and Prevention of Violence, told CBS Colorado that school shooters often exhibit similarities in their behavior and have been known to pay tribute to other mass shooters.",
      "\"I don't think there's ever been a situation that hasn't had warning signs,\" said Kingston.",
      "The website Holly used was also frequented, the ADL says, by other individuals who have carried out school shootings. They include 15-year-old Natalie Rupnow, who shot and killed a student and a teacher at Abundant Life Christian school in Wisconsin last year, and Solomon Henderson, a 17-year-old who committed a shooting that killed one and wounded another at Antioch High School in Nashville in January.",
      "Holly, who posted a photo of Rupnow on TikTok, appeared to have joined the site in December 2024, in the month between the Madison and Nashville shootings, according to the ADL.",
      "\"Many of these online spaces are glorifying these young, violent shooter types, where they're even referencing one another,\" Segal said.",
      "Kingston said, \"When people are radicalized to violence, it's much harder to intervene at those stages than it is at the earlier stages.",
      "\"The best thing we could be doing is preventing someone from even having an interest in going into any of those sites in the first place,\" Kingston told CBS Colorado. \"We want to find a way for them to feel connected, to belong, to be on the pro-social side.\"",
      "Holly's most recent profile photo on TikTok was of Elliot Rodger, who killed six people in California in 2014 and had a history of engaging in and spewing misogynistic content online, according to the\u00a0Southern Poverty Law Center.",
      "The 16-year-old posted a photo of himself holding a gun next to a box of ammunition on his X account two hours before the shooting. On social media, Holly showcased his collection of tactical gear, which featured extremist symbols. In a now-deleted TikTok post that contained references to a 2019\u00a0mass shooting at a mosque\u00a0in Christchurch, New Zealand, he engaged with a comment encouraging him to \"make a move,\" according to ADL.",
      "CBS News reached out to the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office to see whether the department's findings were consistent with those in the ADL report. A spokesperson said they cannot comment as the investigation remains open.",
      "The domain of Watchpeopledie is registered by proxy, according to a search of the \"whois\" registration database \u2013 and hides the names of the owners. Cloudflare is used as the registrar for their main domain, Segal at the ADL said, and uses Cloudflare-owned IP addresses, which means that WPD is either hosted on Cloudflare or they are using their passthrough services.",
      "Segal said Cloudflare allows it to remain \u2026 that it's basically a service provider not taking action and \"allowing the hosting of the site.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Cloudflare told CBS News that it is not the hosting provider for the website, adding that the company \"typically does not host websites and doesn't have the capacity to remove content that is hosted by others.\"",
      "Segal said that ADL shares their findings with law enforcement agencies across the country. He did not specify an agency or the specific report. Segal said understanding incidents perpetrated by people influenced by nihilistic online spaces as a broader trend rather than one-offs could be a step toward preventing violence.",
      "\"We need to see that there's a connection there, there's a through line,\" Segal said. \"There's a common theme and a common thread, which are these online platforms.\"",
      "Kingston says there needs to be better funding for violence prevention, including programs that teach social-emotional learning and life skills, as well as instructions on how to address concerning behaviors on social media.",
      "\"The infrastructure that we need to prevent violence has always been very weak, and it's even weaker right now,\" said Kingston. \"That's my biggest frustration, is having so many solutions that aren't being fully implemented. It just breaks my heart.\"",

      "MAJOR GARRETT: I'm Major Garrett in Washington.",
      "And this week on Face the Nation: What will America do after the killing of political activist Charlie Kirk? Is the assassination of a high- visibility and effective conservative thought leader and vote mobilizer a moment when national divisions begin to close or will attitudes harden?",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "ERIKA KIRK (Widow of Charlie Kirk): To everyone listening tonight across America, the movement my husband built will not die.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The criminal investigation continues, as does the quest to deduce a motive. Charges will be filed later this week.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson joins us on the path ahead and a range of issues facing Congress, from avoiding a government shutdown to Russian sanctions.",
      "And a conversation with Democratic Senator Chris Coons and Republican Senator James Lankford, longtime advocates both of finding common ground and minimizing political strife.",
      "Also, University of Chicago Professor Robert Pape, one of the country's foremost researchers on political violence, with a warning about where things stand.",
      "Then: As consumers turn gloomy and the job market freezes up, high expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut. CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger will break it all down.",
      "It is all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. Margaret is on assignment for \"60 Minutes.\" I'm Major Garrett.",
      "We have a lot to get to today, and I want to begin with justice correspondent Scott MacFarlane with the latest on the assassination of political activist Charlie Kirk and the ongoing investigation.",
      "Utah Republican Governor Spencer Cox has been the most authoritative voice in this matter since it happened, Scott. We have some new comments from him this morning.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: It sounds like they have a lot to work with to start.",
      "First of all, as the weekend began, they executed a search warrant on the family home in Washington County, Utah. It's about three or four hours from the site of the shooting. The governor, though, says multiple people are talking here, including the roommate of the suspect, who he describes as incredibly cooperative.",
      "The roommate, he says, had no idea this was happening, and he also says the roommate may have been in a romantic relationship with Tyler Robinson, may have been gender transitioning, but the governor says there's no indication or no idea yet if that's at all relevant to this case.",
      "As for Robinson, he's in the Utah County Jail, the one where Utah Valley University is. He's in a special watch area. He's inmate 460956. A special watch means they're ensuring he's not harmed or can do any self-harm. It doesn't mean there's a mental health issue, Major, but the severity of the crime, commonly in correctional facilities across the country, puts you in a special watch.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: State charges due to be filed later this week. And because of Utah's approach to state charges, this will be a high-visibility prosecution when it comes.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: Yes, the district attorney is Jeff Gray. We expect him to speak Tuesday. The probable cause statement already submitted for this arrest indicates the possible charges, aggravated murder, felonious discharge of a firearm. Those are possible come Tuesday in Utah County Court.",
      "Whether the feds get involved, whole different issue. There may not be a foothold for federal charges here for the U.S. Department of Justice, unless they see something in the firearms or in the motives here that makes it federal, though we saw in Charlotte last week they brought federal charges in the alleged murder of a Ukrainian refugee.",
      "In that case, they found mass transit system foothold to bring the federal case.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Scott, as you well know, in instances like this, authorities struggle to stay with the facts as they are known and as they evolve.",
      "But there is rampant online speculation, rumormongering about motive. Authorities still very early in the stages of trying to identify one, if it exists\u2026",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: And the F\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: \u2026 and can properly characterized.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: And it's happening at a moment of change inside the U.S. Department of Justice. The FBI has new leadership, and this really is a first big test for the new FBI leadership.",
      "And the grades are incomplete right now. It was the father who seems to have turned in his son in this case, and the FBI director was called on some social media posts that were conflicting with other information, saying a subject was in custody, then a subject was released.",
      "And the FBI director also posted this weekend: \"Against all law enforcement recommendations, we released that video of the suspect.\" Governor of Utah today said: \"We certainly never recommended against releasing video.\"",
      "So there's some questions to answer for the FBI as this week begins.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Little bit of tension there.",
      "Scott MacFarlane, thank you very much.",
      "We turn now to the speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, who joins us this morning from Baton Rouge, Louisiana.",
      "Mr. Speaker, it's good to see you. I appreciate your time.",
      "The burdens of speakership are always manifold. You know that. Previous speakers I have covered know that, but they feel particularly heavy after the events of this week. I just want to ask you, Mr. Speaker, how are you doing?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON (R-Louisiana): I'm doing OK, Major. Thanks for asking it.",
      "No question, it was a difficult week for the country. Certainly, it was felt on Capitol Hill. There's a mixture of anger and sadness and fear, frankly, on the part of a lot of people. It cast a large shadow across the country and the nation's capital.",
      "But what I do know, Major, is that my good friend Charlie would not want any of us to be consumed by despair. He would want us to go forward boldly. That was his message, and to do it in love. And I think that, I hope, is the message that continues in the days ahead.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: It's not common for this show to pick up on something said by Connecticut's Young Democrats and Connecticut's Young Republicans, but they put out a statement that has gotten quite a bit of attention on the Internet, saying, as follows: \"There is no place in our country for such acts, regardless of political disagreements.\"",
      "Do you believe, on Capitol Hill, there will be a method to forge any sort of bipartisan remembrance of Charlie Kirk?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: There will be.",
      "We had a moment of prayer and silent reflection on the floor on Wednesday, within an hour of his passing. There will be \u2013 I participated in a large vigil here in Baton Rouge at LSU, my alma mater, on Friday night. Tonight, we will have a big, I hope, bipartisan prayer and reflection vigil in Capitol Hill, at the Kennedy Center.",
      "There will be a members reflection and prayer moment that I will lead on Monday night. This will continue. I think that the country needs to see leaders in Congress and leaders with platforms all around the country speaking truth and bringing calm to the situation.",
      "We should appeal, as Lincoln reminded us so many years ago, to the better angels among us all. And I think this is a real moment for Amer (AUDIO GAP) affirmatively. And I think one of the ways to do that, Major, is to adopt the manner of Charlie Kirk, because while he loved vigorous debate and he believed in the free marketplace of ideas and advancing truth boldly, he also was motivated by love for his fellow man, because he never hated the person on the other side of the table.",
      "And I think everyone would do well to be reminded of that model.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Mr. Speaker, you mentioned the word fear a moment ago. It is on the lips of members of Congress in ways I have never experienced before. They are talking openly. They already have canceled events.",
      "Other members are talking about whether or not it's proper, and there are family conversations, to seek reelection. How do you feel this particular space of anxiety for your membership, Republican and Democrat?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Yes.",
      "Well, I have been talking with a lot of them over the last few days about that and trying to calm the nerves to assure them that we will make certain that everyone has the level of security that's necessary, that the resources will be there for their residential security and their personal security.",
      "We're evaluating all the options for that, but also to be reminded that it does take a certain measure of courage to step out and to lead. I mean, our first responders do it every day. Our members of the military do it every day and political figures as well.",
      "But I think, if we all adopt these practices together and we turn down the rhetoric, we cease with this idea that policy disputes are somehow an existential threat to democracy or the republic, we stop calling one another names \u2013 I mean, calling people Nazis and fascists is not helpful.",
      "Look, there are some deranged people in society. And when they see leaders using that kind of language so often now, increasingly, it spurs them on to action. We have to recognize that reality and address it appropriately.",
      "And I'm heartened to know, Major, and to see that many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are stepping up and saying that and addressing it. I think this could be a turning point, frankly, to use Charlie's term, for the country. And I hope that's true.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Would that turning point, from your vantage point, Mr. Speaker, because I know you had a long conversation with President Trump, extend to the White House itself?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Well, of course.",
      "Look, the president knew Charlie very well. He was like a family member to the Trumps. Many of us felt that close association with him. And he admired Charlie's approach to public debate. And you have heard him say that publicly. He was \u2013 Charlie was a good man.",
      "And I think the best way we honor his memory is to continue to do that very thing and not shy away from debate, to keep the free marketplace of ideas going, but to work on the tone of those debates, because I think that serves the best of our principles, our Judeo-Christian heritage as a nation, our civil discourse, and we got to return to that.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Mr. Speaker, several issues pending before Congress, not the least of which is keeping the government open.",
      "I know you prefer a seven-week clean C.R., but there is a press for other issues, extending Obamacare tax subsidies. There's been a push this weekend for Russia sanctions backed by Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, in the Senate. Will either of those, from your vantage point, get into something to keep the government open?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Well, listen, we have been working very hard in the House to restore regular order in the appropriations government funding process, and that's something that no one's really seen for a long time on Capitol Hill.",
      "But I'm encouraged that, in a bipartisan fashion, our House Appropriations Committee has passed all 12 of the annual appropriations bills through the committee. We have got three off the House floor. The Senate's passed a few. And then last week we voted to move into a conference\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: OK, Mr. Speaker, I believe there's a technical glitch that has forced us to lose your audio.",
      "We're going to take a quick break, and we will come right back to House Speaker Mike Johnson in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in just a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to Face the Nation.",
      "Because technical gremlins lurk everywhere, they got in between my conversation with House Speaker Mike Johnson.",
      "Mr. Speaker. I'm glad to have you back.",
      "You were in the middle of answering about Obamacare tax subsidies, possible sanctions against Russia and a government funding mechanism. Please continue.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Yes, sorry about the interruption there.",
      "Listen, we're very encouraged that we have been able to restore the regular appropriations, regular order process in the House.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Right, but are we going to get this done? Are those two other things going to be added to the process, Mr. Speaker?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: We will have to see.",
      "I have got to build consensus around all of it, but I think we will need a short-term funding measure, a clean C.R. that will allow more time to figure all this out. And we certainly hope that Democrats will go along on that, because, if not, they really have no excuse.",
      "If they shut the government down, it would be their unilateral decision to do so.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And when Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, says, as he did this weekend, now is the time for Russia sanctions, President Trump opened the door on tariffs against India and China as a way to create economic leverage to end the war in Ukraine, where do you stand on all that?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Well, listen, I do believe that desperate times call for desperate measures.",
      "And I think appropriate sanctions on Russia are far overdue. I mean, I think there's a big appetite for that in Congress. So we're willing to work with the White House and our Senate colleagues in the House to get that done, and I'm anxious to do it personally.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Are you waiting for the president to give you the green light, or might Congress act on this on its own volition?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Well, Congress really can't do this on its own volition, because, of course, the president would need to sign whatever you do into law. So it has to be a partnership.",
      "But we have defer to the commander in chief. I mean, the president is a strong and bold leader on the world stage. He has brokered peace around the world in other conflicts in a way that no one before him has been able to do. And so we're trusting that he can use that same force and that same approach to bring about finally an end to this war in Ukraine.",
      "Everyone in America wants that bloodshed to end, and President Trump is forcing that. And I certainly\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: OK, Mr. Speaker, I'm told that the technical difficulties keep arising, so a bit prematurely, we're going to end our conversation here to spare you and spare our audience from continued mayhem by technical gremlins.",
      "Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the time. Thank you for joining us on Face the Nation very much.",
      "Jill Schlesinger joins now \u2013 joins us now. She's CBS News business analyst. She's on Long Island, as she often is when we talk.",
      "Jill, I'm pleased to see you.",
      "Look, everyone expects the Federal Reserve to cut rates this coming week. That's not a mystery. I guess the only mystery is, is it 25 basis points or 50 basis points? And if it's 50, how much more of a difference might that make?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Well, I think it's more likely to be a quarter-of-a- percentage point, at least for this meeting.",
      "And, remember, what is the Fed's job? It's got \u2013 they have got to keep into balance two big priorities. And these are big. One is to make sure the economy grows enough to create jobs for anyone who wants a job. And the other priority is to kind of keep a lid on prices, to control inflation or deflation.",
      "Right now, if you look at the Fed's job, it's a real tough one, because the job market is weakening at the same time that inflation is reaccelerating. Now, remember, we are not going back to scary post-pandemic inflationary surge, but inflation is starting to move in the wrong direction.",
      "But I think the Fed's outlook is, hey, it's the job market that is getting slower, faster. We have got to concentrate on that. I think they go a quarter-of-a-percentage point, rather than a half-of-a-percentage point, at least to get things restarted.",
      "Major, it was exactly a year ago when they began their rate cuts. Back in September of last year, they cut by a half-a-percentage point because they felt like inflation was moving down very quickly. I don't think that's the case this time.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jill, the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, frequently says the Fed and he are data-dependent. That's probably a virtue, except when the data is messy and cloudy and full of conflicting signals.",
      "That seems to be prevalent right now.",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Well, I think there is a real problem, in that, if you look at the last five years, our data is all over the place. The pandemic really did create a doozy of a problem on the economy, but also the way we track the economy.",
      "And I know people got really freaked out about those preliminary estimates to the revisions to all that data for the 12 months through March of this year. That preliminary revision showed 911,000 fewer jobs than we originally thought. Now, this is always part of an annual process. We will get the final number in February.",
      "But what I guess is important is, there are so many different aspects to what's going on in the economy right now. The crosscurrents are really difficult. So, yes, we know the labor market is weakening, but we're not seeing widespread job losses, thank goodness. There is no evidence that we are in a recession currently.",
      "The economy is growing. But we do have that niggling problem of prices starting to rise again. And I think that that price increase, because of those tariffs, because of certain aspects, even the service economy, I think that's a real crosscurrent.",
      "And, to be clear, the Fed, the amazing people who work there, the amazing economists that are out there doing the research, so many of them say to me, you know what, this is the most difficult time to judge the next steps of the economy in the last 40 years.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jill, as you know, there's a phrase going around describing the job market, and it goes as follows: \"No fire, no hire.\"",
      "What does that mean practically for somebody in the job market or just graduating from college trying to break in?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Yes, this is a very difficult labor market. I mean, granted, we are \u2013 again, we are not like we are in a recession. We are not seeing widespread layoffs, thank goodness. There are pockets of layoffs that are happening in different sectors. We are seeing contractions. We're seeing people who are retiring and those jobs not being refilled.",
      "But I think that if anyone who has a job right now, when I talk to H.R. people, they basically say to me, hey, you know what? Tell people to stay where they are. Don't fly off the handle, the job-hugging, staying engaged with your boss, engaged with the company, very important right now.",
      "If you are seeking a job, you know, where the jobs are right now, we see the most activity in health care, health services. So, you're \u2013 if you're somebody who is trained to do one job, try to find a job in the sector at least that is adding positions. I might be a programmer and I might not have an ability to get a job at a big tech company.",
      "Maybe I go to a big hospital chain. These are the kinds of things. We have to kind of get outside of ourselves. The adaptable candidate is going to be the one that wins in this economy.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jill, let's talk about tariffs, because it is a conversation and a way of trying to assess that this country has no recent experience with, at least 50 or 60 years, of trying to assess what a tariff does when it is widespread throughout the global economy.",
      "So a lot of us are trying to get used to this. Economists are trying to get used to it. Policymakers are trying to get used to it. Our trading partners are trying to get used to it. What is the story of tariffs so far, and has it been fully written?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Nothing fully written, so very important here, because when those tariffs were announced in April, and then they were moved higher, and then they were frozen for a while, the tariff story was an uncertain one.",
      "I think it is that cloud of uncertainty that was really hanging over the labor market over the past four months. But, right now, what we do know is that the industries most directly impacted by tariffs are not hiring as much. We know that. We know that they are losing some jobs. We also know that tariffs are creeping into the economy, and not in a huge way yet.",
      "But what we are clear about is that prices are set to rise over the next, say, six months or so. Not great for holiday shopping, I know. But what we also know is that we consumers, we are very canny. Once those prices go up, we will switch and make different choices.",
      "So that is why economists believe that this kind of tariff regime is one where we will see prices rise, but not keep rising. Now, that does not really help you if you are going out and shopping. I understand that. But maybe the best news that I can have is that you are not going to feel like you did from the year 2021 to 2022, where it just felt like prices were going up, up, up, up, up.",
      "It is likely to be that prices and the Consumer Price Index, from the way that the Fed looks at this, the PCE index, these measures of inflation will start to rise over the next few weeks \u2013 few months. Then they will kind of steady.",
      "But the problem, Major, is that consumers are going to be stuck with price levels that are higher. And I think that is going to be very hard to swallow for anyone who is in the lower to middle earning category.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jill, one other part of the economic scenario I want to discuss with you, because when people talk about inflation, they say, just tell me what energy cost is and I will tell you what inflation is going to be.",
      "But yet there is a dual reality there.",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Yes.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Natural gas and prices at the pump are down, but electricity paid for by consumers, either businesses or at home, are up.",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Yes.",
      "I mean, the great news is that prices at the pumps, OK, totally happy with that. Everyone's good. The price of crude oil sort of in the low 60s, no problem. That electric \u2013 the electricity story is a story of artificial intelligence, because, to build artificial intelligence, it needs a lot of energy in the term \u2013 in terms of electricity or in the form of electricity.",
      "That's why you are seeing those prices go up. But, again, what I have come back to over this process of the last few years, the last five years of the \u2013 all these different impacts on the economy, we have never been here before. And so what I want to try to emphasize is that we can't hang our hat on what has happened in the past.",
      "Right now, I can look at a lot of different companies and say, wow, these companies are making a ton of money, big technology companies. We are seeing the S&P 500, the Nasdaq, the Dow all at all-time highs. And you have to reckon with the problem, the other side of that, which is, consumers feel burdened.",
      "And I think that's going to be the story of this year and next. How will consumers get out of this? If the labor market weakens from here, I think that's a problem. If we see a resumption of growth and the labor market starts to strengthen, the average worker will be able to afford what's going on in the economy.",
      "But it does come down to that labor market.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jill, deeply unfair, 40 seconds. What has A.I.'s influence been on the labor market?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: You know, hard to say. In 40 seconds, what I can tell you is, not yet. That's the major takeaway, because we know that there are some areas where there's a lot of hiring within A.I.",
      "There are companies that are using A.I. to increase their productivity. But there is no evidence yet that A.I. is taking everybody's job, so whew, whew. We have got a few minutes to worry about that.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: A few minutes to worry about that, among many other things.",
      "Jill Schlesinger, always a pleasure. Thank you so much for joining us.",
      "And we will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. I invite you to please stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: For a daily dose of political news, analysis, and so much more throughout the week, please join me for The Takeout. We're on every weeknight at 5:00 p.m. on our CBS News 24/7 streaming channel, also available on our apps, CBS News and Paramount+.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: We will be right back with Senators Chris Coons and James Lankford for a bipartisan conversation on uniting America, plus the leading researcher on political violence, University of Chicago Professor Robert Pape.",
      "Please stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to \"FACE THE NATION.\"",
      "For a look at how Congress may, may help bridge political divisions the country presently, we turn to a couple of lawmakers with a lot of experience in that space. Democratic Senator Chris Coons, who joins us from Wilmington, Delaware, Republican Senator James Lankford, who joins us from Oklahoma City.",
      "Gentlemen, you have a well-earned reputation both for preaching bipartisanship, taking the rhetorical temperature in Washington and nationwide down a notch or two.",
      "Senator Coons, I want to start with you. After the events of this week, do you feel that's harder than ever to achieve?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS COONS (D-DE): It is. And, Major, thank you for a chance to be on with you and with my friend, Senator Lankford.",
      "The brutal assassination of Charlie Kirk, while he was in the middle of a debate on a college campus, goes to the very heart of what it means to be American, of the importance of the First Amendment of free speech. And someone like Charlie Kirk, who was a nationally known figure, who dedicated himself to debate, to engagement with his political adversaries, should not have paid with his life for the opportunity to speak out. No matter how much I might deeply disagree with his political views, the idea that he would be killed in such a grotesque and public way has to bring all of us to reflect about how hard it's getting because the internet is an accelerant. It is driving extremism in our country. It's driving us apart left and right. And leaders like Senator Lankford, Governor Cox have an obligation and an opportunity to join with leaders from my party in urging folks to set aside any thought of political violence and to respect each other, even as we keep advancing our political differences through discourse.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Lankford, do you ever, at times, feel as if your appeals for better angels, calmer rhetoric, more bipartisanship is shouting into an internet void?",
      "SENATOR JAMES LANKFORD, (R-OK): It is because the algorithm pushes people to the most extreme. The algorithm is all \u2013 on social media is always pushing, who's the angriest, who's the loudest, who says the craziest things. That's what gets repeated over and over and over again. So, any time that there is cogent dialogue or an issue on something where people may disagree, but they're having a \u2013 a civil conversation on it, that gets pushed aside towards someone that's just angry and \u2013 and focused.",
      "This is somewhat human nature to be able to say we disagree. We find areas where we disagree, and we try to be able to solve those. The best way to be able to solve those is through words, talking it out, finding an opportunity to be able to do it. But I would tell you, this kind of anger is as old as Cain and Abel, to be able to go back and say, I'm mad at you, so I'm going to try to destroy you. Whether it's destroy you online or to try to humiliate you or to cancel you or to, in this case, try to murder you publicly. It is \u2013 it is painful to be able to see that part of humanity. And it is better for us to be able to push better angels.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Lankford, first to you, then Senator Coons.",
      "Senator Lankford, are you afraid for your own security right now?",
      "SENATOR JAMES LANKFORD: I am \u2013 I am attentive to my own security, how about that, for myself and for my family. My staff and I have to \u2013 have to talk through each public event. But we've had to do that for a while.",
      "As you may know well, there have been 14,000 threats against members of Congress just this calendar year. This is not new. But it continues to be able to rise. as we've seen Democratic lawmakers in Minnesota, in their own home, have a home invasion and be murdered in their home. As we've seen a governor in Pennsylvania have his home set on fire. It's not just public events, it's also in our private spaces as well that we're keenly aware that there are people that are irrational, that do irrational acts.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Coons?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS COONS: I agree that for all of us who serve in public life, whether it's leading a non-profit or a church, teaching in a school, or being a public advocate, someone engaged in public debate, as Charlie Kirk was, the risk is getting higher. And to have to worry about the safety of your own family, if you step forward to serve as a judge, if you write editorials, if you lead a non-profit or if you serve in Congress or run for president, to have to worry not just about your own physical safety but the safety of your spouse and children, I think, weakens our ability to have good and robust debates, to have a well-led nation and to demonstrate to the world that we're a nation committed to free speech, but where we reject political violence.",
      "So, of course, anyone in public life today is more concerned about the tragedy in Utah, about the incidents that Senator Lankford just referenced, the attempt to kidnap the governor of Michigan, to assault Speaker Pelosi's husband, the shooting of Steve Scalise and the shootings at other members of Congress. The recent incidents have gotten worse and worse, and I think I know the reason. It's principally because the internet is fueling and accelerating those deep-seated inclinations towards violence and seeing others as enemies, that James was referencing, and there are steps we can and should take in Congress to address that.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The administering this weekend, as I'm sure you two are both aware, putting before Congress $58 billion in security for members of Congress, the judiciary and the like.",
      "Senator Coons, you believe Congress will be disposed to agree to that?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS COONS: I hope that we will step up and invest more. I just hosted a bipartisan event last week on protecting state judges, and we had state judicial leaders from across the country, from Delaware and Texas and many other states, talk about harrowing incidents and tragic killings of the members of the judiciary. I hope we will invest in securing our public life because incidents like this tragedy in Utah, like the murder of Melissa and her husband, Mark Hortman, in Minnesota, frankly, fuel further anger in our country. And the ways in which folks are then taking the horrific images of these incidents and propagating them on the internet adds fuel to the fire.",
      "We can and should pass bills, as we just did, Senator Cruz and Senator Klobuchar worked together to pass, and President Trump signed into law, the Take It Down Act, to remove some of the most harmful pornographic revenge porn images from the internet. And we have a bill right in front of us, the Kids Online Safety Act, that's broadly bipartisan, that we should pass to help reduce some of the risks and harms to our families and our country from the internet.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Lankford, I misspoke, that's $58 million, not $58 billion, but it's a substantial sum.",
      "SENATOR JAMES LANKFORD: Yes, it is a substantial sum. What was funny was I was going to actually correct you on that, let you know it's an \"m\" not a \"b\" on that particular one. But it is something to be able to set aside and say, what are we doing? It's not \u2013 it is about the person and their family, but it's also about the title. It's about the task. Because that person represents that state, that \u2013 that part of the nation, that particular task.",
      "My wife and I often talk about the fact that I have this title of senator for a season. Someone else had it before me. Someone else will have it after me. But while I have it, I'm a steward of that task and that responsibility. And so, when we're talking about protecting judges and protecting individual, it's not just their personal safety, it is really declaring to the nation that we believe that these tasks are hard, that they should be intense debate, that we have very difference perspective. Chris Coons and I are very close friends, but have very different ideas on some things, but we have the ability to represent our individual states and set of ideas and to be able to talk those two things out and to be able to bring things together and say, I know areas where we disagree. Where do we agree? How can we solve it? That is where we are at our best as Americans is to say, we don't oppress each other. We try to be able to find common ground and to be able to move forward as we can.",
      "But as Chris has mentioned, the Oline Kids Safety Act is a great piece of legislation to be able to protect our kids. We are seeing people radicalized online on social media and through the internet in the United States by other Americans and by the algorithm that's there. And I will tell you, as recently as just a couple of weeks ago, I was in a school in Oklahoma, that now Oklahoma schools have banned all cellphones from bell to bell at school. You cannot have a cellphone on your \u2013 on your \u2013 on from bell to bell on campus. And the principals and the teachers all talk about how dramatically different the environment is on campus right now because people are looking up, people are interacting, people are talking again. They're not just staring at their phone. They're not getting fed all this vitriol all day long. And so, it changes the mood of everything just by looking at each other in the face and saying, let's see if we can work this out.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Lankford, I'm going to bring up something that's playing out through the country right now, and it's making all the things you and Senator Coons have talked about more difficult, which is, people who have posted about Charlie Kirk have jobs and are being fired because what they posted online has been viewed by their personnel directors or leaders as inappropriate. At any governmental level or in the private sector, are you comfortable having someone fired for an utterance about Charlie Kirk's death?",
      "SENATOR JAMES LANKFORD: Yes, this is about protecting the individual businesses. And what people are seeing is, in this cancel culture that still persists, that if you voice something that becomes a big pushback from the community, the employer will step up and say, hey, you're about to kill our business based on what you're saying online. Everyone has to understand what they say privately online can get connected to their business.",
      "We have a veterinarian clinic in Oklahoma City right now that \u2013 that one of the veterinarians posted something just absolutely horrific about now we're culling out the sick ones right after Charlie Kirk was murdered, that now there's been big pushback through that veterinary clinic because people are say, OK, this is the person \u2013 do I want to do business with that person if they have that belief?",
      "So, this is part of the challenge that we have with social media and with employments. Employers are going to say, don't hurt our business based on the foolish things that you choose to say to be able to say online.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Coons, how about within the federal government?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Well, the way James put it there, I think, is a good balance between, it's OK to have codes of conduct, to say to an employee, you shouldn't be speaking out on behalf of this company or this department of the federal government. Where your role, for example, requires that you be trusted, and that you not take partisan political positions. One of the challenges of the intersection of the line between social media and one's conduct on behalf of the government is that today we can see into your internal views.",
      "But it's not that new. So, let's imagine that you're a career federal prosecutor or you're a judge. Historically, there have been clear rules against engaging in partisan politics while you are performing those functions. The internet just makes it easier for folks to police and punish those who make statements that are considered extreme or out of the mainstream.",
      "Cancel culture is a real challenge to us, to balancing free speech with positions of responsibility. And we have to find our way through this together in a way that offers some grace and humility while celebrating the free speech that is the foundation of our republic and urging people to think twice before they post things that are outrageous online.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Lankford, the country's going to look to Congress here in the next couple of weeks to avert a government shutdown, also possibly extend soon to expire Affordable Care Act subsidies that help afford insurance. In this climate, and with those eyes on the nation upon Congress, how do you expect that to play out?",
      "SENATOR JAMES LANKFORD: I expect us to be able to solve the budget issues, which the American people expect to be able to do as well. These are hard issues. We're sent to be able to do hard things. We should do hard things on it. We should not, first and foremost, have a government shutdown. We have $37 trillion in debt right now. We should have hard conversations about debt and deficit, but they shouldn't be during a government shutdown.",
      "What we're currently arguing right now about is a seven-week extension on the current budget spending to say, we're not changing anything, but for the seven \u2013 next seven weeks, let's just hold it until we get a longer budget agreement and can actually come to agreement. What has been floated is a $300 billion requirement by some of my Democratic colleagues to say, if we don't spend an additional $300 billion, we're not going to keep the government open the next seven weeks. This is also a subsidy, an insurance subsidy, that was put in place during Covid, and just after Covid to say, due to the health care issues around Covid, we're going to extend additional insurance coverage that's there.",
      "Covid and the crisis of Covid is now past on it. It's difficult to say we should spent an additional $300 billion just to stay open the next seven weeks due to a Covid emergency at this point.",
      "So, yes, we'll have \u2013 we'll have hard conversations. But let's have it. Let's \u2013 let's talk it out and let's figure it out.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Coons, you're going to get the last word. Respond to Senator Lankford on that.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Well, this is an area where Senator Lankford and I disagree. We are both appropriators. We both want to find a way to work together, to keep the government open. But the Republican-only bill that was passed earlier this year, the so-called big, beautiful bill, threatens to raise rates for health care for millions of Americans and to throw millions more off of health care.",
      "I think there are ways we can reduce the harm to Americans' health care through the appropriations process. The bill that we both voted for in our committee in July would restore many of the proposed deep cuts to the National Institutes of Health, for example, one positive step forward. We have to find a way to resolve these issues and reduce or reverse some of the harm that's being done to Americans' health care.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Chris Coons, Delaware Democratic, James Lankford, Oklahoma Republican, thank you both. I appreciate it.",
      "And we'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back.",
      "We're going to take a closer look at the problem of political violence in America. And we're joined now, I'm glad to say, by University of Chicago Professor Robert Pape. He is the founding director of the Chicago Project on Security and Threats.",
      "Professor, it's great to have you with us. Thanks for joining us.",
      "What are the trend lines and what is the key terminology you want my audience to understand?",
      "ROBERT PAPE (Professor of Political Science, University Of Chicago): We are now in a watershed moment for what I call the era of violent populism in America. This era is defined, first and foremost, by two factors. Number one, a rising tide of political violence on both the right and the left. And just think, and I'll only go back to 2002. Just think of the attack \u2013 the assassination attempt on Nancy Pelosi, Democratic leader of the House. Missed her. Almost killed her husband. The attempt on Brett Kavanaugh, conservative Supreme Court justice. Two attempts on Republican candidate Donald Trump. And then the \u2013 in Minnesota, just a few months ago, not just attempts, but actual assassinations of Democratic leaders. Josh Shapiro, governor of Pennsylvania. And now we see Charlie Kirk assassinated. And what we are seeing is this clear rising trend in numbers of attacks.",
      "Side by side with that, though, we are also seeing a rising tide, a groundswell of support for political violence on both the right and the left that corresponds with this rising trend of political violence on both the right and the left.",
      "Our center at the University of Chicago Project on Security and Threats, we have been conducting highly reliable national surveys on political violence \u2013 the support for political violence among Americans for over four years. We started this in the summer of 2021. Our most recent survey in May found higher levels of support for political violence on both the right and the left than we have ever seen. And that's one of the reasons why I rang the alarm bell with that big op-ed in \"The New York Times\" in June, saying, we're on the cusp of major political violence. And I'm sorry to say, we're now right in the grip of violent populism.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And in that survey data, is it that people who respond to your surveys say to reconcile myself to the political outcome I want, I will be willing to resort to violence. Is that the key connection point?",
      "ROBERT PAPE: The key connection is the particular political grievance. So, we asked, just give you an example, 39 percent of Democrats say they agree that the use of force is justified to remove Donald Trump from the presidency. When we go deeper to probe, what do they mean by use of force? Fifty-five percent are talking about assassinations. They're talking about lethal uses of force. That's why we use that term.",
      "On the right, we also asked \u2013 very same survey, we found 24 percent of Republicans agree that Donald Trump is justified in using the U.S. military to suppress Democratic protesters. So, these are very specific questions. We have a whole slew of these questions so that we really can speak with great precision about what are the grievances that people want to say use of force is justified. We know what the meaning of that term is. And then we can see, Democrat, Republican in the cross tabs.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Does your research buttress the point that both Senator Lankford and Senator Coons made, which is, the internet is an accelerant and amplifier?",
      "RICHARD PAPE: It's an accelerant, but it's not the root cause. So, studying this problem now for five years, I have found that, just as around the world, big, social change drives political violence. We see this in other countries around the world. But the details of the change vary.",
      "We are now moving, for the first time in our country's 250-year history, from a white majority democracy to a white minority democracy. In 1990, we were 76 percent non-Hispanic white. Today, we're 57 percent non-Hispanic white. It will be another ten years, maybe 15 if we deport a lot of those undocumented illegal immigrants, before we make the transition to a truly white minority democracy.",
      "Well, this generational change is happening \u2013 it started about ten years ago where the real tipping point generation and corresponds with the rise of Donald Trump, why his issue of immigration is meteoric, why it's morphed from immigration, meaning stop people costing the border, to now deporting mass numbers of people because there are people on the right who want to stop or reverse this, and also the virulent reaction to Donald Trump on the left, on parts of the left, who want to keep this going. This is really the taproot, and that's why we need to expect \u2013 this, left to its own devices, will get worse and be with us for ten years.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: So, this is a demographic story that is creating a political backlash that gets amplified and accelerated online? Do I have that right?",
      "RICHARD PAPE: Yes. You've got it exactly right. And these are why \u2013 it's not the internet is not important, it's a reinforcing factor. And there is a \u2013",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: In other words, it's too simplistic to say it's the internet?",
      "RICHARD PAPE: Exactly, because that's what \u2013 a few years ago, people challenged my findings and I said, oh, no, no, we'll just deplatform people. So, the problem here is just the internet, so we're going to de- platform x, y, and z. We de-platformed x, y, and z. And, you know what, didn't miss a beat.",
      "And the reason is because, yes, it is an additional \u2013 it's like throwing gasoline on the fire, but the internet is not the fire itself. There's something going on, which is really radicalizing our politics. And I'm sorry to say, this is a story that we see around the world, in other countries, other times, and so this is \u2013 this is the social change leading to radicalized politics that changes winners and losers in our society for real, and that's leading to political violence.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Professor, it has always been a hallmark of this country, we have sort of thought about ourselves as having this experiment that has lots of differences of opinion, spasms of violence, but in the end we reconcile and move forward. Are you any more or less optimistic about that and that underlying assumption about the core ability of America than you were previously?",
      "RICHARD PAPE: The future is in our hands. This is not locked in with destiny. That said, if we do nothing, this will keep getting worse. The number one thing we have to do is we need our political leaders to step up. And we just saw an instance of that, just previously, where we have senators from both sides of the aisle making a joint video appearance. Well, that's really quite \u2013 to condemn violence. That's important because the leaders can restrain their own constituents. When they bad-mouth the other side's constituents, our data shows, that makes everything worse. That's the worst of all possible worlds because it produces defiance. We need to step that up. What would step that up? A summit between President Trump, Governor Newsom and Governor Pritzker, a public session where they all together condemn political violence.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Professor Pape, I am very glad you're here. Modeling behavior matters in many contexts in life, political and otherwise. Thank you very much.",
      "We'll be back in just a moment.",

      "Johnson invoked President Abraham Lincoln's appeal to the nation's \"better angels,\" while urging the adoption of \"the manner of Charlie Kirk.\"",
      "\"While he loved vigorous debate and he believed in the free marketplace of ideas and advancing truth boldly, he also was motivated by love for his fellow man, because he never hated the person on the other side of the table,\" Johnson said. \"And I think everyone would do well to be reminded of that model.\"",
      "The speaker said he's been speaking with members in recent days about the fear that those holding public office are feeling in the aftermath of Kirk's death and has been \"trying to calm the nerves to assure them that we will make certain that everyone has a level of security that's necessary.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the White House is sending a $58 million request to Congress to increase security for the executive and judicial branches in the wake of Kirk's assassination, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CBS News on Saturday. And the Trump administration expressed support for increased funding to protect congressional lawmakers, but may defer to the legislative branch.",
      "Johnson said House GOP leaders are \"evaluating all the options\" to ensure resources will be available for lawmakers' residential security and personal security. And he added that \"it does take a certain measure of courage to step out and to lead,\" saying first responders, members of the military and political figures do it every day.",

    "story": [
      "Conservative activist Charlie Kirk was shot and killed at Utah Valley University on Wednesday as he addressed a large crowd at an outdoor debate. Officials described it as a \"targeted attack,\" and it drew\u00a0condemnation from both sides of the political aisle as authorities launched a massive search for the suspect.",
      "On Friday, officials announced they have a person in custody for the fatal shooting. They identified him as 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, who resides in southern Utah. Robinson was arrested on charges of aggravated murder, obstruction of justice and felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury, according to an inmate booking sheet from the Utah County Sheriff's Office.",
      "Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray is reviewing the evidence to determine the appropriate charges and plans to file them on Tuesday, Christopher Ballard, chief of staff for the Utah County Attorney's Office, confirmed to CBS Saturday. Robinson could make his first court appearance Tuesday afternoon, Ballard said.",
      "Kirk, who co-founded the right-wing advocacy group Turning Point USA, was 31. He is survived by his wife, Erika, and two young children.",
      "Turning Point USA announced Saturday that a public funeral for Kirk will be held on Sunday, Sept. 21, at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.",
      "Here is what we know so far about the assassination and ongoing investigation.",
      "Who is the suspect?",
      "More details about Robinson and what happened before and after the attack are emerging.",
      "Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said Robinson is not a student at Utah Valley University, where the attack took place, and has been living with his family in Washington County, located in the southwestern corner of the state. Family members said Robinson had \"become more political\" in recent years, the governor said.",
      "Utah State University said Robinson briefly attended the school for one semester in 2021. According to the Utah System of Higher Education, Robinson was a third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship program at Dixie Technical College in St. George, Utah.",
      "Robinson's father owns a business installing kitchen countertops and cabinets and his mother is a licensed social worker, according to public records and their social media accounts. Robinson is the oldest of three brothers.",
      "\"They are very supportive parents who loved their boys and are involved in the community,\" a neighbor who said she knew the Robinson family well but had not seen Robinson in a few years told CBS News. She also said the parents were supportive of the country and of President Trump.",
      "State records show that Robinson registered to vote as unaffiliated. He is listed as an inactive voter in state records, meaning he didn't vote in the last two elections. He was not old enough to vote in 2020.",
      "Robinson had no prior felony or misdemeanor convictions and no prior violent offenses, according to a Public Safety Assessment Report filed in Utah state court.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel said he was taken into custody at 10 p.m. local time Thursday night, though Utah officials said it was in the early hours of Friday. Records from the Utah County Sheriff's Office Corrections Division show he was booked into jail at 7:58 a.m. local time (9:58 a.m. ET).",
      "Mr. Trump first broke the news on \"Fox and Friends\" that someone had been taken into custody.",
      "\"With a high degree of certainty, we have him in custody. Everyone did a great job,\" the president said.",
      "Cox said messages on Discord, an instant messaging and social media platform, that were reviewed by investigators referenced a rifle wrapped in a towel that was left in the woods and engravings on bullets. The messages came from a person named \"Tyler\" and were shared with an unidentified individual, Cox said.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, a spokesperson for Discord said it had removed an account associated with Robinson for violating the company's \"off-platform behavior policy,\" which prohibits users from engaging in various forms of violence, and will continue to coordinate closely with law enforcement. The spokesperson also said Discord \"found no evidence that the suspect planned this incident or promoted violence\" on the platform itself.",
      "\"We are deeply saddened by this tragedy and extend our condolences to the Kirk family and everyone affected,\" the statement said. \"The messages referenced in recent reporting about planning details do not appear to be Discord messages. These were communications between the suspect's roommate and a friend after the shooting, where the roommate was recounting the contents of a note the suspect had left elsewhere.\"",
      "The governor said authorities believe Robinson acted alone and said there is currently no information that would lead to additional arrests. He told reporters Friday morning he can't answer questions about the possible motive of the suspect.",
      "Robinson is currently on \"special watch\" at the Utah County Jail while he is being evaluated to determine if he is a risk to himself or others, Utah County Sheriff's Spokesperson Sgt. Raymond Ormond told CBS News. Inmates are held in a special housing unit while on special watch.",
      "All inmates are given an initial screening after booking, but some are put on the more intensive special watch until they're screened, depending on the crimes they committed or things they said, Ormond said.",
      "How the suspect was captured",
      "Cox said Robinson's father recognized his son as the subject of photos that were released by law enforcement and urged him to turn himself in.",
      "Robinson admitted to his father that he was the person in the photos, two federal law enforcement sources told CBS News. Robinson said he would rather die by suicide than turn himself in, the federal law enforcement sources said.",
      "Robinson's father called a youth pastor who knows the 22-year-old and is close to the family, and he and the pastor tried to calm Robinson down. The sources said the pastor, who also serves as a court security officer, called the U.S. Marshals Service and other law enforcement agencies. Marshals  then detained Robinson and kept him secure while waiting for the FBI. The FBI later took him into custody.",
      "Investigators reviewed video footage and said they identified Robinson arriving on Utah Valley University's campus in a gray Dodge Challenger at around 8:29 a.m. local time Wednesday, the day of the shooting, according to the governor. Robinson was wearing a plain maroon T-shirt, light-colored shorts, a black hat with a white logo and light-colored shoes, Cox said.",
      "He is believed to have changed clothing on the roof, where the shot was fired from, before changing back into what he was originally wearing. When investigators encountered Robinson, he was wearing clothing consistent with that outfit, the governor said.",
      "Tracking the suspect",
      "On Thursday, Utah Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason described the suspect they were seeking as a male who \"blended in\" with the college community and appeared to be college age.",
      "The public safety department and the Salt Lake City FBI office posted images of someone they called a \"person of interest,\" showing an individual appearing to wear a dark long-sleeve shirt, a hat and sunglasses. More photos posted later on Thursday showed the person wearing a backpack.",
      "Mason said investigators were able to track the shooter's movements before and after the assassination.",
      "According to a probable cause statement filed by investigators after Robinson's arrest, investigators were able to track his movements on campus starting at approximately 11:50 a.m. local time on Wednesday. He was observed entering a building called the Losee Center near where Kirk's event was taking place, which was the shooting location, and going up to the roof, according to the statement.",
      "Mason said the shooter moved to the other side of the building after firing a single shot, then jumped off and fled into a neighborhood off campus. Investigators contacted homeowners with cameras and witnesses to identify leads, he said.",
      "In a news briefing Thursday evening in Orem, Utah, with Patel in attendance, officials released security video that showed a man \u2014 who Mason called a suspect \u2014 running across the roof and then climbing down the side of the building immediately after the shooting.",
      "As he climbed off the edge of the building and dropped down, he \"left some palm impressions, some smudges, some places we're looking to collect DNA,\" along with a shoe print that indicated he was wearing Converse tennis shoes, Mason told reporters while showing the video.",
      "\"It's important to note his black t-shirt, his black pants, and there appears to be some white on the soles of those Converse tennis shoes,\" Mason said. \"Those are all identifiable items that we're looking for.\"",
      "After dropping off the building, the video showed the man moving across a grassy area before entering traffic. Mason said he crossed the street into a wooded area, where the firearm believed to have been used in the shooting was later found.",
      "The FBI said it was offering a reward of up to $100,000 for information that leads law enforcement to identify and arrest the person or people involved in Kirk's assassination. Patel said authorities had received more than 11,000 leads as of Friday morning.",
      "Gun and bullet casings recovered",
      "FBI special-agent-in-charge Robert Bohls said Thursday that investigators recovered a \"high-powered, bolt-action rifle,\" which they believe was the weapon used in the assassination. It was found in a wooded area where the shooter fled and was wrapped in a towel, according to Bohls. The rifle was determined to be a Mauser .30-06-caliber bolt-action rifle, according to the probable cause statement.",
      "Cox said that there were inscriptions on the casings of the bullet that was fired, as well as on the casings of three bullets that were not fired.",
      "According to the probable cause statement, the fired bullet casing contained the inscription, \"Notices Buldge OWO what's this?\" An unfired bullet casing read, \"hey fascist! CATCH!\" followed by an up arrow symbol, a right arrow symbol and three down arrow symbols. And a second unfired casing read, \"O Bella ciao, Bella ciao, Bella ciao, Ciao, ciao!\" A third unfired casing said, \"If you read This, you are GAY Lmao.\"",
      "Cox didn't speculate on the meaning of the inscriptions.",
      "Investigators also have a footwear impression, palm print and forearm imprints that will be analyzed, the FBI official said.",
      "Timeline of \"targeted attack\"",
      "The event where Kirk was speaking was scheduled to begin in the UVU courtyard at noon.",
      "A CBS News review of livestream footage and video metadata indicates Kirk was shot around 12:23 p.m., which is also when the FBI's Patel said Kirk was shot. He was struck in the neck by a single gunshot.",
      "A map produced by CBS News' Confirmed team shows where Kirk was when he was shot \u2014 in the central courtyard of Utah Valley University, which is surrounded by campus buildings.",
      "A university spokeswoman said Wednesday that they believed the shot was fired from the Losee Center. A law enforcement source told CBS News that the gunman appeared to have fired from the building's roof.",
      "The FBI released a video\u00a0\u2014 timestamped at 12:23 p.m. local time \u2014 that appears to show a person climbing off a roof at Utah Valley University and fleeing the scene. Dispatch audio reviewed by CBS News described a person on the roof of a nearby building wearing black clothing and carrying a long rifle.",
      "Video captured at 2:37 p.m. shows officers searching an area around a quarter mile north of the campus.",
      "At 2:40, more than two hours after the shooting, Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social that Kirk had died.",
      "While authorities have not specified a potential motive for the shooting, Mason said they believe it was a \"targeted attack toward one individual.\" Only one shot was fired, and Kirk was the only victim, the commissioner said.",
      "Cox called the shooting \"a political assassination,\" while Mr. Trump, in a video posted to Truth Social, blamed it on \"radical left political violence,\" which he said \"has hurt too many innocent people and taken too many lives.\"",
      "Charlie Kirk's influence in politics",
      "Kirk was shot while he was speaking at a \"Prove Me Wrong\" debate, a trademark event for Kirk's Turning Point USA, which is a conservative organization focused on young people. He would hold political debates with a group that usually consisted of left-leaning attendees.",
      "Kirk had visited the Utah university as part of a nationwide tour of college campuses that was scheduled to continue for the next two months. About 3,000 people attended the outdoor event where he was assassinated, the Utah Department of Public Safety said in a statement.",
      "Mr. Trump called Kirk legendary, saying, \"No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie. He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us.\"",
      "Kirk was a close Trump ally and was credited with galvanizing younger voters during his campaign. He made it his mission to engage more young people in politics and register them to vote. Kirk was also a close friend of the president's son, Donald Trump Jr.",
      "Kirk was the host of \"The Charlie Kirk Show,\" a daily conservative talk radio show and amassed millions of followers on social media.",
      "Kirk's politics, however, weren't without controversy. He pushed false claims about voter fraud after Mr. Trump lost the 2020 presidential election, stoked skepticism about the COVID-19 pandemic and spread anti-trans rhetoric. He also amplified the \"Great Replacement\" conspiracy, which is based on the belief that there's a plot to replace White people with minorities.",
      "He was a friend of JD Vance, who said Kirk advocated \"in public and private\" for Mr. Trump to pick him as his running mate last year.",
      "\"So much of the success we've had in this administration traces directly to Charlie's ability to organize and convene,\" Vance said after Kirk was killed. \"He didn't just help us win in 2024, he helped us staff the entire government.\"",

    "summary": "The murder of Charlie Kirk last week follows a litany of violent acts against political targets. Historian Jon Meacham talks about the existential questions now facing America.",
    "story": [
      "For Jon Meacham, the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian, and author of \"The Soul of America: The Battle for Our Better Angels,\" this past week has been disturbing \u2014 and all too familiar. Asked what is the state of America's soul today, he replied, \"I think that we are in a dangerous place. There's never been a once-upon-a-time in American history. There's not going to be a happily-ever-after. But there are moments that you and I could agree we would like to see replicated \u2014 and this is not one of them.",
      "\"Political violence erupts in America when there is an existential question \u2014 who is an American? Who deserves to be included in 'We the people,' or 'All men being created equal'?\" he said. \"When that is in tension, when we don't have common agreement about that, then, if you look at it historically, violence erupts.\"",
      "And on Wednesday, it did.",
      "At Utah Valley University, the crack of a gunshot once again rattled America. Charlie Kirk, a prominent 31-year-old conservative activist, was assassinated as he engaged in public debate.",
      "By Thursday, a suspect was in custody: 22-year-old Utah resident Tyler Robinson.",
      "Kirk had a fervent following on the right, and was a key organizer in President Donald Trump's movement. (At the 2020 GOP Convention, Kirk referred to Trump as \"the bodyguard of Western civilization.\") He also had his critics, who called him an incendiary voice [as when, on his eponymous show, he exclaimed, \"The entire Democrat Party project is how quickly we can turn America into a third-world hellhole\"].",
      "His death has become the latest convulsion in a divided country.",
      "Meacham told Robert Costa, \"We do not want to be in a place where because you disagree with someone, you pick up a gun. That is not what the country can be. And if it is, then it's something different.\"",
      "It's not America? \"It's not the America we want,\" he said.",
      "Kirk's murder is the latest of numerous acts of political violence since last summer, when we saw the first of two assassination attempts on candidate Trump, followed by (to name just a few) the firebombing of the home of Pennsylvania's governor, Democrat Josh Shapiro; the killing of Democratic lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband in Minnesota; the murder of two Israeli embassy workers\u00a0in Washington; and the killing of police officer David Rose\u00a0in a shooting outside\u00a0CDC headquarters in Atlanta.",
      "Costa asked Meacham, \"Are we in a particular time in America when all of this seems to keep happening?\"",
      "\"We are, self-evidently,\" Meacham replied. \"And I think it's because we are experiencing an era in which we are debating, not only the means of politics, but the purpose of politics.\"",
      "Meacham says the purpose of America is an urgent cause for leaders, and for citizens: \"When we lose the capacity to engage in argument and dissent and debate peaceably, we are breaking faith with the American covenant,\" he said. \"And the American covenant is that we live in contention with each other, but we're not at each other's throats.\"",
      "Asked what our political leaders can do to keep that covenant, Meacham said, \"Make the case. Tell the story. What do you want the country to be? This is why history matters, I think, more than ever, because there's not a hell of a lot going on in the present that you want to say, 'Yeah, we want more of that,' right?",
      "\"You want to tell the story of Omaha Beach. You want to tell the story of the Pettus Bridge. You want to tell the story of Gettysburg. Because those were moments where imperfect people actually created a more perfect union. It's not that they were superhuman. Quite the opposite,\" he said.",
      "They got through it, Meacham said, \"barely.\"",
      "But even if Americans can just barely carry on this weekend, Meacham says we must: \"If they could do it, then we can, too, if we decide that this country is about a more perfect union, it is about dissent, it is about respecting each other, and it is not about hunting each other down.\"",

      "\"You log into a site, and you're trying to find the right price based on what other airlines are charging \u2014 that's the ultimate goal,\" Ram Reddy, an AI expert and chief technology officer at Nagarro, a consulting firm, said. \"AI tools that know you well can get you to the right place at the right time, when prices, which aren't static, are changing every minute.\"",
      "Consumers booking trips are already seeing AI's value: 41% of more than 2,000 consumers\u00a0surveyed\u00a0by Oliver Wyman, a management consulting firm, said they had recently used AI tools for travel inspiration or itinerary planning.",
      "From inspiration to booking",
      "There are a range of AI-powered apps and bots at consumers' fingertips that can help plan a trip \u2014 from inception to booking. AI-powered bots can help travelers dream up trip ideas, turn visual inspiration into ready-to-go itineraries, and complete bookings and payments while maximizing the consumer's own loyalty points and other rewards so that they save money. In other words, AI provides the services in which travel agents at brick-and-mortar travel agencies once specialized.",
      "Ways AI can assist travel planning",
      "Did you see a social media post of a trip you'd like to be on? Send it to Expedia to book your own version through a feature called Trip Matching, which can turn social media reels into bookable trip itineraries.",
      "Don't know what to plan for the kids while on a family vacation? ChatGPT can generate a list of free activities in any locale.",
      "Not sure how many loyalty points or rewards you've accrued, or what they're worth? A company called Gondola AI can figure that out, helping users maximize their loyalty points so their dollars take them further.",
      "Trip planning and booking is prime territory for AI agents to test their skills, and hopefully, make the process easier for consumers, according to AI leaders.",
      "\"These days, it's easier to identify where AI is not being used to help travelers. It is everywhere, from planning to booking,\" Melanie Fish, head of global PR for Expedia Brands, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Jennifer Yellin, travel expert at Points Path, a browser extension that helps consumers compare flight deals, said the more she utilizes AI for trip planning, the better the technology gets to know her, and the more useful it becomes.",
      "\"The more you use it, it starts to recognize your patterns and preferences. It gets to know you as a traveler,\" she said of a Gondola AI, one of her favorite new tools. \"If you've been booking stays at Ritz Carltons, it won't suggest a Marriott Residence Inn as a first option; it will suggest a stay of a similar caliber.\"",
      "\"I used it dozens of times\"",
      "Other travel industry pros say they see more value in AI's ability to help them navigate locales once they've arrived.",
      "\"ChatGPT totally revolutionized how we were able to get along in China \u2014 I used it to scan menus and translate them into English,\" Scott Keyes, founder of flight deals site Going.com, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I used it dozens of times a day.\"",
      "As far as trip planning goes, Keyes said that while he's generally an AI optimist, \"the use case has not yet proven itself to me.\"",
      "Which tools are the most helpful? These are some popular trip planning tools. Here's how they can help, and where they fall short.",
      "AI travel planning tools",
      "ChatGPT:\u00a0The AI chatbot can suggest places to stay or things to do anywhere in the world. Tell it you're visiting New York City around Christmastime with young children and you're not sure what neighborhood to stay in. It can suggest parts of town and outline their pros and cons.",
      "Google Flight Deals: Enter a destination and desired dates, or describe the type of trip you'd like to take, such as \"beach escape,\" or \"Paris in the fall.\" Let the AI-powered search engine \u2014 designed for travelers who want to save money \u2014 try to find you the best deal based on such parameters. The tool is not an AI agent though, and can't book tickets for you.",
      "Expedia Trip Matching:\u00a0The AI tool lets you send a public Instagram travel reel, or video, to Expedia, which will create an itinerary based on the visual inspiration you provide. The reel must be publicly available on Instagram, and the AI tool can only suggest trips in the U.S. market.",
      "Gondola AI: Give the tool access to your email, and it will cull your loyalty points and rewards from airlines, hotels and credit card companies to let you know what they are worth. It will compare prices in cash versus combinations of points, and can save you hundreds of dollars. It comes into play after you've decided where you want to go and stay. \"We are about finding you money, earning you money and redeeming at the highest possible value,\" Erickson said.",

      "Saudi Arabia will host the Riyadh Comedy Festival, which organizers say will be the \"world's largest comedy festival,\" from Sept. 26 to Oct. 9. Some of North America's most popular comedians, along with comics from Europe and elsewhere, are featured on the bill, including Dave Chapelle, Kevin Hart and Bill Burr.",
      "The festival will be the latest in a series of sports and cultural events hosted by Saudi Arabia's government that critics say amount to an effort to obscure the country's reputation for rampant human rights abuses.",
      "\"The Saudi government has invested billions into high profile entertainment events like these in a deliberate effort to whitewash the country's human rights record and deflect from the egregious abuses that continue to happen inside of the country,\" Human Rights Watch researcher Joey Shea told CBS News. \"These investments are a part of the broader strategy to... have people thinking about a comedy event, for example, rather than the soaring number of executions that are happening inside of the country.\"",

      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back. We're going to take a closer look at the problem of political violence in America. And we're joined now, I'm glad to say, by University of Chicago Professor Robert Pape. He's the founding director of the Chicago Project on Security and Threats. Professor, it's great to have you with us. Thanks for joining us. What are the trend lines, and what is the key terminology you want my audience to understand?",
      "PROFESSOR ROBERT PAPE: We are now in a watershed moment for what I call the era of violent populism in America. This era is defined, first and foremost, by two factors: Number one, a rising tide of political violence on both the right and the left. And just think, and I want to go back to 2002 just think of the attack- the assassination attempt on Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Leader of the House, missed her, almost killed her husband. The attempt on Brett Kavanaugh, conservative Supreme Court Justice. Two attempts on Republican candidate Donald Trump, and then the- in Minnesota just a few months ago, not just attempts, but actual assassinations of Democratic leaders. Josh Shapiro, Governor of Pennsylvania. And now, we see Charlie Kirk assassinated. And what we are seeing is this clear rising trend in numbers of attacks, side-by-side with that, though, we are also seeing a rising tide, a groundswell of support for political violence on both the right and the left that corresponds with this rising trend of political violence on both the right and the left. Our Center at the University of Chicago Project on Security and Threats, we have been conducting highly reliable national surveys on political violence- the support for political violence among Americans for over four years. We started this in the summer of 2021. Our most recent survey in- survey in May found higher levels of support for political violence on both the right and the left than we have ever seen, and that's one of the reasons why I rang the alarm bell with that big op-ed in the New York Times in June saying we're on the cusp of major political violence, and I'm sorry to say we're now right in the grip of violent populism.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And in that survey data, is it that people who respond to your survey say, to reconcile myself to the political outcome I want- I will be willing to resort to violence? Is that the key connection point?",
      "PAPE: The key connection is the particular political grievance. So we asked, just give you an example, 39% of Democrats say they agree that the use of force is justified to remove Donald Trump from the presidency. When we go deeper to probe what do they mean by use of force? 55% are talking about assassinations. They're talking about lethal uses of force. That's why we use that term. On the right, we also asked that very same survey. We found 24% of Republicans agree that Donald Trump is justified in using the US military to suppress democratic protesters. So these are very specific questions. We have a whole slew of these questions so that we really can speak with great precision about what are the grievances that people want to say use of force is justified. We know what the meaning of that term is, and then we can see Democrat-Republican in the cross-tabs.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Does your research buttress the point that both Senator Lankford and Senator Coons made, which is the internet is an accelerant and an amplifier?",
      "PAPE: It's an accelerant, but it's not the root cause. So, studying this problem now for five years, I found that just as around the world, big social change, it drives political violence. We see this in other countries around the world, and- but the details of the change vary. We are now moving for the first time in our country's 250-year history, from a white majority democracy, to a white minority democracy. In 1990, we were 76% non-Hispanic white. Today, we're 57% non-Hispanic white. It will be another 10 years, maybe 15 if we deport a lot of those undocumented, illegal immigrants, before we make the transition to a truly white-minority democracy. Well, this generational change has happened. It started about 10 years ago, with the real tipping point generation and corresponds with the rise of Donald Trump, why his issue of immigration is meteoric, why it's morphed from immigration meaning stop people crossing the border to now deporting mass numbers of people, because there are people on the right who want to stop or reverse this, and also the virulent reaction to Donald Trump on the left- on parts of the left, who want to keep this going. This is really the taproot, and that's why we need to expect- this left to its own devices will get worse and be with us for 10 years.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: So, this is a demographic story that is creating a political backlash that gets amplified and accelerated online. Do I have that right?",
      "PAPE: You've got it exactly right. And these are why it's not the internet is not important. It's a reinforcing factor. And there is \u2013",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: In other words, it's too simplistic to say it's the internet?",
      "PAPE: Exactly. Because-that's why- a few years ago, people challenged my findings, and said, oh no, no, we'll just deplatform people. So the problem here is just the internet, so we're going to deplatform X, Y, and Z. We deplatformed X, Y, and Z, and you know what? Didn't miss a beat. And the reason is because, yes, it is an additional- it's like throwing gasoline on the fire, but the internet is not the fire itself. There's something going on, which is really radicalizing our politics. And I'm sorry to say, this is a story that we've seen around the world, in other countries, other times. And so this is- this is the social change leading to radicalized politics that changes winners and losers in our society for real, and that's leading to political violence.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Professor, it has always been a hallmark of this country, we have sort of thought about ourselves as having this experiment that has lots of differences of opinion, spasms of violence, but in the end, we reconcile and we move forward. Are you any more or less optimistic about that and that underlying assumption about the core ability of America than you were previously?",
      "PAPE: The future is in our hands. This is not locked-in with destiny. That said, if we do nothing, this will keep getting worse. The number one thing we have to do is we need our political leaders to step up. And we just saw an instance of that, just previously, where we have Senators from both sides of the aisle making a joint video appearance. Well, that's really quite- to condemn violence. That's important, because the leaders can restrain their own constituents. When they bad-mouth the other side's constituents, our data shows that makes everything worse. That's the worst of all possible worlds, because it produces defiance. We need to step that up. What would step that up? A summit between President Trump, Governor Newsom, and Governor Pritzker, a public session where they, all together, condemn political violence.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Professor Pape, I'm very glad you're here. Modeling behavior matters in many contexts, in life, political, and otherwise. Thank you very much. We'll be back in just a moment."

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sens. Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, and James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 14, 2025.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to \"Face The Nation.\" For a look at how Congress may- may help bridge political divisions in the country presently, we turn to a couple of lawmakers with a lot of experience in that space. Democratic Senator Chris Coons, who joins us from Wilmington, Delaware, Republican Senator James Lankford, who joins us from Oklahoma City. Gentlemen, you have a well-earned reputation, both, for preaching bipartisanship, taking the rhetorical temperature in Washington and nationwide down a notch or two. Senator Coons, I want to start with you. After the events of this week, do you feel that's harder than ever to achieve?",
      "SEN. CHRIS COONS: It is. And, Major, thank you, for a chance to be on with you and with my friend, Senator Lankford. The brutal assassination of Charlie Kirk, while he was in the middle of a debate on a college campus, goes to the very heart of what it means to be American, of the importance of the First Amendment, of free speech, and someone like Charlie Kirk, who was a nationally known figure, who dedicated himself to debate, to engagement with his political adversaries, should not have paid with his life for the opportunity to speak out. No matter how much I might deeply disagree with his political views, the idea that he would be killed in such a grotesque and public way has to bring all of us to reflect about how hard it's getting, because the internet is an accelerant. It is driving extremism in our country. It's driving us apart, left and right, and leaders like Senator Lankford, Governor Cox, have an obligation and an opportunity to join with leaders from my party in urging folks to set aside any thought of political violence and to respect each other, even as we keep advancing our political differences through discourse.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Lankford, do you ever at times feel as if your appeals for better angels, calmer rhetoric, more bipartisanship, is shouting into an internet void?",
      "SEN. JAMES LANKFORD: It is, because the algorithm pushes people to the most extreme. The algorithm is all- on social media is always pushing who's the angriest, who's the loudest, who says the craziest thing, that's what gets repeated over and over and over again. So anytime that there is cogent dialogue or an issue on something where people may disagree, but they're having a civil conversation on it, that gets pushed aside, towards someone that's just angry and focused. This is somewhat human nature, to be able to say, we disagree. We find areas where we disagree, and we try to be able to solve those. The best way to be able to solve those is through words, talking it out, finding an opportunity to be able to do it. But I would tell you, this kind of anger is as old as Cain and Abel. To be able to go back and say, I'm mad at you, so I'm going to try to destroy you, whether it's destroy you online, or to try to humiliate you, or to cancel you, or to, in this case, try to murder you publicly. It is- it is painful to be able to see that part of humanity, and it is better for us to be able to push better angels.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Lankford, first you, then Senator Coons. Senator Lankford, are you afraid for your own security right now?",
      "SEN. LANKFORD: I am- I am attentive to my own security, how about that, for myself and for my family. My staff and I have to- have to talk through each public event, but we've had to do that for a while. As you may know well, there have been 14,000 threats against members of Congress just this calendar year. This is not new, but it continues to be able to rise. As we've seen, Democratic lawmakers in Minnesota, in their own home, have a home invasion, to be murdered in their home, as we've seen a governor in Pennsylvania have his home set on fire. It's not just public events, it's also in our private spaces as well, that we're keenly aware that there are people that are irrational, that do irrational acts.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Coons?",
      "SEN. COONS: I agree that for all of us who serve in public life, whether it's leading a nonprofit or a church, teaching in a school, or being a public advocate, someone engaged in public debate as Charlie Kirk was, the risk is getting higher. And to have to worry about the safety of your own family, if you step forward to serve as a judge, if you write editorials, if you lead a nonprofit, or if you serve in Congress or run for president, to have to worry not just about your own physical safety, but the safety of your spouse and children, I think, weakens our ability to have good and robust debates, to have a well-led nation, and to demonstrate to the world that we're a nation committed to free speech, but where we reject political violence. So of course, anyone in public life today is more concerned about the tragedy in Utah, about the incidents that Senator Lankford just referenced, the attempt to kidnap the governor of Michigan, to assault Speaker Pelosi's husband, the shooting of Steve Scalise and the shootings at other members of Congress. The recent incidents have gotten worse and worse and I think I know the reason. It's principally because the internet is fueling and accelerating those deep-seated inclinations towards violence and seeing others as enemies that James was referencing. And there are steps we can and should take in Congress to address that.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The administration this weekend, as I'm sure you two are both aware, putting before Congress $58 billion in security for members of Congress, the judiciary and the like. Senator Coons, you believe Congress will be disposed to agree to that?",
      "SEN. COONS: I hope that we will step up and invest more. I just hosted a bipartisan event last week on protecting state judges, and we had state judicial leaders from across the country, from Delaware and Texas and many other states, talk about harrowing incidents and tragic killings of members of the judiciary. I hope we will invest in securing our public life, because incidents like this tragedy in Utah, like the murder of Melissa and her husband Mark Hortman in Minnesota, frankly, fuel further anger in our country, and the ways in which folks are then taking the horrific images of these incidents and propagating them on the internet, adds fuel to the fire. We can and should pass bills, as we just did. Senator Cruz and Senator Klobuchar worked together to pass, and President Trump signed into law, the TAKE IT DOWN Act, to remove some of the most harmful pornographic, revenge porn images from the internet. And we have a bill right in front of us, the Kids Online Safety Act that's broadly bipartisan, that we should pass to help reduce some of the risks and harms to our families in our country, from the internet.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Lankford, I misspoke that's 58 million, not 58 billion, but it's a substantial sum.",
      "SEN. LANKFORD: Yeah, it is a substantial sum. What was funny was I was going to actually correct you on that, to let you know it's an 'M', not a 'B' on that particular one, but it is something to be able to set aside and say, what are we doing? It's not- it is about the person and their family, but it's also about the title. It's about the task, because that person represents that state, that- that part of the nation, that particular task, my wife and I often talk about the fact that I have this title of senator for a season. Someone else had it before me, someone else will have it after me. But while I have it, I'm a steward of that task and that responsibility. And so when we're talking about protecting judges and protecting individuals, it's not just their personal safety. It is really declaring to the nation that we believe that these tasks are hard, that there should be intense debate, that we have very different perspectives. Chris Coons and I are very close friends, but we have very different ideas on some things. But we have the ability to be able to represent our individual states instead of ideas, and to be able to talk those two things out, and to be able to bring things together and say, I know areas where we disagree, where do we agree? How can we solve it? That is where we are at our best as Americans is to say we don't oppress each other. We try to be able to find our common ground and to be able to move forward as we can and- but as Chris has mentioned, the online kids safety Act is a great piece of legislation to be able to protect our kids. We are seeing people radicalize online, on social media and through the internet in the United States, by other Americans and by the algorithm that's there. And I would tell you, as recently as just a couple of weeks ago, I was in a school in Oklahoma that now Oklahoma schools have banned all cell phones from bell to bell at school. You cannot have a cell phone on your- on your- on from bell to bell on campus. And the principals and the teachers all talk about how dramatically different the environment is on campus right now because people are looking up, people are interacting. People are talking again. They're not just staring at their phone. They're not getting fed all this vitriol all day long. And so it changes the mood of everything just by looking at each other in the face and saying, let's see if we can work this out.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Lankford, I'm going to bring up something that's playing out through the country right now, and it's making all the things you and Senator Coons have talked about more difficult, which is people who have posted about Charlie Kirk have jobs and are being fired because what they've posted online has been viewed by their personnel directors or leaders as inappropriate. At any governmental level or in the private sector, are you comfortable having someone fired for an utterance about Charlie Kirk's death?",
      "SEN. LANKFORD: Yeah, this is about protecting the individual businesses. And what people are seeing is this cancel culture that still persists, that if you voice something that becomes a big push back from the community, the employer will step up and say, hey, you're about to kill our business based on what you're saying online. Everyone has to understand what they say privately online can get connected to their business. We have a veterinarian clinic in Oklahoma City right now that one of the veterinarians posted something just absolutely horrific about--and now we're calling out the sick ones right after Charlie Kirk was murdered that now there's been big pushback through that veterinary clinic, because people are saying, okay, this is the person- do I want to do business with that person if they have that belief? So this is part of the challenge that we have with social media and with employments. Employers are going to say, don't hurt our business based on the foolish things that you choose to say, to be able to say online.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Coons, how about within the federal government?",
      "SEN. COONS: Well, the way James put it there, I think, is a good balance between it's okay to have codes of conduct to say to an employee, you shouldn't be speaking out on behalf of this company or this department of the federal government, where your role, for example, requires that you be trusted and that you not take partisan political positions. One of the challenges of the intersection of the line between social media and one's conduct on behalf of the government is that today we can see into your internal views. But it's not that new. So, let's imagine that you're a career federal prosecutor or you're a judge. Historically, there have been clear rules against engaging in partisan politics while you're performing those functions. The internet just makes it easier for folks to police and punish those who make statements that are considered extreme or out of the mainstream. Cancel culture is a real challenge to us, to balancing free speech with positions of responsibility, and we have to find our way through this together in a way that offers some grace and humility while celebrating the free speech that is the foundation of our republic, and urging people to think twice before they post things that are outrageous online.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Lankford, the country is going to look to Congress here in the next couple of weeks to avert a government shutdown. Also possibly extend soon to expire Affordable Care Act subsidies that help people afford insurance. In this climate and with those eyes of the nation upon Congress, how do you expect that to play out?",
      "SEN. LANKFORD: I expect us to be able to solve the budget issues, which the American people expect to be able to- to do as well. These are hard issues. We're sent to be able to do hard things. We should do hard things on it. We should not, first and foremost, have a government shutdown. We have $37 trillion in debt right now. We should have hard conversations about debt and deficit, but they shouldn't be during a government shutdown. What we're currently arguing right now about is a seven-week extension on the current budget spending, to say we're not changing anything, but for the next seven weeks, let's just hold it until we get a longer budget agreement and can actually come to agreement. What has been floated is a $300 billion requirement, by some of my Democratic colleagues, to say, if we don't spend an additional $300 billion, we're not going to keep the government open the next seven weeks. This is also a subsidy, an insurance subsidy, that was put in place during COVID and just after COVID, to say, due to the health care issues around COVID, we're going to extend additional insurance coverage that's there. COVID and the crisis of COVID has now passed on it, it's difficult to say we should spend an additional $300 billion just to stay open the next seven weeks due to a COVID emergency at this point. So yes, we'll have- we'll have hard conversations, but let's have it. Let's- let's talk it out. Let's figure it out.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Coons, you're going to get the last word. Respond to Senator Lankford on that.",
      "SEN. COONS: Well, this is an area where Senator Lankford and I disagree. We are both appropriators. We both want to find a way to work together to keep the government open, but the Republican-only bill that was passed earlier this year, the so-called Big Beautiful Bill, threatens to raise rates for health care for millions of Americans and to throw millions more off of health care. I think there are ways we can reduce the harm to Americans' healthcare through the appropriations process. The bill that we both voted for in our committee in July would restore many of the proposed deep cuts to the National Institutes of Health for example, one positive step forward. We have to find a way to resolve these issues and reduce or reverse some of the harm that's being done to Americans' health care.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Chris Coons, Delaware Democrat. Senator James Lankford, Oklahoma Republican. Thank you both. I appreciate it. And we'll be right back."

      "MAJOR GARRETT: The Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, who joins us this morning from Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, it's good to see you. I appreciate your time. The burdens of speakership are always manifold. You know that. Previous speakers I've covered know that, but they feel particularly heavy after the events of this week. I just want to ask you, Mr. Speaker, how are you doing?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: I'm doing okay, Major. Thanks for asking. No question, it was a difficult week for the country. Certainly, it was felt on Capitol Hill. There's a mixture of, you know, anger and sadness and fear, frankly, on the part of a lot of people. It cast a large shadow across the country and the nation's capital. But what I do know, Major, is that my good friend Charlie would not want any of us to be consumed by despair. He would want us to go forward boldly, that was his message, and to do it in love. And I think that, I hope, is the message that continues in the days ahead.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: It's not common for this show to pick up on something said by Connecticut's Young Democrats and Connecticut's Young Republicans, but they put out a statement that has gotten quite a bit of attention on the internet, saying as follows, \"there is no place in our country for such acts, regardless of political disagreements.\" Do you believe on Capitol Hill there will be a method to forge any sort of bipartisan remembrance of Charlie Kirk?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: There will be. You know, we had a moment of prayer and silent reflection on the floor on Wednesday within an hour of his passing. There will be, I participated in a large vigil here in Baton Rouge at LSU, my alma mater, on Friday night. Tonight, we'll have a big, I hope, bipartisan prayer and reflection vigil in Capitol Hill at the Kennedy Center. There will be a members reflection and prayer moment that I'll lead on Monday night. This will continue. I think that the country needs to see leaders in Congress and leaders with platforms all around the country speaking truth and bringing calm to the situation. We should appeal, as Lincoln reminded us so many years ago, to the better angels among us all. And I think this is a real moment for America [TECHNICAL DISRUPTION] -- affirmatively. And I think one of the ways to do that, Major, is to adopt the manner of Charlie Kirk because while he loved vigorous debate and he believed in the free marketplace of ideas, and advancing truth boldly, he also was motivated by love for his fellow man because he never hated the person on the other side of the table. And I think everyone would do well to be reminded of that model.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Mr. Speaker, you mentioned the word fear a moment ago. It is on the lips of members of Congress in ways I've never experienced before. They are talking openly. They already have canceled events. Other members are talking about whether or not it's proper in their family conversations to seek re-election. How do you feel this particular space of anxiety for your membership, Republican and Democrat?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: Yeah, well, I've been talking with a lot of them over the last few days about that and trying to calm the nerves, to assure them that we will, we will make certain that everyone has a level of security that's necessary, that the resources will be there for their residential security and their personal security. We're evaluating all the options for that. But also, to be- to be, you know, reminded that it does take a certain measure of courage to step out and- and to lead. I mean, our first responders do it every day, our members of the military do it every day and political figures as well. But I think if we all adopt these practices together and we turn down the rhetoric, we, you know, cease with this idea that, you know, policy disputes are somehow an existential threat to democracy or the republic, we stop calling one another names. I mean calling people Nazis and fascists is not helpful. Look, there are some deranged people in society and when they see leaders using that kind of language, so often now, increasingly, it spurs them on to action. We have to recognize that reality and address it appropriately. And I'm heartened to know, Major, and to see that many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are stepping up and saying that and addressing it. I think this could be a turning point, frankly, to use Charlie's term, for the country, and I hope that's true.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Would that turning point, from your vantage point, Mr. Speaker, because I know you had a long conversation with President Trump, extend to the White House itself?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: Well, of course. Look, the President knew Charlie very well. He was like a family member to the Trumps. Many of us felt that close association with him, and he admired Charlie's approach to public debate. And you've heard him say that publicly. He was- Charlie was a good man, and I think the best way we honor his memory is to continue to do that very thing, and not shy away from debate, to keep the free marketplace of ideas going, but to work on the tone of those debates. Because I think that- I think that serves the best of our principles, our Judeo-Christian heritage as a nation, our civil discourse, and we got to return to that.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Mr. Speaker, several issues pending before Congress, not the least of which is keeping the government open. I know you prefer a seven-week clean CR, but there is a press for other issues. Extending Obamacare tax subsidies. There's been a push this weekend for Russia sanctions backed by Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, in the Senate. Will either of those, from your vantage point, get into something to keep the government open?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: Well, listen, we've been working very hard in the House to restore regular order in the appropriations government funding process, and that's something that no one's really seen for a long time on Capitol Hill. But I'm encouraged that, in a bipartisan fashion, our House Appropriations Committee has passed all 12 of the annual appropriations bills through the committee. We've got three off the House floor. The Senate's passed a few, and then last week, we voted to move into a conference [TECHNICAL DISRUPTION] --",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: -- Okay, Mr. Speaker, I believe there's a technical glitch that has forced us to lose your audio. We're going to take a quick break, and we'll come right back to House Speaker Mike Johnson in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in just a moment.",
      "[COMMERCIAL BREAK]",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to Face the Nation. Because technical gremlins lurk everywhere, they got in between my conversation with House Speaker Mike Johnson. Mr. Speaker, I'm glad to have you back. You were in the middle of answering about Obamacare tax subsidies, possible sanctions against Russia and a government funding mechanism. Please continue.",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: Yeah, sorry about the interruption there. Listen, we're very encouraged that we've been able to restore the regular appropriations, regular order process --",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: -- Right, but are we going to get this done? Are those two other things going to be added to the process, Mr. Speaker?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: We'll have to see. I got to build consensus around all of it, but I think we'll need a short-term funding measure. A clean CR that will allow more time to figure all this out. We certainly hope that Democrats will go along on that, because, if not, they really have no excuse. If they shut the government down, it would be their unilateral decision to do so.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And when Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, says, as he did this weekend, now is the time for Russia sanctions. President Trump opened the door on tariffs against India and China as a way to create economic leverage to end the war in Ukraine. Where do you stand on all that?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: Listen, I do believe that desperate times call for desperate measures, and I think appropriate sanctions on Russia are far overdue. I mean, I think there's a big appetite for that in Congress, so we're willing to work with the White House and our Senate colleagues in the House to get that done and I'm anxious to do it, personally.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Are you waiting for the President to give you the green light or might Congress act on this on its own volition?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: Well, Congress really can't do this on its own volition because, of course, the President would need to sign whatever we do into law. So it has to be a partnership, but we defer to the commander in chief. I mean, the President is a strong and bold leader on the world stage. He has brokered peace around the world and other conflicts in a way that no one before him has been able to do, and so we're trusting that he can use that same force and that same approach to bring about, finally, an end to this war in Ukraine. Everyone in America wants that bloodshed to end, and President Trump is forcing that, and I certainly [TECHNICAL DISRUPTION]--",

Mr. Speaker, I'm told that the technical difficulties keep arising, so a bit prematurely we're going to end our conversation here to spare you and spare our audience from continued mayhem by technical gremlins.

    "story": [
      "A\u00a0London march\u00a0organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson drew more than 110,000 people and became unruly on Saturday as a small group of his supporters clashed with police officers who were separating them from counterprotesters.",
      "Several officers were punched, kicked and struck by bottles tossed by people at the fringes of the \"Unite the Kingdom\" rally, Metropolitan Police said. Reinforcements with helmets and riot shields were deployed to support the 1,000-plus officers on duty.",
      "Twenty six police officers were injured \u2014 four who were seriously hurt, including broken teeth and a concussion, a possible broken nose and a spinal injury. At least 25 people were arrested for offenses including violent disorder, assaults and criminal damage, and the investigation continues, police said.",
      "\"There is no doubt that many came to exercise their lawful right to protest, but there were many who came intent on violence,\" Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist said. \"They confronted officers, engaging in physical and verbal abuse and making a determined effort to breach cordons in place to keep everyone safe.\"",
      "The rally drew an estimated crowd of between 110,000 and 150,000 people, far surpassing expectations, police said. The rival \"March Against Fascism\" protest organized by Stand Up To Racism had about 5,000 marchers.",
      "At one point, the larger crowd stretched from Big Ben across the River Thames and around the corner beyond Waterloo train station, a distance of three-quarters of a mile (around a kilometer).",
      "While the crowd was large, it fell far short of one of the biggest recent marches when a pro-Palestinian rally drew an estimated 300,000 people in November 2023.",
      "Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon and is known for his nationalist and anti-migrant views, billed the march as a demonstration for free speech, and also said it was in defense of British heritage and culture.",

      "Numerous anti-migrant protests were held this summer outside hotels housing asylum-seekers following the arrest of an Ethiopian man who was later convicted of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl in a London suburb. Some of those protests became violent and led to arrests.",
      "Participants in the \"Unite the Kingdom\" march carried the St. George's red-and-white flag of England and the Union Jack, the state flag of the United Kingdom, and chanted, \"We want our country back.\" U.K. flags have proliferated this summer across the U.K. \u2014 at events and on village lampposts \u2014 in what some have said is a show of national pride and others said reflects a tilt toward nationalism.",
      "Some Robinson supporters held signs saying \"stop the boats,\" \"send them home,\" and \"enough is enough, save our children.\"",
      "At the counterprotest, the crowd held signs saying \"refugees welcome\" and \"smash the far right,\" and shouted \"stand up, fight back.\"",
      "Robinson supporters chanted crude refrains about U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and also shouted messages of support for slain U.S. conservative activist Charlie Kirk.",
      "Kirk was shot and killed on Wednesday at Utah Valley University as he addressed a large crowd at an outdoor debate. Officials described it as a \"targeted attack,\" and it drew\u00a0condemnation from both sides\u00a0of the political aisle as authorities launched a massive\u00a0search\u00a0for the suspect.",
      "Officials announced they have a person in custody for the fatal shooting and identified him as 22-year-old\u00a0Tyler Robinson, who resides in southern Utah. Robinson was arrested on charges of aggravated murder, obstruction of justice and felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury, according to an inmate booking sheet from the Utah County Sheriff's Office.",
      "One demonstrator held a sign saying: \"Freedom of speech is dead. RIP Charlie Kirk.\"",
      "Robinson had planned a \"Unite the Kingdom\" rally last October, but couldn't attend after being jailed for contempt of court for violating a 2021 High Court order barring him from repeating libelous allegations against a Syrian refugee who successfully sued him. He previously served jail time for assault and mortgage fraud.",

    "summary": "Earlier this month, the U.S. deported a group of non-Ghanaian nationals to Ghana, including deportees from Gambia and Nigeria.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Saturday accused the Trump administration of trying to do an \"end-run\" around legal obligations that the U.S. has to protect people fleeing persecution and torture following the deportation of a group of African migrants to Ghana, some of whom are now slated to be returned to their home countries.",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan ordered the U.S. government to explain, by 9 p.m. EST on Saturday, what steps it was taking to prevent the deportees \"from being removed to their countries of origin or other countries where they fear persecution or torture.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the U.S. deported more than a dozen non-Ghanaian nationals to Ghana, including deportees from Gambia and Nigeria, making Ghana the latest country to accept these so-called third country deportations at the request of the Trump administration. Ghana's government confirmed the deportations.",
      "Attorneys have alleged in a lawsuit that the deportees have been held in \"squalid conditions and surrounded by armed military guards in an open-air detention facility\" in Ghana.",
      "Lee Gelernt, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, told Chutkan during a hearing Saturday that four of the deportees have been told that Ghana will return them to their native nations as early as Monday, despite the fact that they have orders from U.S. immigration judges that bar their deportation to their home countries due to concerns they could be persecuted or tortured there. One man from Gambia, who attorneys say is bisexual, has already been returned to Gambia, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The deportees' legal protections \u2014 which are rooted in the United Nations Convention Against Torture and a provision of U.S. immigration law known as withholding of removal \u2014 prohibit the U.S. from sending foreigners to countries where they would face persecution or torture. But unlike asylum, they still allow the U.S. to send them to other, third-party countries.",
      "The Justice Department lawyer representing the U.S. government during the hearing did not dispute that Ghana plans to return the deportees to their native countries and conceded that the Ghanaian government appears to be violating diplomatic assurances that it allegedly made vowing not to send these migrants to places where they could be harmed.",
      "But the Justice Department attorney said the U.S. could not tell Ghana what to do at this point.",
      "Chutkan appeared frustrated by that position, suggesting it was \"disingenuous.\" She grilled the Justice Department attorney about whether the U.S. knew this could happen and suggested the deportations seemed to be an \"end-run\" to bypass the legal protections the deportees have. She suggested the U.S. can retrieve the deportees and return them to the U.S. or transfer them to another country where they would be safe. Or, she added, it could tell Ghana it is violating its agreement with the U.S.",
      "\"How's this not a violation of your obligation?\" she asked the Justice Department attorney.",
      "But Chutkan acknowledged her \"hands may be tied\" since the deportees are not on American soil nor in U.S. custody. She also implied that the Supreme Court would almost certainly pause any order that required the American government to act to stop the returns.",
      "Representatives for the Departments of State and Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests to comment on the deportations to Ghana and Chutkan's order.",
      "Gelernt, the ACLU attorney representing the African deportees, hailed Chutkan's mandate.",
      "\"The Court properly recognized that the United States government, with full knowledge that these individuals are going to be sent to danger, cannot simply wash their hands of the matter,\" Gelernt told CBS News.",
      "As part of its mass deportation campaign, the Trump administration has sought to convince countries around the globe to receive deportees who are not their citizens, brokering agreements with nations including El Salvador, Kosovo, Panama and South Sudan.",

      "The soldiers asked his wife, Suha, about his whereabouts and went through her phone, he said, while his 9-month-old daughter was home. They also briefly detained one of his uncles, he said.",
      "As of Saturday night, Adra said he had no way of returning home to check on his family, because soldiers were blocking the entrance to the village and he was scared of being detained.",
      "Israel's military said that soldiers were in the village after Palestinians had thrown rocks, injuring two Israeli civilians. It said its forces were still in the village, searching the area and questioning people.",
      "Adra has spent his career as a journalist and filmmaker chronicling settler violence in Masafer Yatta, a group of villages in the southern reaches of the West Bank, where he was born. After settlers\u00a0attacked his co-director, Hamdan Ballal, in March, he told the AP that he felt they were being targeted more intensely since winning the Oscar. Adra said he witnessed the detention and said around two dozen settlers \u2014 some masked, some carrying guns, some in Israeli uniform \u2014 attacked the village of Susiya.\u00a0Ballal said the settlers beat him\u00a0in front of his home while filming the assault.",
      "Adra described Saturday's events as \"horrific.\"",

Ballal and Adra made the joint Palestinian-Israeli production with Israeli directors Abraham and Rachel Szor.",
      "The film has won a string of international awards, starting at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2024. It has also drawn ire in Israel and abroad. In March this year, Miami Beach proposed ending the lease of a movie theater that screened the documentary, although it later backed down.",
      "Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem. The Palestinians want all three for their future state and view settlement growth as a major obstacle to a two-state solution.",
      "Israel has built well over 100 settlements, home to more than 500,000 settlers who have Israeli citizenship. The 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority administering population centers.",
      "The Israeli military designated Masafer Yatta in the southern West Bank as a live-fire training zone in the 1980s and ordered residents, mostly Arab Bedouin, to be expelled. Around 1,000 residents have largely remained in place, but soldiers regularly move in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive orchards \u2014 and Palestinians fear outright expulsion could come at any time.",
      "During the war in Gaza, Israel has killed hundreds of Palestinians in the West Bank during wide-scale military operations, and there has also been a rise in settler attacks on Palestinians. There has also been a surge in Palestinian attacks on Israelis.",

It came after a May interview the duke did with the BBC in which he emotionally spoke about his desire to become close with his family again \u2013 something Fitzwilliams called a \"serious error.\"",

      "Fitzwilliams claims, \"Harry made a serious error in giving an emotional half-hour interview to the BBC when he lost his case over automatic police protection.\"",
      "\"I would love a reconciliation with my family,\" Harry said then. \"There\u2019s no point in continuing to fight anymore. Life is precious. I don\u2019t know how much longer my father has.\"",
      "Charles was diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer in February 2024.",
      "Royal expert Ian Pelham Turner said that Harry is currently on a \"well-structured charm offensive\" designed to \"re-identify his credibility, his kindness and warmth and the key values he holds most dear.\"",
      "\"Harry is longing for a popular return to Britain with Meghan and his children,\" Pelham Turner continued, saying that there was a time when Harry and Meghan were considered more popular than Prince William and Kate Middleton. Harry and Meghan can \"reclaim that throne again,\" he theorized, with \"a more relaxed royal protocol and a more secure Meghan.\"",

      "Pelham Turner said, \"The future of the monarchy, in my opinion, is reliant on unification\u2026the royal brand must stay united now, egos have to be put aside, with much less secrets and much more openness required.\"",
      "British broadcaster and photographer Helena Chard told Fox News Digital that while Harry's reputation has been \"in tatters,\" his recent European trip was \"the perfect PR strategy engineered to initiate a reputation reboot.\"",

      "\"Determined to show resilience, mask any chink in his armor and garner glowing PR. Prince Harry meeting with his father was a small part of the strategy,\" she said. \"However, the meeting was significant as it highlights progress of sorts, however superficial. It\u2019s a glimmer of hope that, in time, father and son will privately rebuild a relationship.\"",
      "She added, \"I would love nothing more than King Charles to enjoy his Sussex grandchildren although I sadly feel this will not happen soon. Prince Harry holds the key here.\"",

      "While it seems clear that Charles is interested in the idea of patching things up with Harry, the same can't be said for William.",
      "\"The senior royals don\u2019t do anything by mistake, especially Prince William,\" royal expert Hilary Fordwich said. \"His having maintained a distance from Harry\u2019s reunion with King Charles, while the palace adopted an understated, cautious approach to public messaging, focusing on privacy and dignity rather than commentary or celebration says it all.\"",
      "Fordwich said that any reconciliation Harry has with his family is now dependent on \"what he does and doesn't say or do.\"",
      "\"His actions are on the line, he must prove he truly wants a closer bond by displaying, finally, dignity and dedication to duty, not just to himself. Harry has repeatedly voiced his desire to have his children know the family of his birthright and country, to know their heritage. The entire family is in \u2018wait and see mode.'\"",
      "Several royal experts believe that Harry's recent trip to the U.K. and Ukraine was an attempt to improve his image. (Chris Jackson/Getty Images for Invictus Games Dusseldorf 2023)",
      "Harry has been estranged from his family since he and his wife, Meghan Markle, stepped back as senior royals in 2020 and moved to California. The couple aired their grievances in interviews and documentaries. The royal\u2019s 2023 memoir, \"Spare,\" which exposes embarrassing details about the House of Windsor and his sibling rivalry, worsened tensions.",
      "In July,\u00a0the U.K.\u2019s Daily Mail\u00a0reported that Harry had quietly extended an olive branch by offering to share his official schedule of engagements. The outlet said this was meant to ease tensions with the king.",

I got this diagnosis about diabetes \u2014 my father died of it; his mother died of it; one of my sisters is in peril,\" she explained. \"When they said \u2019diabetes,\u2019 I figured out what to do to slowly, over years, to lose the weight. And then when Ozempic came along, I was able to lose the last 15 to 20 pounds and keep it off.\"",
      "Bates is making history this weekend as the oldest actor to receive a nomination in the lead actress in a drama category at the Emmy Awards. She was nominated for her role as Madeline Matlock in the CBS reboot of \"Matlock.\"",

What are the emotions that are pouring out because I don\u2019t have that armor? It just really surprised me, really shocked me.\"",

      "\"We knew this wasn't just some ordinary show, and I think there was also pressure from the producers,\" he recalled. \"We can't just give them ordinary jokes. We got to give them the best of the best because they were the best of the best.\"",

      "During a panel discussion in June, former \"Golden Girls\" writers, producers and staff members made revelations about the duo's fraught dynamic.",
      "\"When that red light was on [and the show was filming], there were no more professional people than those women, but when the red light was off, those two couldn\u2019t warm up to each other if they were cremated together,\" co-producer Marsha Posner Williams joked, according to The Hollywood Reporter.",
      "Williams claimed that Arthur complained to her about White off camera and often referred to her co-star as a \"c---.\" During a 2022 appearance on \"The Originals\" podcast, Thurm previously claimed that Arthur used the same language when speaking about White in front of him.",
      "\"The Golden Girls\" won three Emmy Awards for outstanding comedy series.\u00a0 (Ron Tom/NBCU Photo Bank)",
      "\"Literally Bea Arthur, who I cast in something else later on, just said, \u2018Oh, she\u2019s a f---ing c---,\u2019 using that word,\" Thurm explained. \"She called her the c-word. I mean, I heard that with my own ears. And, by the way, so did Rue McClanahan. Rue McClanahan said it to me in [the restaurant] Joe Allen\u2019s; Bea Arthur [when she was] on the set of \u2018Beggars and Choosers.\u2019\"",
      "Thurm's publicist clarified to Fox News Digital at the time that McClanahan did not use the c-word to describe White, but instead claimed the actress said that White \"could be a b----\" during an outing at Joe Allen's.",

      "\"And you have to remember, I was there for Season 1, so people were on their best behavior,\" he continued. \"People were also very excited in Season 1 because, back then, nobody thought a show about older women would be a success in that we'd be talking about it 40 years later.\"",
      "\"So, there was just this excitement on set, in the writers room and at the table reads that we would have every Monday. \u2018Oh my God, people are really liking the show,\u2019\" Zimmerman added. \"And then no, they're not just liking it, they're loving it.

Meanwhile, White rose to fame as a comedy legend and sitcom star.",
      "\"It happens on any job,\" Zimmerman said. \"You just have different working ethics. Bea Arthur came from the stage, so she would want to stay in character between takes. Betty White, once they yelled cut, she would be making jokes and going up to the studio audience. And I don't think Bea quite liked that.\"",

      "During a 2011 interview with The Village Voice, White shared her own take on the reason behind Arthur's animosity toward her.",
      "\"Bea had a reserve,\" White said. \"She was not that fond of me.",

      "\"I think one of the lessons we can get from \u2018Golden Girls\u2019 40 years later is that there's so many people in different corners of this world with different viewpoints that we have to now, I think, find where we can connect, where we can find that table where we can all sit and have cheesecake no matter what our political views are or feelings about the world,\" he said.",
      "\"And I feel like that's the next step as we evolve as a country, is to just find those times where we have each other's back like those \u2018Golden Girls\u2019 have.\"",

      "There is also a scarcity of research into how medical issues affect pregnant women, with less than 1% of drug trials enrolling pregnant patients in the past 15 years, according to a public health study.",
      "Is marijuana safe during pregnancy?",

      "GLP-1s help insulin move the glucose (sugar) out of the bloodstream and into the body\u2019s cells, where it can be used for energy or stored, the doctor said. The drugs also help to prevent the inflammation and damage sugar can cause in the blood vessels, nerves and organs.",

      "\"I don't think anyone would argue that if there was a way to manipulate the amount of sugar and inflammation your body's exposed to, that is something we want to lean into. And that's exactly what these drugs do,\" Dubrow added.",

      "\"I have never seen a drug in the history of medicine be on such a rapid path to approval,\" Dubrow said.",
      "The case for microdosing",
      "Along with other experts, Dubrow is an advocate for microdosing, which is where people take low, steady doses of GLP-1s every day, even if they don\u2019t need them for diabetes or obesity.",

      "\"We're figuring it out, and we're teaching the medical profession how to do it. The patients are telling us how to use these drugs.\"",
      "Potential risks",
      "GLP-1 medications have been linked to several potential risks. The most prevalent is gastrointestinal issues, such as nausea and vomiting.",
      "Others have reported an increased risk of pancreatitis, muscle loss and thyroid tumors.",
      "\"I read every study that comes out on these drugs, and I can tell you, it's very clear they don\u2019t cause pancreatitas,\" Dubrow said.",

      "Those who experience severe side effects from GLP-1s should talk to a doctor, Dubrow advised.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "\"If you have a family history of that, that's a contraindication to you using these drugs,\" he said.",

      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "The severity of side effects is linked to the dose amount, Dubrow noted.",
      "\"The low dose, particularly the microdose, really has a low propensity toward the constipation, the nausea, the potential diarrhea, the GERD (reflux),\" he said. \"I think those side effects are less significant for people who microdose.\"",
      "To counteract the risk of muscle loss, Dubrow recommends increasing protein intake and incorporating resistance training as a core component of an exercise routine.",

      "\"Lilly does not have any data on the benefits or risks of microdosing of Zepbound and Mounjaro,\" said a spokesperson for Eli Lilly, maker of the GLP-1 drugs Mounjaro and Zepbounda. \"Both autoinjectors and Zepbound vials are approved for single-use only \u2014 dose-splitting or \u2018microdosing\u2019 is not contemplated by the FDA label.

Patients should work with their healthcare professional to select either 1.7 mg or 2.4 mg for the maintenance dose.\"",
      "CHEAP OZEMPIC KNOCK-OFFS HAVE RISEN IN POPULARITY",
      "\"It is also important to note that the authentic Wegovy\u00a0injectable pen is designed as a single-use pen, the dose is already set, and should not be altered or tampered with, and the pen must be disposed after one use.\"",
      "\"Ozempic\u00a0is a multi-use pen with one pen and multiple needles,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Accessing GLP-1s",
      "Dubrow said he\u2019s not concerned about supply issues amid the growing popularity of GLP-1s, as major drug companies have the resources to \"scale up\" to meet the demand.",

      "\"It's hard to find these drugs online from compounding pharmacies, because essentially they're going rogue \u2014 it's illegal. They're not allow to do it,\" he warned.",
      "\"These drugs are natural hormones that occur in our small intestine, and you get used to the side effects.\"",

      "Looking ahead",
      "There are several next-generation drugs in development that combine multiple hormone pathways, Dubrow said.",

      "\"He performed terribly in the last few days,\" Rufo wrote on social media Friday, adding that he has been talking with conservative leaders who are questioning the FBI's leadership structure, which includes Patel, Deputy Director Dan Bongino, and, as of next week, Andrew Bailey, who is taking on the unprecedented role of FBI co-deputy director.",
      "A White House spokesman said in a statement that \"Patel and his team worked night and day to find this murderer and bring him to justice.\"",
      "\"Anyone who doubts his resolve and dedication - especially when Charlie was such a close friend to him - simply is using this extremely sad moment in a disgusting act of political gamesmanship,\" Communication Director Steven Cheung said, adding the suspect will \"face the full wrath of the justice system.\"",
      "The backlash began after Patel said Wednesday that \"the subject for the horrific shooting today that took the life of Charlie Kirk is now in custody,\" before saying less than two hours later that he had the wrong person. It was the second time that day authorities had arrested someone in the case then let them go.",
      "\"The subject in custody has been released after an interrogation by law enforcement,\" Patel then said, adding the investigation was ongoing.",

      "At the same time that Patel said the killer had been caught, Utah law enforcement officials were giving a news conference saying the gunman was at large, leading social media users to convey confusion over the mixed messages.",
      "The blips during the manhunt for the person responsible for Kirk's killing also put a spotlight on Patel's and Bongino's apparent fixation on social media, a point that a lawsuit against Patel and the Department of Justice laid out in thorough detail days prior.",
      "The lawsuit was brought by three top FBI officials who alleged their constitutional rights were violated when they were fired without explanation. One of the fired officials said Patel and Bongino lamented the \"political capital\" they had to spend to keep the official on the job, a reference to pressure Patel and Bongino were getting on social media about the official. Patel's and Bongino's actions were often dictated by social media comments, the lawsuit said.",
      "Also fueling the fire was a delayed news conference on Thursday that offered little new detail as the investigation was underway. Patel appeared at the news conference but did not speak. Upon announcing the suspect's arrest Friday morning, the FBI director gave remarks of gratitude to the agency, local law enforcement, the media and public for contributing to the arrest. Patel made clear that he had been directing the FBI behind the scenes during the past couple days.",
      "\"Warroom\" podcast host Steve Bannon, a former Trump advisor, said on his show that he didn't \"know why Kash Patel flew out there, thousands of miles\" merely to thank people. Bannon suggested he wanted more details about the suspect and any possible accomplices.",

The source said the focus should be on the success of the FBI\u2019s operation and the \"good police work\" involved.",
      "A spokeswoman for Patel pointed to a statement she posted online highlighting that the FBI's mission to identify Kirk's assassin was a success and that Patel was intentional every step of the way.",

      "\"It's becoming a popularity contest,\" the retired agent told Fox News Digital. \"It's not necessarily something that's new either, because J. Edgar Hoover was big about leveraging the press to make the FBI look good. I mean, he was notorious for that.

      "Apple Watch Series 11 now includes FDA-cleared hypertension notification. (Apple)",
      "Apple Watch hypertension alerts explained",
      "Hypertension is often called the \"silent killer\" because it can strike without symptoms. Left unchecked, it increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, and kidney disease. By adding passive blood pressure monitoring, Apple Watch aims to help millions detect early warning signs.",
      "Using its optical heart sensor, the watch reviews how your blood vessels respond to heartbeats over 30-day periods. If it detects consistent patterns of hypertension, you'll get a notification. Apple expects the feature could alert more than 1 million people with undiagnosed hypertension in its first year alone.",
      "Apple Watch sends users a \"Possible Hypertension\" alert when heart data shows consistent signs of elevated blood pressure. Paired with the iPhone, users can log blood pressure and follow up with doctors. (Apple)",
      "Clinical validation of Apple Watch hypertension feature",
      "Apple built the new hypertension notification feature on a foundation of years of health research. Since the launch of Apple Watch, heart health tools like ECG, AFib History, and irregular rhythm notifications have helped users catch issues early. The hypertension notification now extends that mission by addressing one of the most common and dangerous silent conditions.",
      "The feature works in the background during waking hours, analyzing photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, changes in blood volume under the skin, to detect patterns that suggest chronic high blood pressure. You do not need to calibrate the feature or take direct blood pressure readings with the watch. Instead, the device tracks signals over 30 days and sends a notification if consistent signs of hypertension appear.",
      "CAN YOUR APPLE WATCH DETECT PREGNANCY?",
      "Study results confirm accuracy of hypertension alerts",
      "Apple developed the algorithm using data from more than 100,000 study participants across diverse ages, races, body types, and health statuses. The company then validated its accuracy through a pivotal clinical study with over 2,000 participants, who wore Apple Watch alongside an at-home cuff to compare results.",
      "The validation study showed the feature achieved a specificity rate above 92%, meaning it minimized false positives. Sensitivity rates were especially strong for Stage 2 hypertension, the more severe form of the condition, where the feature identified more than half of users at risk. That accuracy could help prevent strokes, heart attacks, and kidney disease in those who may not otherwise know they have hypertension.",
      "Importantly, the study confirmed that the feature performed consistently across age groups, genders, races, and skin tones, making it reliable for Apple's global user base. Apple also ran usability testing to fine-tune onboarding and notification language, so people understand the alerts and what actions to take next.",
      "By passively monitoring and flagging possible signs of hypertension, Apple Watch helps fill a dangerous gap in diagnosis. Hypertension often goes unnoticed for years, but now, you can be alerted within just one month of wearing the watch.",

The feature also provides a way to archive blood pressures, so if people are measuring at home, they can bring that information to their doctor. This isn\u2019t a one-stop solution, but it has the potential to help consumers take charge of their health and identify hypertension earlier.

      "What if your old bottle of cooking oil could help save the planet and your smartphone? That's the big idea behind a groundbreaking discovery by researchers in Finland.",
      "Scientists from the University of Helsinki and the University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 have found that you can recover silver from electronic waste using common kitchen ingredients like vegetable oil and hydrogen peroxide. This sustainable, scalable method published in the Chemical Engineering Journal could change how we mine precious metals from our growing piles of electronic junk.",

      "Scientists have discovered a new method of silver extraction from electronics by using cooking oil. (Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "How cooking oil recovers silver from electronic waste",
      "Here's how it works. Fatty acids found in oils like sunflower or olive oil are mixed with hydrogen peroxide. When heated slightly, this combo safely dissolves silver from old circuit boards, wires or keyboard connectors. Then, using ethyl acetate, a far less toxic alternative to industrial solvents, researchers pull out the silver in a solid form. Unlike traditional methods that rely on harsh acids or cyanide-based solutions, this technique avoids toxic runoff and air pollution. Think of it as salad dressing meets science lab, without the environmental mess.",
      "Why recycling silver from e-waste is urgently needed",
      "Silver powers the devices you use every day, such as phones, solar panels, electric vehicles and even medical tech. But less than 20% of it gets recycled. As demand rises and natural resources shrink, finding clean ways to reclaim silver isn't just smart, it's necessary. Silver prices have surged sixfold in the last 25 years. At the same time, supply has lagged. That makes e-waste a goldmine, literally, for anyone who can unlock its hidden metals without poisoning the environment.",

      "Fatty acids found in cooking oil can stabilize silver ions for easier extraction. (Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images)",
      "How scientists extract silver using fatty acids and light",
      "To figure out exactly how this all works, researchers used advanced computer models to study how fatty acids interact with silver ions. The process not only stabilizes the silver but also allows for easy recovery using light and simple solvents. Better still, the ingredients can be reused, and there's no chemical waste or massive cost. And it's highly selective. The method targets silver while leaving other metals behind, a major step forward in urban mining. In testing, even silver-coated keyboard connectors were cleanly processed into pure elemental silver powder using this system.",
      "Indian laborers sift through a heap of pre-owned mobile phones in an electronic waste workshop Dec. 5, 2023, in New Delhi, India.\u00a0 (Yawar Nazir/Getty Images)",
      "What this means for you",
      "This research brings us closer to safe, at-home or small-scale recycling kits that could recover silver from old gadgets. Recyclers and manufacturers could adopt this method to reduce chemical waste and operating costs, while protecting workers and the environment. This method supports a future where nothing goes to waste. It keeps valuable materials in use, cutting down the need for mining and pollution. Silver is vital for making many of the tech items we use every day. Reusing it responsibly means cleaner energy at a lower cost and less reliance on mined resources.",

      "We've long known that waste is a problem. Now, it might also be the solution.

Review your digital footprint, lock down privacy settings, and reduce what's available on public databases and broker sites.",

AI tools now help criminals generate highly realistic phishing attempts designed to trick you into handing over logins. By enabling\u00a02FA, you add an extra layer of protection that they cannot easily bypass. Choose app-based codes or a physical key whenever possible, as these are more secure than text messages, which are easier for attackers to intercept.",
      "AI-driven attacks often exploit the most basic weaknesses, such as outdated software. Once a hacker knows which companies or individuals are running old systems, they can use automated scripts to break in within minutes. Regular updates close those gaps before they can be targeted. Setting your devices and apps to update automatically removes one of the easiest entry points that criminals rely on.",
      "One of the most alarming details in the Anthropic report was how the hacker used AI to craft convincing extortion notes. The same tactics are being applied to phishing emails and texts sent to everyday users. If you receive a message demanding immediate action, such as clicking a link, transferring money or downloading a file, treat it with suspicion. Stop, check the source and verify before you act.",
      "The hacker in this case built custom malware with the help of AI. That means malicious software is getting smarter, faster and harder to detect. Strong antivirus software that constantly scans for suspicious activity provides a critical safety net. It can identify phishing emails and detect ransomware before it spreads, which is vital now that AI tools make these attacks more adaptive and persistent.",

      "Copy-pasting commands into Terminal may seem like an easy fix, but it's also one of the easiest ways for attackers to bypass Apple's built-in protections. If you see a command on a website, forum, or GitHub repository, don't execute it unless you fully understand what it does. Instead, confirm with Apple's official support site or the Apple Community forums, where experienced users and moderators can verify safe troubleshooting steps.",

That's why they buy sponsored ads like the one below to push fake troubleshooting websites higher in search results. Clicking the top link may feel natural, but it could be a trap.

If the account looks suspicious, inactive, or brand-new, avoid it.",

The company's CEO, Tim Cook, led the presentation with sweeping visuals, confident pacing and a clear message: Apple is still betting big on premium innovation. But the real headline wasn't so much the tech; it was the prices.",
      "Earlier this year, President Donald Trump granted Apple a tariff break. Still, the company raised prices across its iPhone lineup. The new ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air, which Apple positioned as a reinvention of last year's iPhone 16 Plus, jumps to $999. The iPhone 17 Pro begins at $1,099, while the Pro Max tops out at $1,199. The entry-level iPhone 17 starts at $799.",
      "Apple positioned the price hikes as a reflection of breakthrough innovation. The company spotlighted the iPhone Air's sleek redesign, the powerful A19 chip and major camera upgrades. Yet the takeaway was clear: tariff relief didn't lead to consumer savings. Instead, Apple leaned into its premium identity, signaling that cutting-edge tech now comes with a steeper price tag.",

      "Apple unveiled the iPhone 17 Air, its slimmest model yet at 5.6mm and 165 grams, built with recycled aluminum, glass and titanium. (Apple)",
      "Apple calls the iPhone 17 Air a game-changer. At just 5.6mm thin and weighing around 165 grams, it stands as the slimmest iPhone the company has ever made. The design uses recycled aluminum, glass and titanium to reduce weight while staying durable. Engineers reinforced the frame and applied new drop-test algorithms to make sure it holds up in daily use.",
      "The Air debuts silicon anode battery technology, which allows Apple to shrink the device without cutting power. During the presentation, Apple promised \"all-day battery life,\" but never gave an exact hour count. That vague description raised questions. Moments later, Apple introduced a new low-profile MagSafe battery accessory. When paired with the iPhone 17 Air, Apple says the combo delivers up to 40 hours of video playback. The timing of that announcement made it clear that battery life could still be a concern.",
      "Apple also pushed the Air forward with a new ultra-wide 48MP fusion camera system, which uses advanced image processing to improve detail and low-light performance. The display gained a ProMotion 120Hz refresh rate that makes scrolling and animations feel smoother. Outdoor use should also improve, thanks to 3,000 nits of peak brightness, making it easier to see in direct sunlight. On the durability side, the Air features Ceramic Shield 2 coating, which Apple claims resists scratches and accidental drops better than before.",

      "The iPhone 17 Pro introduces a striking unibody design that relies on laser-welded vapor chamber cooling to keep performance steady even under heavy use. Apple gave the back a ceramic shield finish, while the front now features its upgraded seven-layer coating. That change reduces glare both indoors and outdoors, making the display easier on the eyes in all conditions.",
      "At the core of the Pro sits the new A19 Bionic chip built on 3nm architecture. Apple paired it with a 16-core Neural Engine and an updated display engine to push speed and efficiency even further. The company claims this is the most power-efficient iPhone yet and promises the longest battery life ever offered in a Pro model.",
      "Apple also turned its attention to the camera system. The Pro camera lineup includes a 48MP main sensor and a 12MP ultra-wide, with ProRes support for high-quality video recording. It even offers Genlock syncing, which professionals can use to line up multiple cameras in studio and live production setups.",
      "To complement the new design, Apple introduced TechWoven cases that feel more like premium accessories than traditional covers. Some versions include optional cross-body straps, a nod to the growing trend of blending technology with fashion.",

      "Apple positioned the iPhone 17 Pro Max as the ultimate model in the lineup. It shares the same unibody design, ceramic shield finish and seven-layer front coating as the Pro, but it stretches everything to a larger scale. The Pro Max delivers the biggest display Apple has ever put on an iPhone, paired with enhanced brightness that makes it more usable outdoors and in direct sunlight.",
      "Inside, it runs on the same A19 Bionic chip with the 16-core Neural Engine, so performance and efficiency mirror the Pro. What sets the Max apart is its endurance. Apple claims it offers the best battery life of any iPhone to date, making it the go-to choice for people who rely heavily on their phone throughout the day.",
      "The Pro Max also carries the full Pro camera system, including the 48MP main sensor and advanced video features like ProRes and Genlock. With its extra size, it appeals most to creators, gamers and anyone who wants the biggest screen possible in an iPhone.",

      "The iPhone 17 inherits many of the Pro's features. It comes in five colors and has a thinner profile that feels more refined in hand. The display includes the upgraded coating to cut glare, and the front camera has a square AI-driven sensor with Center Stage for better video calls.",
      "The main camera system also makes a leap forward. The iPhone 17 now carries a 48MP main sensor, supported by Apple's fusion technology to improve clarity and low-light results.

      "The new AirPods Pro 3 deliver up to eight hours of listening time on a single charge. (Apple)",
      "Apple unveiled the third-generation AirPods Pro, priced at $249, and available starting Sept. 19. The design keeps the iconic stem but introduces foam-infused ear tips that come in five sizes. Apple said it studied 100,000 ear shapes to make them fit more securely.",
      "The new AirPods Pro 3 extend listening time, offering up to eight hours on a single charge, compared with six hours in the previous generation. With the charging case, total listening time stretches to 10 hours with hearing-AI features enabled.",
      "One of the standout additions is heart rate sensing, which turns the AirPods into another health-tracking accessory in Apple's ecosystem. The earbuds also use AI-driven hearing enhancements to improve clarity in noisy environments. Apple said the AirPods Pro 3 now deliver up to four times stronger active noise cancellation (ANC) than the originals, making them far more effective in crowded or loud spaces.",
      "For workouts, users can also track over 50 activity types with the Fitness app on iPhone while wearing them. Perhaps most notably, Apple added live translation.

      "The Apple Watch Series 11 continues Apple's push into health technology. It runs on watchOS 26 and introduces monitoring for possible hypertension and sleep apnea, with alerts designed to prompt users to seek medical care. Apple noted that FDA clearance is still pending for hypertension notifications, but the company clearly sees the watch as a serious medical tool.",
      "The watch also includes Sleep Score, which breaks down sleep stages such as core, deep and awake to give users a clearer picture of rest quality. Battery life reaches up to 24 hours, and the watch remains efficient even with 5G connectivity.",
      "Apple built the Series 11 with 100% recycled aluminum and titanium cases, expanding its sustainability pledge. Color options bring a refreshed look, while pricing\u00a0starts around $399, depending on configuration.",

      "It also delivers sleep apnea notifications, a feature previously limited to more expensive models. Charging is now up to two times faster, ensuring the watch is ready to go with less downtime. Apple added more health and convenience tools, including wrist temperature sensing for deeper insights in the Vitals app, retrospective ovulation estimates and an Always-On display. It also supports double-tap and wrist flick gestures, plus on-device Siri. Available in two colors, the SE 3 carries forward Apple's strategy of making core health features more accessible.",
      "Apple Watch Ultra 3 debuts with the largest and brightest display ever on a Watch. (Apple)",
      "At the top end, Apple introduced the Apple Watch Ultra 3, starting at $799 and shipping September 19. This model pushes the limits of durability and outdoor performance. The Ultra 3 features the largest and brightest display ever put on an Apple Watch, making it easier to read data during workouts or in direct sunlight.",
      "It includes a redesigned radio and antenna system capable of connecting with satellites orbiting 800 miles above Earth. That means users can send messages or use Find My features even without cell service, making it a true companion for extreme adventures.",
      "The Ultra 3 packs a larger battery that runs up to 42 hours on a single charge. With Low Power Mode enabled, Apple says the battery can extend to as much as 72 hours, making it the longest-lasting Apple Watch to date. It also introduces new Workout Buddy tools for training and enhanced hypertension notifications, further pushing Apple's reputation in health tech. Available in black or natural titanium, the Ultra 3 blends rugged design with cutting-edge features.",
      "iPhone 17 accessories: small add-ons with big impact",
      "Apple showcased new accessories for its iPhones, including a low-profile MagSafe battery pack. (Apple)",

The most talked about was the\u00a0low-profile MagSafe battery pack, created to address the iPhone 17 Air's biggest weakness: vague \"all-day\" battery claims. When attached, the Air can stretch to 40 hours of video playback, turning what could have been a limitation into a selling point for Apple's ecosystem.",
      "To complement the Air's slim profile, Apple also revealed a\u00a0new translucent case and a\u00a0lightweight bumper. The translucent case keeps the 5.6mm design visible while still protecting it, while the bumper adds shock resistance around the edges without adding bulk. Both aim to reassure buyers who worry that the thinnest iPhone yet might be more fragile.",
      "For the Pro and Pro Max models, Apple introduced\u00a0TechWoven cases made from a durable fabric blend. What stood out was the addition of an\u00a0optional cross-body strap, giving users a hands-free way to carry their phones. Apple leaned into the idea of the iPhone as not just a device but also a lifestyle accessory that blends technology with personal style.",
      "Together, the MagSafe battery, translucent Air case, protective bumper and fashion-forward TechWoven cases with cross-body straps showed Apple's strategy clearly. Accessories are no longer secondary; they are central to how Apple expects customers to protect, power and personalize their iPhones.",

      "That's what makes the Tapping project stand out. Contec printed the structural walls for both stories in just 18 hours of active printing time, something not yet widely seen in the U.S. This could signal the next step for American 3D printing: scaling beyond single-story housing into more complex multi-story designs.",

      "One of the biggest questions people have is price. Contec hasn't shared the exact cost of the Tapping home, but the company says it delivered the structural walls 22% cheaper than a standard masonry build. That saving adds up when you consider how much of a home's budget goes toward labor and materials.",
      "In the U.S., companies like Icon have priced 3D printed homes starting around $100,000 to $150,000, depending on size and finishes. While final costs vary by region, land and design, the potential savings from reduced labor and faster timelines make 3D printing an attractive option as housing costs continue to rise.",

That kind of speed changes the way we think about construction. With rising costs and ongoing labor shortages, builders need new solutions. 3D concrete printing offers a path to faster, more affordable and more sustainable homes without cutting corners on strength or safety.",

      "The scheme is a twist on what is known as a brushing scam. Traditionally, brushing scams involved online sellers sending products to strangers and then using the recipient's details to post fake reviews. It was more of a nuisance than a serious crime.",
      "An Amazon package with a QR code. (Lindsey Nicholson/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)",
      "Now the practice has shifted from harmless free items to deliberate fraud. Instead of receiving a product, many victims find only a printed QR code. Once scanned, the code redirects them to fraudulent websites that ask for sensitive personal information, such as banking information, credit card numbers or login credentials. Some codes go a step further and install malicious software designed to track activity and steal data directly from the device.",

      "QR codes have become common in everyday life. They are used in restaurants, stores, airports, on polls and payment systems and most people scan them without a second thought. Unlike suspicious links that can be spotted, a QR code reveals nothing until it is scanned.",
      "That makes it a perfect disguise for a scam. The setup is simple: a package arrives with no sender information and no explanation. The mystery sparks curiosity, and many people scan the code to figure out who sent it. That moment of curiosity is what the scammers rely on.",

      "The less personal data available about you online, the harder it is for scammers to target you with convincing fraud attempts. Consider using data removal services that scrub your information from people-search sites and marketing databases. This reduces the chances that your address or phone number ends up in the wrong hands and is connected to a scam package.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",

      "Software updates often contain fixes for security vulnerabilities that scammers try to exploit. Running the latest version of your phone's operating system, as well as updating apps regularly, gives you stronger protection against malware that can be delivered through a malicious QR code.",
      "If an unexpected package arrives at your door with a QR code inside, do not simply throw it away. Report it to local authorities and consider filing a complaint with the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center.

      "This scam might not be everywhere yet, but it shows just how quickly criminals adapt to new technology. QR codes were meant to make life easier, and most of the time they do, but that same convenience can turn into a weakness when people let curiosity override caution. The lesson here is that a mystery package with a QR code is not some fun puzzle to figure out. It is a red flag. The safest move is to step back, resist the urge to scan and if something feels off, report it instead of interacting with it.",

      "\"The army needs them, Israel needs them and it\u2019s manageable \u2014 we can do it. What makes it difficult is the lack of an oversight mechanism that the Haredim would agree to,\" Edelstein said.",
      "In July,\u00a0Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party removed Edelstein as chair of the influential Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee after he publicly accused Haredi lawmakers of refusing to engage in compromise on legislation the body was ready to advance.",
      "The shake-up came a week after the ultra-Orthodox parties United Torah Judaism and Shas withdrew from the coalition in protest over the failure to pass legislation exempting Haredi men from military service. However, they stopped short of joining opposition no-confidence motions that could topple the government.",

Several spoke on the condition of anonymity, some because they were not authorized to speak publicly and others citing fear of retaliation from the Trump administration.",
      "Those actions ranged from where Patel was on the evening of the assassination to what a former official described as his \u201cgrandstanding\u201d about his own role after the arrest.",

      "A senior White House official said in a separate statement Sunday that President Donald Trump has confidence in Patel and his handling of the investigation. \u201cThe president spoke on it this morning and said he thinks everyone has done an amazing job,\" the official said.",
      "Dinner at Rao's",
      "Hours after the shooting at Utah Valley University, Patel dined at the exclusive New York restaurant Rao\u2019s, two sources familiar with his whereabouts said. A reservation at Rao\u2019s, on the Upper East Side, is famously difficult to obtain.",
      "Patel posted on X at 6:21 p.m. that \u201cthe subject\u201d in Kirk\u2019s killing was \u201cin custody.\u201d Roughly 90 minutes later, at 7:59 p.m., he posted a follow-up message saying the \u201csubject in custody has been released after an interrogation by law enforcement.\u201d",
      "It is not clear whether Patel was at Rao's, which opens at 7 p.m., when he published the second post. The restaurant did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Four former senior FBI officials told NBC News that the posts were premature and unnecessary. O\u2019Leary said they undermined public confidence in the bureau.",
      "\u201cThey gave the public the perception that the FBI is not that organized at a time when the public is concerned because there\u2019s an unfolding crisis,\u201d said O\u2019Leary, an MSNBC national security contributor. \u201cThey need to be reassured that the FBI and its partners have the situation under control, and that is done through accurate strategic messaging.\u201d",
      "Asked whether Patel had dined at Rao\u2019s and for a response to the criticism, a spokesperson for the bureau said in a statement: \u201cThe FBI worked with our law enforcement partners in Utah to bring to justice the individual allegedly responsible for the horrific murder of Charlie Kirk, and we will continue to be transparent with the American people with real-time updates as we are able.\u201d",
      "Two former senior FBI officials said it was premature for Patel to post on X that \u201cthe subject\u201d was in custody.",
      "\u201cHe should not have posted anything about the case until there was certainty,\u201d the first former senior FBI official said. \u201cPeople need to trust what the director says. He needs to be measured and always right. It wasn\u2019t a good look.\u201d",

      "A heated call",
      "With the suspect still at large the morning after Kirk\u2019s killing, Patel and his deputy, Dan Bongino, held a tense conference call with agents nationwide, according to two law enforcement officials and a Trump administration official.",
      "Patel and Bongino said on the profanity-laced call Thursday morning that they were under intense pressure to arrest the killer, according to The New York Times, which cited three people familiar with the exchange. Patel also called out agents in Salt Lake City for not having shared photos of the suspect with him sooner.",
      "That afternoon, Patel chose to travel from New York to Utah after he attended 9/11 anniversary ceremonies. Two administration officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Patel was told not to appear at news conferences in Utah or make other public comments until there was an arrest.",
      "On Thursday evening, Patel appeared at a news conference in Utah with state and local officials but did not speak. One of the administration officials said Patel \u201cmade the right decision\u201d by remaining silent.",
      "A third former senior FBI official criticized Patel\u2019s decision to travel to Utah before an arrest. He said Patel\u2019s arrival could have distracted agents or pulled them away from the investigation.",
      "\u201cNo serious director would show up at this stage,\u201d the former senior FBI official said. \u201cThey can\u2019t help. They can only distract. Every agent needed to support the visit is an agent not available to work the case.\u201d",
      "On Saturday, the day after Tyler Robinson, 22, was arrested in connection with the killing, Patel said on X that the FBI had solved the case by overruling other law enforcement agencies.",
      "\u201cAgainst all law enforcement recommendations, we demanded the video footage and enhanced stills of the suspect be released to the public,\u201d Patel wrote. \u201cRobinson\u2019s father, who ultimately turned him in to authorities, told law enforcement that he recognized his son in that released video.\u201d",
      "The Utah Department of Public Safety, the state\u2019s main law enforcement agency, issued a statement contradicting Patel\u2019s claim and emphasizing the importance of a \u201cunified investigation.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the agency said it first tried to identify the suspect using facial recognition technology to give officers an element of surprise and to prevent people who looked like the suspect from being unfairly scrutinized.",
      "\u201cWe did not recommend they not be released, however we first used technology [facial recognition] to try to identify,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWhen that was unsuccessful we were fully supportive and in agreement we should release the photos.\u201d",
      "A former senior official in a large police department who repeatedly worked with the FBI questioned Patel\u2019s criticism of local officials.",
      "He said that the FBI traditionally brings sweeping resources to investigations but that it generally has local officials \u2014 who are sometimes more trusted by the public than federal officials \u2014 be the faces of the investigations.",
      "\u201cThese things should be left to the actual on-the-ground investigators,\u201d said the former senior law enforcement official, who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation.",
      "The former official added that he believed Patel\u2019s need to please Trump to keep his job may have caused him to criticize Utah officials.",
      "He said that \u201cit never benefits the FBI to criticize the locals\u201d and added that Patel appeared to be \u201cgrandstanding to impress an audience of one.\u201d",
      "Past firings",
      "O\u2019Leary, now a senior vice president at the Soufan Group, a security consulting firm, noted Patel\u2019s management of the bureau has also been marked by firings of supervisors and agents who investigated Trump or Jan. 6 rioters.",
      "He cited as an example the ouster last month of Brian Driscoll, a senior FBI official who was its acting director before Patel took office. Driscoll, who tried to protect agents who worked on Jan. 6 investigations, and two other former senior FBI officials sued Patel last week and requested their jobs back.",
      "O\u2019Leary also cited the demotion and subsequent retirement of Mehtab Syed, the head of the bureau\u2019s Salt Lake City office. He said it was not clear why Syed, who had worked multiple high-level terrorism cases and been a senior counterintelligence official, was forced out.",
      "\u201cThe corrosive nature of their policies is starting to have an impact,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cAnd it is leading to generational destruction to an institution that is essential to the protection of our nation, both from external and internal actors.\u201d"

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-federal-vaccine-court-threaten-production-us-rcna230377",
    "published": "Mon, 15 Sep 2025 09:00:41 GMT",
    "summary": "The Vaccine Injury Compensation Program created a special court for vaccine-related injuries. Kennedy has called it \u201cbroken\u201d and vows to \u201cfix it.\u201d",
    "story": [
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist, has promised not to \u201ctake away anybody\u2019s vaccines.\u201d",
      "Beyond restricting who is eligible for certain shots \u2014 as he\u2019s already done for this year\u2019s Covid vaccines \u2014 experts say Kennedy can take steps that could drive drug companies to stop making vaccines entirely.",
      "In the 1980s, lawsuits fueled by the nascent anti-vaccine movement led more than a dozen manufacturers to stop producing vaccines, creating shortages, according to Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia.",
      "Domestic vaccine production survived only because Congress stepped in to create a no-fault alternative to the traditional legal system, the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, or VICP, which protected vaccine makers from liability and created a special vaccine court to award financial damages to people harmed by vaccines, said Dr. Walter Orenstein, an infectious disease expert and emeritus professor of medicine at the Emory University School of Medicine.",
      "The program\u2019s legal protections for plaintiffs and drugmakers have helped ensure the United States has a reliable supply of vaccines ever since, Orenstein said.",
      "As health secretary, Kennedy has that program in his sights.",
      "Kennedy \u2014 who has long cast vaccine manufacturers as the enemy and has been involved in litigation against them \u2014 has amped up his attacks on the VICP, criticizing the program on social media and TV.",
      "In a July post on X, Kennedy disparaged the VICP as corrupt and \u201cbroken\u201d and vowed to \u201cfix it.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe VICP routinely dismisses meritorious cases outright or drags them out for years,\u201d Kennedy wrote. \u201cInstead of \u2018quickly and fairly\u2019 awarding compensation, Special Masters dismiss over half of the cases.\u201d",
      "When asked for comment on Kennedy and VICP, Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, referred NBC News to the secretary\u2019s X post.",
      "Vaccines are overwhelmingly safe and have saved 154 million lives over the past five decades, according to the World Health Organization. But about 1 in 1 million vaccinations causes a serious injury, such as a life-threatening allergic reaction or Guillain-Barre syndrome, which can cause monthslong paralysis, Offit said.",
      "The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of America, an industry group, said that the VICP doesn\u2019t shield drug companies from all liability. People whose claims are denied by the VICP can still sue in a traditional court, said Andrew Powaleny, a PhRMA spokesperson.",
      "The program, which is funded through a 75-cent surcharge on vaccines, has helped thousands of people, Powaleny said, awarding $5.4 billion to plaintiffs since its founding.",
      "Offit said that eliminating or undermining the VICP could lead history to repeat itself.",
      "\u201cIf you want to destroy vaccines in this country, if your goal is to eliminate vaccine manufacturing in this country, the best way to do that is through attacking the VICP,\u201d Offit said.",
      "\u2018Opening the floodgates\u2019",
      "The VICP is not without its limitations, said Dorit Reiss, a professor and vaccine policy expert at the University of California, San Francisco School of Law.",
      "The program desperately needs more resources to address the backlog of cases, Reiss said. The program also allows families only three years to make a claim, even though some potentially serious injuries might not become apparent for four or five years.",
      "Although members of Congress have tried to pass legislation several times to give the VICP more resources \u2014 including the ability to hire more special masters, who act as judges \u2014 the efforts have never succeeded.",
      "Because Congress created the VICP, only Congress has the authority to update or eliminate it, Reiss said.",
      "Yet the health secretary wields significant power over the program. And he has big plans.",
      "In an interview with Tucker Carlson in June, Kennedy said, \u201cWe just brought a guy in this week who\u2019s going to be revolutionizing the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.\u201d",
      "Although Kennedy didn\u2019t name the employee, he has brought Andrew Downing, an attorney with experience suing vaccine manufacturers, onto his staff, a development that was first reported in June by NOTUS, a digital news site. Downing is listed in HHS\u2019 employee directory as a counselor in the Office of the Secretary. Both Downing and Kennedy, who is also a lawyer, have been involved with lawsuits against Merck over its HPV vaccine, Gardasil.",
      "Kennedy could threaten vaccine production by making two types of changes to the VICP, experts say: by adding new conditions to the VICP\u2019s list of injuries, or by withdrawing recommendations for certain vaccines.",
      "The VICP compensates people who have been injured by any of the 16 routinely recommended pediatric vaccines, as long as the balance of medical evidence shows that their health problem is related to vaccines, Reiss said. So while VICP compensates people for severe allergic reactions, the program does not compensate people whose children develop autism, because research has found no link between autism and vaccines.",
      "Offit fears that Kennedy wants to add autism and other conditions to the VICP program.",
      "Kennedy has commissioned a report on the causes of autism and has said it would be released in September. Dr. Marty Makary, head of the Food and Drug Administration, told Bloomberg TV on Sept. 8 that the report would come out \u201cwithin a month.\u201d",
      "An anti-vaccine activist, David Geier, was picked by Kennedy to write the report, so it\u2019s likely that the paper will echo Kennedy\u2019s claims linking vaccines to autism, Offit said.",
      "Adding autism to VICP would \u201copen the floodgates to claims previously dismissed, overwhelming the system and inflating program costs,\u201d said Y. Tony Yang, a professor at George Washington University\u2019s Milken Institute School of Public Health. Vaccine \u201cmanufacturers would read that as legal and reputational risk, which historically leads to exits or constrained supply.\u201d",
      "Changing vaccine recommendations",
      "In order for vaccines to be included in the VICP, they must be recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Reiss said. If a vaccine is removed from the agency\u2019s recommendations, people who believe they have been injured by that vaccine could no longer bring claims to the vaccine court and instead would have to go through the legal system, she said.",
      "An onslaught of lawsuits in traditional courts could prompt drug companies to conclude that making vaccines costs them too much money, leading them to leave the market, experts say.",
      "Orenstein said that pushing the lawsuits into the traditional legal system could also hurt plaintiffs.",
      "The VICP protects children with legitimate vaccine injuries, he said, noting serious injuries are extremely rare. Orenstein said the nation owes a debt to families who vaccinate their children, whose immunity helps to protect medically fragile people who can\u2019t be vaccinated or who don\u2019t respond to vaccines.",
      "David J. Carney, an attorney at Green & Schafle in Philadelphia and president of the Vaccine Injured Petitioners Bar Association, said that without the VICP, families of children with rare vaccine-related injuries would need to find to a lawyer to take their case and would have a much harder time winning compensation through the regular court system than through the VICP.",
      "It \u201cwould force families into traditional civil litigation \u2014 a far more expensive and uncertain process,\u201d Carney said.",
      "Several long-used vaccines are slated to come up for review at an upcoming meeting of the CDC\u2019s independent vaccine panel, which advises the agency on which vaccines to recommend. In June, Kennedy fired all 17 members of the panel and replaced them with seven new, handpicked members. Several of the members Kennedy appointed have a history of anti-vaccine statements or publications.",
      "On the docket for discussion and possible votes are the hepatitis B vaccine, given to newborns, and the use of the combined measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (chickenpox) vaccine in kids under 5."

      "Shares of Nvidia were down around 2% in premarket trading.",
      "Late last year, China\u2019s State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) opened an investigation into Nvidia in relation to the acquisition of Mellanox and some agreements made during the acquisition. Nvidia acquired the Israeli technology company that creates network solutions for data centers and servers in 2020, in a deal that was approved by China at the time with certain conditions.",
      "In a preliminary investigation, the SAMR said Nvidia had violated China\u2019s anti-monopoly laws in relation to that acquisition and its conditions. China\u2019s market regulator did not specify how Nvidia allegedly breached the country\u2019s laws.",
      "CNBC has reached out to Nvidia for comment.",
      "The update from the SAMR has the potential to complicate trade talks between Chinese and U.S. officials that began on Sunday in Madrid, Spain.",
      "Tensions between Beijing and Washington appear to be on the rise on the technology front. China opened two separate probes into semiconductors on Saturday: one is an anti-dumping investigation into certain chips imported from the U.S., while the other is an anti-discrimination scrutiny of U.S. restrictions on China\u2019s chip industry.",
      "Nvidia has had a tumultuous relationship with the Chinese market in recent months, as the company has been caught up in geopolitical volatility. Earlier this year, Nvidia\u2019s H20 product, a chip that had been specially designed to comply with U.S. export restrictions, was blocked from being sent to China.",
      "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has publicly called for American firms to be allowed to sell to China, saying the local artificial intelligence market will likely reach about $50 billion in the next two to three years. Huang said that, if American companies aren\u2019t present in China, domestic players like Huawei will fill the void.",
      "That lobbying appeared to work. Last month, Nvidia cut a deal with Washington that would allow the tech giant to resume chip sales to China in exchange for giving up 15% of that revenue to the U.S. government.",
      "Huang and the U.S. government have been discussing the possibility of exporting a more advanced chip to China."

      "Then, while he was closing out an overtime loss, Wilson added even more fuel to the criticism.",
      "As part of a wild fourth quarter in which the Giants and the Cowboys combined for 41 points, Wilson, 36, looked like he would play the role of hero just one week after his ineffectual 168-yard performance in a loss sparked discussions about how long it might take for New York to supplant Wilson on the depth chart and let rookie first-round pick Jaxson Dart develop.",
      "Dart did briefly play Sunday in Dallas as part of a specialized package. The big surprise was how strongly Wilson was justifying New York\u2019s decision to stick with him after his head coach, Brian Daboll, had initially been noncommittal about keeping him as the starter.",
      "On his way to 450 passing yards against Dallas, just two shy of his career high, Wilson threw his day\u2019s second touchdown pass, a 32-yarder, to take a 30-27 lead with 2:44 left in the fourth quarter.",
      "When Dallas answered nearly two minutes later to go ahead, 34-30, the Giants got the ball back with just 52 seconds left to either score a touchdown or lose. Wilson\u2019s abilities have fluctuated with age, and he is no longer the dynamic runner who helped Seattle once win a Super Bowl. But he can still throw a deep ball, as he showed again on what looked to be the game-winning strike with just 25 seconds left, a 48-yard bomb he lofted over two closing defenders into the hands of Malik Nabers. It was the sixth lead change of the fourth quarter alone.",
      "Yet the game wasn\u2019t over, headed to overtime instead after Dallas moved into position for its star kicker, Brandon Aubrey, to make a 64-yard field goal to tie as time expired in regulation.",
      "In overtime, Wilson completed his first two passes. Then began a stretch of plays that figure to reignite the Dart discussion.",
      "Wilson was sacked and fumbled out of bounds when the ball came loose as he was throwing for a 6-yard loss on second-and-3. He then threw an incompletion to force a New York punt.",
      "When the Giants got the ball back again, all they needed was to gain about 30 yards to get into field goal range. But Wilson\u2019s first pass lost 4 yards, and his second was a high-arcing pass thrown deep to where he thought Nabers would be, even though Nabers was running a route in a different direction. The pass was intercepted, and Dallas won four plays later on a field goal, 40-37.",
      "It was the Giants' ninth consecutive loss to their NFC East division rival.",
      "\u201cI thought he played well, made some plays, attacked certain things we wanted to attack. That second-and-3, it kind of slipped out of his hand and it pushed us back there,\u201d Daboll told reporters when he was asked how he reacted to Wilson\u2019s big fourth quarter and his struggles in overtime.",
      "Of the interception, Daboll was circumspect, calling \u201cthat deep shot kind of at the end, the communication, not a bad communication, just communication. ... Again, this one\u2019s tough.\u201d",
      "For New York, which started the season 0-2 for the seventh time in the last nine years, the answer isn\u2019t as easy as inserting Dart. Wilson had high-profile miscues and a role in New York\u2019s scoring on just one of its five trips inside the Dallas 20-yard line. The rest of his team was called for 14 penalties for 160 yards, as well. And the Giants have been in no hurry to shift quarterbacks, ESPN reported, because it\u2019s one thing to start a rookie quarterback but another thing to protect him, and star offensive lineman Andrew Thomas remains sidelined by injury.",
      "With a new team, Wilson now faces a familiar criticism. Speculation about whether he is the right quarterback for the job has followed ever since Seattle traded him to Denver in 2022. Pronounced as the player the Broncos would build around, Wilson lasted only 30 games before Denver was so motivated to bench, and later release, him that it ate $85 million in his salary. Wilson moved on to Pittsburgh, where his ability to still throw a pristine deep ball helped the Steelers win five of his first six starts. But when they then lost their final four games of the season, Wilson was back on the look for a new employer who would believe in him.",
      "One of the outstanding questions of Week 2 is how much longer that belief in Wilson remains in New York."

      "Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow was helped off the field with a left toe injury during the first half of the Bengals\u2019 game against the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday. The team later announced he was ruled out of the matchup.",
      "In the middle of the second quarter, Burrow was attempting to pass when he was sacked by Jaguars defensive end Arik Armstead. After initially trying to stand up, Burrow stayed on the field and waited for medical attention.",
      "Trainers appeared to be examining his left ankle before he was taken off the field.",
      "Once off the field, Burrow was observed limping in the tunnel of the stadium with no shoe on his left foot.",
      "Burrow, 28, was the first overall pick in the 2020 NFL draft. He has struggled with injuries in his career, missing the final six games of his rookie season after tearing his ACL. He also missed seven games in 2023 because of a torn ligament in his wrist.",
      "Cincinnati has struggled to protect Burrow for much of his time in the league. He was sacked 48 times last season, and the Bengals ranked last in the league in ESPN\u2019s pass block win rate metric.",
      "Despite the team\u2019s protection struggles, Burrow threw for 4,918 yards and 43 touchdowns in 2024, leading the NFL in both categories. In the 2021 season, Burrow led Cincinnati to the Super Bowl \u2014 making him the only quarterback other than Patrick Mahomes to represent the AFC in the Super Bowl since 2019.",
      "Cincinnati entered Week 2 with a 1-0 record after a win over the Cleveland Browns in Week 1."

    "story": [
      "For Nate Bargatze, the Tennessee-born comic who\u2019s become one of America\u2019s most beloved stand-up performers, hosting the 77th Emmy Awards represents the culmination of a career built on understated charm and everyman relatability.",
      "Known for his commitment to clean humor, Bargatze had a series of successful comedy specials, like \u201cThe Greatest Average American\u201d and \u201cThe Tennessee Kid.\u201d",
      "After decades in the business, he shot to fame after his 2023 \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d appearance. His 2024 tour crowned him the highest-grossing comedian of the year.",
      "Follow live Emmys 2025 coverage",
      "Now, Bargatze is approaching his hosting duties with a clear mission: keep things light, fun and genuinely enjoyable for everyone in attendance.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to be mean,\u201d Bargatze told USA Today when discussing his hosting philosophy. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make someone sad that\u2019s there.\u201d",
      "In an interview with TheWrap, he echoed the sentiment, saying that he wants to avoid making people in the audience feel uncomfortable.",
      "\u201cWhen the celebrities are there, you want to be able to see them afterwards and it not be weird. Jokes are naturally going to be kind of mean. That\u2019s the only way it\u2019s going to be funny,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have jokes about shows, but I\u2019m not trying to be, I don\u2019t want to make anybody sad.\u201d",
      "And to CNN, he said something similar: \u201cI would not want to do something that\u2019s just inherently mean, and to really be mean to a person. That would break my heart if I found out anybody was really hurt by anything.\u201d",
      "What viewers can expect, however, is stripped-down compared to traditional Emmy spectacle. Don\u2019t look for elaborate song-and-dance numbers or musical interludes under Bargatze\u2019s watch. \u201cI would be terrible at that stuff,\u201d he said to USA Today. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want the show to be bad. I want it to be good. So I don\u2019t plan on singing. I hope I don\u2019t.\u201d",
      "He's also devised an unconventional strategy for keeping speeches under 45 seconds each. Bargatze promised a personal $100,000 donation to the Boys & Girls Club of America \u2014 and the number will change depending on how speeches go.",
      "He explained the scheme on \"The Jimmy Kimmel Show.\"",
      "\u201cEverybody gets 45 seconds to do all the thank-yous,\u201d Bargatze said. \u201cSo what I came up with is I\u2019m going to donate $100,000 to the Boys & Girls Club. \u2026 That\u2019s what the show\u2019s starting at. When everybody uses their 45 seconds, if someone goes over, we take away $1,000 a second every time they go over.\u201d",
      "This year\u2019s ceremony follows the 2024 show helmed by father-son duo Dan and Eugene Levy.",
      "The 2025 nominees represent a particularly strong field, with Apple TV+\u2019s workplace thriller \u201cSeverance\u201d leading the pack with a 27 nominations. Close behind is HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Penguin,\u201d Colin Farrell\u2019s transformative turn as the Batman villain earning the limited series 24 nominations, while Apple TV+\u2019s behind-the-scenes comedy \u201cThe Studio\u201d nabbed 23 nods.",

      "In in the interview, Kelce also discussed playing his 13th season in the NFL. Andrews said there was a speculation among fans over whether or not the three-time Super Bowl champ would play another year. The 2024-2025 season notably ended in heartbreak for his team, with the Philadelphia Eagles defeating the Chiefs, 40-22, in the Super Bowl. (Kelce's interview with Andrews aired Sept. 14, the same day as the Chiefs-Eagles rematch game at Kansas City's Arrowhead Stadium.)",

      "\u201cListen, you know, the Benihana Christmas episode where Michael and Andy draw with a Sharpie on one of the Asian women that they\u2019ve brought back to the Christmas party is jaw-droppingly, kind of, horrific,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a tricky conversation, you know?\u201d",

And that\u2019s Michael, Dwight and Andy \u2014 and Kevin, for that matter. So it\u2019s a show based around clueless, insensitive, racist, sexist people that kind of mirrors the United States in a lot of ways.\u201d",
      "He added that while you \u201cwant to encourage it, because it\u2019s funny as hell and it also kind of like skewers a particular American sensibility,\u201d the show, at times, \u201cdefinitely goes pretty far if you dig deep.\u201d",

      "Retail sales last month rose 3.4% from a year earlier, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed Monday, missing analysts\u2019 estimates for 3.9% growth in a Reuters poll and slowing from July\u2019s 3.7% growth.",
      "Industrial output growth slowed to 5.2% in August, compared to the 5.7% jump in July, marking its weakest level since August 2024, according to LSEG data. Economists had expected the data to be unchanged from the previous month.",

      "Service consumption gained momentum, led by travel, leisure and transport, signaling a gradual shift in spending toward services, Zhang pointed out.",
      "The slowdown in retail sales growth was mainly due to weaker demand for home appliances and electronics, as the boost from Beijing\u2019s consumer goods trade-in subsidies started to fade, Lisheng Wang, China economist at Goldman Sachs, said in a note Monday.",

      "The North Korean government has intensified repression inside the isolated, nuclear-armed state, expanding electronic surveillance and publicly executing people for sharing foreign media, the United Nations said in a major new report.",
      "\u201cNo other population is under such restrictions in today\u2019s world,\u201d said the report, which was released Friday by the U.N. Human Rights Office.",
      "The 16-page report examined the state of human rights in North Korea since 2014 and came to grim conclusions, describing a totalitarian state that under leader Kim Jong Un has effectively cut off its population of about 26 million from the rest of the world.",
      "\u201cToday, the death penalty is more widely allowed by law and implemented in practice,\u201d the U.N. said in a statement on the report, which was based on interviews with 314 victims and witnesses who have left the country since 2014.",
      "The North Korean diplomatic mission in Geneva and its embassy in London did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment outside of business hours.",
      "Aided by advances in technology, surveillance of the population has become even more pervasive in North Korea, a communist state where all media is controlled by the government and there are no independent civil society organizations.",
      "The report said every person is also required to participate in weekly self-criticism sessions that are \u201cprimarily aimed at collective surveillance and indoctrination.\u201d",
      "\u201cEnjoyment of freedom of expression and access to information have significantly regressed, with the implementation of severe new punishments, including the death penalty, for a range of acts including the sharing of foreign media\u201d such as popular South Korean dramas, the U.N. said.",
      "Crackdowns on access to foreign information are believed to have intensified starting in 2018 and become even harsher since 2020, the U.N. said, and the government has held public trials and executions \u201cto instill fear in the population and as a deterrent.\u201d",
      "A government task force has increasingly carried out inspections of computers, radios and televisions and house searches without advance notice or warrants, citing the need to curb \u201canti-socialist\u201d behavior and protect national security, the report said.",
      "One escapee told researchers that the tightened surveillance was intended \u201cto block the people\u2019s eyes and ears.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was a form of control aimed at eliminating even the smallest signs of dissatisfaction or complaint,\u201d the person said.",
      "The public has almost no access to the internet, the report said, adding that the government operates \u201ca tightly controlled national intranet\u201d that is used mainly by research institutions and government officials.",
      "According to the U.N. report, new laws \u201ccriminalize access to unauthorized foreign information and prohibit the consumption or dissemination of information (through, for example, publications, music and movies) from \u2018hostile\u2019 nations and the use of linguistic expressions that do not conform with prescribed socialist ideology and culture.\u201d",
      "The laws, which provide for severe punishments up to and including the death penalty, \u201craise serious concerns\u201d about restrictions on the right to free expression, the report said.",
      "It said reports suggest that North Koreans continue to consume prohibited information despite the growing risks."

      "\u201cWithout going into too much detail I have recently been diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer which has spread into other areas of my body. Sadly, I have been informed by specialists it\u2019s time for me to retire and think about life after being a professional athlete.\u201d"

      "More than 300 South Koreans \u2014 307 men and 10 women \u2014 were detained in the Sept. 4 raid on a Hyundai plant in Georgia, the ministry said, one of whom has decided to remain in the U.S. rather than agree to \u201cvoluntary departure.\u201d The 316 others will be on the flight to Seoul, along with 14 employees of South Korean companies from other Asian countries: 10 from China, three from Japan and one from Indonesia.",
      "The workers were released from the Folkston ICE Processing Center in rural Georgia at 2:18 a.m. ET, the foreign ministry said, and were being driven several hours to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport where a plane sent by the South Korean government is waiting for them.",
      "The Korean Air plane is scheduled to leave Atlanta at noon ET and arrive in Seoul on Friday around 4 p.m. local time (3 a.m. ET).",
      "South Korean officials originally hoped the plane would leave Atlanta as early as Wednesday afternoon local time, shortly after it arrived from Seoul. But the foreign ministry said its departure was likely to be delayed \u201cdue to circumstances on the U.S. side,\u201d and an airport spokesperson later said the charter flight had been canceled.",
      "At a meeting with Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington on Wednesday, South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun learned that Trump had ordered the suspension of the repatriation process in order to discuss with South Korea whether its detained nationals \u2014 all of them skilled workers who were helping set up an electric vehicle battery plant \u2014 should remain in the U.S. to continue their work rather than be sent home.",
      "Cho told Rubio that it would be better for them to return home first and then re-enter the U.S. \u201csince these individuals were already in shock and are exhausted,\u201d a South Korean government official said.",
      "The official said that the U.S. agreed to repatriate the South Koreans and that Trump had instructed that they be transported to the airport without physical restraints such as handcuffs, in a departure from standard U.S. practice.",
      "Images of South Koreans being shackled at the wrists and ankles have caused outrage in South Korea, a key U.S. ally in Asia that has pledged hundreds of billions in U.S. investment as part of tariff negotiations. The raid came weeks after South Korean President Lee Jae Myung reinforced that commitment at a meeting with Trump at the White House.",
      "\u201cWe believe that President Trump\u2019s consideration in this regard stems from the deep bonds formed between the two leaders at the successful South Korea-U.S. summit, as well as the consistent position our government has maintained on this detention issue,\u201d the South Korean government official said.",
      "Lee said all but one of the 317 detained South Koreans had elected to fly home.",
      "\u201cEach person was allowed to choose, and the U.S. government said essentially, \u2018If you want to go, you may go; if you want to stay, you may stay,\u2019\u201d Lee said at a news conference in Seoul marking his 100th day in office.",
      "The raid has raised concerns about the potential impact on U.S.-South Korea relations, though Lee said his government had \u201cnot considered it to that depth yet.\u201d",
      "He said the incident could make South Korean companies more hesitant to invest in the U.S., where they have long sent employees on a temporary basis to provide training or assistance in areas where U.S. expertise is lacking.",
      "\u201cIf this is not allowed, companies will inevitably worry: \u2018If setting up factories in the U.S. brings endless restrictions and difficulties, should we even proceed?\u2019\u201d Lee said.",
      "What happened?",
      "The South Korean nationals were among the 475 people federal and immigration agents arrested in the raid on a construction site in the town of Ellabell, where the South Korean companies Hyundai and LG Energy Solution are jointly building an electric vehicle battery plant.",
      "U.S. officials, who said the arrested people were working or living in the country illegally, have described the raid as the largest single-site enforcement operation in the history of Homeland Security Investigations, a division of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. No criminal charges have been filed.",
      "Of the detained South Koreans, 47 were employed by LG Energy Solution and the rest were hired by subcontractors. Hyundai, South Korea\u2019s largest automaker, said none of its direct employees were detained.",
      "Most of the detained South Koreans either were engineers or they worked in after-sales services and installation, said Charles Kuck, an Atlanta-based immigration attorney who is representing at least seven of them. He said they were in the U.S. under various visa programs that South Koreans and other foreign nationals have long used to do business in the country in the face of U.S. bureaucratic delays and murky regulations.",
      "Sarah Park, president of the Korean American Coalition, said Monday that the detained workers should not be blamed for the challenges companies face trying to secure the proper U.S. visas for employees who are key to getting new facilities up and running.",
      "James S. Kim, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Korea, said Wednesday in an interview in Seoul: \u201cI wish that Americans in America would be a little bit more sympathetic to what the Koreans have witnessed. And as long as they do that, I think the two countries can work together to kind of mitigate what had happened and move forward.\u201d",
      "What\u2019s behind the raid?",
      "Federal authorities showed up at the Hyundai-LG plant to execute a judicial search warrant in connection with what they said was a criminal investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices.",
      "According to the warrant, agents were authorized to seize employment records and immigration documents, as well as ownership and management records related to the construction site. Authorities were also looking for four people, but the reasons the federal government was specifically interested in them remain under seal.",
      "On Sunday, U.S. and South Korean government officials reached a deal to release the workers from immigration custody and return them to their home country.",
      "Consulate officials and other South Korean officials met with those detained at the Folkston ICE Processing Center over the weekend, Meredyth Yoon, a litigation director at Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta, which has been assisting detainees and their families seeking legal help, told NBC News on Tuesday.",
      "Yoon said that, as part of the deal, most of the South Korean nationals had agreed to \u201cvoluntary departure,\u201d avoiding formal deportation orders.",
      "She said that about 175 of the remaining detainees \u2014 who hail from Guatemala, Colombia, Chile, Mexico, Ecuador and Venezuela \u2014 remain in immigration detention and that her organization is working to connect the affected families to aid."
