      "Designer Matthieu Blazy has taken Chanel's fashions underground, with a runway show on a New York City subway platform",
      "NEW YORK -- Chanel\u2019s new showman, Matthieu Blazy, took his designs on the road Tuesday \u2014 or rather, underground, with a buzzy New York runway show staged on an actual subway platform.",
      "The designer, just weeks after his splashy Paris debut for Chanel in October, took over a decommissioned part of Manhattan's Bowery station for his first M\u00e9tiers d\u2019Art collection. The annual show, which takes place in a different city each year, celebrates the craftsmanship of the artisans that partner with Chanel.",
      "In this case, it was two shows \u2014 one in the afternoon and one in the evening. And befitting the first Chanel shows in New York since 2018, there were VIPs aplenty: A$AP Rocky, Tilda Swinton, Ayo Edebiri, Rose Byrne, Kristen Stewart, Sofia Coppola, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Jessie Buckley, Margaret Qualley, Bowen Yang, Jon Bon Jovi and many others.",
      "The location had been a closely held secret. Guests entered via a doorway at 168 Bowery, and at first, it seemed like Chanel had perhaps decorated an event space to resemble a subway station, complete with tiled walls, turnstiles and a newsstand (with its own bespoke newspapers).",
      "But down a flight of stairs was the real platform. Guests settled into bleacher seats resembling subway benches. \u201cStand clear of the closing doors!\u201d came the announcement on the soundtrack, familiar to New Yorkers. Then a train came rolling in, and out of the cars came the models.",
      "The show was a marked contrast in vibe with the last M\u00e9tiers d\u2019Art collection in New York in 2018, when the late designer Karl Lagerfeld took over the Egyptian Temple of Dendur at the Metropolitan Museum of Art for what felt like a mini-Met Gala, with clothes channeling the luxury of Egyptian royalty.",
      "Blazy was inspired not by royalty but by ordinary urban commuters, of different ages and types, coming together in a mashup of styles from different eras, from the 1920s onward.",
      "\u201cThe New York subway belongs to all,\u201d the designer said in his show notes. \"Everyone uses it. There are students and game-changers, statesmen and teenagers. It is a place full of wonderful encounters, a clash of pop archetypes.\u201d",
      "His models strolled the platform, some checking for arriving trains \u2014 feigning annoyance at their lateness \u2014 or leaning against a post as they waited. Their numbers increased until, by the end, there was a virtual rush hour of fashion, with the eclectic soundtrack playing the \u201cHappy Days\u201d theme song as a finale.",

      "\u201cThis felt like breaking the system,\u201d said Stewart, speaking after the afternoon show. \u201cI genuinely had an emotional response to the show. I felt like I just saw so many different versions of a person walking. It wasn't one woman.\"",
      "Stewart, like others, had no idea going in what the show\u2019s theme would be, and thought the subway environment felt like \u201ca flurry of fleeting caught moments.\u201d",
      "\u201cLike, \u2018Where is she going?\u2019 I wanted to go with them,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cI believed in it. All of this is artifice, but when you do a really good impression of the truth, you find your own. This felt real to me.\u201d",
      "It was real enough that Chanel had printed its own \u201cnewspaper\u201d \u2014 called La Gazette \u2014 to accompany the show, with articles and interviews. An interview with Blazy quoted the designer as saying the collection was inspired partly by the 1931 visit to New York of Gabrielle \u201cCoco\u201d Chanel.",
      "And he sang the praises of the subway.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost like it\u2019s the vortex of the city,\" Blazy said. \"It connects everything.\u201d",

      "If there were any doubt, the first few days of Hollywood\u2019s year-end awards has already made it abundantly clear",
      "NEW YORK -- If there were any doubt, the first few days of Hollywood's year-end awards has already made it abundantly clear: Paul Thomas Anderson's \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d is the Oscar front-runner.",
      "On Monday, \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d won best film at the 35th Gotham Awards. On Tuesday, it was named best film by the New York Film Critics Circle. On Wednesday, it swept the National Board of Review Awards, winning best film, best director for Anderson and acting awards for Leonardo DiCaprio, Benicio del Toro and newcomer Chase Infiniti.",
      "Expect to hear this pun a lot: one award after another.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t expect this, actually,\u201d Anderson said at the Gothams. \u201cI started to think I didn\u2019t know what was going on.\u201d",
      "That may be the first, and last, time Anderson can say that this awards season.",
      "\u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d a father-daughter tale of political resistance in the face of recurring oppression, has firmly established itself as the movie of the moment. With an opening scene depicting a raid at an immigrant detention facility, Anderson's opus has struck critics and moviegoers, alike, for its contemporary relevance in the first year of President Donald Trump's second term. Even foes of the film, like conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, have predicted it will \u201cwin all the Academy Awards.\u201d",
      "Yet Anderson's film is, in many ways, an Academy Awards oddity. It's a critically acclaimed release that skipped film festivals. It's a big-budget studio movie that wasn't a hit. In fact, should \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d go on to win at the March 15 Oscars, it could be one of the only money-losers to ever win the industry's top honor.",
      "Smaller films have, increasingly, won best picture. That includes indies like \u201cThe Hurt Locker,\u201d \u201cMoonlight\u201d and \u201cNomadland\u201d \u2014 much-praised films with minuscule box office. Hollywood long ago got used to honoring films that exist largely outside its mainstream, franchise-obsessed business. And the notion of what constitutes a best-picture movie has grown elastic. \u201cParasite,\u201d\u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once\u201d and, the most recent winner, \u201cAnora,\u201d have all shaken traditional notions of Oscar material.",

      "\u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d represents something different. With a production budget of at least $130 million (some reports have it much higher) and another $70 million in marketing costs, it will have to have an extraordinary after-theater life to break even. Thus far, the Warner Bros. release has made $70.6 million domestically and $131.6 million overseas \u2014 great sums for an adult-oriented, R-rated, auteur-driven film that runs nearly three hours.",
      "Still, Variety earlier estimated \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d will lose $100 million, a figure that Warner Bros. has disputed. It's too harsh a label, but such a discrepancy could make \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d tagged as the first best picture-winning flop.",
      "Awards season has a long way to go. None of the awards dished out this week has any direct correlation with academy voters. Some contenders, like A24's \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d have yet to hit theaters. Others, like Focus Features' \u201cHamnet,\u201d are just arriving. Support is also strong for another Warner Bros. title, Ryan Coogler's \u201cSinners,\u201d which might pose the stiffest competition for \u201cOne Battle After Another.\u201d Both films are returning to IMAX screens on Dec. 12.",
      "But a bottom line in the red is far from a unique cross to bear this fall. Aside from the blockbuster launches of \u201cZootopia 2\u201d and \u201cWicked: For Good,\u201d waves of would-be awards contenders \u2014 films like \u201cThe Smashing Machine,\u201d \u201cRoofman\u201d and \u201cChristy\u201d\u2014 have fizzled with ticket buyers. It's been a grueling fall for a wide spectrum of contenders, a context that makes \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d comparatively, a smash success.",
      "The biggest financial ding against it, really, is that it cost a lot \u2014 arguably too much \u2014 to make. At a time when so few films anything like \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d get greenlit, let alone with such budgets, the cost of \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d could even be seen as a badge of honor. Here is a movie that win, lose or draw, is in the fight for a kind of moviemaking that's under siege. To quote DiCaprio's Bob Ferguson: \u201cViva la revolution!\u201d",

      "The Kennedy Center, known for theater and opera, becomes the sports world's focus on Friday",
      "WASHINGTON -- On Friday afternoon, the Kennedy Center, best known for its theater, opera and ballet, will be the unlikely center of the sports world when the matchups for next year's World Cup are announced there. By Sunday, in a quick pivot, the venue will assume its more traditional role as the host of the annual awards program honoring some of the top artists in the U.S.",
      "The culture headsnap has one thing in common: President Donald Trump's starring role.",
      "Trump was instrumental in working with FIFA President Gianni Infantino to move the draw to the Kennedy Center after it was widely expected to take place in Las Vegas. FIFA may further recognize Trump at the event with a newly created peace prize. Infantino hasn't confirmed that Trump will be the recipient but the two have forged a notably close relationship and Trump has openly campaigned for the Nobel Peace Prize. On the same day last month that FIFA said it would issue the new award, Infantino called Trump a \u201cclose friend\" who has \u201csuch an incredible energy.\u201d",
      "If the prospect of a peace prize isn't enough attention, Trump will assume a role played in the past by the broadcasting legend Walter Cronkite and other luminaires by hosting the Kennedy Center Honors, if current plans hold. When Trump announced the honorees at the Kennedy Center in August, he cast himself as reluctantly taking on the duties at the request of his chief of staff.",
      "\u201cI've been asked to host,\u201d he said. \u201cI said, I\u2019m the President of the United States. Are you fools asking me to do that? Sir, you\u2019ll get much higher ratings. I said 'I don\u2019t care.\u201d",
      "There are few recent parallels to the fervor that's about to descend on the Kennedy Center. When the U.S. last hosted the World Cup in 1994, the draw was held in Las Vegas and Bill Clinton, the president at the time, didn't attend. When presidents participate in the Kennedy Center Honors \u2014 Trump skipped the event during his first term \u2014 they generally stay in their box, wave to the audience and cheer the honorees.",
      "This week's lineup is a reminder that for Trump \u2014 a two-term president, bestselling author and onetime reality television star \u2014 his favorite role is that of a showman. And Trump's transformation of the Kennedy Center from one of Washington's relatively apolitical spaces into something of an extension of his White House affords him a natural stage.",
      "The shift at the Kennedy Center began quickly after Trump's return to Washington in late January. Within a month, he ousted the institution\u2019s leadership, filled the board of trustees with his supporters and announced he had been elected the board\u2019s chair.",
      "Trump and his aides criticized the Kennedy Center's programming as \u201cwoke\" and accused the previous leadership of financial mismanagement and neglecting the building. Some renovations have been underway in recent weeks, including using white paint over columns that were previously gold.",
      "Deborah Rutter, who was fired as the Kennedy Center's president, said in a May statement that allegations of poor financial management were \u201cfalse\u201d and insisted that when she left, \u201cthe Kennedy Center was fiscally sound.\u201d",
      "But the fallout has been intense with prominent musicals such as \u201cHamilton\u201d canceling performances. Actor Issa Rae and author Louise Penny also withdrew from appearances while consultants such as musician Ben Folds and singer Ren\u00e9e Fleming resigned. Some artists have expressed a sense of sadness at the changes.",
      "\u201cIt was always a joy to be asked to perform at the Kennedy Center,\u201d Jane Alexander, an actor and former chair of the National Endowment for the Arts, told The Associated Press.",
      "For its part, the Kennedy Center's new leadership has said it is focusing on programming that appeals to a broad audience and doesn't lose money. Kennedy Center President Richard Grenell has emphasized \u201ccommon sense\u201d programming.",
      "But Democrats in Congress are scrutinizing whether the new management is ultimately costing the Kennedy Center money. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee, released documents last month showing the Kennedy Center entered into an agreement giving FIFA \u201cexclusive\u201d use of the facility from Nov. 24 through Dec. 12 at no cost, arguing that the venue was at risk of losing millions in potential revenue because of the arrangement.",

      "Claire\u2019s grown kids (Felicity Jones, Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz, Dominic Sessa ) don\u2019t appreciate her efforts. Her husband (Denis Leary) is supportive without being helpful. And she is operating as a one woman show, managing this precious time with her family and trying to keep it all cozy and happy and fun through constant, thankless labor (cooking, cleaning, wrapping, planning). She even looks fabulous on her many, many (too many?) garbage runs. But after one particularly cruel oversight from her family, she takes off from her suburban prison and doesn\u2019t tell anyone. For once, she\u2019s decided to go do something for herself.",
      "Promising though it may seem, \u201cOh. What. Fun\u201d is a movie that does very little with its setup and terrific cast (including the likes of Danielle Brooks, Joan Chen, Maude Apatow, Rose Abdoo and Eva Longoria in almost cameo-sized roles) opting instead for the most generic version of itself.",
      "The movie, streaming Wednesday on Prime Video, begins with a kind of \u201clow point\u201d (for a beautiful, well-off, stay-at-home Texas mom, that is) in which she tells some children in a neighboring car at a gas station to be nicer to their exhausted mother in the front seat. \u201cShe\u2019ll be dead someday,\u201d she says calmly and seriously. She wishes the mother a Merry Christmas, gives the kids a piercing look and then we get the dreaded freeze-frame/record scratch and a voiceover about being entitled to a little outburst around the holidays and a half-hearted rant about how many holiday movies are about men. Already this movie is making this poor woman apologize.",
      "\u201cThey need to make a movie about the true heroes of the holidays: Moms,\u201d Claire says. Sure, yes, preach Claire, even if her exclusions are suspect and her examples need further review. I\u2019m pretty sure \u201cHome Alone\u201d was at least a little bit about the mom, and that \u201cPlanes, Trains and Automobiles\u201d doesn\u2019t deserve the vitriol. Alas, noble intentions aside, \u201cOh. What. Fun.\u201d probably wasn\u2019t what she had in mind.",
      "Director Michael Showalter co-wrote the script with the short story\u2019s author, Chandler Baker and is committed to keeping the proceedings light and breezy (no cancer diagnoses here). But the effect is a movie that seems almost embarrassed to commit to its own silly premise, rushing through everything instead of letting us enjoy this cast. Everyone gets assigned one tidy problem or flaw and no one has any sort of lived-in familial chemistry with one another.",
      "Channing (Jones) is the oldest and is married to Doug (Jason Schwartzman) who really wants her younger sister Taylor (Moretz) to think he\u2019s cool although Taylor, a serial monogamist who always brings a new woman home for the holidays, is just mean to him. Sessa is the youngest: Underemployed and recently dumped. There are two grandchildren too, Channing and Doug\u2019s twins, but they\u2019re nonentities.",

He was not accused of selling the actor the dose that investigators say killed him on Oct. 28, 2023.",
      "Perry had been taking the surgical anesthetic ketamine legally as a treatment for depression.

      "But the song's vocal phrasing, melodic shape and stylistic DNA came from someone who does exist: Grammy-nominated country artist Blanco Brown, a Black music artist who has worked with Britney Spears, Childish Gambino and Rihanna.",
      "And he had no idea.",
      "\u201cI didn't even know about the song until people hit me up about it,\u201d said Brown, whose 2019 country rap hit \u201cThe Git Up\u201d helped usher in a new, hybrid era of country crossover. He didn't learn about the chart-topping AI track until his phone was flooded with messages from friends.",
      "\u201cMy phone just kept blowing up,\u201d he said. \u201cSomebody said: 'Man, somebody done typed your name in the AI and made a white version of you. They just used the Blanco, not the Brown.\u201d",
      "The moment is the latest example of how generative AI is upending the music industry, giving anyone the ability to instantly create seemingly new songs by typing prompts into a chat window, often using models trained on real artists' voices and styles without their knowledge.",
      "The credits for the grit-filled, chant-heavy track \u201cWalk My Walk\u201d list Aubierre Rivaldo Taylor as one of the song's creators, with streaming platforms such as Apple Music and Spotify identifying him as both the songwriter and producer. In recent months, Taylor has also been credited on streaming platforms as the songwriter and producer behind Defbeatsai \u2014 one of several X-rated, AI-generated country artists that exploded across social media last year.",
      "The Defbeatsai ecosystem, however, connects back to another figure in Brown's past: Abraham Abushmais, a collaborator Brown once jokingly called \u201cAbe Einstein\u201d for his sharp studio instincts. Abushmais co-wrote a couple of songs on Brown's 2019 album \u201cHoneysuckle & Lightning Bugs\u201d and is listed as the developer of Echo, an obscure AI-powered music generator app promoted on one of Defbeats.ai's Instagram pages with a link encouraging users to \u201cmake your own hit country song.\u201d",
      "Brown said he wasn't notified about their involvement in the AI hit, and the collaborator he once mentored has since become unreachable.",
      "\u201cAbe\u2019s number changed,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe used to talk. I ain\u2019t heard from him in a year or two.\u201d",
      "The AP reached out to Abushmais for comment but did not receive a response.",
      "The digital avatar fronting \u201cWalk My Walk,\" a white, AI-generated country singer built with a vocal approach modeled on Brown's sound, is where the moment shifted from eerie to uncomfortable.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a white AI man with a Black voice,\u201d Brown said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s singing like a Negro spiritual.\u201d",
      "For Brown, the shock quickly gave way to action. He went into the studio and recorded his cover of the song, which was released last week. He's also putting out a reworked derivative of the track on Monday with new lyrics and a new arrangement.",
      "Brown's management said his response to the song is a direct challenge to the legal, ethical and policy void surrounding AI-generated music. He wants to use his own lived experience to force the industry and lawmakers to confront who owns art and what happens when technology outpaces the rights of the human creators it imitates.",
      "\u201cIf someone is going to sing like me, it should be me,\u201d he said.",
      "For musicians and educators, the success of \u201cWalk My Walk\u201d made one thing clear: AI-generated music has leapt from internet experiment to commercial disruptor.",
      "\u201cWe are entering a very strange and unprecedented period of both creation and industry,\u201d said Josh Antonuccio, director of the Ohio University Music Industry Summit. \u201cAI has essentially democratized the act of music creation itself.\u201d",

      "That democratization has come with no guardrails. Major record labels sued Suno and Udio \u2014 two most popular AI song generators \u2014 accusing them of training their models on copyrighted recordings without permission.",
      "\u201cThese companies trained their platforms on a volume of recorded music without permission,\u201d Antonuccio said. \u201cIt leaves creators in this strange purgatory where they're not getting compensated.\u201d",
      "Some labels have now shifted from lawsuits to negotiation. Universal Music Group recently settled a copyright infringement lawsuits with Udio and signed a new licensing agreement with the platform. Warner Music Group followed with its own deal on Tuesday, partnering with Suno in what the companies called a \u201cfirst-of-its-kind\u201d agreement to develop licensed AI music that both compensates and protects artists.",
      "\u201cThere's no accountability mechanism at the moment,\u201d he said.",
      "The sudden success of \u201cWalk My Walk\u201d also raises questions about the tools enabling it. Educators say most chart-ready AI vocals today are generated through systems like Suno and Udio, which let users create full songs by prompting musical genres, vocal styles and lyrical ideas.",
      "For Brown, this situation is a legal and cultural issue.",
      "He spent years navigating country music as a Black artist who blends gospel, hip-hop, pop and twang. He's been nominated for a Grammy and embraced by the Recording Academy, but country radio hasn't given him consistent traction.",
      "Meanwhile, an AI song built on his vocal identity and paired with a white avatar went straight to No. 1, a dynamic he says reflects a familiar pattern in Nashville: innovation from Black artists being reattributed.",
      "\u201cHe created something with my tone and gave it a white face,\u201d Brown said. \u201c(Race) is an understatement in Nashville.\u201d",
      "Music educators say the issue goes beyond authorship. While AI tools can convincingly approximate sound, they aren\u2019t able to capture the source of it.",
      "\u201cThere are things a real artist conveys that the digital part never will,\u201d said Shelton \u201cShelly\u201d Berg, dean of the University of Miami's Frost School of Music and a Grammy-nominated pianist. He spoke shortly after appearing on on a Future of Music panel at the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles last week. \u201cThey occupy fundamentally different spaces.\u201d",
      "Berg said AI tracks can sometimes be polished in an eerie manner, but the intangible elements of performance remain out of reach.",
      "\u201cThere's an energy between an artist and an audience that happens in real time that you can't see but you can feel,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are so many light years away from that happening in an AI environment.\u201d",
      "Brown insists he's not anti-AI. He's not even angry with Abushmais. He's proud that his sound inspired someone, but he understands what the moment exposes.",
      "For him, the arrival of an AI artist built on his tone only underscored something he has learned repeatedly in Nashville: talent is one thing, but how the industry assigns value is often something else.",
      "\u201cI go through this every day with real people who steal and borrow from what I do,\u201d Brown said. \u201cSo I don't care if it's a robot or a human. They're not giving me credit anyway.\u201d",
      "In a fast-changing landscape, Brown said artists will have one final advantage that machines can't mimic.",
      "\u201cReal artists are always going to prevail,\u201d he said. \u201cPurpose lives where greed can't.\u201d",

      "Tollywood, the Telugu-language film industry, is rapidly gaining global attention, challenging Bollywood's dominance",
      "HYDERABAD, India -- A fast-rising parallel film industry in India is competing with Bollywood's musicals and action-packed films and has taken the world by storm: It\u2019s called Tollywood.",
      "As Mumbai is to Hindi films \u2014 or Bollywood \u2014 the southern Indian city of Hyderabad is to movies made in Telugu, one of the country\u2019s most widely spoken languages. Tollywood films like \u201cRRR\u201d and \u201cBaahubali\u201d have achieved international acclaim at the box office and on the awards stage.",
      "The Telugu-language film industry, widely known as Tollywood, is one of India\u2019s many regional movie-producing centers. But it's drawn national and global audiences with its high-adrenaline action movies, mythic storylines and grand visual style. It has carved out its own identity separate from Hindi-language Bollywood by leaning toward star-driven spectacle and large-scale epics.",
      "Tollywood primarily operates out of Hyderabad, which is home to Ramoji Film City. The 1,666-acre (674-hectare) facility, recognized by Guinness World Records as the world\u2019s largest film studio complex, houses massive film studio complexes, dozens of production houses, warehouses, movie sets and post-production facilities. The industry churns out around 300 films every year \u2014 fewer than Bollywood but still enough to make it one of India\u2019s largest regional industries.",
      "Tollywood\u2019s growing exposure was in large part sparked by the coronavirus pandemic, as the rapid expansion of streaming services in India allowed regional films to find wider audiences. That expansion also coincided with Bollywood\u2019s struggle to lure audiences back to theaters amid repetitive storylines and rehashes of hits from other languages.",
      "What has also worked in favor of Tollywood is that it offers a rare balance of high-octane action films and nuanced movies charged with real human drama.",
      "\u201cTelugu people have a lot of interest in movies. The Telugu audience watch and accept all kind of movies. They are cinema lovers,\u201d says filmmaker T.V. Ravi Narayan, who is working on a biopic based on an 18th-century social activist. \u201cBecause they are cinema lovers, be it \u2018Baahubali,\u2019 \u2018Pushpa\u2019 or \u2018RRR,\u2019 be it big budget or small budget, be it realistic or biopics or fantasy movies, the audiences accept it.\u201d",
      "Tollywood is known for its high-energy storytelling, big action set pieces and grand spectacle that are heavy on visual effects. It often blends family drama, action and mythology into movies, increasingly marketed as \u201cpan-India\u201d releases and dubbed in multiple regional languages.",
      "The films, like other big Indian productions, have crowd-pleasing visuals and feature viral songs and dances central to the narrative and usually presented as grand performance set pieces.",
      "Many Tollywood films are also remade in Bollywood, which has become a proven formula to expand Telugu cinema across India. Dubbing \u2014 where actors record voice-overs in Hindi or a professional voice artist replaces the track \u2014 is also a standard and tested practice that has made Tollywood more accessible.",
      "The industry does also produce smaller, low-budget films that tend to focus on stories rooted in Telugu culture. Most of them are set in rural landscapes and explore themes such as social issues, regional cultures and class inequality. Some of those films are sent straight to streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime, where they enjoy a wide reach across India.",
      "Many Tollywood movie stars like Mahesh Babu, Allu Arjun, Prabhas, Ram Charan and N.T. Rama Rao Jr. command a near-godlike following, with devoted fan bases that cut across generations. Their movie releases are often tied to regional religious festivals and are preceded by carefully marketed music launch events and dance performances that are a spectacle in itself. Tens of thousands of fans attend such events, as they did recently with the first look of S.S. Rajamouli's \u201cVaranasi.\u201d",
      "The industry has also led to a massive fan club culture, predominantly centered around male film stars. Some fans are so invested in their favorite stars that they often organize charitable drives and blood donation camps in their names. It is not unusual for fans to perform acts of literal worship, washing male stars' cardboard cutouts or statues with milk \u2014 a ritual usually reserved for Hindu gods.",
      "In theaters across Hyderabad, viewers will commonly dance, whistle and throw confetti in the air during releases of films. Outside, billboards of major stars are a frequent sight in the city.",

After sweeping state elections, he became the chief minister.",
      "Tollywood\u2019s rapid commercial success and audience acceptance over the past decade has reshaped the country\u2019s entertainment landscape and pushed regional cinema further onto the world stage.",
      "Much of its recent success has been credited to filmmaker S.S. Rajamouli, who favors larger-than-life heroes and imaginative filmmaking. Rajamouli became an international name after \u201cRRR,\u201d or \u201cRise, Roar, Revolt,\u201d his 2022 three-hour epic set in British India. The sprawling anti-colonial tale became one of India\u2019s biggest hits, a global streaming phenomenon that won an Oscar for best original song. His two-part \u201cBaahubali\u201d series, released in 2015 and 2017, broke box-office records in India and a reedited version combining the two parts, \u201cBaahubali: The Epic,\u201d released in cinemas worldwide just last month.",

      "Just like Bollywood, the Telugu film industry also draws its revenue from theatrical releases, television and music rights, overseas distribution and brand partnerships. It is widely regarded as India\u2019s second-highest-grossing film industry, trailing only Bollywood.",
      "Even though the industry is largely controlled by some regionally influential film families and businessmen that have power over movie distribution and screenings, huge marketing campaigns have carried Telugu films across India and beyond.",

      "NEW YORK -- A federal vaccine advisory committee this week is expected to discuss whether newborns should still get the hepatitis B vaccine \u2014 the first shot found to prevent cancer.",
      "Federal health recommendations now suggest that all babies be vaccinated against the liver infection in their first day of life, but U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s committee on Thursday is expected to change that \u2014 contradicting previous public health advice.",
      "It's not clear exactly what the committee is considering, but the American Academy of Pediatrics will still urge a birth dose, said the organization's Dr. Sean O'Leary.",
      "\u201cWe are going to continue to recommend it because it saves lives,\u201d he said.",
      "Here's a look at the disease, the vaccine and the debate over changing the recommendations.",
      "Hepatitis B is a serious liver infection that for most people lasts less than six months. But for some \u2014 especially infants and children \u2014 it can become a long-lasting problem that can lead to liver failure, liver cancer and scarring called cirrhosis.",
      "In adults, the virus is spread through sex or through sharing needles during injection-drug use.",
      "But it can also be passed from an infected mother to a baby. As many as 90% of infants who contract hepatitis B go on to have chronic infections, meaning their immune systems don't completely clear the virus.",
      "As many as 2.4 million people in the U.S. are estimated to have hepatitis B, and as many as half are unaware they are infected, according to information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Dr. Baruch Blumberg, a federal scientist, identified the virus behind the infection in 1965. He won the Nobel Prize for the discovery, which led to tests and vaccines. The first hepatitis B vaccine was licensed in the U.S. in 1981.",
      "For decades, the nation's vaccine guidance has been influenced by a government-appointed panel of experts, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Its recommendations have usually been adopted as national guidance that is widely heeded by doctors.",
      "In 1991, the committee recommended an initial dose of hepatitis B vaccine at birth. The guidance was modified a little over the years and currently suggests a dose within 24 hours of birth for all medically stable infants who weigh at least 4.4 pounds (2 kilograms), plus follow-up shots to be given at about 1 month and 6 months.",
      "Why a dose right at birth? Health officials used to rely on screening expectant mothers to find babies that might have been exposed to the virus. But many cases were missed, experts say, because some women weren't tested or test results were incorrect. Also, the virus can live on surfaces for more than seven days at room temperature, so unvaccinated children living with a person with a chronic infection can catch it.",
      "Newborn hepatitis B vaccinations are widely considered to be a public health success story. Over about 30 years, cases among children fell from about 18,000 per year to about 2,200.",
      "A collaboration of public health researchers, the Vaccine Integrity Project, this week released its analysis of more than 400 studies and reports spanning 40 years. The group concluded the birth dose is safe, and is an important reason U.S. pediatric hepatitis B infections have fallen.",
      "Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine activist before becoming the nation\u2019s top health official, fired all 17 members of ACIP earlier this year and replaced them with a group that includes several anti-vaccine voices.",

      "Peppered with questions about why a change was necessary, committee member Dr. Robert Malone said: \u201cThe signal that is prompting this is not one of safety. It\u2019s one of trust. ... It\u2019s one of parents uncomfortable with this medical procedure being performed at birth in a rather unilateral fashion without significant informed consent.\"",
      "The committee tabled a vote at the September meeting, but it's slated to be acted on during Thursday's meeting, according to the agenda. Federal officials have not answered questions about exactly how much of a delay is being proposed, or disclosed what research is being used as a basis for such a decision.",
      "Not knowing what the committee is contemplating makes it difficult to guess the potential impact. But some have tried.",
      "This week, public health researchers collaborating with hepatitis-focused advocacy organizations released a report estimating that delaying the birth dose to 2 months could result in at least 1,400 hepatitis B infections in children and 480 deaths. The report \u2014 which has yet to be peer reviewed or published in a medical journal \u2014 estimated the toll would be higher if the first dose was given even later.",
      "But an ACIP change to the recommendation may have limited impact, O'Leary said.",
      "The committee's most direct power comes over what's covered by the government Vaccines for Children program, which pays for shots for uninsured children from low-income families. Hepatitis B shots often have been bundled into the final hospital bill for childbirth. So a new ACIP recommendation likely would not be an economic obstacle for the current practice continuing at many hospitals, he said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A single HPV vaccination appears just as effective as two doses at preventing the viral infection that causes cervical cancer, researchers reported Wednesday.",
      "HPV, or human papillomavirus, is very common and spread through sex. Most HPV infections clear up on their own but some linger, causing cancers that appear years later, including cervical cancer in women and rarer cancers in both women and men.",
      "HPV vaccination has been recommended for U.S. girls since 2006 and already the nation is counting fewer cases of precancerous cervical lesions among women in their 20s \u2014- the first age group to start getting the shots back when they were tweens or teens.",
      "But cervical cancer kills about 340,000 women worldwide annually \u2014 and the new findings from a huge study in Costa Rica could help spur global efforts to protect more girls and young women in harder-to-reach low-income countries.",
      "Led by the U.S. National Cancer Institute, the study enrolled more than 20,000 girls between ages 12 and 16. Researchers tested two different HPV vaccines used around the world, giving half the girls one shot type and the rest the other.

      "The West Virginia Supreme Court has paused a ruling that allowed parents to use religious beliefs to opt out of required school vaccines for their children",
      "CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- The West Virginia Board of Education on Tuesday reinstated a school vaccination mandate after the state Supreme Court paused a lower court's ruling that allowed parents to cite religious beliefs to opt out of shots required for their children to attend classes.",
      "The Supreme Court earlier Tuesday issued a stay in last week's ruling by Raleigh County Circuit Judge Michael Froble in a class-action lawsuit. In issuing an injunction, Froble said children of families who objected to the state\u2019s compulsory vaccination law on religious grounds would be allowed to attend school and participate in extracurricular sports.",
      "The Supreme Court halted Froble's ruling pending resolution of appeals in the case. In light of that, the board said in a statement that it \u201cis reinstating its directive to county boards of education not to accept religious exemptions to compulsory vaccination laws. This directive will be in effect until the Supreme Court issues further guidance.\u201d",
      "The board further said its priority is to ensure compliance with the vaccine law \u201cand safeguard the health and well-being of all students across West Virginia.\u201d",
      "The board had suspended the vaccine mandate last week after Froble's ruling, which said that a state policy barring parents from seeking religious exemptions violated the Equal Protection for Religion Act signed into law in 2023 by then-Republican Gov. Jim Justice.",
      "West Virginia was among just a handful of states that granted only medical exemptions from school vaccinations when Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order in January allowing religious exemptions. In June, the board directed public schools to ignore Morrisey's executive order. Two groups had sued over the executive order, saying the Legislature, not the governor, has the authority to make such decisions.",
      "Legislation that would have allowed the religious exemptions was passed by the state Senate and rejected by the House of Delegates earlier this year. Froble said in his ruling that the failure of the legislation did not determine the application of the 2023 law. He rejected the defendants' argument that religious exemptions can only be created by legislative action.",

But on June 17, Guzman received an email from the local school superintendent rescinding the certificate, according to the lawsuit.",

      "At least 30 states have religious freedom laws, including one signed by Georgia's governor in April. The laws are modeled after the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, signed in 1993 by then-President Bill Clinton, which allows federal regulations that interfere with religious beliefs to be challenged.",

      "NEW YORK -- A high-stakes hearing in the New York murder case against Luigi Mangione continues Thursday, a year to the day after prosecutors say he gunned down UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "Mangione, 27, has pleaded not guilty to both state and federal charges. Before any trials get scheduled, his lawyers are trying to preclude the eventual jurors from hearing about his alleged statements to law enforcement officers and items \u2014 including a gun and a notebook \u2014 allegedly seized from his backpack.",
      "The evidence is key to prosecutors' case. They have said that the 9 mm handgun matches the firearm used in the killing, that writings in the notebook laid out Mangione's disdain for health insurers and ideas about killing a CEO at an investor conference, and that he gave Pennsylvania police the same fake name that the alleged gunman used at a New York hostel days before the shooting.",
      "Thompson, 50, was shot from behind as he walked to an investor conference on Dec. 4, 2024. He became UnitedHealthcare's CEO in 2021 and had worked within parent UnitedHealth Group Inc. for 20 years.",
      "The hearing, which started Monday and could extend to next week, applies only to the state case. But it is giving the public an extensive preview of some testimony, video, 911 audio and other records relevant to both cases.",
      "It's not immediately clear what witnesses or evidence are expected Thursday.",
      "Tuesday's court session displayed police body-camera video of officers confronting Mangione at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, and concluding \u2014 to their amazement \u2014 that he was the much-publicized suspect in Thompson's killing five days earlier.",
      "They interacted with Mangione for roughly 20 minutes before telling him he had the right to remain silent. The officers asked his name, whether he\u2019d been in New York recently and other questions, including: \u201cWhy are you nervous?\u201d",

Still, they patted Mangione down and pushed his backpack away from him. About 15 minutes in, they warned him that he was being investigated and would be arrested if he repeated what they'd determined was a fake name.",
      "After he gave his real one, he was read his rights, handcuffed, frisked again and ultimately arrested on a forgery charge related to his fake ID.",

      "Mangione's lawyers argue that his statements shouldn't be allowed as trial evidence because officers started questioning him before reading his rights. The defense contends the backpack items should be excluded because police didn\u2019t get a warrant before searching his bag.",
      "Manhattan prosecutors haven't yet detailed their arguments for allowing the disputed evidence. Federal prosecutors have maintained that police were justified in searching the backpack to ensure there was nothing dangerous inside and that Mangione's statements to officers were voluntary and made before he was under arrest.",

      "The committee makes recommendations to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on how already-approved vaccines should be used. CDC directors almost always adopted the committee's recommendations, which were widely heeded by doctors and guide vaccination programs.",
      "Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine activist before becoming the nation\u2019s top health official, fired the entire 17-member panel earlier this year and replaced it with a group that includes several anti-vaccine voices. He also named Kulldorff as chairman.",
      "Under Kulldorff's leadership, the group made several decisions that angered major medical groups.",
      "At a June meeting, the panel recommended that a preservative called thimerosal be removed from doses of flu vaccine even though some members acknowledged there was no proof it was causing harm.",
      "In September, the group recommended new restrictions on a combination shot that protects against chickenpox as well as measles, mumps and rubella. The panel also took the unprecedented step of not recommending COVID-19 vaccinations \u2014 not even for high-risk populations like seniors \u2014 instead making it a matter of personal choice.",

      "Here\u2019s what to know about the new approach.",
      "Myopia, commonly called nearsightedness, is when people can clearly see objects at close range but struggle with distant objects, which often appear blurry or indistinct.",

      "The FDA said it cleared the lenses based on company data showing children experienced a 70% reduction in the progression of their myopia after two years.",
      "Over time, myopia causes the eye to grow longer, worsening vision and increasing the risk of tears to the retina \u2014 the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye that is essential for vision.",
      "The new lenses use 11 concentric rings filled with tiny raised dots to refocus light onto the retina in a way that is believed to slow elongation of the eye.",
      "\u201cWhether this hypothesis is ultimately proven to be true, of course, matters only in part,\u201d Repka said, noting that the lenses appear to work regardless of how the underling science works.",

      "The easy availability of the drugs combined with their hard-to-detect nature is precisely the toxic combination doping regulators and Olympic officials are trying to avoid. With the Milan Cortina Games just two months away, they are hoping to break a string of scandals involving the Russians and Chinese that have disrupted the Games, both summer and winter, since 2014.",
      "Though online pharmaceuticals and supplements have for years been portrayed as a risk by anti-doping authorities, the influx of certain hard-to-detect peptides \u2014 chains of protein-building amino acids marketeed to help with anything from anti-aging to workout recovery to weight and memory loss \u2014 presents a more difficult challenge.",

      "The few substances specifically listed under the \u201cS0\" category \u2014 such as the popular BPC 157 \u2014 are placed there because the pharmalogical make-up of the substances don't fit neatly into another category on the banned list.",
      "One tricky part of the \u201cS0\u201d category is that it includes unapproved substances that aren't specifically listed because, for instance, there is no way to test for that drug and regulators don't want to reveal that to users.",

      "\u201cThe bad guys know it, and that\u2019s why the stuff proliferates,\u201d Burke said.",
      "Though some peptides \u2014 insulin and the newly popular weight-loss dynamo GLP-1 are among the best examples \u2014 are time-tested, perfectly legal (with a prescription) and effective, other substances in the category are not legally marketable, either as supplements or prescription or over-the-counter drugs.",

      "Like some peptides, designer steroids were impossible to detect at the time but they were not easy to obtain. It took years to uncover their existence, let alone to analyze their efficacy or sanction the athletes who used them.",
      "Fast forward 25 years and this new model of performance enhancers are, in some cases, just as difficult to detect but as easy to purchase as clicking a few buttons on a computer.",
      "WADA spokesman James Fitzgerald said the availability of PEDs on websites isn't under its jurisdiction, but that WADA began teaming with national anti-doping and law enforcement agencies two years ago to tackle the illegal manufacture, sale and supply of performance enhancers of all sorts.",

      "Whether the proliferation of the drugs could be the trigger point of the next Olympic scandal could take years to uncover.",
      "Like some of the blood-boosting drugs they purport to mimic, most peptides disappear from the blood quickly, which makes them hard to detect. The IOC stores blood samples for up to 10 years to account for possible improvements in detection long after the event ends.",
      "USADA and other anti-doping organizations have spent years warning athletes about the potential legal and eligibility risks of using unapproved substances \u2014 whether via prescription drugs or unvetted supplements \u2014 while also articulating the health risks for elite athletes and others looking to gain a small advantage in the gym.",
      "\u201cFrom a consumer-buyer-beware standpoint, anytime you consume or inject something where you don't know what you're taking, there's the possibility of adverse health effects, and that's concerning,\u201d said Matt Fedoruk, USADA's chief science officer.",

      "The family of a Colombian man has filed a formal challenge to U.S. military strikes on alleged drug-carrying boats",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- The family of a Colombian man has filed the first formal challenge to U.S. military strikes on alleged drug-carrying boats, arguing in a petition to the premier human rights watchdog in the Americas that his death was an extrajudicial killing.",
      "The petition from the family of Alejandro Carranza says the military bombed his fishing boat on Sept. 15, when he was sailing off Colombia\u2019s Caribbean coast, in violation of human rights conventions. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights received the complaint Tuesday, and while the Trump administration has said it supports the commission's work, the U.S. does not recognize the jurisdiction of an international court associated with the commission. Therefore, any recommendations that could result from the family\u2019s petition would not be binding.",
      "The family\u2019s attorney, Daniel Kovalik, said Carranza\u2019s four children and spouse want to be compensated as their loved one was their primary breadwinner. He explained that the family chose the commission because of the obstacles that a federal case would face, but the possibility has not been ruled out either.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. does not subject itself to accountability, so we\u2019re using the avenues we have before us,\" Kovalik said Wednesday. \u201cWe believe that a decision in our favor, combined with public pressure, can get us that compensation and also can end the killings in the Caribbean.\u201d",
      "The U.S. military has killed more than 80 people since early September, when it began striking vessels that the Trump administration has said were carrying drugs toward the U.S. The strikes began off Venezuela's Caribbean coast and later expanded to the eastern Pacific Ocean.",
      "The U.S. also has built up its largest military presence in the region in generations, which many see as part of a strategy to pressure Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to resign.",
      "The Trump administration has not provided any details of the people killed in the strikes, but it has insisted that its intelligence confirmed that members of foreign terrorist organizations were operating the targeted vessels.",
      "The U.S. military's Sept. 15 strike killed three people. Asked at the time what proof the U.S. has that the vessel was carrying drugs, President Donald Trump told reporters that big bags of cocaine and fentanyl were spattered all over the ocean. However, images of what Trump described were not released by the military or the White House.",
      "Kovalik denied that Carranza's boat was carrying drugs and said he did not know if other people were on the vessel. Kovalik, who is also representing President Gustavo Petro in the U.S. after the Trump administration imposed sanctions on him, said he met the Carranzas at their home in northern Colombia.",
      "Petro, the leftist leader of a traditional U.S. ally, has called the boat attacks \u201cmurders,\u201d questioning the disproportionate use of force.",
      "The petition cites as evidence of Carranza's killing stories from The New York Times and The Washington Post regarding the family\u2019s allegations and statements by U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. It also says the family has received threats since Carranza's death.",

    "story": [
      "Spain's former King Juan Carlos has published a memoir titled \"Reconciliation\" in an attempt to repair his tarnished reputation",
      "MADRID -- With his reputation in tatters, Spain\u2019s former King Juan Carlos I abdicated in favor of his son in 2014 and left Spain years later for self-imposed exile in the United Arab Emirates. Now, he is trying to rehabilitate his image \u2014 but struggling to make headway.",
      "The disgraced former monarch published a memoir on Wednesday called \u201cReconciliation,\" saying on the first page he needed to write it because, \u201cin recent years, misinterpretations and false truths about my life have been growing.\u201d",
      "Juan Carlos, 87, was for decades deemed a national savior after he oversaw Spain\u2019s return to democracy and stood down a military coup. Then came the womanizing, the spending on safaris to shoot African elephants during a worldwide recession, and finally the unseemly wealth of Saudi origin sloshing around in foreign bank accounts.",
      "While the book contains nuggets of historical interest, including details on Juan Carlos' accidental shooting of his brother, it appears to have driven father and son, King Felipe VI, further apart.",
      "Promoting the book earlier this week, Juan Carlos addressed Spaniards in a video quickly splashed across Spanish media, appealing to people: \u201cI ask you to support my son, King Felipe, in the difficult job that is unifying Spain.\u201d",
      "The royal house, which rarely airs Felipe's views, reacted swiftly.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t understand the purpose of that video, and we don\u2019t see it as necessary or appropriate,\u201d Rosa Lerchundi, communications director for the royal house, said in a message to the media, including The Associated Press.",
      "Felipe, who took the throne in 2014, has for years distanced himself from Juan Carlos. When his father's financial dealings came under scrutiny, Felipe renounced any future personal inheritance he could receive from Juan Carlos and stripped his father of his annual stipend.",
      "Investigations into Juan Carlos' finances in Spain and Switzerland were eventually dropped, as was a harassment case against a former lover taken to court in Britain, but the damage to his public image was done.",
      "The Spanish Royal House under Felipe makes every effort to appear to be a service to the country while avoiding lavish spending. Its yearly budget is less than a tenth of what the British royal house receives in public funding.",
      "In the book, Juan Carlos said he understands Felipe\u2019s need to protect the monarchy, but laments their estrangement.",
      "\u201cI understand that, as King, he must keep a certain distance from me,\" Juan Carlos wrote. \"But I have suffered as a father. In those difficult moments, I felt the need for affection and family support.\u201d",
      "The release in Spain comes a full month after the book originally appeared in France. At that time, talk of the memoir was all over Spanish news, tabloids and podcasts. Coverage was overall unfavorable, and any hopes of convincing Spaniards to welcome him home appeared to be of little avail.",
      "\u201cThe problem is that they (the memoirs) were ghostwritten by a French author who is not particularly well informed about contemporary Spanish affairs,\u201d said Charles Powell, director of the Elcano Royal Institute in Madrid, a think-tank.",

      "Juan Carlos details an accident that he said shaped his life forever: the moment he accidentally shot and killed his younger brother in a gun accident. The incident is well-known in Spain, but the former king has never recounted it firsthand.",
      "In 1956, when Spain\u2019s royals were exiled in Portugal, Juan Carlos and his 14 year-old brother \u201cwere having fun playing with a .22 caliber pistol.\"",

      "\u201cA shot went off, the bullet ricocheted and struck my brother in the forehead. He died in my father\u2019s arms,\u201d Juan Carlos wrote. \u201cEven today, it\u2019s difficult for me to talk about what happened, but I think about it every day.\u201d",

      "Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi has won the catchphrase of the year for her pledge to \u201cwork, work, work, work and work\u201d for the country",
      "TOKYO -- The pledge by Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi to \u201cwork, work, work, work and work\u201d for her country has been named the catchphrase of the year, recognizing the effort Japan's first female leader had to make to reach the top.",
      "The ultraconservative Takaichi uttered the phase in October when she was elected as head of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Many were initially as worried about her work ethic as supportive of her enthusiasm.",
      "In a country notorious for long working hours, especially for working women who are also burdened with homemaking and caregiving, overwork is a sensitive topic. The recognition triggered a mixed reaction, with some interpreting it as satire.",
      "Accepting her award from a private committee this week, Takaichi said she only wanted to stress her enthusiasm.",
      "\u201cI have no intention of encouraging other people to overwork, or suggesting long working hours as a virtue,\u201d Takaichi said. \u201cI hope there is no misunderstanding.\u201d",
      "Takaichi, within weeks of taking office in late October, sparked a deepening spat with Beijing over her remark about possible Japanese military action in the event that China attacks Taiwan.",
      "As the nation's first female prime minister, Takaichi has captured public attention for her workwear, with women scrambling to copy her style, and the interest has not worn off.",
      "But while her dress sense has won admiration from younger women who say they are \u201cSana-katsu,\u201d or rooting for Sanae, it is unclear if her hardline conservative policies will win the same praise.",
      "Takaichi is looking to regain right-wing supporters after the LDP\u2019s big election losses under her moderate predecessor Shigeru Ishiba.",
      "During her speech to party members Oct. 4 she promised an all-out effort to rebuild the struggling party and regain public support, urging lawmakers to \u201cwork like a horse.\u201d Then she added: \u201cI will abandon the idea of a \u2018work-life balance\u2019 \u2014 I will work, work, work, work and work.\u201d",
      "Repeating the word \u201cwork\u201d in a low, determined voice left a strong impression at the time.",
      "Takaichi\u2019s apparent long working hours and lack of sleep have worried fellow lawmakers. She held a meeting with aides at 3 a.m. before the first day of parliament Nov. 7, though she hasn\u2019t started that early since.",
      "\u201cI sleep about two hours now, four hours at the longest,\u201d Takaichi, who also provides care for her husband who is recovering from a stroke, told MPs at a budget committee meeting last month. \u201cIt\u2019s probably bad for my skin.\u201d",
      "She says she likes to soak in a hot tub in the morning and at night to relax. \u201dThat\u2019s my blissful time,\u201d she said.",
      "Her style-icon status has been boosted by her black bag, dubbed a \u201cSanae Bag,\" which is officially called the Grace Delight Tote. It is made by Hamano Inc., a 145-year old bagmaker based in Tokyo.",
      "Priced at 136,400 yen ($875), the simple leather bag is just large enough to fit A4-sized papers. It is selling the best since its debut 30 years ago, according to the company.",

      "Within days, inquiries and orders for the bag surged, and all eight colors have sold out. The bag, which is carefully made of high quality leather, cannot be mass-produced, and those who ordered it now have to wait until August, Kobayashi says.",
      "Another popular item is a sparkly light-pink pen Takaichi uses to take notes; it's Mitsubishi Pencil Co.\u2019s Jetstream 4&1.",
      "The pen, the \"Sanae Takaichi model,\u201d is often out of stock at stores and internet shopping sites. Those who have found one often proudly post photos with a message: \u201cMatching Sanae.\u201d",
      "The attention Takaichi is receiving is usually reserved for pop stars, athletes and influencers in Japan who fans have access to only through television or the internet.",
      "The prime minister's fans show their loyalty by buying the same bag and pen she uses, just as fans of star athletes like Shohei Ohtani buy replicas of his uniform to cheer on the Dodgers, experts say.",
      "Takaichi has won admiration as a new type of role model for women who have not usually rooted for prime ministers in the past, says Namiko Kubo-Kawai, a psychology professor at Nagoya Shukutoku University.",
      "In Japan, many female role models typically were supported for their femininity, but Takaichi is unique as a high-powered politician. Her short haircut and no-frills workwear also stand out from conventional female models.",
      "She may not inspire many feminists, however. Takaichi is a staunch conservative who champions Japan\u2019s traditional gender and paternalistic values. She has supported keeping the succession of Japan\u2019s monarchy male only. She also opposes changing a 19th-century law that would allow married couples the option of keeping separate surnames.",
      "Sill, as the first female prime minister, \u201cshe fits perfectly as a stylish role model and has won admiration from many women who have been looking for one even though they probably have never thought of rooting for a prime minister,\" Kubo-Kawai said. \u201cFemale role models are becoming more diverse.\"",

      "West Africa's cattle herders are being stripped of their animals by extremist-linked armed groups as the deadly conflict in the Sahel region grows",
      "ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast -- Nouhoun Sidib\u00e8 was a herder, like his father and grandfather, and took pride in his identity as a pastoralist. That's until the day armed men descended on his home in northern Burkina Faso and seized all his livestock.",
      "Within minutes on that day in 2020, the father of four lost everything.",
      "For the next three years, he wandered from town to town looking for jobs in the landlocked West African nation that faces growing attacks by armed groups, with some of the fighters linked to al-Qaida. He had no luck, and decided to try neighboring Ivory Coast in 2023.",
      "\u201cI feel very, very lost. I was a chief, and now I have come here and I am working for someone else,\u201d the 49-year-old Sidib\u00e8 told The Associated Press at a stockyard in a swampy wasteland on the outskirts of Abidjan, the Ivory Coast capital. He and other migrants live in a cramped space with no bathroom or kitchen.",
      "The sprawling conflict in the Sahel, a vast semi-arid stretch south of the Sahara desert, has sent thousands of herders to safer areas on the fringes of Abidjan, where they struggle to adapt to city life with rising costs and soaring unemployment. Sidib\u00e8 now gets by helping cattle sellers vaccinate their herds.",
      "He said the city was his only option: \u201cYou can\u2019t keep livestock here, but since I didn\u2019t have any anymore, there was nothing stopping me from coming.\"",
      "That could change. This month, Ivory Coast said it was strengthening security along its northern borders after noting \u201cseveral unusual flows of refugees from Mali.\u201d",
      "Countries in the Sahel have been fighting armed groups for years, starting with unrest in northern Mali in 2012 that has spread to landlocked Burkina Faso and Niger.",
      "The struggle is reshaping West Africa, with a spike in migration into seaside countries like Ivory Coast.",
      "Experts say armed groups target herders and seize livestock for various reasons, including to finance their operations and exert control over communities. Herding is a major occupation in the Sahel, where the changing climate also creates tensions with struggling farmers \u2014 another driver of migration.",
      "Ivory Coast, with its status as a regional hub and steady economic growth, has long been a destination for migrants, according to analysts. But that migration has jumped in recent years after military juntas took power in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger and took up the fight against armed groups.",
      "Between January and March of this year, more than 72,000 people fled violence in Burkina Faso and Mali to Ivory Coast, according to data by UNICEF. That's up from the 54,000 recorded by the International Organization for Migration between April 2021 and March 2024.",
      "Nomadic herders are among the most vulnerable people fleeing. They are often ethnic Fulani, Muslims who have faced accusations of sympathizing with or being recruited by armed groups. Many reject those claims and point out they're targeted by the fighters, too.",
      "\u201cThere is no Fulani without his cattle, that is his identity,\u201d Amadou Sonde, secretary general of the Federation of Burkinab\u00e8 Fulani Associations in Ivory Coast, told the AP.",

      "\u201cWith the insecurity surrounding livestock and tensions between farmers and herders, there has been a trend among Fulani herd owners to switch to land acquisition, real estate or shops,\u201d said Yao Kouam\u00e9, a research professor in sociology at Ivory Coast\u2019s University of Bouak\u00e8.",

      "Authorities in Belgium made the arrests on Tuesday after raiding the offices of the EU diplomatic service in Brussels, and a college in Bruges. Federica Mogherini led the EU foreign service from 2014 to 2019, and now serves as the rector of the College of Europe, a prestigious institute of European studies.",
      "The EPPO said in a statement that Mogherini and a senior staff member of the College of Europe were detained at its request, as well as a senior official from the European Commission.",
      "\u201cAfter being questioned by the Belgian Federal Judicial Police, the three individuals were formally notified of the accusations against them,\u201d the EPPO said. \u201cThe accusations concern procurement fraud and corruption, conflict of interest and violation of professional secrecy. They were released, as they are not considered a flight risk.\u201d",
      "The European External Action Service (EEAS) is the EU\u2019s equivalent of a foreign office. As the bloc\u2019s top diplomat, Mogherini was responsible for supervising the Iran nuclear talks, leading efforts to improve long-strained relations between Serbia and Kosovo, and a host of other foreign policy and security issues.",
      "Police searched the properties of the suspects, several buildings of the College of Europe and the EEAS headquarters that sits at the center of the 27-nation bloc\u2019s institutions in Brussels, the EPPO said.",
      "No outside actor, or country, has been named so far in the investigation.",

      "American zoologist Laurie Marker has been collecting and storing specimens in a cheetah sperm bank in Namibia for 35 years, hoping conservationists never have to use them",
      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- For 35 years, American zoologist Laurie Marker has been collecting and storing specimens in a cheetah sperm bank in Namibia, hoping conservationists never have to use them.",
      "But she worries that the world's fastest land animal might be on the brink of extinction one day and need artificial reproduction to save it.",
      "Marker says the sperm bank at the Cheetah Conservation Fund she founded in the southern African nation is a \u201cfrozen zoo\u201d of cheetahs she's been building since 1990. It would be utilized in a worst-case scenario for the big cats, whose numbers have dropped alarmingly in the wild over the last 50 years.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t do anything with it unless until it\u2019s needed,\u201d Marker, one of the foremost experts on cheetahs, told The Associated Press from her research center near the Namibian city of Otjiwarongo. \u201cAnd we never want to get to that point.\u201d",
      "Conservationists mark World Cheetah Day on Thursday with less than 7,000 of them left in the wild, similar numbers to the critically endangered black rhino. There are only around 33 populations of cheetahs spread out in pockets mainly across Africa, with most of those populations having less than 100 animals, Marker said.",
      "Like so many species, the sleek cats that can run at speeds of 70 miles per hour (112 kilometers per hour) are in danger from habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict and the illegal animal trade. Their shrinking, isolated groups mean their gene pool is shrinking also as small populations continuously breed among themselves, with repercussions for their reproduction rates.",
      "Globally, cheetah numbers in the wild have dropped by 80% in the last half-century and they\u2019ve been pushed out of 90% of their historical range.",
      "Scientists believe that cheetahs already narrowly escaped extinction at the end of the last ice age around 10,000-12,000 years ago, which first reduced their gene pool.",
      "Marker said the lack of genetic diversity, along with the fact that cheetahs have 70-80% abnormal sperm, mean they might need help in the future.",
      "\u201cAnd so, a sperm bank makes perfect sense, right?\u201d Marker said.",
      "Storing sperm is not unique to cheetahs in the wildlife world. It's a tactic that conservationists have developed for other species, including elephants, rhinos, antelopes, other big cats, birds and others.",

      "Other efforts around artificial reproduction have been successful, including a project that bred black-footed ferrets using artificial reproduction after they'd been reduced to a single wild population in Wyoming in the United States.",
      "Marker doesn't chase down cheetahs to collect their sperm but takes samples opportunistically. In Namibia, cheetahs are mostly in danger from farmers who view them as threats to their livestock, meaning Marker's team are called out for cats that have been injured or captured and will collect samples while treating and releasing them.",
      "Sperm samples can also be taken from dead cheetahs. \u201cEvery cheetah is actually a unique mix of a very small number of genes. We will try to bank every animal we possibly can,\" Marker said.",
      "The samples from approximately 400 cheetahs and counting are now stored at ultralow temperatures in liquid nitrogen at the Cheetah Conservation Fund laboratory. Marker's research does not involve any artificial insemination as breeding wild animals in captivity is not allowed in Namibia.",
      "Should cheetahs be threatened with extinction again, the first backup would be the roughly 1,800 cats living in zoos and other captive environments. But, Marker said, cheetahs don't breed well in captivity and the sperm bank might be, like the northern white rhinos, the last resort.",

      "President Donald Trump is expected to announce a proposal to weaken vehicle mileage rules for the auto industry",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump is expected to announce a proposal Wednesday to weaken vehicle mileage rules for the auto industry, loosening regulatory pressure on automakers to control pollution from gasoline-powered cars and trucks, according to several people familiar with the White House plans.",
      "The proposal would significantly reduce fuel economy requirements, which set rules on how far new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline, through the 2031 model year, according to a White House official and several people familiar with the plan. They were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly because the proposal has not been announced and spoke on condition of anonymity. Further details were not immediately available.",
      "The move would be the latest action by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles. Burning gasoline for vehicles is a major contributor to planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. The Republican administration says the new rules would increase Americans' access to the full range of gasoline vehicles they need and can afford.",
      "Trump is set to announce the plan at a White House event that is expected to include top executives from the three largest U.S. automakers, who have praised the planned changes. Since taking office in January, Trump has relaxed auto tailpipe emissions rules, repealed fines for automakers that do not meet federal mileage standards and terminated consumer credits of up to $7,500 for EV purchases.",
      "Ford CEO Jim Farley said in a statement Wednesday that the planned rollback was \u201ca win for customers and common sense.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs America\u2019s largest auto producer, we appreciate President Trump\u2019s leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities. We can make real progress on carbon emissions and energy efficiency while still giving customers choice and affordability,\u201d Farley said.",
      "Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said the automaker appreciates the administration\u2019s actions to \u201crealign\u201d the standards.",
      "Environmentalists decried the decision.",
      "\u201cIn one stroke Trump is worsening three of our nation\u2019s most vexing problems: the thirst for oil, high gas pump costs and global warming,\u201d said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign for the Center for Biological Diversity.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s action will feed America\u2019s destructive use of oil, while hamstringing us in the green tech race against Chinese and other foreign carmakers,\u201d Becker said.",
      "Trump has repeatedly pledged to end what he falsely calls an EV \u201cmandate,\u201d referring incorrectly to Democratic President Joe Biden\u2019s target that half of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2030. EVs accounted for about 8% of new vehicle sales in the United States in 2024, according to Cox Automotive.",

In June, he said that standards set under Biden were illegal because they included use of electric vehicles in their calculation. EVs do not run on gasoline. After the June rule revision, the traffic safety agency was empowered to update the requirements.",
      "Under Biden, automakers were required to average about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon of gas for passenger cars by 2031, compared with about 39 miles (63 kilometers) per gallon today.",
      "The Biden administration also increased fuel-economy requirements by 2% each year for light-duty vehicles in every model year from 2027 to 2031, and 2% per year for SUVs and other light trucks from 2029 to 2031. At the same time, it called for stringent tailpipe rules meant to encourage EV adoption.",

      "Thailand has lifted a 53-year-old ban on the afternoon retail sale of alcoholic drinks",
      "BANGKOK -- BANGKOK (AP) \u2014 Thailand on Wednesday lifted a 53-year-old ban on the afternoon retail sale of alcoholic drinks, a move expected to help boost year-end holiday tourism, as well as business at venues such as bars and convenience stores.",
      "The ban from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. will be lifted on a trial basis for 180 days, after which its effects will be evaluated.",
      "An afternoon ban on selling beer, spirits and wine was enacted in 1972, when Thailand was under military rule, though the original reasons for the measure are now obscure. Thailand is predominantly Buddhist and the religion discourages imbibing intoxicating substances, though drinking is common.",
      "Consumers are now allowed to buy such beverages from 11 a.m. until midnight, according to an amendment of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act made official on Tuesday by its publication in the Royal Gazette. While sales end at midnight, customers at nightlife venues are allowed to keep drinking until 1 a.m.",

      "After riding the artificial intelligence craze to new heights, business software maker Salesforce has been pummeled by a wave of investor skepticism that\u2019s intensified the pressure on its persuasive CEO Marc Benioff to reverse the tide",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- After riding the artificial intelligence craze to new heights, business software maker Salesforce has been pummeled by a wave of investor skepticism that\u2019s intensified the pressure on its persuasive CEO Marc Benioff to reverse the tide.",
      "Benioff, who helped spearhead the transition to cloud computing after founding Salesforce in 1999, got a chance to try to change the AI narrative late Wednesday with the release of his company\u2019s latest quarterly results.",
      "The key numbers covering the August-October eclipsed the analyst projections that help steer the stock market, providing Benioff with some material to support his contention that Salesforce\u2019s big bets on AI will yield a jackpot. The San Francisco-based company earned $2.1 billion, or $2.19 per share, a 37% increase from the same time last year while revenue rose 9% to nearly $10.9 billion. Salesforce also provided an outlook for the current quarter ending in January that exceeded analysts' predictions.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re uniquely positioned for this new era,\u201d Benioff boasted during a 25-minute address on an analyst conference call that sometimes sounded like an AI sermon that also featured comments about \u201cwow\u201d moments that customers experience when seeing the company's technology.",
      "Salesforce\u2019s shares initially surged by more than 5% after the results came out, but backtracked to a gain of 2% following Benioff's presentation.",
      "It's unclear if that modest momentum will be sustained in Thursday's regular trading session because making more money than analysts anticipated isn\u2019t necessarily enough to keep propelling a technology stock amid persisting doubts about whether the hundreds of billions of dollars being poured into the much-hyped technology will pay off.",
      "Nvidia, the dominant maker of the chips needed to power AI, put a dent in the wall of worry a couple weeks ago with a quarterly earnings report that soared far beyond analyst estimates and initially eased fears about a Big Tech bubble bursting.",
      "But the tranquility quickly evaporated, leaving Nvidia\u2019s stock price slightly below where it was trading before the company\u2019s stellar earnings report and 15% below its peak price reached in late October when the chipmaker became the first company to be valued at $5 trillion.",
      "The AI jitters have punished Salesforce even more severely. Before the earnings report was released, Salesforce's market value had plunged by 35%, wiping out about $125 billion in shareholder wealth, since Salesforce\u2019s stock price peaked at $369 a year ago.",
      "The downturn has happened even as Benioff has been doing his best to highlight AI's potential benefits while calling upon the flair for salesmanship that he developed while become the become a chief evangelist behind the rise of software subscription services amid the ruins of the dot-com bust a quarter century ago.",
      "Benioff, who owns Time magazine in addition to his Salesforce job, also is among the Big Tech leaders who have forged ties with President Donald Trump this year while trying to persuade the administration to adopt AI-friendly policies to protect U.S. interests as China also works feverishly on the technology.",

      "But the corporate customers that buy Salesforce\u2019s services haven't been embracing AI agents as quickly as investors initially thought, turning the company into a \u201cposter child\u201d for the doubts hanging over the technology, said Jay Woods, chief market strategist for investment banking firm Freedom Capital Markets.",
      "The second-guessing hasn\u2019t dimmed Benioff\u2019s AI exuberance \u2013 a passion that recently displayed in a resounding endorsement of Google\u2019s latest version of the Gemini technology powering its AI suite.",
      "\u201cWe all know that the speed of innovation has exceeded the speed of customer adoption,\u201d Benioff conceded while confidently predicting that dynamic is about to change dramatically as more companies and government agencies build AI services into their operations.",
      "Salesforce is projecting $60 billion in revenue for its fiscal year ending in January 2030 \u2013 a target that would require average annual increases of 10% from its forecasted sales of $41.5 billion for its current fiscal year. The company also just completed an $8 billion acquisition of another software maker, Informatica, that is building AI tools to manage corporate data.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to execute on the path to our $60 billion dream\u201d Benioff said.",

      "NEW YORK -- Macy\u2019s posted a surprise third-quarter profit and its strongest comparable sales in more than three years as an extensive overhaul of the 167-year-old New York department store begins to resonate with shoppers.",
      "After posting its back-to-back quarterly jumps in comparable sales Wednesday, Macy\u2019s raised its financial guidance for the year. However, even the elevated sales guidance issued Wednesday was below last year's annual sales numbers, sending a note of caution about the mood of the American consumer.",
      "Macy's said that the guidance reflects a customer that is being more selective in what they buy as the holidays approach.",
      "Shares slid 4% before the opening bell.",
      "Comparable sales, a good barometer of a retailer\u2019s health, have been an ominous sign at Macy\u2019s for several years now, serving each quarter as a reminder that the storied department store chain had a long way to go.",

      "Macy\u2019s strong performance is notable because all retailers are navigating a challenging environment with consumers pulling back as prices rise amid a U.S. initiated trade war. Yet, shoppers have remained resilient and delivered a strong start to the holiday shopping season that kicked off over the Thanksgiving weekend.",

      "NEW YORK -- The end of 2025 is almost upon us. And it's time to unpack Spotify Wrapped.",
      "On Wednesday, the music streaming giant delivered its annual recap \u2014 giving its hundreds of millions of users worldwide a look at the top songs, artists, podcasts and other audio that filled their ears over the past year (give or take a month and some change).",
      "Spotify isn't the only platform \u2014 or music streamer \u2014 to roll out a yearly glimpse of data collected from consumers' online lives. But since its launch about a decade ago, Wrapped has become one of the most anticipated. And Spotify is billing the 2025 edition to be its biggest yet, with a host of new features it hopes may address some disappointments users had last year.",
      "So, what goes into pulling together Wrapped, and what's new this year? Here's what to know.",
      "To compile Wrapped, Spotify collects listening data from Jan. 1 through around mid-November.",
      "That gives the company time to solidify finishing touches and deliver its recap to users by early December. But it also means your late November and December streaming habits won't be included, which may be why your favorite holiday songs aren't on the list, or other year-end hits.",
      "For top songs, artists and \u2014 for the first time this year \u2014 albums to show up on Spotify Wrapped, the platform looks at a mix of what you stream and how long you listen for.",
      "According to Spotify, users must listen to at least 30 tracks for over 30 seconds each to get top songs. For artists, users need to listen to at least five unique artists for over 30 seconds. And for top album, users need to have listened to at least 70% of the tracks on one album.",
      "The company confirmed that data is collected evenly across all platforms \u2014 and that streaming in \u201coffline\u201d mode will also be counted, as long as the device connects back to the internet a few weeks before Wrapped's launch. Listening using Spotify's \u201cprivate mode\u201d features, meanwhile, won't contribute to any rankings, but will still count toward total time spent on the platform. And Spotify says \u201cbackground sounds,\" like white noise, are filtered out.",
      "Marc Hazan, senior vice president of marketing and partnerships at Spotify, said his team started thinking about 2025 Wrapped the day last year's recap was launched.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a full year production that touches, without question, every function within Spotify,\u201d Hazan told The Associated Press. On day one, he noted, that includes looking at what users think of the Wrapped that just dropped.",
      "Many Spotify subscribers were quick to share disappointments about 2024's recap \u2014 with some complaining that Wrapped was too minimalist last year. Others took to social media with memes mocking features that didn't seem to hit the mark.",
      "The look and feel of Wrapped evolves each year, and Hazan notes the development of the 2025 edition was largely driven by last year's feedback.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019ve really taken the feedback to heart \u2014 and fueled what we think is the freshest, most action-packed Wrapped experience we\u2019ve ever done,\u201d he added.",
      "That includes returning music genres, which were missing in 2024\u2019s Wrapped. The platform is also introducing top albums and audiobooks, as well as playcounts for each song that makes your annual playlist. And the experience is more gamified this year. There's a prompt for users to guess their top song before it's revealed and a \u201clistening age\u201d \u2014 which takes a stab at guessing how old your music taste is, based on when your favorite tunes were released.",
      "Spotify has also unveiled \u201cWrapped Party,\u201d a feature that allows users to compare their listening habits with friends who also use the app \u2014 and win their own award-like titles within the group.",
      "Among other backlashes Spotify received last year was speculation over how much artificial intelligence played a role in compiling Wrapped.",
      "The most visible use of AI in Spotify's 2024 Wrapped was an accompanying podcast powered by generative AI. Spotify didn't repeat the podcast this year but is introducing another feature, Archive, which uses a large language model to break down your listening on specific days.",
      "That's the most AI-focused part of 2025's Wrapped, Hazan said. But the technology is still more broadly supplemented across Spotify's technical operations today, including in scaling the reach of its annual recap.",
      "\u201cRooted into Wrapped is human creativity,\u201d Hazan said, stressing that hundreds of people work on pulling together the recap each year. Technology like AI, he noted, helps \u201cfast track\u201d and \u201cenhance\u201d the product so it can reach the platform's more than 700 million users.",
      "Spotify is far from the only company to track what users do on its platform \u2014 and feed back some of that data, with a nostalgic twist, at the end of the year.",
      "Streaming rival Apple Music rolled out its annual \u201cReplay\u201d on Tuesday. And YouTube this week unveiled its new \u201cRecap,\u201d which similarly breaks down its listeners' music habits. Social media platforms, Google search and even dictionaries also offer their own year-end reflections.",
      "These recaps may signal more transparency for users, because they can see some data in their hands. And products like Wrapped have become particularly popular because they're personalized and now designed to share online \u2014 leaving many to look forward to it as an \u201cannual ritual\u201d of sorts, notes Yakov Bart, a marketing professor at Northeastern University.",
      "Still, one concern is the normalization of now-constant \u201ctracking of digital footprints that consumers leave online,\u201d he added.",
      "\u201cWhat Spotify Wrapped is able to do is essentially package this tracked data into the form of entertainment,\u201d Bart said. \u201cIt reframes all this digital tracking that's constantly happening behind the scenes into something that\u2019s fun \u2026 And so, instead of kind of feeling under surveillance, users (are) basically feeling seen.\u201d",

      "Airports impacted by the flight restrictions during the shutdown included large hubs in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Atlanta.

      "Von der Leyen said that using the frozen assets would strengthen the Ukrainian position at peace negotiations with Russia and the U.S. but it would also send a message to Moscow that \u201cthe prolongation of the war on their side comes with a high cost for them.\u201d She said that she had informed the Trump administration about the proposal.",
      "EU leaders have committed to fund Ukraine over the next two years, whatever the method. The EU has already poured in over 170 billion euros ($197 billion) since the war started in 2022.",
      "Von der Leyen said that if the loan plan didn't pass muster, the bloc could borrow the money on international markets in a scheme underpinned by its long-term budget. The problem here, though, is that it would require the approval of all 27 member countries, and Hungary has consistently blocked aid to Ukraine.",
      "The biggest pot of ready funds available is through frozen Russian assets. Most of the money is held in Belgium \u2013 around 194 billion euros as of June \u2013 and outside the EU in Japan, with around $50 billion, and the U.S., U.K. and Canada with lesser amounts. A total of 210 billion euros worth ($245 billion) are held in Europe.",

      "\u201cI would be very cautious about blaming bamboo itself before the full investigation reports are published,\u201d said Kristof Crolla, an associate professor of architecture at the University of Hong Kong whose focus includes bamboo architecture.",
      "As a natural material, bamboo can be combustible, Crolla said. But \u201cwhen it is properly used and combined with certified fire-retardant netting it is comparatively hard to ignite.\u201d",
      "During the fire, flames shot up the bamboo scaffolding erected for external maintenance work,-as well as the green netting draping it. But bamboo is usually not \u201ceasily ignited,\" said Raffaella Endrizzi, an architect who researches bamboo scaffolding who teaches at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. \u201cFocusing on bamboo alone risks obscuring more systemic safety issues,\u201d she said.",
      "Last week, as firefighters battled the deadly inferno for a second day, the city\u2019s chief secretary for administration, Eric Chan, told reporters that bamboo scaffolding's fire resistance was \u201cinferior\u201d to that of metal scaffolding.",
      "The city's top leader, John Lee, said officials had met with construction industry representatives to discuss timelines for switching to metal scaffolding. Metal should be used for safety reasons when possible, Chan said.",
      "The initial cause of the fire is under investigation. So far, experts have found that some of the green netting wrapped around the bamboo scaffolding was substandard and that flammable foam boards were used to seal windows during the months' long renovations. Those were the main factors causing the fire to spread to seven of the eight buildings in the Wang Fuk Court complex, said Secretary for Security Chris Tang.",
      "One note in Chinese left among a mountain of bouquets placed near the disaster site stood out: \u201cit\u2019s not the bamboo scaffolding that should be reviewed, but the whole system.\" Many others have posted similar comments on social media.",
      "Putting the blame on bamboo scaffolding is a \u201clazy, scapegoating\u201d move that distracts from deeper issues, Regina Ip, a former Hong Kong secretary for security who is an adviser to the chief executive, Lee, wrote Tuesday in the local newspaper Ming Pao.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s light, fast, adaptable, and supported by generations of skilled scaffolders -- qualities that have shaped the city\u2019s skyline and construction pace,\u201d said Endrizzi, of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.",

    "story": [
      "Compact SUVs have become an extremely popular choice for folks who need a vehicle that can do it all without compromising everyday usability",
      "A small SUV is a great choice if you want a vehicle that is practical, comfortable and versatile enough to handle anything from daily driving to multi-day road trips. Available all-wheel drive, good mpg and starting prices in the low $30,000s are other big draws. But what to get? Well, two of the most popular picks are the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4.",
      "While the CR-V has been among Edmunds\u2019 top recommendations in recent years, Toyota has fully redesigned the RAV4 for 2026 with updates that enhance its style, technology and value. Is it enough to overtake its longstanding rival? Edmunds\u2019 experts compare the two to find out.",
      "Take a drive in the CR-V and you\u2019ll be able to tell that Honda has put in a lot of effort to get it right. The controls have a solid feel and are easy to use, and the front seats are comfortable and supportive. In back, the rear doors swing out wide to improve accessibility for passengers with limited mobility and make it easier to install or remove child safety seats.",
      "The RAV4 is also a model for thoughtful design. We are particularly impressed with its clever storage spots, such as a center console with a lid that can be flipped over and used as an impromptu lunch tray. The RAV4 also feels spacious inside, offering ample headroom and legroom for both front and rear passengers, as well as a generous cargo area that yields a flat load floor when the rear seats are folded down. But while the RAV4\u2019s new cabin is a significant step forward from its predecessor, it\u2019s still not quite as pleasant to spend time in as the CR-V\u2019s.",
      "Winner: Honda CR-V",
      "The RAV4 gets an improved touchscreen infotainment system for 2026. A 10.5-inch display is standard for most models, while upper trim levels like the Limited and XSE receive an even larger 12.9-inch display. Either way, you get a thoroughly overhauled interface that has a more intuitive layout and quicker responses to inputs. Wireless connectivity for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration is standard across all trim levels. The 2026 RAV4 is also the first vehicle in its class to offer an integrated dashcam recorder, and it\u2019s standard across all trim levels too.",
      "The Honda CR-V has some new tech tricks up its sleeve for 2026 as well. Every CR-V now comes with a 9-inch touchscreen that features integrated Google services, including Google Maps and the voice-activated Google Assistant. However, the 9-inch touchscreen is noticeably smaller than the standard display in the RAV4, and only the CR-V\u2019s top trim, the Sport Touring, comes with the Google features.",
      "Winner: Toyota RAV4",
      "The CR-V proves that practicality and fun don\u2019t have to be mutually exclusive. It feels surprisingly athletic when hustled through corners, and Honda managed to accomplish this without compromising ride quality. In general, you\u2019ll feel more confident in the CR-V should you need to take a turn quickly or make an emergency swerve on the highway.",
      "The RAV4 counters with its own advantages. It\u2019s a bit quicker than the CR-V, needing 7.5 seconds to get to 60 mph in Edmunds\u2019 testing versus the CR-V\u2019s 8 seconds. It also wins on fuel economy. All RAV4s feature a hybrid powertrain for 2026 that gets up to a Toyota-estimated 44 mpg combined. That\u2019s excellent for a small SUV.",
      "You can get a hybrid powertrain for the CR-V, but only for the more expensive trim levels. Its EPA estimate of up to 40 mpg combined isn\u2019t quite as good as the RAV4\u2019s, and Edmunds has often found that it\u2019s easier in the RAV4 to match the EPA\u2019s estimates in real-world driving. Toyota also offers a plug-in hybrid of the RAV4 to further help you save on gas, something Honda can\u2019t match.",

But remember that the RAV4 comes standard with a hybrid powertrain. Hybrid availability starts in the middle of the CR-V\u2019s trim level lineup. As such, the least expensive hybrid CR-V starts at $37,080. Fully loaded, both the CR-V and the RAV4 will cost you approximately $44,000. Otherwise, you\u2019re getting a similar level of comfort, technology and safety-related features with both SUVs.",
      "Winner: Toyota RAV4",
      "The 2026 Toyota RAV4 and 2026 Honda CR-V are both top contenders in their class, but the revamped RAV4\u2019s combination of strong value, more sophisticated technology and better efficiency give it the edge in this comparison.",

      "Cooper Flagg didn't wilt in the month the Dallas Mavericks were without injured forward Anthony Davis",
      "DALLAS -- Cooper Flagg followed Anthony Davis' bank shot with a jumper of his own, then blocked a jump hook from Anthony Wiggins at the other end before scoring a contested layup on an assist from Davis.",
      "Just like that, the rookie No. 1 overall pick and the 10-time All-Star combined to seal Dallas' 118-108 victory over the Miami Heat on Wednesday night, extending the first winning streak of the season for the Mavericks to three games.",
      "Flagg knew his NBA career would start without help on the court from star guard Kyrie Irving, who is recovering from an ACL tear last March. The 18-year-old former Duke standout also had to persevere for a month without Davis, who was sidelined with a left calf strain.",
      "A loss in Davis' return at the Los Angeles Lakers last week dropped the Mavericks to 5-15, but they won a night later without him before consecutive victories over Denver and the Heat, two teams that should be playoff contenders.",
      "\u201cWhen you talk about the stars, he didn\u2019t have the two stars on the floor, so he had to endure the best wing defender, and I thought he did an incredible job,\" coach Jason Kidd said. \u201cWhen you look at the clutch situations, he responded in a positive way. For an 18-year-old to be leaned on without AD or Kai out there, I thought he responded in a positive way.\u201d",
      "While Davis was out, Flagg found himself in the company of LeBron James a couple of times.",
      "In a 118-115 victory over New Orleans last month, Flagg had 29 points, seven rebounds and five assists. James is the only other player with at least 25 points, five rebounds and five assists in a game as an 18-year-old.",
      "With Davis resting on the second night of a back-to-back in a 114-110 victory at the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday, Flagg became the youngest player in NBA history to score 35 points. He and James are the only 18-year-olds with 30-point games.",
      "\u201cI think I learned a lot throughout that period, and as a team I think we learned a lot as well,\u201d Flagg said. \u201cObviously it wasn\u2019t the start we were looking for or hoping to have, but I think it\u2019ll give us a lot of gratitude moving forward. If we can find success and we can think back to a really rocky start, I think I grew a lot in that time period as well.\u201d",
      "Flagg was 9 of 13 from the field and led Dallas with 22 points against the Heat, and is shooting 57% in the four games since Davis returned. They did get five games together to start the season, but Flagg wasn't quite as assertive then.",
      "Four-time champion and 13-year veteran Klay Thompson has come out of a shooting slump recently, which also has helped ease the burden on Flagg.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s so much better for us when he\u2019s out there,\u201d Flagg said about Davis. \u201cI think just between him and Klay on the court at the same time, the amount of gravity that those two guys have of just pulling defenses toward them and just creating space out there, it\u2019s huge for me.\u201d",
      "It's far from a guarantee that Davis can stay healthy, with him missing more games than he has played since the oft-injured forward was acquired in the much-criticized trade that sent superstar Luka Doncic to the Lakers last February.",
      "If Davis stays on the court, Flagg will have part of the formula the Mavs envisioned with title-winning vets easing his transition to the NBA after he essentially turned pro a year earlier than other one-and-done college stars. And that's not even including Irving, who presumably could return sometime after Jan. 1.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to put your best defender on someone and so most of the time that\u2019s AD,\u201d Kidd said. \u201cSo he gets the secondary defender and for him, it\u2019s his ability to get to the paint, but also to be able to play off AD, where he doesn\u2019t have to do everything like he did here early on, where we were asking him to be the point guard, score, defend, do everything, which he\u2019s not afraid of doing, but now he has some help.\u201d",
      "Davis illustrated it by combining with Flagg to score the final eight Dallas points to stop a Miami rally close out the Heat.",

      "AI-powered shopping assistants have become a staple in online retail, making shopping easier and more convenient",
      "Shopping assistant chatbots were a novelty a year ago. Now, they\u2019re everywhere.",
      "After rolling out AI-powered assistants, online retailers and tech companies have been adding more artificial intelligence features to make online shopping easier and more convenient.",
      "The latest crop of AI-powered shopping services and tools made their debut in recent weeks, just in time to kick off the holiday shopping season that begins with Black Friday.",
      "Here\u2019s a rundown of existing and newly released AI services that can help with your search for the perfect gift in the run-up to Christmas:",
      "Amazon led the way by rolling out its Rufus chatbot in 2024. Other ecommerce websites followed with their own AI assistants to enhance the online shopping experience.",
      "Walmart's Sparky chatbot is available on the retail giant\u2019s app and can synthesize reviews or offer product recommendations based on occasions, such as Christmas. Target recently unveiled a gift finder chatbot on its app, but it's only available for the holiday season. Ralph Lauren partnered with Microsoft on the \u201cAsk Ralph\u201d chatbot to provide style recommendations.",
      "The aim of deploying chatbots is to make it easier for people to find what they\u2019re looking for. Instead of entering search terms and keywords, you can type or use voice dictation for a conversational back-and-forth.",
      "The results, in my experience, can be mixed.",
      "I tried Rufus recently to find a replacement aftermarket stainless steel pot for my rice cooker, as well as a protective trivet for my kitchen sink faucet. In both cases, the results weren\u2019t quite right and didn\u2019t seem to capture the wide range of products available. Sometimes the results were completely unsuitable.",
      "I ended up doing a more painstaking search of product listings\u2019 pictures and specifications to find the right items. The problem, I suspect, is partly because I was looking for generic products. Searches for name-brand products may produce better results.",
      "Perhaps you don\u2019t want to limit yourself to a single retailer\u2019s website in your Christmas shopping search. Or you\u2019re not sure where exactly to find that perfect gift.",
      "Tech platforms have rolled out AI-powered shopping tools that can cast a wider net by searching multiple sites.",
      "OpenAI added a new \u201cshopping research\u201d feature to ChatGPT last week that can provide personalized buying advice for products that are heavy on detailed specs, like electronics or appliances. The feature will activate if you ask ChatGPT a shopping-related question or manually turn it on in the chat window. OpenAI says it can go beyond simple questions, such as checking a price or feature that regular ChatGPT can easily answer.",
      "Google users can get a similar experience when they use its search engine in AI Mode, which recently got a big update for shopping searches. The company says users can describe what they\u2019re looking for as if talking to a friend and get an \u201cintelligently organized response\u201d based on 50 billion product listings, with pictures alongside prices, reviews and inventory info.",
      "Google added similar shopping features to its Gemini AI chatbot app for U.S. users last month.",
      "Meanwhile, Perplexity unveiled its own shopping assistant feature last week that can tailor recommendations based on previous searches.",
      "I asked all three to find a soft cotton flannel shirt. Both ChatGPT and Perplexity asked me for specific requirements, such as budget and must-have features. ChatGPT's response was the most detailed, with options from six brands including its top pick, and included pictures, prices and point-form summaries for each shirt. It also compiled the results into a comparison table.",

The feature was in test mode but is being rolled out more widely.",
      "Prefer to buy in person? It's a good idea to make sure a bricks-and-mortar shop has the product you want before heading over. Google has launched an AI service that will call local stores to ask.",

      "The Grammy-winning rapper \u2014 in front of more than 133 million people \u2014 chose to perform on a massive, industrialized grid of flashing lights resembling a giant PlayStation controller.",
      "It was a nice surprise present for Sony's PlayStation, which this year is celebrating its 30th anniversary in North America and Europe. Lamar's nod to the console \u2014 which Sony had nothing to do with \u2014 was another sign of how far the brand has penetrated the culture, in ways big and small.",
      "From big-budget Hollywood fare like \u201cLara Croft: Tomb Raider\u201d starring Angelina Jolie, to Juice WRLD's video for \u201cHear Me Calling\u201d to \u201cThe Last of Us\u201d on HBO Max, the PlayStation experience has leapt far past the console. Chandler Bing on \u201cFriends\u201d played a PlayStation 1 and the title character fired at PlayStation zombies in the cult movie \u201cShaun of the Dead.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe made gaming cool. When we came out we were a little edgy, we were a different, but it was really about being disruptive,\u201d says Eric Lempel, senior vice president for marketing, sales and business operations at Sony Interactive Entertainment. \u201cWe feel we are a premier entertainment brand, not just a gaming brand.\u201d",
      "Part of the enduring popularity of the PlayStation has been its ability to evolve with the technology, starting in 1995 by picking CD-ROMs that opened the door to 3D gaming. At the time, clunky cartridges were king.",
      "The PlayStation \u2014 sparked by a failed partnership between Nintendo and Sony \u2014 entered a marketplace dominated by Sega and Nintendo. Sony wanted to bring the arcade experience home and a crucial decision was to consult with game developers first, before building their system.",
      "\u201cSony realized they needed developers in place from the get-go before they even started designing it,\u201d says Anthony Caulfield, who with his wife, Nicola, run Gracious Films and made the independent documentary \u201cThe PlayStation Revolution.\u201d",
      "\u201cHardware manufacturers up to that point basically didn\u2019t care what the developers wanted. They just made what they thought was the best piece of hardware,\u201d he says.",
      "Some critical steps helped right from the launch. Sony had a number of games ready to go, a development pipeline in place and a killer retail price \u2014 $299 \u2014 that was less expensive than the rival Sega Saturn.",
      "Sony also picked its market carefully, Caulfield says. With Sega and Nintendo largely targeting children, Sony aimed the PlayStation at teens and young adults \u2014 catnip for their younger brothers and sisters.",
      "\u201cIf you grew up loving Nintendo games, the PlayStation was like a really good next step,\u201d says Tyler Treese, the editor-in-chief of PlayStation LifeStyle, an online forum and news site for fans.",
      "When the console first arrived, it was a sensation, going on to sell more than 100 million units globally. \u201cIt\u2019s when games grew up,\u201d says Caulfield. \u201cIt\u2019s where the gaming went from the bedroom to the living room.\u201d",
      "Sony kept up with the technology, packing a DVD into the PlayStation 2 so that buyers had another reason to buy the system. The PlayStation 2 remains the best selling console of all time, with some 160 million units sold.",

      "Sony hit a wobble with the PS3, which used a Blu-ray deck. \u201cIt made the thing so expensive and it kind of broke that original PlayStation feeling of availability and great value for money,\u201d Caulfield says. The 2011 PlayStation network hack that shut down the network for 24 days didn't help. \u201cIf they got the PS4 wrong it could have been the end.\u201d",

      "\u201cEvery console has to have a purpose, it has to have a reason to exist, and when we find that we have the right amount of new technology that can enable developers to do great things, we push forward,\u201d says Lempel.",

It includes: \u201cUncharted\u201d starring Tom Holland on the big screen, \u201cThe Last of Us\u201d with Pedro Pascal on HBO, \u201cTwisted Metal\u201d on Peacock and \u201cGran Turismo\u201d with Orlando Bloom from Columbia Pictures.",

      "That has even spilled out into fashion \u2014 British Nigerian multidisciplinary artist and designer Yinka Ilori has a line of PlayStation-inspired loungewear \u2014 and footwear, thanks to rapper Travis Scott's Nike Dunk Low Cactus Jack X PlayStation sneakers.",
      "\u201cWe know that we\u2019ve struck a chord that goes just well beyond a consumer product,\u201d says Lempel. \u201cThis is something that people love. It\u2019s a big part of people\u2019s lives and they love to talk about it. They love to express it in different ways.\u201d",
      "Lempel recently got a taste of that expression firsthand. He was at a restaurant in Manhattan when he spotted the PlayStation symbols tattooed on someone\u2019s arm. \u201cThese are permanent markings on someone\u2019s body,\u201d he says in wonder. \u201cThat\u2019s the passion people have.\u201d",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has set off a \u201ccode red\u201d alert to employees to improve its flagship product, ChatGPT, and delay other product developments, according to The Wall Street Journal.",
      "The newspaper reported that Altman sent an internal memo to staff Monday saying more work was needed to enhance the artificial intelligence chatbot's speed, reliability and personalization features.",
      "This week marks three years since OpenAI first released ChatGPT, sparking global fascination and a commercial boom in generative AI technology and giving the San Francisco-based startup an early lead. But the company faces increased competition with rivals, including Google, which last month unleashed Gemini 3, the latest version of its own AI assistant.",
      "OpenAI didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday. Tech news outlet The Information also reported on the memo.",
      "Altman said this fall that ChatGPT now has more than 800 million weekly users. But the company, valued at $500 billion, doesn\u2019t make a profit and has committed more than $1 trillion in financial obligations to the cloud computing providers and chipmakers it relies on to power its AI systems.",

      "A baby and his family dog sit across from each other in a podcast studio.",
      "\u201cWelcome to the talking baby podcast,\u201d says the infant, wearing headphones and sounding like a deep-voiced radio broadcaster. \u201cOn today\u2019s episode, we\u2019ll be talking to the weird-looking person who lives at my house.\u201d",
      "So begins a series of humorous interactions between two characters animated by artificial intelligence that's attracted millions of views on social media. They\u2019re a nod to the 1989 movie \u201cLook Who\u2019s Talking\u201d but produced in a matter of hours and without a multimillion-dollar Hollywood budget.",
      "AI helped do all of that, but it didn't craft the punch lines. It\u2019s a relief to comedian Jon Lajoie, who made the videos, that AI chatbots just aren\u2019t \u201cinherently funny.\u201d",

      "King Willonius is not feeling so cautious. His first big hit was an AI-generated song called \u201cBBL Drizzy\u201d that made fun of rapper Drake during the height of his feud with Kendrick Lamar. He's since moved into making AI video parodies like \u201cI\u2019m McLovin It (Popeye\u2019s Diss Song)\u201d and \u201cI Want My Barrel Back (Cracker Barrel song).\u201d",

      "He starts with writing his own notes on an idea, then refines it with a chatbot, and puts that language \u2014 known as a prompt \u2014 into AI tools that can generate imagery, video, music and voices. The key, he says, is to keep iterating.",

      "\u201cIt does seem fluent in the basic grammar of jokes, but sometimes they\u2019re slightly off,\u201d said Robinson, a professor of American studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \u201cThey may be moderately funny, but I think they\u2019re really missing an important element of what makes us laugh.\u201d",
      "What are they missing? She's not totally sure, except that most good jokes are a little edgy or dangerous and chatbots can't seem to calibrate \u201cwhatever provocation is in the joke to the moment that we\u2019re living in.\u201d",
      "Caleb Warren, a professor who studies marketing and consumer psychology at the University of Arizona, said that leaves comedy writers with an opportunity to make use of tools that can't completely outsource their skills.",

And once the writers' strike happened, that kind of shut that down. I started to learn these AI tools and get really good at them and started to cultivate an audience.\u201d",

Instead, he found it useful to cheaply animate ideas he would otherwise never have pursued \u2014 such as the talking baby, birds wearing jeans, or a podcasting Jesus Christ interviewing an Easter Bunny who\u2019s never heard of him.",
      "The prominent venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz invited Lajoie and Willonius to exhibit their video creations this fall at a new AI gallery space in Manhattan, part of a promotion of AI creativity tool startups that the firm invests in.",
      "Willonius obliged. Lajoie ended up bowing out, after an interview with The Associated Press in which he voiced doubts about what he described as AI's \u201cNapster phase.\u201d The music-sharing website shuttered in the early 2000s after the record industry and rock band Metallica sued over copyright violations.",
      "The investment firm's co-founder, Marc Andreessen, has been bullish about AI's potential to bring new life into filmmaking and comedy. On a November podcast, he blamed Hollywood opposition to its adoption on \u201cwoke activists (who) have picked up AI as the new thing they\u2019re going to agitate about.\u201d He compared it to resistance to computer graphics in movies before they became commonplace.",
      "Lajoie said he shared his early AI video experiments with a few friends who are \u201canti-AI; real, real, anti-AI\u201d and they were surprised by how well the sketches retained Lajoie's own comedic voice.",
      "He insists he's no AI expert, just \u201ca creative person who can figure out how to make two characters talk to each other.\u201d But even editing the sketches requires understanding comedic timing, and he has no interest in ceding that part to a machine.",
      "\u201cThe thing with comedy is it\u2019s so related to performance, delivery and point of view,\u201d Lajoie said. \u201cDo AIs have a point of view? They can grab a few points of view from different people.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd when it does have a point of view, I think that\u2019s when we all should be afraid for all of the reasons that the Terminator has taught us,\u201d he said.",

      "Conservationists are hoping to strengthen regulations at a wildlife trade conference on birds, reptiles and other animals that are seeing their numbers decline due to the exotic pet trade",
      "A growing exotic pet trade has conservationists calling for stronger regulations to protect the reptiles, birds and other animals in the wild that are increasingly showing up for sale on internet marketplaces and becoming popular on social media.",
      "The two-week Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora is scheduled to run through Friday in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. Several proposals related to the pet trade will be considered Tuesday.",
      "Participants have proposed tighter regulations or complete bans on the trade of several species including iguanas from the Galapagos Islands, more than a dozen species of Latin America tarantulas and an odd-looking turtle from Africa.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is the pet trade much more looking at reptiles, amphibians. People want rare species and they don\u2019t have to go into a pet shop,\u201d said Susan Lieberman, vice president for international policy at the nonprofit Wildlife Conservation Society. \u201cThey go online and there are thousands of animals, including endangered species, illegally obtained species, all available on the internet.\u201d",
      "In the past, the trade was dominated by sales in animal parts like elephant ivory and tiger bones. But Matt Collis, the senior director of international policy at the International Fund for Animal Welfare, said live animals for the pet trade are increasingly turning up on the internet.",
      "\u201cThe dramatic growth in online marketplaces has put consumers directly in touch with wildlife traders and criminals around the world,\u201d Collis said. \u201cIn today\u2019s society where pretty much anything can be bought with a click of a button and shipped anywhere in the world in a matter of days, no wildlife is safe.\u201d",
      "Social media influencers, who have made owned exotic pets cool, are also contributing to the problem, Collis said.",
      "Several of the species proposed for greater protection at the CITES conference are in Latin America, where an IFAW report last year found illegal trade is on the rise. The report, covering 18 Spanish speaking Latin American countries, says there were more than 100,000 animals seized or poached from 2017 to 2022, with seizures increasing every year.",
      "The report found the live pet trade accounted for a growing piece of the trade, with reptiles representing about 60% of the animals, while nearly 30% were birds and more than 10% were amphibians. Many animals were traded locally or regionally but there also was evidence of animals shipped to collectors in Europe, Asia and the United States.",
      "More than 90% of the seized wildlife destined for Europe were live animals, confirming the demand for pets was a key driver of the illegal trade, the report said.",
      "Among the reptile species up for tighter trade controls is Home\u2019s Hinged-back Tortoise, a critically endangered turtle found in West Africa that has a unique hinge on its back allowing it to close off its back legs and tail.",
      "There are proposals to regulate the trade in two vipers species endemic to Ethiopia, two species of rattlesnake found mostly in Mexico, the leaf-tailed gecko from Australia and two species of sloths from South America, which are increasingly turning up in sloth-themed cafes in Asia.",
      "A proposal from Ecuador would ban the trade in marine and land iguanas from the Galapagos, which are listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as critically endangered or vulnerable. There are concerns that the illegal trade could further destabilize the population, which already faces threats from invasive species, rising tourism and fluctuations in weather associated with the El Nino.",
      "In its CITES proposal, Ecuador said it doesn't permit commercial export of iguanas and collecting them from the Galapagos has been prohibited for decades. But Ecuador raised concerns that traders are capturing and transporting young iguanas by boat or overland to ports and evading authorities by mislabeling them as captive bred. Most of the iguanas are destined for Japan and other Asia countries and can sell for as much $25,000 on the black market.",

      "\u201cIn theory, under CITES rules, the countries issuing those export permits should be checking that these animals, and crucially their parentage all the way back to the founder stock, were legally acquired in order for an export permit to be granted,\u201d Collis said. \u201cBut that is not happening.\"",
      "Countries issue permits without verifying animal origins, which helps traffickers launder animals from illegal sources, \u201cundermining the very framework meant to protect these species,\u201d he said.",
      "The CITES proposals draw attention to a long-running problem with captive breeding of exotic species, according to Lieberman of the Wildlife Conservation Society.",
      "\u201cWhen the treaty was drafted in the early 1970s, there wasn't a lot of captive breeding and people thought, 'Well, if they\u2019re bred in captivity, it\u2019ll take pressure off the wild,\u201d she said. \u201cSounds good, except it doesn\u2019t work that way. Breeding in captivity also creates a market, but they\u2019re cheaper from the wild. And also it\u2019s a great way to launder.\u201d",
      "A proposal has also been submitted at the convention to regulate the trade in more than a dozen species of tarantulas. Bolivia, Argentina and Panama note they are \u201camong the most heavily traded groups of invertebrates\u201d with more than half all species available online. The proposal would permit the trade in the spiders as long as there is proof the sources are legal, sustainable and traceable.",
      "\u201cSome tarantula species are particularly vulnerable to overexploitation due to their long life span, limited geographic range and low reproductive rate,\u201d according to the proposal. \u201cAlarmingly, most of them are not regulated internationally, despite the high availability of hundreds of species in international trade.\u201d",
      "The United States Association of Reptile Keepers opposes the tarantula listing, which it called \u201cincongruous\u201d for rolling many species into a single proposal.",
      "The association, which advocates for responsible private ownership and trade in reptiles and amphibians, suggested other reptile proposals reflect government overreach, noting the proffered changes to iguana sales are unnecessary since current regulations \u201cprovide adequate protection.\u201d",
      "\u201cMost species have limited trade in captive bred specimens which is not a threat to wild populations,\u201d David Garcia, the organization's legal counsel and its delegate at the CITES conference, said in a statement. \u201cUnfortunately, many countries, groups, and individuals take the nonsensical position that the way to limit threats to wild populations is to make the captive reproduction of those species more difficult.",
      "But a report from the nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity, shared with The Associated Press and due to be released Dec. 8, found that the United States was among the biggest markets for the pet trade, importing on average 90 million live amphibians, arachnids, birds, aquarium fish, mammals and reptiles each year.",
      "\u201cWildlife exploitation, including for the pet trade, is a major driver of the global extinction crisis,\u201d the report said. \u201cOne million species are on track to face extinction in coming decades unless action is taken to address species loss. Addressing the United States\u2019 role in the exotic pet trade must be a top priority to stem this crisis and protect biodiversity for future generations.\u201d",

      "The Ministry of Communications' order issued Monday asked smartphone makers to pre-install the government\u2019s \u201cSanchar Saathi\u201d app on all new devices within 90 days and to prevent users from deleting it. The order also requires manufacturers to push the app onto older models through a software update, extending the mandate beyond phones available in the market.",
      "The ministry said the app, which is available to India\u2019s 1.2 billion smartphone users, was essential in \u201ccurbing misuse of telecom resources for cyber frauds and ensuring telecom cyber security.\u201d But privacy advocates say the order marks an effort to erode user privacy and consent.",

      "A rare confluence of factors makes the Atacama an ideal home for some of the world\u2019s biggest ground-based astronomical projects \u2014 dry climate, high altitude and, crucially, isolation from the light pollution of civilization.",
      "\u201cIt's a perfect cocktail for astronomy,\u201d said Daniela Gonz\u00e1lez, executive director of the Skies of Chile Foundation, a nonprofit that defends the quality of the country\u2019s night skies.",
      "But that may not be the case for much longer, a group of leading scientists warned in an open letter to Chile\u2019s government released Tuesday.",
      "A private company is pressing ahead with plans to construct a giant renewable energy complex in sight of one of Earth\u2019s most productive astronomical facilities \u2014 the Paranal Observatory, operated by an international consortium known as the European Southern Observatory, or ESO.",
      "In the letter, 30 renowned international astronomers, including Reinhard Genzel, a 2020 Nobel laureate in astrophysics who conducted much of his prize-winning research on black holes with the ESO-operated telescopes in the Atacama Desert, describe the project as \u201can imminent threat\u201d to humanity's ability to study the cosmos, and unlock more of its unknowns.",
      "\u201cThe damage would extend beyond Chile\u2019s borders, affecting a worldwide scientific community that relies on observations made at Paranal to study everything from the formation of planets to the early universe,\u201d the letter reads.",
      "\u201cWe are convinced that economic development and scientific progress can and must coexist to the benefit of all people in Chile, but not at the irreversible expense of one of Earth\u2019s unique and irreplaceable windows to the universe.\u201d",
      "The scientists join a chorus of voices that have been urging the Chilean government to relocate the hydrogen-based fuel production plant since the plan was unveiled a year ago by AES Andes, an offshoot of the American-based multinational AES Corp.",
      "In response to a request for comment, AES Corp. said that its own technical studies showed the project would be fully compatible with astronomical observations and compliant with the Chilean government's strict regulations on light pollution.",
      "\"We encourage trust in the country\u2019s institutional strength, which for decades has guaranteed certainty and environmental protection for multiple productive sectors,\" the company said.",

      "That means not only a major increase in light pollution but also new dust, ground vibrations and heightened atmospheric turbulence that blurs stars and makes them twinkle. All of that \u2014 just 3 kilometers (1.9 miles) from the Paranal Observatory\u2019s high-powered telescopes \u2014 will mess the view of key astronomical targets and could obstruct scientific advances, experts say.",
      "\u201cAt the best sites in the world for astronomy, stars don't twinkle. They are very stable, and even the smallest artificial turbulence would destroy these characteristics,\u201d said Andreas Kaufer, the director of operations at ESO, which assesses that the AES project would increase light pollution by 35%.",
      "\u201cIf the sky is becoming brighter from artificial light around us, we cannot do these observations anymore. They're lost. And, since we have the biggest and most sensitive telescopes at the best spot in the world, if they're lost for us, they're lost for everyone.\"",
      "Although this controversy might be specific to Chile, home to 40% of the world\u2019s astronomy infrastructure, the project reflects the wider tension between natural darkness and industrialization tearing at countless countries as light pollution makes the night sky about 10% brighter each year.",
      "\u201cMajor observatories have been chased out to remote locations, and essentially now they\u2019re chased out to some of the last remaining dark sky locations on Earth, like the Atacama Desert, the mountain peaks of Hawaii, areas around Tucson, Arizona,\u201d said Ruskin Hartley, the executive director of DarkSky International, a Tuscon-based nonprofit founded by astronomers.",

Some highly selective schools are adopting AI tools to vet the increasingly curated application packages that some students develop with the help of high-priced admissions consultants.",
      "The California Institute of Technology is launching an AI tool this fall to look for \u201cauthenticity\u201d in students who submit research projects with their applications, admissions director Ashley Pallie said.

      "Major retail chains and tech companies are offering new or updated artificial intelligence tools in time for the holiday shopping season",
      "NEW YORK -- Major retail chains and tech companies are offering new or updated artificial intelligence tools in time for the holiday shopping season, hoping to give consumers an easier gift-buying experience and themselves an augmented share of online spending.",
      "Although AI-powered purchases are in early stages, the shopping assistants and agents rolled out by the likes of Walmart, Amazon and Google can do more than the chatbots of holidays past. The latest versions were designed to provide personalized product recommendations, track prices and to place some orders through unscripted \u201cconversations\u201d with customers.",
      "Those features are on top of shopping updates from AI platforms like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Google Gemini. In one of the season's most talked-about launches, Google this month introduced an AI agent that can be instructed to call local stores to ask if a desired product is in stock.",
      "San Francisco software company Salesforce estimated that AI would influence $73 billion, or 22%, of all global sales in one way or another from the Tuesday before Thanksgiving through Monday after the holiday, according to Caila Schwartz, Salesforce\u2019s director of consumer insights.",
      "The figure, which stood at $60 billion a year ago, encompasses everything from a ChatGPT query to AI-supplied gift suggestions on a retailer\u2019s website, Schwartz said.",
      "Despite the advancements, AI\u2019s impact on holiday shopping will be \u201crelatively limited\u201d this year since not every shopping site has useful tools and not every shopper is willing to try them, said Brad Jashinsky, a senior retail industry analyst at information technology research and consulting firm Gartner.",
      "\u201cThe more retailers that launch these tools, the better they get, and the more that consumers get comfortable and start to seek them out,\u201d Jashinsky said. \"But customer behavior takes a long time to change.\u201d",
      "Here are three ways the technology is poised to influence holiday shopping habits in 2025:",
      "AI's potential to simplify the search for the perfect present is most apparent so far in tools that promise to give shoppers faster and more detailed results than a web browser with a lot fewer clicks.",
      "OpenAI upgraded ChatGPT with a shopping research feature that provides personalized buyers' guides. The information comes from product pages, reviews. prices and a user's previous interactions with the chatbot. The tool works best for complicated products like electronics and appliances, or for \u201cdetail-heavy\u201d items like beauty or sporting goods, OpenAI said.",
      "Then there's Rufus, the shopping assistant that Amazon rolled out last year. It now remembers information customers previously fed it, like having four children that all like board games, for example. A user's browsing and purchase history and reviews are used to personalize recommendations.",
      "Google upgraded its AI Mode search tool to provide answers to detailed questions composed in natural language. For example, users can tell the agent they want to buy a casual sweater to wear with skirt or jeans in New York in January that goes with a skirt or jeans,",
      "Responses are pulled from Google's 50 billion product listings. The tool can also produce charts with side-by-side comparisons of prices, features, reviews and other factors. Previously, shoppers had to use keywords, filters and product links to find the information they needed.",
      "\u201cThis is an expansionary moment, I think, for all of technology and for commerce,\u201d Lilian Rincon, vice president of product, consumer shopping at Google, recently told The Associated Press.",
      "Meanwhile, Walmart\u2019s AI shopping assistant, Sparky, offers occasion-based recommendations and synthesizes reviews. An AI-powered gift finder on Target's app exclusively for the holidays responds to prompts such as the age and special hobbies of the recipient.",
      "Tools for tracking online prices have been around for years, including CamelCamelCamel, a third-party service for Amazon prices, as well as Paypal\u2019s Honey browser extension for monitoring thousands of online shops.",

      "This holiday season, shoppers have new options.",
      "Amazon launched a 90-day pricing history tracker this month for virtually everything it sells. Shoppers also now can set up alerts to receive notifications when prices on specific items fall within their budgets.",
      "Google, which for years had a basic price tracker, launched a more advanced version that lets users refine their requests with details like a garment's size and color. Microsoft's Copilot also launched a price tracker this year.",
      "Jason Goldberg, chief commerce strategy officer at Publicis Groupe, said he thinks the new pricing tools will add more pressure on retailers to make sure their prices are competitive.",
      "\u201cA lot of consumers that weren\u2019t even looking for price alerts are going to discover price alerts for the first time,\u201d Goldberg predicted.",
      "Amazon, OpenAI and Google are racing to create tools that would allow for seamless AI-powered shopping by taking consumers from browsing to buying within the same program instead of having to go to a retailer's website to complete a purchase.",
      "OpenAI launched a new instant checkout feature that lets users buy products suggested by ChatGPT without leaving the app. Users can order merchandise from Etsy sellers and from some brands that use Shopify, including Glossier, Skims and Spanx.",
      "OpenAI and Walmart announced a similar deal in October, saying the partnership would allow ChatGPT members to use the instant checkout feature to shop for nearly everything available on Walmart\u2019s website except for fresh food. For now, however, the feature only supports buying one item at a time.",
      "A different deal Target struck with OpenAI lets shoppers put multiple items in a cart on ChatGPT, including fresh food products. But when customers are ready to pay for their orders, they are directed away from the chatbot to the Target app.",
      "New tools from Amazon and Google will give shoppers a taste of having autonomous AI assistants do the buying for them. While the services still are limited, \u201cagentic AI\u201d is intended to be more independent and advanced than the generative AI chatbots that excel at research and writing, experts say.",
      "Amazon is now letting Rufus automatically purchase items for customers who click an \u201cauto buy\u201d button while setting up price alerts. Once a product's price drops to the desired level, customers receive notice of their completed orders and have a limited window to cancel, the company said.",
      "The e-commerce giant also started allowing shoppers to use Rufus searches for brand-name products on the Amazon app as a gateway to other retailers. If Amazon doesn't carry a desired item in its store, a \u201cShop Direct\u201d button will take them to the website of a place that does.",
      "Google's AI Mode price tracker also includes a \u201cbuy for me\u201d option that automatically makes a customer's purchase through Google Pay when the price is right. The feature is available for products sold by Wayfair, Chewy, Quince and some Shopify merchants, and Google expects to keep adding more stores, the company said. sellers.",
      "Google also expanded its web browser with an automated AI call feature that phones local businesses on behalf of customers looking for information or specific products. Google's program discloses to the store that it's an AI caller, and stores can choose not to participate, the company said.",
      "Google said it's applying the feature initially to specific product categories: toys, health and beauty, and electronics. Target and Walmart declined to comment on whether this type of service would be part of their future plans.",

      "Ukrainians in the southern city of Kherson live in constant fear of Russian drone attacks",
      "KHERSON, Ukraine -- When Olena Horlova leaves home or drives through town outside the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, she fears that she's a target. She believes that Russian drones could be waiting on a rooftop, along the road or aiming for her car.",
      "To protect herself and her two daughters, the girls stay indoors, and she stays alert \u2014 sometimes returning home at night along dark roads without headlights so as not to be seen.",
      "After living through the occupation, refusing to cooperate with Russian forces and hiding from them, Horlova, like so many other residents, found that even after her town was liberated in 2022, the ordeal didn't end.",
      "Kherson was among the first places where Russian forces began using short-range, first-person view, or FPV, drones against civilians. The drones are equipped with livestreaming cameras that let operators see and select their targets in real time. The tactic later spread more than 300 kilometers (185 miles) along the right bank of the Dnipro River, across the Dnipropetrovsk, Kherson and Mykolaiv regions.",
      "The United Nations' Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine says the attacks leave little doubt about their intent. In an October report, the commission said that the attacks have repeatedly killed and wounded civilians, destroyed homes and forced thousands to flee, concluding that they amount to the crimes against humanity of murder and forcible transfer.",
      "\u201cWe live with the hope that one day this will finally end,\u201d Horlova said, her voice trembling. \u201cWhat matters for us is a cease-fire, or for the front line to be pushed further away. Then it would be easier for us.\u201d",
      "Horlova lives in Komyshany, a village just outside Kherson and only 4 kilometers (2\u00bd miles) from the Dnipro River, where the level of intense attacks has remained the same, despite Ukrainian forces retaking the city from Russian occupation in November 2022 \u2014 about nine months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24 of that year.",
      "But the war didn't end there. Instead, it shifted into a phase in which the area has effectively become what locals and the military term a \u201chuman safari,\u201d describing it as a testing ground where people are often the target of drone attacks.",
      "Horlova says that FPVs often land on rooftops when their batteries run low and then wait out.",
      "\u201cWhen people, cars or even a cyclist appear, the drone suddenly lifts off and drops the explosive,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten to the point where they even drop them on animals \u2014 cows, goats.\u201d",
      "She believes that civilians are hunted as \u201crevenge\u201d for the celebrations that broke out when Kherson was liberated.",
      "The report from the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine says the attacks have spread terror among civilians and violated their right to life and other fundamental human rights. Investigators found that Russian units on the occupied left bank of the Dnipro carried out the strikes and identified specific drone units, operators and commanders involved. They also noted that Russian Telegram channels routinely share videos of the attacks, often with mocking captions and threats of more.",
      "The U.N. commission said that it examined Russian claims that Ukrainian forces had launched drone attacks on civilians in occupied areas, unable to conclude its investigation because it lacked access to the territory, couldn't ensure witness safety and didn't receive answers from Russian authorities.",
      "Interceptions obtained by The Associated Press from the 310th Separate Marine Electronic Warfare Battalion show Russian FPV drones that appear to be hunting for vehicles. The videos capture drones flying low over roads and locking onto moving or parked cars \u2014 often pickups, supply vehicles, sedans and even clearly marked ambulances \u2014 before diving for a strike.",
      "The commander of the 310th Battalion, which protects the skies over 470 kilometers (nearly 300 miles) of southern Ukraine, including Kherson, says at least 300 drones fly toward the city every day. In October alone, the number of drones that flew over Kherson was 9,000.",
      "\u201cThis area is like a training ground,\u201d said the battalion\u2019s commander, Dmytro Liashok, a 16-year military veteran and one of Ukraine\u2019s early pioneers in electronic warfare. \u201cThey bring new Russian crews here to gain experience before sending them elsewhere.\u201d The AP couldn't independently verify the claim.",

      "\"I think he'd like to get back to dealing a more normal life. I think he'd like to be trading with the United States of America, frankly, instead of, you know, losing thousands of soldiers a week. But their impression was very strongly that he'd like to make a deal,\" Trump said of Putin.",
      "Witkoff and Kushner have invited Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov to Miami on Thursday for further peace talks, according to a senior U.S. administration official.",
      "Witkoff and Kushner conducted marathon talks with Putin to bring about the end of the nearly four-year Russian invasion of Ukraine, but no immediate breakthroughs were announced by either side.",
      "Though both sides in the negotiations -- led by Witkoff and Kushner from the U.S. -- and Putin who conducted negotiations in Moscow -- vowed secrecy and provided no comprehensive briefings of their discussion, it became clear that a deal for peace was not yet in hand as Trump has long desired.",
      "\"So far no compromise option has been found, but some American proposals appear more or less acceptable,\" said Putin's top foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, who was in the room for the Moscow meeting and spoke to Russian media afterward. \"The president did not hide our critical or negative view of certain proposals.\"",
      "\"We agreed on some things ... while others caused criticism, and the president [Putin] also made no secret of our critical, even negative, attitude toward a number of proposals. But the main thing is that we had a very useful discussion,\" Ushakov said.",
      "It's unclear which peace plan was presented to the Russians after details of an initial 28-point plan were presented to Ukraine last month. Kyiv and its European allies worked quickly to amend down to a 19-point plan.",
      "None of the parties involved in the negotiations this week has detailed the current version of the proposal.",
      "Following the high-profile meeting between Witkoff, Kushner and Putin -- in which the U.S. delegation presented Putin with four documents outlining Washington's plan -- Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said negotiators from Kyiv would meet with European leaders in Brussels on Wednesday to discuss the outcome of the Kremlin meeting.",
      "He added that senior negotiator Umerov and army chief Andrii Hnatov would then prepare for meetings with the U.S. envoys.",

      "Among the potential benefits, Trump claims, is the ability to replace revenue from federal income taxes with money the U.S. is taking in from tariffs \u2014 a concept he has touted since his 2024 presidential campaign, most recently at a Cabinet meeting Tuesday.",
      "But tariff revenue doesn't even come close to where it would need to be if federal income taxes were eliminated, and experts say such a plan isn't at all feasible.",
      "Here's a closer look at the facts.",
      "CLAIM: The U.S. is earning enough revenue from tariffs to eventually eliminate federal income taxes.",
      "THE FACTS: This is false. Individual income taxes brought in trillions more dollars than tariffs did in the last fiscal year, accounting for more than 50% of total U.S. revenue, according to Treasury Department data. Tariffs made up only 3.7% of the total. In the first month of the current fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, individual income taxes accounted for 54% of total revenue. Tariffs made up 7.75%.",
      "Trump's proposal wouldn't work regardless, according to experts, given the unreliability of tariff revenue as well as the harmful effects of tariffs on economic growth and their outsize impact on lower earners.",
      "\u201cIt's not possible. It's not feasible mathematically or economically,\u201d said Brandon DeBot, senior attorney adviser and policy director at New York University's Tax Law Center. \u201cAnd analysts from a range of different perspectives agree with that conclusion. Even the very substantial tariffs imposed this year, which are at the highest levels in the postwar era, raise nowhere near the revenue that income tax does.\u201d",
      "Steve Wamhoff, federal policy director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, called the idea \u201cnonsensical.\u201d",
      "But Trump has floated it twice in the last week \u2014 first during remarks on Thanksgiving at Mar-a-Lago and then again at Tuesday's Cabinet meeting.",
      "\u201cAnd I believe that at some point in the not too distant future, you won't even have income tax to pay. Because the money we're taking in is so great, it's so enormous, that you're not going to have income tax to pay,\u201d he said at the meeting, which lasted more than two hours.",
      "In the last fiscal year, Treasury Department data shows that revenue from individual income taxes was approximately $2.66 trillion out of about $5.23 trillion in total revenue. Corporation income taxes added approximately $452 billion. Customs duties earned nearly $195 billion. That's a difference of around $2.8 trillion.",
      "The current fiscal year is shaping up in a similar fashion. Individual income taxes took in about $217 billion out of approximately $404 billion in total revenue the first month, with about $15 billion in additional funds from corporation taxes. Tariffs, meanwhile, earned around $31 billion.",

      "Trump has boasted of additional income from investments in the U.S. by other countries and international companies. But the precise terms of these investments have yet to be fully codified and released to the public, and some numbers are under dispute or involve potentially fuzzy math.",
      "The modern federal income tax was created with the ratification of 16th Amendment in 1913, ending the 43-year era when Trump says the country was wealthiest. He has not expressly detailed plans to end a national income tax since retaking the White House, and he can\u2019t do so without an act of Congress and upending the federal budget.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is set to raise trillions in revenue for the federal government in the coming years with his tariffs \u2014 whose costs will ultimately be paid by the foreign exporters who rely on the American economy, the world's biggest and best consumer market,\u201d said White House spokesman Kush Desai. He also cited \u201ctrillions in historic investment commitments to make and hire in America\u201d that have been fueled by tariffs.",
      "It is actually importers \u2014 American companies \u2014 that pay tariffs. Those companies typically pass their higher costs on to their customers in the form of higher prices. Still, tariffs can hurt foreign countries by making their products pricier and harder to sell abroad. Foreign companies might have to cut prices \u2014 and sacrifice profits \u2014 to offset the tariffs and try to maintain their market share in the United States.",
      "Even if the numbers were made to add up, replacing revenue from federal income taxes with that of tariffs \u2014 a Republican talking point since the 1990s \u2014 poses many risks. Tariffs, especially at rates needed to make up for a loss in federal income taxes, could lead to retaliation from other countries and a lack of imports. In fact, revenue could start going down the more tariffs go up. There is also a lot of uncertainty about how much revenue tariffs will actually take in, given periodic changes to Trump's policies.",
      "\u201cWe would be talking about living in a completely different world than the one we live in now,\u201d said Wamhoff. \u201cThere was a time when the government's finances were provided through tariffs. But I believe people were getting around with a horse and buggy back then and not cars. I mean, that was a completely different time.\u201d",
      "Another reality is currently playing out. Trump's tariffs are the subject of a Supreme Court case and could be struck down if the justices decide he does not have the authority to implement them. However, the president will still have plenty of options to keep taxing imports aggressively even if the courts rule against him. For example, he can reuse tariff powers he deployed in his first term and can reach for others, including one that dates back to the Great Depression. Many companies \u2014 including Costco \u2014 aren't waiting for a decision from the Supreme Court. Instead, they're filing suits against the Trump administration demanding refunds on the tariffs they've paid.",
      "Experts say there is also an issue of fairness, noting that tariffs would shift the tax burden to lower-income households given their propensity to increase costs on consumer goods. Plus, they lack the flexibility of income taxes, which can be set at any desired rate, and they wouldn't allow for incentives such as charitable donations or child tax credits.",
      "\u201cInequality is very highly skewed toward the top,\u201d said Michael Graetz, a professor of tax law at Yale University. \u201cWe've got more billionaires than we've ever had. We've got more millionaires than we've ever had. So it's a strange time to be reducing the tax burden on the top and increasing it on the middle. It's a proposal that is very effective for fundraising for Republicans and it always has been.\u201d",

      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Florida\u2019s Republican-controlled House is holding the first meeting of its select committee on congressional redistricting Thursday, as the state becomes the latest to consider redrawing electoral maps amid a partisan battle for every edge in next year\u2019s midterm elections.",
      "The national wave of redistricting efforts was instigated by President Donald Trump, who hopes to buck the historical trend of the president\u2019s party losing seats in midterms, and his allies are wagering that his adopted home state could yield three to five more seats for Republicans. Each seat is crucial, because Democrats need a net gain of just three to control the chamber.",
      "But the push for redistricting faces major challenges in Florida due to bitter infighting between Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and leaders in the GOP-dominated Legislature, along with a provision in the state Constitution that explicitly bars redrawing maps with the intent to \u201cfavor or disfavor a political party or an incumbent.\u201d",
      "DeSantis has voiced support for redistricting and even called for a redo of the 2020 U.S. census, claiming that Florida was shortchanged in the count, which determines how many congressional seats each state gets.",
      "\u201cWe are going to press this issue,\u201d DeSantis said in August.",
      "This week, in an interview with online outlet The Floridian, DeSantis floated the possibility of calling lawmakers back in a special session if they do not get redistricting done in the regular session, which is scheduled for Jan. 13 to March 13.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's administration says it will withhold money to help manage SNAP food aid from states that don't give the federal government information on individual recipients",
      "U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said this week that the federal government would start withholding money to help run the SNAP food aid program from states that don't provide data on participants, including their immigration status.",
      "The department said the government needs the data to spot fraud in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which helps 42 million Americans, or about 1 in 8, buy groceries.",
      "The plan to withhold the administrative funds is an escalation of a legal battle that's been going on since shortly after President Donald Trump took office. It's decidedly partisan. Only states led by Democrats have failed to provide the information the administration seeks.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "SNAP costs federal taxpayers about $100 billion a year. Of that, about $94 billion goes to benefits and the rest to administrative costs.",
      "The federal government currently reimburses about half the states\u2019 cost to manage SNAP, though that\u2019s scheduled to drop to 25% next October.",
      "The amount states receive varies widely, as does the portion of state SNAP funding that goes to administrative costs. When excluding bonus funds for the coronavirus pandemic, Wyoming, for example, got less than $9 million for administering SNAP during the 2023 fiscal year, the most recent time frame for which data is available. That represented 12% of its SNAP funding. California, the most populous state, received more than $1.2 billion for SNAP administration, nearly 10% of its total SNAP allocation. Florida received $84 million for administration, a little over 1% of its overall federal SNAP funding.",
      "Some experts have warned that shifting costs to states \u2014 even short of withholding them entirely \u2014 could be such a major expense that some could drop SNAP.",
      "Some states already are bracing to take on more of the costs. Connecticut recently set aside $500 million to offset potential federal funding cuts to states. It\u2019s up to Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat, to decide whether to tap that for SNAP costs.",
      "USDA plans to notify states that have not provided the requested information that they're not in compliance as soon as next week. The states would have more time to comply.",
      "And after that, they could appeal.",

      "Twenty-two plus the District of Columbia \u2014 all with Democratic governors or attorneys general \u2014 have sued to block the request.

Kathy Hochul told Fox 5 New York on Wednesday.",
      "One state \u2014 Nevada, which has a Republican governor and Democratic attorney general \u2014 has both complied and sued. Kansas, with a Democratic governor and Republican attorney general, has neither complied nor sued.",
      "Whether the administration's latest effort will be allowed is another question likely to be resolved by courts, too.",
      "Rollins has said findings from the states that complied with the request have shed a new light on fraud.",
      "She has said that it revealed 186,000 deceased people receiving benefits and about 500,000 getting them in more than one place. It's not clear just how many of those instances represent fraud versus people dying or moving and the systems not catching up immediately \u2014 or how many are cases involving fictitious people created by criminal operations to receive benefits illegally.",
      "\u201cAny abuse of federal funding is an issue, no matter how big or small because it means that the people that need the program are not directly receiving it,\u201d said U.S. Rep.

      "Annie Farmer weighed in through her lawyer, Sigrid S.

      "A deadly UPS cargo plane crash in Kentucky stemmed from corporate choices that favored profits over safety, according to a lawyer who filed two wrongful death lawsuits Wednesday, which allege the company kept flying older aircraft without increasing maintenance beyond what\u2019s regularly scheduled.",
      "Federal officials said last month's fiery crash of the MD-11 jet happened during takeoff after the engine on the left wing detached and flew off. Cracks were found where the engine connected to the wing, according to the National Transportation Safety Board report.",
      "The cracks show the now-grounded MD-11s, which average more than 30 years old, are too dangerous for package delivery companies to keep in the air, said Robert Clifford, a lawyer who has represented victims in plane crashes for more than 45 years.",
      "The plane that crashed \u201cwas old, tired and should have been never taken out of mothballs,\u201d Clifford said. Saving money by keeping older planes in the air and not increasing the number of inspections \u201cis putting profits over safety,\u201d Clifford added.",
      "UPS and GE, which made the plane's engines and is also being sued, said in a statements that safety is a top priority as they assist the federal investigation, and extended their heartfelt sympathies to the families of those killed. They said they do not comment on pending lawsuits.",
      "The suit by Clifford Law Offices of Chicago and Sam Aguiar Injury Lawyers are names Boeing, which acquired the original manufacturer of the plane McDonell Douglas, and VT San Antonio Aerospace, Inc., which inspected and maintained the plane. The two companies did not immediately respond to email and phone messages seeking comment.",
      "Clifford and other lawyers filed the wrongful death suits on behalf of the families of Angela Anderson, 45, who was shopping at a business by the airport and Trinadette \"Trina\" Chavez, 37, who was working at Grade A Auto Parts. Both died in the fire caused by the 38,000 gallons (144,00 liters) of jet fuel on board the plane as it headed for Hawaii, the attorneys wrote in court papers.",

Some of the parts involved in attaching the engine to the wing were also lubricated during the work that VT San Antonio performed, according to the lawsuits.",

When the Fed reduces its rate it can over time lower borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards.",

      "Steve Cropper, who co-wrote classic songs, including \u201c(Sittin' on) the Dock of the Bay\u201d and \u201cIn the Midnight Hour,\u201d during his years playing guitar at the legendary Stax Records in Memphis, has died",
      "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Steve Cropper, the lean, soulful guitarist and songwriter who helped anchor the celebrated Memphis backing band Booker T. and the M.G.\u2019s at Stax Records and co-wrote the classics \u201cGreen Onions,\u201d \"(Sittin' on) the Dock of the Bay\" and \"In the Midnight Hour,\" has died. He was 84.",
      "Pat Mitchell Worley, president and CEO of the Soulsville Foundation, said Cropper\u2019s family told her that Cropper died on Wednesday in Nashville. The foundation operates the Stax Museum of American Soul Music in Memphis, located at the site of the former Stax Records, where Cropper worked for years.",
      "The guitarist, songwriter and record producer was not known for flashy playing, but his spare, catchy licks and solid rhythm chops helped define Memphis soul music. His very name was immortalized in the 1967 smash \"Soul Man,\" recorded by Sam & Dave. Midway, singer Sam Moore calls out \"Play it, Steve!\" as Cropper pulls off a characteristically tight, ringing riff, a slide sound that Cropper used a Zippo lighter to create. The exchange was reenacted in the late 1970s when Cropper joined the John Belushi-Dan Aykroyd act \u201cThe Blues Brothers\u201d and played on their hit cover of \u201cSoul Man.\u201d",
      "Cropper was born near Dora, Missouri, but moved with his family to Memphis when he was 9 and got his first mail-order guitar at age 14, according to his website, playitsteve.com. Chuck Berry, Jimmy Reed and Chet Atkins were among his early influences.",
      "Cropper was a Stax artist before the label was even called Stax, which Jim Stewart and Estelle Axton had founded as Satellite Records in 1957. In the early 1960s, Satellite signed up Cropper and his instrumental band the Royals Spades. The band soon changed its name to the Mar-Keys and had a hit with the funky \u201cLast Night.\u201d Satellite soon was renamed Stax; a California label with the same name had threatened legal action.",
      "At Stax, some of the Mar-Keys became the label's horn section while Cropper and other Mar-Keys eventually formed Booker T. and the MG\u2019s. Featuring Cropper, keyboard player Booker T. Jones, bassist Donald \u201cDuck\u201d Dunn and drummer Al Jackson, Booker T. and the M.G.'s were known for their hit instrumentals \"Green Onions,\" \"Hang 'Em High\" and \"Time Is Tight,\u201d and backed Otis Redding, Sam & Dave and other artists. The racially integrated band, a rarity in its day, was so admired that even non-Stax artists recorded with them, notably Wilson Pickett.",
      "In the mid-1960s, Atlantic Records executive Jerry Wexler brought Pickett to Memphis to work with the Stax musicians. During a 2015 gathering with the National Music Publishers Association, Cropper acknowledged he had never heard of Pickett before working with him. He found some gospel recordings by Pickett, was taken by the line \u201cI\u2019ll see my Jesus in the midnight hour\" and with a slight change helped write a secular standard.",
      "\u201cThe man up there has been forgiving me for this ever since!\u201d he said.",
      "Cropper was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 as a member of Booker T. and the M.G.'s. The same year, Cropper, Dunn and Jones were part of the house band for an all-star tribute at Madison Square Garden to Bob Dylan, with other performers including Neil Young, George Harrison and Stevie Wonder. (Al Jackson died in 1975, Dunn in 2012).",
      "Rolling Stone magazine ranked Cropper 39th on its 100 Greatest Guitarists list, calling him \u201cthe secret ingredient in some of the greatest rock and soul songs.\u201d",
      "He played guitar on hits by Eddie Floyd, Wilson Pickett and many others, but was especially close to Redding. In an interview on his website, Cropper recalled collaborating on \u201c(Sittin' on) the Dock of the Bay,\u201d completed shortly before Redding\u2019s death in a December 1967 plane crash and a No. 1 hit in 1968.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A dozen prior leaders of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \u2014 appointed by Republicans and Democrats alike \u2014 issued a scathing denunciation of new FDA assertions casting doubt on vaccine safety.",
      "The former officials say the agency's plans to revamp how life-saving vaccines for flu, COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases are handled \u2014 outlined in an internal FDA memo last week \u2014 would \u201cdisadvantage the people the FDA exists to protect, including millions of Americans at high risk from serious infections.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe proposed new directives are not small adjustments or coherent policy updates. They represent a major shift in the FDA\u2019s understanding of its job,\u201d the officials, former FDA commissioners and acting commissioners, wrote Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "The internal memo by FDA vaccine chief Dr. Vinay Prasad hasn't been publicly released but a source familiar with the document confirmed its authenticity. The document claimed \u2014 without providing evidence \u2014 that COVID-19 vaccines caused 10 children\u2019s deaths. It went on to outline planned agency changes in handling those and certain other vaccines, and said that FDA staff who disagreed should resign.",
      "Among Prasad's plans were revising how yearly flu shot updates are handled and focusing more on \u201cthe benefits and harms of giving multiple vaccines at the same time.\" A common message of vaccine skeptics is that too many shots may overwhelm kids' immune systems or that ingredients may build up to cause harm \u2014 although scientists say repeated research into those claims has turned up no concerns.",
      "The FDA's planned vaccine changes come at a time when Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2014 who helped lead the anti-vaccine movement for years \u2014 is seeking to broadly remake federal policies on vaccines.",
      "Kennedy already ousted a committee that advised the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccine recommendation and replaced it with handpicked members. And in August, he fired Susan Monarez 29 days into her tenure as CDC chief over vaccine policy disagreements. The CDC's vaccine advisory committee will meet Thursday and Friday to discuss hepatitis B vaccinations in newborns and other vaccine topics.",

They also noted that \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d shows COVID-19 vaccines reduce children's risk of severe disease and hospitalization.",
      "But the bigger picture, the former FDA leaders argued, is that the new proposals would reject long-standing science about how to evaluate vaccines being updated to better match virus strains, slow innovation to replace older vaccines with newer, potentially better ones, and make the process less transparent to the public.",

      "The man who did it was arrested several months later for a string of other rapes and burglaries around Chattanooga, Tennessee. He confessed his crimes to the police. Now, more than 37 years later, Harold Nichols is scheduled to be executed by the state of Tennessee. Monroe can\u2019t wait for it to be over.",
      "In 1988, Ronald Regan was president and \u201cFaith\u201d by George Michael was at the top of the charts. Monroe had just returned to the United States after 3 years of living on an Air Force base in the Philippines with her airman husband.",
      "One of the things she had missed most while overseas was daily contact with her little sister. They had written letters and shared phone calls from the base, but things were not like they had been in back in Chattanooga. The girls were inseparable as children. Even at the ages of 20 and 17, they had spent every Sunday together. After a full day of church activities, the sisters would go out to dinner.",
      "\u201cKaren and I thought we were so grown up,\u201d Monroe recalls. \u201cI think it was something as simple as Wendy\u2019s, but we would be sitting there and talking about our lives that week and how things had gone.\u201d",
      "Back in the U.S. after three years apart, Monroe was planning a trip to Tennessee to catch up on her sister\u2019s life as a 20-year-old college student at Chattanooga State and introduce Pulley to her infant niece.",
      "The longed-for visit would never happen.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like having a wound, and every time you turn around the band-aid is ripped off again,\u201d she says of the years since the murder. Despite Nichols pleading guilty, there have been endless court battles over his death sentence \u2014 constant reminders to Monroe of the worst thing that ever happened.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost like we\u2019ve been through 37 years of hell, just over and over and over again,\" she says.",
      "Monroe knows people have a tendency to remember departed loved ones as better or more perfect than they were in life, but in Karen\u2019s case, \u201cShe really was an angel,\" she says. Monroe recalls her sister as \u201cgentle, sweet and innocent.\u201d",

At a time when it was common for White musicians to co-opt the work of Black artists and make more money from their songs, Cropper was that rare White artist willing to keep a lower profile and collaborate.",
      "Cropper was celebrated, respected by fellow guitarists",
      "Cropper's very name was immortalized in the 1967 smash \"Soul Man,\" recorded by Sam & Dave. Midway, singer Sam Moore calls out \"Play it, Steve!\" as Cropper pulls off a tight, ringing riff, a slide sound that Cropper used a Zippo lighter to create. The exchange was reenacted in the late 1970s when Cropper joined the John Belushi-Dan Aykroyd act \"The Blues Brothers\" and played on their hit cover of \"Soul Man.\"",
      "In a 2020 interview with AP, Cropper discussed his career and how he mastered the art of filling gaps with an essential lick or two.",
      "\"I listen to the other musicians and the singer,\" Cropper said. \"I'm not listening to just me. I make sure I'm sounding OK before we start the session. Once we've presented the song, then I listen to the song and the way they interpret it. And I play around all that stuff. That's what I do. That's my style.\"",
      "Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards, asked once about Cropper, said simply, \"Perfect, man.\" On a YouTube instructional video, guitar virtuoso Joe Bonamassa says Cropper's moves are often copied.",
      "\"If you haven't heard the name Steve Cropper, you've heard him in song,\" Bonamassa said.",
      "Cropper was born near Dora, Missouri, but moved with his family to Memphis when he was 9 and got his first mail-order guitar at age 14, according to his website, playitsteve.com. Chuck Berry, Jimmy Reed and Chet Atkins were among his early influences.",
      "Cropper was a Stax artist before the label was even called Stax, which Jim Stewart and Estelle Axton had founded as Satellite Records in 1957. In the early 1960s, Satellite signed up Cropper and his instrumental band the Royals Spades. The band soon changed its name to the Mar-Keys and had a hit with \"Last Night.\"",
      "Satellite was later renamed Stax, where some of the Mar-Keys became the label's horn section while Cropper and other Mar-Keys formed Booker T. and the M.G.'s. Featuring Cropper, keyboard player Booker T. Jones, bassist Donald \"Duck\" Dunn and drummer Al Jackson, they were known for their hit instrumentals \"Green Onions,\" \"Hang 'Em High\" and \"Time Is Tight,\" and backed Otis Redding, Sam & Dave and others.",
      "Cropper co-wrote \"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay\" weeks before Redding's death",
      "In a 2017 interview with \"CBS Mornings,\"\u00a0Cropper recounted playing guitar behind Redding at the Monterey Pop Festival in a legendary 1967 performance that helped put Redding on the map.",
      "\"We had no idea what the reaction was gonna be. And it was unbelievable,\" Cropper told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "In late November of 1967, Cropper said Redding brought him a song the now-legendary singer had started writing on a houseboat overlooking San Francisco Bay that would become \"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay.\"",
      "\"That afternoon, it was done,\" Cropper told \"CBS Mornings.\" \"We went and cut it the next day. I think there's three takes of it.\"",
      "A few weeks later, on Dec. 10, 1967, Redding died in a small plane crash near Madison, Wisconsin, at the age of 26.",
      "\"And I said, 'I just lost my best friend,'\" Cropper told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Cropper returned to the studio to put the finishing touches on the song, and \"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay,\" released in January 1968, became the first posthumous No. 1 record on the Billboard charts. It won Redding and Cropper the Grammy for Best R&B song, with Redding also winning Best Male R&B Vocal Performance.",
      "Booker T. and the M.G.'s. broke barriers",
      "Booker T. and the M.G.'s. was a racially integrated band, a rarity in its day. It was so admired that even non-Stax artists recorded with them, notably Wilson Pickett. Jones, who is the only surviving member of the band, and Jackson are Black. Dunn and Cropper are white.",
      "\"When you walked in the door at Stax, there was absolutely no color,\" Cropper said in the AP interview. \"We were all there for the same reason \u2014 to get a hit record.\"",
      "In the mid-1960s, Atlantic Records executive Jerry Wexler brought Pickett to work with the Stax musicians. During a 2015 gathering with the National Music Publishers Association, Cropper acknowledged he had never heard of Pickett before working with him. He found some gospel recordings by Pickett, was taken by the line \"I'll see my Jesus in the midnight hour\" and with a slight change helped write a secular standard.",
      "\"The man up there has been forgiving me for this ever since!\" he said.",
      "Cropper was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 as a member of Booker T. and the M.G.'s. That year, Cropper, Dunn and Jones played in an all-star tribute at Madison Square Garden to Bob Dylan. Al Jackson died in 1975, Dunn in 2012.",
      "Rolling Stone magazine ranked Cropper 39th on its 100 Greatest Guitarists list, calling him \"the secret ingredient in some of the greatest rock and soul songs.\"",
      "Cropper was in the 1980 movie \"The Blues Brothers\" and its follow-up, \"Blues Brothers 2000,\" portraying \"The Colonel\" in the Blues Brothers band. In real life, he toured with them.",
      "He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2005, and two years later received a Grammy Award for lifetime achievement.",
      "Cropper continued recording into his later years, including 2024's \"Friendlytown,\" which was nominated for a Grammy. Earlier this year, Cropper received the Tennessee Governor's Arts Award, the state's highest honor in the arts.",
      "He is survived by his wife and four children.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/avatar-fire-and-ash-director-james-cameron-on-generative-ai-thats-horrifying-to-me/",
    "published": "Sun, 30 Nov 2025 13:44:10 -0500",
    "summary": "The \"Avatar\" director, who uses performance capture to help create fantasy characters, has consistently raised the level of movie visual effects. But James Cameron believes using artificial intelligence to create a character and performance without an actor is \"horrifying.\"",
    "story": [
      "Much of what we see from the Earth-like moon of Pandora, the fantastical setting for the \"Avatar\" franchise, comes from a soundstage in Los Angeles, where scenes from the second and third movies were filmed. \"We had to build an ocean,\" director James Cameron said. \"We could make a two-meter swell. We could make a wave crash up on a shoreline if we built the shoreline.\"",
      "Sigourney Weaver, Zoe Salda\u00f1a  and other actors shot their underwater scenes in the nearly 250,000-gallon tank. Digital artists then took those shots, called performance captures, as a template to render the final versions of the characters we see on screen.",
      "\"So, performance capture, we use a whole bunch of cameras to capture the body performance of the actor,\" Cameron explained. \"And we use a single camera (or now we use actually two) to video their face. They're in a close-up 100% of the time. But there's a beautiful thing about being in a close-up 100% of the time. It's very much like theater rehearsal.\"",
      "\"Avatar: Fire and Ash\" is the third film in the series. It tells the story of the indigenous Na'vis' fight to defend their paradise from colonizing humans.",
      "Cameron created these stories and this world. He's always been a dreamer, even as a kid in rural Canada. \"I lived in a world of my imagination \u2013 it was comic books, it was science fiction. I read a lot. There were movies, TV shows,\" he said. \"I mean, I had a pretty fertile imagination.\"",
      "Cameron moved to Los Angeles with his parents as a teen. He briefly attended community college, where studies included marine biology, before dropping out and picking up odd jobs, including truck driving.",
      "So, how did he go from blue collar to Hollywood? \"Watching 'Star Wars,'\" he said. \"I used to put my headphones on and listen to fast electronic music and imagine space battles, hyperkinetic space battles with all kinds of maneuvers and energy weapons, and people going through debris fields and all that. If the things I'm seeing in my mind can be the same things that are in a movie that's the number one movie in movie history, then I've got a salable imagination.\"",
      "He returned to school, although not in an official capacity. \"I started to study visual effects, and the way I did it was, I didn't have the money to go to USC or anything like that. So what I used to do is, I'd go down to USC, I'd go bury myself on a Saturday, when I wasn't driving a truck, in the stacks. And I'd read everything I could find on optical printing and front-screen projection and, you know, sodium process traveling mattes. All self-taught. I'd Xerox all these scholarly papers, put them all in binders. And I had this shelf full of black binders that had essentially a graduate course in visual effects and cinematography.\"",
      "He found jobs in visual effects departments and production design, rising through the ranks quickly due to his technical knowledge.",
      "Then, in the early 1980s, Cameron, inspired by a literal dream about a robot exoskeleton, co-wrote and directed \"The Terminator.\" The movie put him on the map, and proved he could turn his imagination into reality.",
      "But CGI wasn't available at the time; the effects were done largely through puppeteering. \"We just figured out how to do it all practically,\" Cameron said.",
      "He showed us around his private museum in Los Angeles, full of movie props from his films, including \"Aliens,\" where puppeteers brought Sigourney Weaver's powerlifter - and the Alien Queen \u2013 to life. Of the Alien Queen, Cameron said, \"Her head had, I think, seven or eight different axes of movement that were controlled by cables that went basically out her butt. And we had to hide all that stuff, so there was a lotta steam and smoke and backlight and things like that.\"",
      "Cameron's first use of CGI came with the science fiction movie \"The Abyss,\" It was also his first cinematic foray into another one of his fascinations: the deep sea. His second venture into an oceanic film? \"Titanic.\" It became the then-highest-grossing movie of all time. Cameron took home three Oscars himself.",
      "But the film itself was never the priority for Cameron: He said he wrote the script in order to explore the wreck of the Titanic. \"It was a little bit of a means to an end, you know?\" he said. \"I thought, 'I can just go do this. All right, I need a story. Okay, 'Romeo and Juliet.' You know, young, doomed love on the Titanic.' Boom! Like, instantaneous.\"",
      "He found a way to use Hollywood to invest in his passion for scientific exploration. \"Yeah, exactly,\" he said. \"And then I had so much fun on my expedition that was to shoot Titanic for the movie, that I basically took an eight-year hiatus from Hollywood, an eight-year sabbatical. And I did subsequently six more expeditions for a total of seven, before I started 'Avatar.'\"",
      "Cameron wrote the treatment for \"Avatar\" before \"Titanic,\" but it wasn't until 2005 that he thought the current technology could support his vision. And even then, he wasn't sure the business of Hollywood would go along. \"For years, there was this sense that, 'Oh, they're doing something strange with computers and they're replacing actors,' when in fact, once you really drill down and you see what we're doing, it's a celebration of the actor-director moment,\" he said.",
      "\"Now, go to the other end of the spectrum, and you've got generative AI, where they can make up a character,\" he continued. \"They can make up an actor. They can make up a performance from scratch with a text prompt. It's like, no. That's horrifying to me. That's the opposite. That's exactly what we're not doing.\"",
      "Cameron's \"Avatar: Fire and Ash\" opens next months.",
      "So, how does he feel a few weeks from the premiere? \"Nervous!\" he laughed. \"Are you kidding? Always. Always.\"",
      "Despite the uncertainty, Cameron is still undaunted, and enamored by the unknown. \"I'm attracted, in case you haven't noticed, by things I don't know how to do,\" he said. \"Because you grow and you learn. If I'm still making movies when I got an oxygen tube up my nose and I'm 87 or whatever, should I be that lucky, I want to still be doing things I don't know how to do.\"",

    "summary": "The heavy metal band has not only changed lives with their music; they've also changed lives with their philanthropy \u2013 from donations to food banks and disaster relief, to their charity, All Within My Hands, which has donated to workforce education and other critical services.",
    "story": [
      "Carmen DeBerry is a newly-minted commercial delivery driver in Baltimore, Maryland. She says having this new job has completely changed her life. \"It feels awesome,\" she said. \"You know, I take care of my daughter, and I also take care of my mother.\"",
      "The commercial driver's license, like the type DeBerry got at the Community College of Baltimore County, can cost up to $7,500, money she didn't have \u2013 which is where four kind of unlikely guys from the Bay Area stepped in.",
      "Yes, we are talking about the guys from the band Metallica, one of the most commercially successful bands of all time, with more than 180 million records sold. \"I mean, to be honest, I didn't know when I first signed up that it was through Metallica; they just called it a scholarship,\" DeBerry said.",
      "A Metallica Scholarship, to be precise, part of the more than $10 million the band's charity All Within My Hands has donated to workforce education, mostly in the form of grants through trade schools and community colleges.",
      "\"Not everyone is built for college, and not everyone needs college,\" said Metallica lead singer James Hetfield. And he should know; he himself is the son of a truck driver, something he's hasn't forgotten.",
      "\"It was very evident during COVID, you know, when we weren't able to go out and do our thing,\" said Hetfield. \"But the plumber, the electrician, the truck driver, the people that needed to help keep America running were there. And thank God for them. You know, my thought is that the next millionaires will be the tradesmen.\"",
      "\"We all came from, I mean, pretty humble beginnings,\" said Metallica bassist Robert Trujillo, who worked in construction before he became a professional musician. \"At a certain point you realize, like, hey, you know, we're selling tickets, we're doing well, the ship's not sinking. What can we do to make people's lives better?\"",
      "The band's philanthropy actually began with the simple question of what to do with their leftover food backstage at the sports arenas and stadiums they'd been playing. They started donating it to local food banks; then, they starting donating sizable checks to those food banks as well, which turned into disaster relief.",
      "\"It was a bit profound for us because one of the first things that happened was in, maybe 2017, we had the Northern California fires that affected so many people in the Bay Area,\" said guitarist Kirk Hammett. When disaster struck in the band's backyard, that's when he says it hit home: \"And we were able to, like, jump in and, like, really help people right off the bat. And there's been other instances where there's been earthquakes, you know, disasters, people in need of food and medicine. And we've been able to step up and send money, and not just a pittance, but like enough money that makes a difference to, you know, a good group of people who need it.\"",
      "But actually talking about their charity work publicly? That didn't come as easily, says drummer Lars Ulrich. \"We had never screamed from the rooftops about it,\" he said. \"I think instinctively you just want to help. I mean, we all depend on each other \u2013 you know, if you really want to break it down, then you go, humans are herd animals and really thrive, you know, the flock does better when everybody is doing well.\"",
      "Now, if all this doesn't sound very Metallica-like, well, in a way neither does the annual fundraiser concert that they've been putting on in Los Angeles. Last year it raised $3.5 million and brought in some big Metallica admirers, like Aquaman himself Jason Momoa. \"They've kind of been the soundtrack of my life, man. I've kind of discovered them probably when I was ten years old. And I think these are your heroes. These are my heroes.\"",
      "It might come as a surprise to some that a band with songs like \"Nothing Else Matters\" and \"Seek and Destroy\" spends so much time thinking about how to better other people's lives. But for Hetfield, it's a thought process that comes with age.",
      "\"It seems clearer that we have a purpose,\" he said. \"And that purpose is to bring joy to people on this planet, and absolutely still blows my mind that there's three generations out there, you know, rocking out to 'Master of Puppets.' Like, really? You like this song? Okay! That was written when I was 22 years old, and I was pissed off. But beyond what we've done in the music thing, as you get older, you start to see the world in a different light, you know? My philosophy is, you're climbing to the next layer of the high rise. And the older you get, the better the view is of the world, and what you get to see, and where you can be of service. And this is certainly one of them.\"",
      "Up until now, Hetfield had never actually met a Metallica scholar, but that changed backstage before a show in Landover, Maryland, when a very appreciative Carmen DeBerry stopped by. \"I really think that your scholarship, me telling them about your scholarship, is what got me the job,\" she told Hetfield. \"Because once I told them that I got the Metallica scholarship, they were like, Whaaaaat? I got an entrance, and they took a chance with me. And I appreciate it.\"",
      "\"Right on!\" Hetfield replied.",
      "I asked, \"You're about to go out and play to thousands and thousands of people, and yet you just had a moment of getting to talk to somebody whose life has been significantly changed from All Within My Hands' charity work. What's that feel like?\"",
      "Hetfield replied, \"It is so amazing. We get to go make some people smile out there, deliver the goods by playing songs that saved us in our lives. And then to create a foundation that's giving back to, you know, the blue collar America? We get to go from thousands that are making big noise, that we know we're impacting, but to get a one-on-one, you know, heart-to-heart with somebody whose life you've changed, it changes mine.\"",

    "story": [
      "Breakfast is served on Amanda Seyfried's Upstate New York farm, which means feeding the horses, the goats, and Cliff, a 35-year-old pony. \"I love it,\" Seyfried said, \"'cause nothing else matters, because they need to get fed. It's a responsibility that, like, keeps me focused on what's important.\"",

      "\"I don't know if you know this, but Hollywood is really \u2026 it's tricky, and it's got a lot of personalities,\" Seyfried replied. \"There are a lot of people that are working in a way that doesn't necessarily make it feel like a safe place. This is exactly what I have always wanted.\"",
      "And she's is not merely putting on a show for the cameras. \"Last night it was raining, it was pouring, and I was doing the same ****. I just didn't look this nice!\" she said.",
      "This is where Seyfried lives, but she goes where the work is, and there's been plenty of it \u2013 as Karen, memorably clueless in \"Mean Girls,\" later as Sophie in the mega-hit \"Mamma Mia!\"",
      "A big change of pace came in 2020, starring as early Hollywood actress Marion Davies in \"Mank.\" The film earned Seyfried an Oscar nomination.",
      "She agrees that she wants to be challenged, badly. \"Because here's the thing: the challenge is within a certain parameter. I have had enough therapy and enough insight and perspective to know what happens when I may fall too deep into something, and I have enough tools and support to not let that happen. So, every time I'd say it's a challenge, it's really hard, and I look back and I'm like, I wouldn't want to do that again! But when I'm in it, it's more than a challenge; it's a new life. I'm being born into something \u2013 a new version of myself.\"",
      "Her commitment is right there on the screen in two movies out next month: the psychological thriller \"The Housemaid,\" co-starring Sydney Sweeney; and the dramatic musical \"The Testament of Ann Lee.\"",
      "In that 18th century story, Seyfried plays Ann Lee, the founder of the Shakers, a religious sect that embraced equality and chastity, even inside of marriage.",
      "\"Her conviction was everything,\" Seyfried said of Lee. \"The coolest thing about her is that she created a utopia. The idea that we're better off working together as equals, it still rings true to this day. Like, if you take away power and control of each other, there's nothing we can't do.\"",
      "The cast received a long standing ovation at the Venice Film Festival, while the role has made Seyfried an Oscar contender.",
      "\"It's like, I worked my ass off in this specific experience, and I worked my ass off throughout my career, and I've stayed true to who I am,\" she said. \"I've definitely changed, and evolved, and become a better person. Do I still make mistakes? Uh-huh, yeah. Do I still make bad choices? Yeah! But I'm human, and I'm, like, doing the best I can. And I'm nice. And I'm f****** nice!\" she laughed. \"'Cause there's no other reason not to be.\"",
      "I can testify, she is \u2026 nice! And refreshingly honest. Raised in Allentown, Pennsylvania, Seyfried studied acting and music as a kid, did some modeling, too. In high school, she was a regular on the soap opera \"All My Children.\" She was on the show for ten months.",
      "Why'd she leave it? \"Why did I leave? Why did Megan McTavish write me off? I don't know, ask her!\" she laughed.",
      "Getting fired, even at 17, hurt. She figured acting was over, so she enrolled at New York's Fordham University, sort of. \"I, like, took the elevator up, and then I stood there, looked at the elevators, and then I took the escalator down, and then I went home. That was my time at Fordham,\" she laughed.",
      "Immediately after \"college,\" Seyfried landed an audition for \"Mean Girls,\" her first big break. \"Mamma Mia!\" was her second. It led to a sequel, 2018's \"Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again\" \u2026 and maybe a trilogy? Asked if there was going to be a third one, she replied, \"Yeah, absolutely.\"",
      "\"Do we know anything about the story?\" I asked.",
      "\"No, I think if we all decided we'll do it for free, they'll be like, 'Cool. Let's do it tomorrow,'\" she replied. \"I know Judy Craymer, who created it, is working furiously on a script. I just assume it'll happen exactly ten years from when we shot the last one, which was '17. So, we'll shoot it in 2027, out in 2028. Every ten years! I just don't know how they get Meryl back.\"",
      "Well, that is the tricky part, as her character is (spoiler) dead. Evil twin? \"There it is!\" Seyfried smiled.",
      "Some character traits can stay with Seyfried, like the voice of Elizabeth Holmes, the Theranos founder convicted of fraud in \"The Dropout\" (2022). The role won Seyfried an Emmy.",
      "Seyfried is candid about everything, including battling serious anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder, obstacles she believes help her as an actor. \u00a0\"All the things that I have, I've been diagnosed with, I've been able to channel them in the right ways and take the right medication to use it to my advantage,\" she said, \"and to, like, shut it up when it's no longer helpful, for the most part. And that has helped me. Self-loathing, self-judgment, all that, at times helped me keep my s*** together.\"",
      "Seyfried, who turns 40 this week, is married to actor Thomas Sadowski. They have two children. Her daughter was close by during our conversation, as was a guitar. It's one of many instruments Seyfried  plays.",
      "She was looking right at her daughter as she sang.",
      "Seeing her in own house, this farm upstate, surrounded by family and animals, reveals a grounded movie star living a grounded life.",
      "\"It's my world now,\" she said. \"Like, I've been in it for 25 years or whatever. And I, like, totally feel at home in it. And people know me well enough, I don't feel like I have anything to prove. I'm nice to people. I'm not trying to cover up any scandals \u2013 yet! Wait! \u2013 and I'm not trying to, you know, hide or, like, run away from any bad press. So it's like, I've made it easy for myself. So far!\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tom-stoppard-dies-playwright-shakespeare-in-love/",
    "published": "Sat, 29 Nov 2025 20:58:40 -0500",
    "summary": "Stoppard was often hailed as the greatest British playwright of his generation.",
    "story": [
      "British playwright Tom Stoppard, who won an Academy Award for the screenplay for 1998's \"Shakespeare In Love,\" has died. He was 88.",
      "United Agents said in a statement Saturday that Stoppard died \"peacefully\" at his home in Dorset in southern England, surrounded by his family.",
      "\"He will be remembered for his works, for their brilliance and humanity, and for his wit, his irreverence, his generosity of spirit and his profound love of the English language. It was an honour to work with Tom and to know him,\" the statement said.",
      "\"My wife and I are deeply saddened to learn of the death of one of our greatest writers, Sir Tom Stoppard,\" King Charles said in a statement. \"A dear friend who wore his genius lightly, he could, and did, turn his pen to any subject, challenging, moving and inspiring his audiences, borne from his own personal history. We send our most heartfelt sympathy to his beloved family. Let us all take comfort in his immortal line: \"Look on every exit as being an entrance somewhere else.\"",
      "Stoppard was born in the Czech Republic in 1937. His family fled to Singapore after Nazi Germany's invasion in 1939. He, his brother and their mother fled again when Japanese forces closed in on the city in 1941. His father died trying to leave the city. His mother married an English officer in 1946, and the family moved to postwar Britain. The 8-year-old Tom \"put on Englishness like a coat,\" he later said, growing up to be a quintessential Englishman who loved cricket and Shakespeare.",
      "Stoppard first worked as a journalist before turning to theater in the 1960s. Stoppard was often hailed as the greatest British playwright of his generation and was garlanded with honors, including a shelf full of theater gongs.",
      "His brain-teasing plays ranged across Shakespeare, science, philosophy and the historic tragedies of the 20th century. Five of them won Tony Awards for best play: \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\" in 1968; \"Travesties\" in 1976; \"The Real Thing\" in 1984; \"The Coast of Utopia\" in 2007; and \"Leopoldstadt\" in 2023.",
      "He wrote plays for radio and television including \"A Walk on the Water,\" televised in 1963, and made his stage breakthrough with \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,\" which reimagined Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" from the viewpoint of two hapless minor characters.",
      "Stoppard was a strong champion of free speech who worked with organizations including PEN\u00a0and Index on Censorship. He claimed not to have strong political views otherwise, writing in 1968: \"I burn with no causes. I cannot say that I write with any social objective. One writes because one loves writing, really.\"",
      "That was especially true of his late play \"Leopoldstadt,\" which drew on his own family's story for the tale of a Jewish Viennese family over the first half of the 20th century. Stoppard said he began thinking of his personal link to the Holocaust quite late in life, only discovering after his mother's death in 1996 that many members of his family, including all four grandparents, had died in concentration camps.",
      "\"Leopoldstadt\" premiered in London at the start of 2020 to rave reviews; weeks later all theaters were shut by the COVID-19 pandemic. It eventually opened on Broadway in late 2022, going on to win four Tonys.",
      "Dizzyingly prolific, Stoppard also wrote many radio plays, a novel, television series including \"Parade's End\" (2013) and many film screenplays. These included dystopian Terry Gilliam comedy \"Brazil\" (1985), Steven Spielberg-directed war drama \"Empire of the Sun\" (1987), Elizabethan romcom \"Shakespeare in Love\" (1998) \u2014 for which he and Marc Norman shared a best adapted screenplay Oscar \u2014 code breaking thriller \"Enigma\" (2001) and Russian epic \"Anna Karenina\" (2012).",
      "He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1997 for his services to literature.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nucleus-genomics-ceo-genetic-optimization-tools-parents-select-traits-babies/",
    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 13:39:12 -0500",
    "summary": "Kian Sadeghi, the 25-year-old founder and CEO at Nucleus Genomics, tells \"CBS Mornings\" that parents have every right to select the qualities and traits they desire in their child.",
    "story": [
      "Big leaps in science have made a once-impossible, much-debated question come to life: Would you design your unborn child?",
      "Kian Sadeghi, the 25-year-old founder and CEO at Nucleus Genomics, believes every parent has a right to do just that, selecting qualities they desire \u2013 from height to weight to intelligence. He calls it \"genetic optimization,\" and it's part of a Silicon Valley push to breed \"super-babies.\"",
      "Sadeghi dropped out of the University of Pennsylvania and started the company in 2021, inspired by a cousin who died of a rare genetic illness. Backed by investors and prominent tech entrepreneurs like Peter Thiel and Alexis Ohanian, Sadeghi says his company has already helped thousands of families.",
      "\"It's the parents' right to know\"",
      "\"We give you the full range of insights there is to know about your future child. We really think it's the parents' right to know,\" he told \"CBS Mornings\" in an interview that aired Wednesday.",
      "Genetic testing companies like Nucleus say DNA screening of embryos can prevent disease, while also giving parents a unique ability to compare and choose traits that make up a healthier baby \u2013 and one that's more desirable in the eyes of mom and dad.",
      "\"They want us to, you know, play sports and they want us to go to the best school. They want us to be well educated. They want us to thrive. Life, I think, as a parent doesn't just stop at 'I want my child to be healthy,'\" Sadeghi said.",
      "For $30,000, Nucleus offers a program called IVF+, which includes full DNA scans of both parents and up to 20 embryos conceived through in vitro fertilization. The results come back in the form of a sleek, user-friendly menu.",
      "Advanced DNA screenings",
      "The company screens embryo samples for more than 2,000 traits and conditions, including eye color, hair color, intelligence \u2013 even acne. It also can estimate genetic predisposition to medical conditions such as depression, autism and bipolar disorder.",
      "Sadeghi says this \"genetic optimization\" allows parents to minimize disease while maximizing traits they prefer. However, critics have drawn comparisons to a different term: \"eugenics.\"",
      "\"[It's not eugenics] by any stretch, because it's fundamentally about empowering people with information that they can use to give their child the best start in life,\" he said. \"And yes, if you want 2 inches taller for your child, 3 inches taller, right, if you want a couple IQ-point difference, absolutely, by all means, do that. But I'm saying, you're really asking me here, you're asking me, what is life about? That's what you're really getting at when you talk about height and IQ, right, they're abstractions of life.\"",
      "Ethical debate over reproductive genetics",
      "But while companies like Nucleus continue to grow, some medical experts point to the ethical dilemmas surrounding these types of new reproductive technologies. An article published in the MIT Technology Review in October argued the race to create the \"perfect baby\" is actually creating an \"ethical mess.\"",
      "In a\u00a0statement last year, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics said the practice of genetic screenings and use of polygenic risk scores for embryo selection has \"moved too fast with too little evidence.\"",
      "\"In this statement we do not address either individual or broader social, ethical, and regulatory issues this testing raises,\" the group noted.",
      "But Sadeghi said he remains confident in the data.",
      "\"Our predictors can better predict longevity from an embryo's DNA than any other genetic model ever built,\" he said.",
      "However, he pushes back on the criticism that he's creating a new class of \"superhumans.\"",
      "\"DNA is not destiny, the messiness of life, the nurture element of life, right, how hard your child works, you know, what school they go to, what resources they have, serendipity, all those factors are never, ever going to go away,\" Sadeghi said.",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 17:43:35 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration proposed rules that would weaken fuel economy standards for vehicles set under President Biden in 2024.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is proposing new fuel economy standards for vehicles that would roll back efficiency rules implemented under former President Biden.",
      "Under the Transportation Department proposal, which was unveiled at a White House event on Wednesday, automakers would need to meet less stringent vehicle mileage requirements.",
      "Federal fuel economy rules are overseen by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) under what's known as the\u00a0CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) Standards. Enacted by Congress in 1975, the regulations stipulate how many miles vehicles must be able to drive on a gallon of fuel, with specific standards for light-duty vehicles, as well as medium- and heavy-duty trucks.",
      "The rules aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help consumers save money on gas, according to the Transportation Department. Critics of the fuel standards have long argued they are costly for automakers, which must make technological improvements to reduce fuel usage, raising vehicle prices.",
      "The revamped fuel standards would reverse a Biden policy that \"forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse,\" Mr. Trump said on Wednesday.",
      "Rules would sharply lower mileage standard",
      "If finalized, the plan would relax fuel economy standards by setting the industry average for light-duty vehicles at roughly 34.5 miles per gallon through the 2031 model year, lower than the 50 miles per gallon outlined by a Biden-era rule.",
      "On Wednesday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the previous rules drove up the cost of new cars and were \"completely unattainable\" for automakers. He initially\u00a0directed\u00a0NHTSA to review the CAFE regulations in January.",
      "The Transportation Department said the proposal is projected to save American families $1,000 on the average cost of a new vehicle and a total of $109 billion over the next five years.",
      "NHTSA Administrator Jonathan Morrison said the move to ease the mileage standards would make the nation's roads safer. \"Newer cars are safer cars and by reducing vehicle prices, more American families will be able to afford newer vehicles,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Mr. Trump was joined at Wednesday's event by senior auto industry executives.\u00a0In a statement shared with CBS News, Stellantis CEO Antonioa Filosa expressed support for the proposed fuel efficiency rules, saying the initiative would realign the CAFE standards \"with real-world market conditions as part of its wider vision for a growing U.S. automotive industry.\"",
      "General Motors also backed the proposed fuel economy standards, which would need to undergo an official rulemaking process before being adopted.",
      "\"GM supports the goals of NHTSA's proposed CAFE rule and its intention to better align fuel economy standards with market realities. We have long advocated for one national standard that upholds customer choice and provides the auto industry long-term stability,\" a spokesperson for the automaker said in a statement.",
      "The fuel economy proposal would roll back\u00a0a rule\u00a0finalized in June 2024 under the Biden administration aimed at raising the minimum gas mileage for passenger cars and light trucks by model year 2031.",
      "At the time, NHTSA said the new regulations would save Americans $23 billion at the gas pump and reduce pollution. Burning gas for vehicles is a major contributor to carbon emissions, which scientists have linked to climate change.",
      "The rules were also intended to spur automakers to produce more electric vehicles, a key Biden administration priority for the nation's transportation sector.",
      "Would new MPG rules ease car prices?",
      "CarEdge CEO Zach Shefka described the Trump administration proposal as a win for automakers, but said consumers shouldn't expect to see lower car prices right away. That's because automakers work at least five years ahead in their product development, he said, meaning it would take a while before any redesigned cars make it onto the road.",
      "If the proposal eventually does help lower vehicle prices, he said, \"It will happen years from now, not in the coming weeks or months.\"",
      "The Center for Biological Diversity, a nonprofit organization that works to protect endangered species, said the Transportation Department proposal will increase the country's oil consumption and undermine the competitiveness of U.S. automakers.",
      "\"Trump's action will feed America's destructive use of oil, while hamstringing us in the green tech race against Chinese and other foreign carmakers,\" said Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity's Safe Climate Transport Campaign.",
      "Wednesday's move is the latest effort by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged automakers to build cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles. The administration scrapped EV\u00a0tax credits\u00a0in September and has also proposed rules to eliminate\u00a0gas emission regulations.",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 13:39:12 -0500",
    "summary": "Kian Sadeghi, the 25-year-old founder and CEO at Nucleus Genomics, tells \"CBS Mornings\" that parents have every right to select the qualities and traits they desire in their child.",
    "story": [
      "Big leaps in science have made a once-impossible, much-debated question come to life: Would you design your unborn child?",
      "Kian Sadeghi, the 25-year-old founder and CEO at Nucleus Genomics, believes every parent has a right to do just that, selecting qualities they desire \u2013 from height to weight to intelligence. He calls it \"genetic optimization,\" and it's part of a Silicon Valley push to breed \"super-babies.\"",
      "Sadeghi dropped out of the University of Pennsylvania and started the company in 2021, inspired by a cousin who died of a rare genetic illness. Backed by investors and prominent tech entrepreneurs like Peter Thiel and Alexis Ohanian, Sadeghi says his company has already helped thousands of families.",
      "\"It's the parents' right to know\"",
      "\"We give you the full range of insights there is to know about your future child. We really think it's the parents' right to know,\" he told \"CBS Mornings\" in an interview that aired Wednesday.",
      "Genetic testing companies like Nucleus say DNA screening of embryos can prevent disease, while also giving parents a unique ability to compare and choose traits that make up a healthier baby \u2013 and one that's more desirable in the eyes of mom and dad.",
      "\"They want us to, you know, play sports and they want us to go to the best school. They want us to be well educated. They want us to thrive. Life, I think, as a parent doesn't just stop at 'I want my child to be healthy,'\" Sadeghi said.",
      "For $30,000, Nucleus offers a program called IVF+, which includes full DNA scans of both parents and up to 20 embryos conceived through in vitro fertilization. The results come back in the form of a sleek, user-friendly menu.",
      "Advanced DNA screenings",
      "The company screens embryo samples for more than 2,000 traits and conditions, including eye color, hair color, intelligence \u2013 even acne. It also can estimate genetic predisposition to medical conditions such as depression, autism and bipolar disorder.",
      "Sadeghi says this \"genetic optimization\" allows parents to minimize disease while maximizing traits they prefer. However, critics have drawn comparisons to a different term: \"eugenics.\"",
      "\"[It's not eugenics] by any stretch, because it's fundamentally about empowering people with information that they can use to give their child the best start in life,\" he said. \"And yes, if you want 2 inches taller for your child, 3 inches taller, right, if you want a couple IQ-point difference, absolutely, by all means, do that. But I'm saying, you're really asking me here, you're asking me, what is life about? That's what you're really getting at when you talk about height and IQ, right, they're abstractions of life.\"",
      "Ethical debate over reproductive genetics",
      "But while companies like Nucleus continue to grow, some medical experts point to the ethical dilemmas surrounding these types of new reproductive technologies. An article published in the MIT Technology Review in October argued the race to create the \"perfect baby\" is actually creating an \"ethical mess.\"",
      "In a\u00a0statement last year, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics said the practice of genetic screenings and use of polygenic risk scores for embryo selection has \"moved too fast with too little evidence.\"",
      "\"In this statement we do not address either individual or broader social, ethical, and regulatory issues this testing raises,\" the group noted.",
      "But Sadeghi said he remains confident in the data.",
      "\"Our predictors can better predict longevity from an embryo's DNA than any other genetic model ever built,\" he said.",
      "However, he pushes back on the criticism that he's creating a new class of \"superhumans.\"",
      "\"DNA is not destiny, the messiness of life, the nurture element of life, right, how hard your child works, you know, what school they go to, what resources they have, serendipity, all those factors are never, ever going to go away,\" Sadeghi said.",

      "The money will be given to most children ages 10 and younger who were born before the qualifying date of the Trump accounts, which were created earlier this year through the Republicans' tax and spending bill. Those accounts are designed to provide $1,000 to babies born during President Trump's second term in office.",

      "Dell, who is ranked by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index as the world's 11th richest person with net worth of $148 billion, said he and his wife were inspired by the Invest America program, which is the formal name of the Trump accounts. The Dells said they are encouraging others to join in by contributing funds to the accounts, ranging from other philanthropists and businesses to childrens' families and friends.",
      "\"We believe the smartest investment we can make is the one in children,\" Michael Dell told \"CBS News 24/7 Mornings\" in a Tuesday interview. \"We know that when a child has an account like this, even a modest sum, it really improves their outlook on life, and they are more likely to graduate from high school and college, and buy a home, start a business, start a family, become productive members of society.\"",
      "Susan Dell added that the gift builds on the couple's previous philanthropic efforts to help children through their foundation. The pair announced the program on Giving Tuesday, an annual event where people are encouraged to make charitable contributions.",

      "Every child born in the U.S. between Jan. 1, 2025, and Jan. 1, 2029, with a Social Security number, and whose parents have Social Security numbers, would be automatically enrolled in the program, according to Invest America.",
      "Sign-ups are slated to begin on July 4, 2026, with parents and caregivers needed to activate the accounts. The Department of Treasury will seed the accounts with $1,000 per child, while parents, friends and others can also contribute up to $5,000 per year.",
      "Signing up will be easy, according to details released by the Trump adminstration on Tuesday. Parents or guardians will need to file an IRS Form 4547, a one-page document that asks for basic information such as a child's home address and Social Security number, to activate the account.",

      "Children who are U.S. citizens and who are born between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028, are eligible to have a Trump Account, according to a fact sheet from the Department of the Treasury.

      "Families with children under 18 may also open accounts, but they won't receive the $1,000 gift from the government. However, parents, friends, employers and other parties can contribute tax-free dollars to an account.",
      "How do I open a Trump account?",
      "Parents or guardians must set up and manage the account until a child turns 18.",
      "The Treasury Department said households should use IRS Form 4547 to open a Trump account on behalf of a child. The newly created form is also where applicants can request the $1,000 U.S. government contribution to the account. The White House said that each Trump account for eligible children will launch with a $1,000 contribution from the government.",
      "In May 2026, the Treasury Department will send instructions to individuals who applied for government-funded accounts on how to activate them.",
      "When can I set up an account?",
      "Families can open a Trump account beginning in early 2026 and can start making financial contributions on July 4, 2026, according to the Trump Administration.",
      "How much can I contribute?",
      "Excluding the government's $1,000 donation, a total of $5,000 per child can be deposited into an account each year. Employers can contribute up to $2,500 per year to an employee's account tax-free, which will count toward the $5,000 limit.",
      "Financial contributions from cities, states, tribal governments and tax-exempt organizations, including nonprofit organizations, are generally not counted toward the $5,000 limit, according to employment law firm\u00a0Littler.",

      "How will money in a Trump account be invested?",
      "Under the \"big, beautiful bill,\" funds in a Trump account must be invested in an authorized investment, such as mutual funds or exchange-traded funds that track the S&P 500 stock index or another index with mostly U.S. equities. Financial firms managing the funds also may not charge more than 0.1% in annual fees.",
      "Should I personally invest in the account?",
      "Financial experts advise people considering opening a Trump account to accept the government's $1,000 contribution \u2014 money is money, after all \u2014 but to think twice about putting in their own money. The reason: Other types of savings plans \u2014 such as a\u00a0529 plan, a tax-advantaged savings account for education expenses, or a custodial brokerage account, an investment account for a minor managed by an adult \u2014 can be more financially advantageous.",
      "\"The gift is the biggest part of this. It really is free money,\" Madeline Brown, a wealth and financial policy expert at the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, D.C., told CBS News.",
      "\"It's a nice perk for parents with children who qualified,\" added Kate Ashford, a wealth management specialist at personal finance company NerdWallet. \"But it's not a slam dunk, and it's not going to do as much for you as other accounts.\"",
      "She cited the accounts' contribution caps and more limited investment tax advantages as drawbacks compared to 529s or custodial brokerage accounts.",
      "\"The only advantage is your earnings grow tax-free over the years, but you pay the ordinary income tax rate \u2014 not, say, a capital gains tax rate,\" Ashford said.",
      "Adam Michel, director of tax policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian public policy research firm, thinks there are better ways to set money aside for children, such as in a 529 or standard IRA account.",
      "\"Generally speaking, parents should not put their own money into a Trump account,\" he told CBS News. \"The primary use case for the accounts is to receive free money from sources like the government or private donations.\"",
      "For example, Michael and Susan Dell on Tuesday said they would donate a total of $6.25 billion \u2014 or $250 apiece \u2014 to millions of kids in Trump accounts.",
      "How do Trump accounts compare to a 529 savings plan?",
      "If you're saving for college, a 529 savings plan could be a better alternative, investment experts said. It lets families sock away money tax-free for education expenses. Savings from such an account can also be transferred to an IRA, offering accountholders more flexibility to save for retirement or other expenses.",
      "The Trump accounts have \"many more strings attached and complicated rules that make it not an attractive overall investment vehicle,\" Michel of the Cato Institute said.",
      "To be sure, 529 plans also have limitations. If people use funds for non-education expenses, for example, they must pay a 10% penalty.",
      "Meanwhile, a Trump account offers some flexibility. Beneficiaries, once they are adults, may use the money for purposes beyond education, such as buying a home or starting a business, while the accounts also can serve as a kind of IRA.",

    "summary": "A new report from Realtor.com projects that the housing market will shift in a more buyer-friendly direction in 2026.",
    "story": [
      "It's still a tough time to get a foothold in the housing market, with homes sitting near record values and mortgage rates parked well above 6%. But the tide could turn in 2026, with property prices forecast to dip in 22 of the largest 100 U.S. cities and mortgage rates expected to ease slightly, according to a new analysis from\u00a0Realtor.com.",
      "The real estate market is expected to move in a more \"buyer-friendly\" direction next year, leading to the \"most balanced housing market\" since the pandemic, meaning that neither sellers nor buyers are likely to have the upper hand in negotiations, said Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com.",
      "Mortgage rates are expected to dip to an average of 6.3% next year, a slight drop from 2025's 6.6% average rate. Lower borrowing costs, as well as strong wage growth next year, should encourage more buyers to jump into the market, Krimmel added.",
      "\"2026 is going to be a year where we think the market is going to steady,\" Krimmel said. \"It's going to show a lot of signs of getting back on track to what we consider to be normal.\"",
      "That will help push up existing-home sales, which are projected to increase less than 2% to 4.13 million properties in 2026, according to Realtor.com's report. That's only a slight bump from this year's projected 4.07 million home sales, but a notable change given that transactions have been relatively flat throughout 2025.",
      "Where will prices drop?",
      "Most of the 22 cities where home prices are forecast to drop next year are located in the Southeast and the West. For instance, seven of the eight largest cities in Florida are projected to see declines in home prices next year, with the sole exception of Miami, the report said.",
      "The Cape Coral-Fort Lauderdale metropolitan area is expected to see the nation's largest price decline next year, with homes dropping by 10.2%, the analysis says. That's followed by the North Port-Sarasota-Bradenton, Florida region, with an 8.9% decline.",
      "The cities with projected price drops include those where inventory has expanded, providing more choices for buyers, Krimmel said. Some of those metropolitan areas may now also have lighter demand from buyers compared with the COVID-era\u00a0real estate boom, which was fueled by low mortgage rates and a shift to work-at-home policies.",
      "\"These places, among others, saw a huge frenzy during the pandemic, so part of what we are projecting is that demand continuing to come back down to earth,\" Krimmel told CBS News.",
      "Prices are expected to rise in the other 78 largest U.S. cities, but the hikes are likely to be small, with a median price gain of 4% across those locations.",

      "Under a 13-year-old law known as the STOCK Act, members of Congress, executive branch officials and other federal employees are prohibited from using nonpublic information for their financial benefit. The law also requires officials to disclose stock trades exceeding $1,000 within 45 days.",
      "Critics say the law needs reforms to require more transparency to ensure public officials are not using their positions for personal gain.",
      "\"This body has been enriching itself on the taxpayers' dime for too dadgum long, and it's got to stop,\" Republican Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee told reporters. \"We're in committee meetings. We hear things before y'all do. We can make those connections.\"",
      "Dan Savickas, the vice president of policy and government affairs at the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, told lawmakers during the hearing that \"on average, members of both political parties outperformed the market.\"",
      "\"Each party's performance gets a boost when they control more branches of government,\" Savickas said. \"This only lends further credence to the public perception that congressional representatives are using their office for personal gain rather than public service.\"",

      "U.S. air travelers who haven't upgraded to a Real ID can still fly without one, but starting Feb. 1 they'll be charged a $45 fee, the Transportation Security Administration\u00a0said\u00a0Monday.",
      "Flyers without a Real ID, a passport or another acceptable form of ID will need to have their identities confirmed through a fee-based verification system called TSA Confirm.ID, the agency said.",
      "The announcement of a $45 fee for people without Real IDs comes after the TSA started requiring the identification or other approved documents in May. The Real ID is a federally compliant state driver's license, learner's permit or nondriver ID card, identified by a black or gold star in the upper right corner.",
      "Passengers without Real IDs \"will be referred to the optional TSA Confirm.ID process for identity verification upon TSA check-in and prior to entering the security line,\" the TSA said.",
      "The process will vary from airport to airport, according to the agency, which said it is working with private vendors to allow consumers to pay for the screening process before they arrive at the airport. The TSA warned that people without Real IDs could encounter increased wait times at airports while their identities are verified.",
      "The fee verifies passengers for a 10-day period, according to the TSA. The agency is still urging passengers without Real IDs to visit their local DMV to update their IDs.",
      "The $45 fee is designed to ensure that travelers, not taxpayers, foot the bill for the advanced verification system, said Adam Stahl, a TSA official, in the statement.",
      "Some travel experts said the new fee disadvantages lower-income Americans and that the 10-day verification window could cause confusion.",
      "The policy creates \"a bizarre situation where your identity expires like a carton of milk,\" travel expert Julian Kheel, founder of flight search engine Points Path, told CBS News. \"After those 10 days pass, you're back to square one, forced to pay another $45 even though nothing about your actual identity has changed.\"",
      "How does Confirm.ID work?",
      "Confirm.ID asks passengers without Real IDs to answer a series of questions about themselves to verify their identity.",

    "title": "Personal finance advice doesn't work for most Americans, economists say",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/retirement-personal-finance-advice-too-complex-economists-fixed/",
    "published": "Tue, 02 Dec 2025 14:08:34 -0500",
    "summary": "Personal finance is too complex for most people to navigate, two economists contend in a new book. Is there a better way to help people deal with money?",
    "story": [
      "Americans typically score poorly in financial literacy tests. Yet they're on their own when it comes to making major financial decisions, from funding their retirement to buying a home, two economists argue in a new book that critiques the personal finance system.",
      "Take the U.S. retirement system, which has shifted away from corporate-based pensions that guaranteed income in old age toward 401(k) plans, where workers must decide how to invest their savings.",
      "In theory, taking control of your investment decisions should be empowering, but the current U.S. retirement system \"appears too complex for many people to understand,\" write Harvard University economist John Campbell and Imperial College London economist Tarun Ramadorai in \"Fixed: Why Personal Finance Is Broken and How to Make It Work for Everyone,\" published by Princeton University Press.",
      "Despite some recent changes in how personal finance is practiced in the U.S., such as automatic enrollment in 401(k)s that were inspired by behavioral economist Richard Thaler's research about \"nudges\" \u2014 small changes that can steer people to make positive financial decisions \u2014 millions of Americans remain woefully unprepared to weather the financial strains of old age.",
      "Stronger medicine is needed, Campbell and Ramadorai say. Rather than a nudge, they call for a combination of regulatory and industry changes designed to overhaul the country's approach to personal finance \u2014 a broader shift they describe as a \"shove.\"",
      "\"We've learned that people make many mistakes, and particularly, sadly, less educated and poorer people tend to make worse mistakes,\" Campbell told CBS News.",
      "Their book proposes a \"starter kit\" of personal finance options, such as retirement accounts that automatically enroll people when they start their first job and stay with them throughout their careers, along with savings accounts that pay interest at the same rate and carry clear, transparent fees.",
      "CBS News spoke with Campbell and Ramdorai about their new book. It has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "CBS News: You write that most Americans are financially illiterate, according to one\u00a0basic assessment. Yet you say that introducing personal finance classes in high school isn't the solution. Why?",
      "Campbell: A simple way to put it is that you have a race between financial literacy and the complexity of the products people are offered, and the decisions they're asked to make. And complexity has been winning the race.",
      "Yes, young people in high school do have to make some big decisions \u2014 taking on student debt, going to college. They may also get a credit card, and then they have to manage their credit score. But there are a lot of other decisions they won't make until much later in life.",
      "It's as if we were trying to teach people to drive by just having the classroom component of driver's ed, without putting the kids behind the wheel.",
      "Ramadorai: All of us are also consumers in the personal finance system, and if you ask me what fraction of my daily time I spend thinking about my own personal finance situation, it's probably fairly small. But the financial sector is entirely focused \u2014 especially those on the personal finance side \u2014 on trying to get this right. So there's a sort of uneven competition between me, however educated I may be, and the financial sector, who is doing this on an industrial scale.",
      "For us to say, \"Oh, well, you know, if only you had taken the time and trouble to be educated, you wouldn't be in the situation you're in right now,\" that seems a bit glib. We're proposing not just putting all of the burden of responsibility on individuals.",
      "You advocate for \"shoves\" instead of \"nudges\" to ensure people are on the proper financial path. Can you elaborate?",
      "Ramadorai: We've seen lots of good examples of these nudges \u2014 for example, auto-enrollment into pension plans. That seems like it's a very well-functioning, effective policy until you start to look a little bit more closely at it. Research is starting to emerge that, in some cases, what happens is that the default contribution rate can actually either be too high or too low, depending on what kind of person you are.",
      "There's a kind of characterization or a caricature of academics as, \"All you want is, you just want the government to come in and fix everything.\" That's really not what we're about in this book.",
      "What we're trying to say is that we believe very strongly in the power of capitalism to produce products that are extremely high quality and are delivered at very low prices. But the energy of capitalism has been perverted.",
      "Campbell: We'd like to make personal finance shopping more like buying a painkiller when you have a headache. You know, you walk into the pharmacy, you go to the shelf. There's ibuprofen, there's Advil, there's the generic \u2014 it's all on the same shelf. The active ingredient is the same, the dosage is the same, and there's a little label on the shelf that shows you the price per unit.",
      "We think personal finance, unfortunately, is a long way away from that right now. It's more like the world of unregulated medicine 120 years ago, when people were selling legitimate medicines, but they were also selling snake oil, and it was very hard for individuals to tell the difference.",
      "You're suggesting that personal finance should be more tightly regulated. Critics of that idea might argue that this would chill innovation in personal finance. What's your view?",
      "Ramadorai:\u00a0There are areas where even the most laissez-faire among us would agree that there's a role for government intervention. Think about civil aviation.",
      "Civil aviation transports very large numbers of people across vast distances at a relatively low cost, and what we don't necessarily want is for people to come in and innovate in that space in a way that introduces risks, because we're super averse to the fact that we don't want these things falling out of the sky.",
      "The other one, of course, is basic utilities. You want the lights to be on \u2014 electricity companies are regulated in a particular way, there's piping that goes to houses for running water. We think that there's a strong role for government to play in having regulation in those areas.",
      "Our argument is that there are vast areas of personal finance that are just as important as any of those basic utilities. It is the plumbing that makes our financial system work.",
      "Campbell: We instead propose a forward-looking, design-focused approach to regulation, where we ask the regulators to get very specific about what a basic financial product should look like. We call these \"starter kit products.\" They can offer a wide range of products. And the starter kit product should be designed so that it is simple, safe, cheap and easy.",
      "If you could redesign how personal finance works in the U.S. from the ground up, what would be the first feature you would build in?",
      "Campbell:\u00a0Number one, I would create a universal retirement account. I would give it a Roth structure that is open for people, automatically upon the date of first employment, and then you can carry it with you across all jobs that you have subsequently.",
      "That would fix the problem we have at the moment \u2014 we have this immense profusion of accounts, and as people change jobs, they very often end up with multiple 401(k)s. But at the same time, people who work for small businesses or who are self-employed \u2014 maybe they open an IRA, maybe they don't \u2014 but the contribution limits are much lower, and so we have an access problem.",
      "Ramadorai:\u00a0Right now in the United States, there's a lock-in problem [with mortgages], which is that interest rates have gone up so high that it's compromising mobility for most people in the U.S. So people are sitting on 2% mortgages, and they're absolutely reluctant to move, even if there's a great job opportunity somewhere else, because they would have to refinance into a much higher rate.",
      "There's a feature of mortgage markets that exists in other places, which is called portability, where you simply take your old mortgage with you to the new place \u2014 you then get the lender to reassess the collateral on the new place, and then you're able to take your mortgage with you. That increases mobility and keeps the labor market functioning well.",
      "You could also have a different feature, which is called assumability, where the buyer of your house actually is able to take on your cheap mortgage, assuming that they pass the appropriate credit checks and so on.",
      "Both of those features, portability and assumability, would be really good additions to the U.S. mortgage market.",

      "Data from AAA shows that the national average price for a gallon of gas is $2.99.",

      "\"Any coffee that's already landed in the United States is still subject to the tariff,\" Ghambari said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/black-friday-cyber-monday-2025-spending-deals-inflation/",
    "published": "Mon, 01 Dec 2025 15:43:35 -0500",
    "summary": "Holiday spending is hitting new records, but some data shows that people are buying fewer items amid higher prices.",
    "story": [
      "Americans may not be feeling jolly about their economic prospects, but that didn't stop shoppers from opening their wallets on Black Friday and driving spending to new records. Despite record holiday sales, however, other signs suggest consumers are getting a smaller bang for their buck because of rising inflation and stingier seasonal discounts.",
      "Consumers spent a combined $11.8 billion online on Nov. 28 during the shopping blitz, a 9.1% jump from last year, Adobe Analytics said. Including in-store sales, Americans spent 4.1% more on Black Friday than a year earlier,\u00a0according to Mastercard SpendingPulse.",
      "Purchases on Cyber Monday are also expected to be strong, with Adobe forecasting shoppers will spend a record $14.2 billion online today, which would amount to a more than 6% jump from a year ago.",
      "The resilience of the American consumer has helped buoy the economy even as it faces headwinds ranging from higher costs from the Trump administration's tariffs to a spike in corporate layoffs amid a slowing labor market.",
      "Inflation remains a problem",
      "Yet while discounts dangled by retailers from Walmart to Amazon helped fuel spending, beneath the record sales are signs of weakness, according to online sales data from Salesforce.com. Discounts this year aren't as deep, with the average selling price of goods rising 7% from a year ago, while consumers bought 2% fewer items at checkout, Salesforce said.",
      "\"A lot of growth is being driven by higher prices, and this means the growth in the number of things that people buy is significantly less,\" Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData, told CBS News. \"So far this year, we have retail volume growth running at about 0.3%, which is very low growth.\"",
      "He added, \"This is one of the reasons some consumers feel a little gloomy when they see their dollars don't stretch as far as they once did.\"",
      "Inflation ticked up to 3% in September on an annual basis, according to the latest available Consumer Price Index data. That's up from a low this year of 2.3% in April.",
      "Experts say tighter household budgets are causing many consumers to watch their spending, such as by focusing on a few \"big ticket\" purchases, or spreading out what they buy over days of promotions in hopes of getting the most bang for their buck.",
      "Affordability pinch",
      "Consumer spending is vital to the U.S. economy because it represents about 70 cents of every $1 of gross domestic product. With consumer confidence falling last month to its lowest point since April, there were questions about whether the holiday season would bring cheer or gloom to retailers.",
      "Some Americans are also facing an affordability pinch, with costs for everything from groceries to utility bills on the rise. According to Deloitte's 2025 holiday study, three-quarters of shoppers reported bracing for higher prices during the holidays.",
      "Consumer spending in 2025 has been largely driven by high-income households, with the top 10% accounting for nearly half of all spending in the second quarter, according to an\u00a0analysis\u00a0of Federal Reserve data by Mark Zandi, chief economist at financial research firm Moody's Analytics.",
      "Spending among the bottom 80% of households \u2014 or those earning less than $175,000 a year \u2014 has \"simply kept pace with inflation since the pandemic,\" Zandi wrote in a September social media post.",
      "That's creating a so-called\u00a0K-shaped economy, with high-earning Americans spending more, while middle- and low-income households are holding back due to rising costs.",
      "\"Virtually all major holiday outlooks point to a bifurcated consumer,\" Kent Smetters of the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a nonpartisan research project at the University of Pennsylvania, said in an email. \"Widening behavioral gap \u2014 high-income households spending and staying online; lower-income households more selective, financed and volume-conscious.\"",
      "For now, both discount retailers and luxury stores appear to be outperforming this season, Saunders noted.",
      "\"So far, we're seeing value-focused retailers like Walmart and off-price do well,\" he said. \"Some of the accessible luxury brands, such as Coach and Ralph Lauren, are also doing really well. So there are winners out there, but the low-volume growth means that there are losers, too.\"",

      "The cryptocurrency dropped more than 8% in the last 24 hours alone, falling to $84,096 as of 11:15 a.m. on Monday, according to data aggregator CoinGecko. Bitcoin has lost roughly a third of its value since Oct. 6, when it hit a record high of nearly $125,000. The slump has wiped out more than $750 billion in the digital currency's total market value, CoinGecko shows.",

      "Why are crypto prices sliding?",
      "Experts who spoke to CBS News said global economic developments are weighing on the crypto sector. Bitcoin prices sank after a Bank of Japan official hinted at a possible interest rate hike at its upcoming meeting on Dec. 18-19. Higher interest rates tend to stoke market demand for safer assets, while putting pressure on riskier investments, including crypto.",
      "\"$BTC dumped [because] BOJ put Dec rate hike in play,\" Arthur Hayes, co-founder of cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, wrote on X early Monday.",
      "The selloff is also part of a broader decrease in risk appetite that is reverberating across other tech stocks, according to Nigel Green, CEO of global financial advisory group deVere Group. He noted that bitcoin's performance has mirrored that of the Nasdaq Composite, where a 4% pullback in tech has translated into a near 30% drop in the value of bitcoin.",
      "\"Bitcoin has increasingly behaved as a leading indicator for broader risk assets, particularly U.S. technology stocks,\" Green said in an email.",
      "Investors are looking ahead to the Federal Reserve rate decision on Dec. 9-10, with investors expecting policymakers to again lower the Fed's benchmark interest rate. The likelihood of a rate cut now stands at 87%, according to CME FedWatch.",

    "summary": "A long-lost painting by 17th-century Flemish master Peter Paul Rubens sold at auction for well beyond its asking price.",
    "story": [
      "A long-lost painting by Baroque master Peter Paul Rubens, which was hidden for more than four centuries, sold for $2.7 million at an auction Sunday in Versailles.",
      "The painting was recently found in a private townhouse in Paris. It depicts the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.",
      "It was part of a French collection and was initially thought to be from one of the many Rubens workshops that existed at the time. The artwork was rarely valued at more than $11,500.",
      "\"I immediately had a hunch about this painting, and I did everything I could to try to have it authenticated,\" auctioneer Jean-Pierre Osenat told The Associated Press. \"And finally, we managed to have it authenticated by the Rubenianum, which is the Rubens committee in Antwerp.\"",
      "Osenat told AFP earlier this year the picture was \"a masterpiece\" which was painted by Rubens when he was \"at the height of his talent.\"",
      "The painting was authenticated by German art historian Nils Buttner, known for his research on the master of the Flemish Baroque, Osenat said. Its provenance was certified through methods including X-ray imaging and pigment analysis, he added.",
      "B\u00fcttner explained before the auction that the master often painted crucifixions but rarely depicted \"the crucified Christ as a dead body on the cross.\"",
      "\"So this is the one and only painting showing blood and water coming out of the side wound of Christ, and this is something that Rubens only painted once.\"",
      "The Osenat auction house said the painting's authenticity and provenance were confirmed after scientific analysis. It said microscopic examination of the paint layers revealed not only white, black, and red pigments in the areas representing flesh, but also blue and green pigments Rubens typically used in painting human skin.",
      "Art expert Eric Turquin told a packed house the painting had virtually disappeared in the early 1600s. It is known to have belonged to 19th-century French classic painter William Bouguereau before it was passed down in the family.",
      "Although Rubens produced many works for the Church, the painting, measuring 42 by 29 inches, was likely to have been created for a private collector.",
      "A flurry of paintings by famous artists have sold at auctions in recent days.",
      "Last week, a previously unknown work by French impressionist painter Auguste Renoir of his toddler son Jean sold for $2.08 million at a Paris auction.",

      "\"All impacted U.S. carriers have reported great progress, and are on track to meet the deadline of this Sunday at midnight to complete the work,\" Duffy said.",
      "The emergency update stems from an incident Oct. 30 when a JetBlue flight traveling from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, experienced an issue with its flight controls. The plane dropped about 100 feet in seven seconds, according to preliminary flight data from Flightradar24, and was diverted to Tampa, Florida.",

      "The Federal Aviation Administration and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency issued emergency orders Friday that grounded the affected planes. The EU safety agency's order took effect Saturday at 7 p.m. Eastern Time, meaning planes awaiting the updates would be essentially grounded. The order allows for the planes to be flown up to three times without passengers to get them to a location for the fix.",
      "The software change comes as U.S. passengers were beginning to head home from the Thanksgiving holiday, which is the busiest travel time in the country. More than 500 U.S.-registered aircraft will be impacted, the Associated Press reported.",
      "Several U.S. carriers use the Airbus A320 family in their fleet. Spirit and Frontier only fly the A320 family of planes, with many popular carriers maintaining several hundred in their fleet. Delta flies about 315 A320 jets, United has about 200 planes and American has around 480 planes.",
      "United told CBS News the order impacts six aircraft in its Airbus fleet. Delta expects only a small portion of its A320 fleet, less than 50 aircraft, to be impacted by the updates.",
      "American Airlines said in a statement to CBS News Friday evening that it had downgraded the number of impacted aircraft from more than 340 to 209, and that it expected the majority of those 209 to be updated by Friday \"and through the night.\"",

Air India said on X that it had completed the reset on more than 40% of the planes that needed it, and that there were no cancellations so far. France's transport minister said the issue had a limited impact in the country. Disruptions were also minimal in the U.K., Germany and Scandinavia.",
      "Airlines for America, the trade association for the leading U.S. airlines, predicted that carriers will fly a record 31 million passengers from last Friday, Nov. 21, through this coming Monday.

    "summary": "The White House confirmed this week that there was a second strike, but denied that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered it.",
    "story": [
      "Two people who survived the U.S. military's early September strike on an alleged drug-carrying vessel were attempting to climb back onto the boat before it was hit a second time, a source familiar with the matter told CBS News on Wednesday.",
      "The survivors allegedly tried to salvage some of the drugs, according to the source. They appeared to be in communication with others at the time, and there were other boats in the vicinity that could have picked them up, the source said.",
      "ABC News was first to report the additional details on the strike. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reposted a video of ABC News' report on X.",
      "The Sept. 2 mission \u2014 the first of more than 20 attacks on alleged drug boats by the Trump administration in recent months \u2014 has drawn bipartisan scrutiny since last week, when The Washington Post reported that the military carried out at least two strikes on the same boat in the Caribbean, killing a pair of survivors from the initial hit. The newspaper alleged in its report that the second strike was conducted because Hegseth had said that everybody onboard the boat should be killed.",
      "The White House confirmed this week that there was a second strike, but denied that Hegseth ordered it. Hegseth has said the decision was made by the mission's commander, Adm. Mitch Bradley, and argued the follow-up strike was legal and justified.",
      "Democrats and some legal experts have alleged the second strike may have constituted a war crime under U.S. and international law if the military targeted survivors. A Pentagon manual on the law of war says \"wounded, sick, or shipwrecked\" combatants no longer pose a threat and should not be attacked.",
      "Even before the recent revelations, the campaign of boat strikes had drawn broader legal questions, with critics arguing the president doesn't have the authority to order military operations against alleged traffickers without congressional approval. In the past, the U.S. has typically sought to interdict drug smugglers at sea, essentially treating them like criminals rather than combatants. The Trump administration has argued the strikes are lawful because the U.S. is engaged in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels that it views as terrorist organizations.",
      "Lawmakers from both parties have vowed to investigate the Sept. 2 strike. Bradley is due to testify before Congress on Thursday. He is expected to show video from Sept. 2 and walk through his decisions, a source familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is expected to accompany Bradley for his congressional testimony, a U.S. official said.",

    "summary": "President Trump has recently attacked Gov. Tim Walz over the fraud cases, calling Minnesota a \"hub of fraudulent money laundering activity\" and lashing out against the state's Somali community.",
    "story": [
      "A series of multimillion-dollar alleged fraud schemes in Minnesota has drawn the Trump administration's attention in recent weeks, vaulting an issue that has brewed in state politics for years into the national conversation.",
      "President Trump has attacked Democratic Gov. Tim Walz over the fraud cases, calling Minnesota a \"hub of fraudulent money laundering activity\" and lashing out against the state's Somali community. And Walz is facing an investigation by U.S. House Republicans.",
      "Meanwhile, federal prosecutors have continued to bring new charges against alleged fraudsters in the midwestern state in recent months. And this week, the U.S. Treasury said it will investigate whether tax dollars from Minnesota's public assistance programs made their way to al Shabaab, an affiliate of al Qaeda and a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization based in Somalia, bringing the fraud cases back into the spotlight.",
      "Here's what to know about the cases:",
      "What was the Feeding Our Future fraud scheme?",
      "Three years ago, federal prosecutors in Minnesota filed the first charges in what they described as the \"largest pandemic fraud in the United States.\"",
      "The $250 million scheme \u2014 which now includes upward of 75 defendants \u2014 revolved around a nonprofit group called Feeding Our Future that partnered with the Minnesota Department of Education and U.S. Department of Agriculture to distribute meals to children.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, prosecutors say, Feeding Our Future and its affiliated food distribution sites submitted fake meal count sheets and invoices to trick state and federal officials into thinking they had helped serve food to thousands of children. The group allegedly raked in millions in administrative fees for the fake meal distributions, and got kickbacks from people who ran their distribution sites, according to federal charging documents.",
      "Feeding Our Future's founder, Aimee Bock, was convicted at trial earlier this year. Several other defendants, including distribution site operators, have pleaded guilty or been convicted, in some cases receiving multiyear prison sentences and being ordered to pay millions in restitution. One defendant also pleaded guilty to attempting to bribe a juror, after a member of the jury in his fraud trial found a bag with $120,000 in cash at her home.",
      "Bock has long denied wrongdoing. At various points before charges were filed, Minnesota officials questioned some of the group's filings and slowed approvals of distribution sites, leading Feeding Our Future to file a lawsuit accusing the state of discrimination.",
      "The case was part of a trend of large-scale fraud across the U.S. during the pandemic, as the federal government poured money into assistance programs at a rapid clip. One former federal watchdog estimated to \"60 Minutes\" earlier this year that COVID-19 fraud may have cost taxpayers some $1 trillion.",
      "Prosecutors said the program that was allegedly co-opted by Feeding Our Future \u2014 the Federal Child Nutrition Program \u2014 became more vulnerable to fraud during the pandemic. Oversight was more difficult because of the health crisis, and federal officials waived some of the program's rules to let restaurants participate and allow off-site meal distribution.",
      "State officials have also faced scrutiny. A probe last year by the state's Office of the Legislative Auditor found the Minnesota Department of Education \"created opportunities for fraud\" by failing to act on warning signs with Feeding Our Future or investigate complaints about the group.",
      "What other fraud allegations have circulated in Minnesota?",
      "The Feeding Our Future scheme isn't the only fraud case to rattle Minnesota politics.",
      "In August, state officials shut down a fairly new program designed to help seniors and people with disabilities find housing after discovering \"large-scale fraud.\"",
      "A month later, federal prosecutors charged eight people with allegedly defrauding the program, which was run through the state's Medicaid service, by enrolling as providers and submitting millions in \"fake and inflated bills.\"",
      "Prosecutors said the housing stabilization program was susceptible to fraud because it intentionally had \"low barriers to entry\" and few recordkeeping requirements. They also noted that spending on the program had ballooned to more than $100 million last year, despite initial estimates that it would cost around $2.6 million a year.",
      "And in late September, a person was charged with defrauding a third state program \u2014 in this case, one that provides services to children with autism. Her company was accused of hiring unqualified \"behavioral technicians\" and submitting false claims to the state that indicated the staff had worked with children enrolled in the program.",
      "She also allegedly paid kickbacks to parents who agreed to enroll their children in the program, in some cases sending them as much as $1,500, prosecutors said.",
      "The same person, Asha Farhan Hassan, was also charged in September with running a fraudulent food distribution site as part of the Feeding Our Future scheme.",
      "Acting U.S. Attorney Joseph H. Thompson said the case \"is not an isolated scheme.\"",
      "\"From Feeding Our Future to Housing Stabilization Services and now Autism Services, these massive fraud schemes form a web that has stolen billions of dollars in taxpayer money,\" the federal prosecutor wrote in a statement.",
      "Kelly Loeffler, who leads the U.S. Small Business Administration, also alleged Tuesday that some of the groups linked to the Feeding Our Future scheme received COVID-era emergency loans. She said she has ordered an \"investigation into the network of Somali organizations and executives implicated in these schemes.\" She did not provide details on the probe.",
      "What is the connection to Minnesota's Somali community?",
      "Most of the people charged in the Feeding Our Future case are of Somali descent, though Bock, the group's founder and the scheme's alleged \"mastermind,\" is White.",
      "Prosecutors in the alleged autism services fraud scheme said the defendant \"approached parents in the Somali community to recruit their children.\"",
      "The named fraud defendants appear to represent a small percentage of Minnesota's Somali American community, which is among the largest in the nation.",
      "Some 76,000 people of Somali descent live in the state, more than half of whom were born in the U.S., according to Census Bureau figures from last year. The vast majority of the state's foreign-born Somali population has U.S. citizenship, and most entered the U.S. before 2010.",
      "Around 65% of Somali people in Minnesota ages 16 and over were employed as of last year, according to the Census Bureau, roughly equivalent to the state population as a whole.",
      "Last year, a Somali American former investigator in the Minnesota attorney general's office, Kayseh Magan, wrote about what he called an \"uncomfortable and true\" reality that many people who have been charged with fraud in the state are of Somali descent.",
      "He wrote that \"fraud occurs when desire meets opportunity,\" noting that many Somali Americans are \"poor, desperate and seek shortcuts,\" and their families in the impoverished East African country frequently rely on money from their U.S.-based relatives. He said Somali service providers often leverage trust within the community to recruit friends and relatives into their programs. Many victims of these fraud schemes are Somali, too, he added.",
      "Has Minnesota taxpayer money made its way to the terror group al Shabaab?",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said earlier this week that his department will investigate whether tax dollars from Minnesota's public assistance programs made their way to al Shabaab, an affiliate of al Qaeda and a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization based in Somalia.",
      "Bessent appeared to be responding to a report in the conservative magazine City Journal that alleged millions from state programs \"ultimately landed in the hands of the terror group Al-Shabaab,\" citing law enforcement sources.",
      "Those allegations have circulated for years. A 2019 report by the state's Office of the Legislative Auditor said it was \"unable to substantiate\" allegations that Child Care Assistance Program funding is going to terrorist groups, though the report didn't rule it out, saying it's \"possible\" that state funds may have been sent overseas and eventually found its way to terrorists.",
      "Multiple federal investigators told CBS News Minnesota's Jonah Kaplan that there is no evidence taxpayer dollars were funneled to al Shabaab.",
      "Andy Lugar, a Biden- and Obama-era U.S. attorney for Minnesota, told The Minnesota Star Tribune last month that those charged in the Feeding Our Future fraud scheme \"were looking to get rich, not fund overseas terrorism.\"",
      "What has President Trump said?",
      "Mr. Trump has blamed the fraud schemes on Somali people, whom he has attacked in often incendiary terms in recent weeks. On Tuesday, the president called immigrants from Somalia \"garbage,\" and claimed they \"destroyed Minnesota\" and \"contribute nothing.\"",
      "Last month, the president announced he would end temporary deportation protections for Somali immigrants who live in Minnesota, claiming without evidence that \"Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State,\" and that Minnesota has become a \"hub of fraudulent money laundering activity.\"",
      "Somalia is also one of 19 countries that have faced near-total travel bans and a halt to immigration applications. And Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations are underway this week in the Minneapolis area, CBS News has reported.",
      "A particular focus of Mr. Trump's ire is Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota Democrat who was born in Somalia and came to the U.S. as a teenager. He has also lashed out at Walz, whom he referred to last week using a slur for people with intellectual disabilities.",
      "Minnesota lawmakers and members of the state's Somali community have castigated Mr. Trump for the comments. In an interview with \"Meet The Press\" last weekend, Walz said the fraud issue \"is totally disconnected with demonizing an entire group of people who came here, fleeing civil war, and created a vibrant community that makes Minnesota and this country better.\"",
      "What has Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said about the fraud schemes?",
      "Walz, who has served as Minnesota's governor since 2019, told NBC's \"Meet The Press\" on Sunday that his state has sought to crack down on fraud. He also pointed to the state's generosity.",
      "\"Minnesota is a generous state. Minnesota is a prosperous state, a well-run state. We're AAA-bond rated,\" said the governor and 2024 Democratic vice presidential nominee. \"But that attracts criminals. Those people are going to jail. We're doing everything we can.\"",
      "Asked this week about the U.S. Treasury's investigation into claims that tax money may have gone to al Shabaab, Walz said the state welcomes federal help and wants to crack down on fraud, but added: \"I don't think anybody in here really believes their motive and their timing,\" referring to the Trump administration and congressional Republicans.",
      "Meanwhile, the governor and his administration have faced years of local scrutiny over their handling of fraud, dating back to the Feeding Our Future scheme's emergence in 2022. Republican officials have long argued the state failed to carry out due diligence and was slow to act in that scheme \u2014 though Walz has insisted the state caught the fraud early but was stymied by court battles and asked by the FBI not to cut off payments during its investigation.",
      "That scrutiny has resurged in recent weeks. Earlier Wednesday, Republican Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, the chair of the House Oversight Committee, opened an investigation into fraud in Minnesota's public assistance programs.",
      "\"The Committee has serious concerns about how you as the Governor, and the Democrat-controlled administration, allowed millions of dollars to be stolen,\" Comer said in a letter requesting documents from Walz. \"The Committee also has concerns that you and your administration were fully aware of this fraud and chose not to act for fear of political retaliation.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 21:49:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The former officials said the FDA's plans to revamp how certain life-saving vaccines are handled would \"disadvantage the people the FDA exists to protect, including millions of Americans at high risk from serious infections.\"",
    "story": [
      "A dozen prior leaders of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \u2014 appointed by Republicans and Democrats alike \u2014 issued a scathing denunciation of new FDA assertions casting doubt on vaccine safety.",
      "The former officials said the agency's plans to revamp how life-saving vaccines for flu, COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases are handled \u2014 outlined in an internal FDA memo last week \u2014 would \"disadvantage the people the FDA exists to protect, including millions of Americans at high risk from serious infections.\"",
      "\"The proposed new directives are not small adjustments or coherent policy updates. They represent a major shift in the FDA's understanding of its job,\" the officials, former FDA commissioners and acting commissioners, wrote Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "The internal memo by FDA vaccine chief Dr. Vinay Prasad hasn't been publicly released. The memo said a review \"found that at least 10 children have died after and because of receiving COVID-19 vaccination,\" multiple sources familiar with it told CBS News on Saturday.",
      "Prasad suggested that the deaths were related to myocarditis, or the inflammation of the heart muscle, the sources said. Prasad did not share any data used in the review, including the children's ages, whether they had existing health conditions, or how the FDA determined there was a link between their death and the vaccine. The findings were not published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.",
      "It went on to outline planned agency changes in handling those and certain other vaccines and said that FDA staff who disagreed should resign.",
      "Among Prasad's plans were revising how yearly flu shot updates are handled and focusing more on \"the benefits and harms of giving multiple vaccines at the same time.\" A common message of vaccine skeptics is that too many shots may overwhelm kids' immune systems or that ingredients may build up to cause harm, although scientists say repeated research into those claims has turned up no concerns.",
      "On Wednesday, the former FDA leaders wrote that Prasad's claim about child deaths related to COVID-19 vaccines had been reported to a surveillance system that doesn't contain medical records or other information sufficient to prove a link \u2014 and that government scientists had carefully combed through those reports in previous years, reaching different conclusions. They also noted that \"substantial evidence\" shows COVID-19 vaccines reduce children's risk of severe disease and hospitalization.",
      "\"The memo asserts, incorrectly, that 'we do not have reliable data' on the benefits of Covid vaccination in children,\" the former FDA officials wrote. \"Reasonable scientists should engage in open debate about how best to shape recommendations for children at lower risk for Covid-19, but substantial evidence shows that vaccination can reduce the risk of severe disease and hospitalization in many children and adolescents.\"",
      "But the bigger picture, the former FDA leaders argued, is that the new proposals would reject long-standing science about how to evaluate vaccines being updated to better match virus strains, slow innovation to replace older vaccines with newer, potentially better ones, and make the process less transparent to the public.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement Wednesday night, \"The fact these criticisms are coming from former FDA officials who opposed raising the bar for vaccine science confirms we are on the right track.\"",
      "Many doctors and public health experts have also expressed alarm about the memo.",
      "\"Vaccines save lives, period,\" Dr. Ronald Nahass, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said in a statement. \"It is a sad day when FDA creates confusion and mistrust without supplying evidence, spreading propaganda that makes lifesaving vaccines harder to access and that creates additional confusion and mistrust for the public.\"",
      "The FDA's planned vaccine changes come at a time when Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2014 who helped lead the anti-vaccine movement for years \u2014 is seeking to broadly remake federal policies on vaccines.",
      "Kennedy already ousted a committee that advised the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccine recommendations and replaced it with handpicked members. And in August, he fired Susan Monarez 29 days into her tenure as CDC chief over vaccine policy disagreements. The CDC's vaccine advisory committee will meet Thursday and Friday to discuss hepatitis B vaccinations in newborns and other vaccine topics.",

And on Wednesday, House Oversight committee chairman Rep. James Comer announced he is launching an investigation into the widespread fraud allegations.",
      "Bessent wrote on X that the Treasury is \"investigating allegations that under the feckless mismanagement of the Biden Administration and Governor Tim Walz, hardworking Minnesotans' tax dollars may have been diverted to the terrorist organization Al-Shabaab.\"",
      "The Treasury secretary shared a Nov. 19 report in the conservative publication City Journal that alleged millions of dollars from Minnesota state welfare programs had \"ultimately landed in the hands of the terror group Al-Shabaab,\" citing law enforcement sources. Several Minnesota Republicans, including Rep. Tom Emmer, pushed federal prosecutors to look into the allegations.",
      "Walz's office pointed CBS News to remarks last week in which the governor said he welcomes an investigation into where defrauded welfare money went and would work with investigators.",
      "Comer, a Republican from Kentucky, released an excerpt from a letter he sent Walz, saying the Oversight Committee \"has serious concerns about how you as the Governor, and the Democrat-controlled administration, allowed millions of dollars to be stolen,\" and requesting \"documents and communications showing what your administration knew about this fraud and whether you took action to limit or halt the investigation.\"",
      "Minnesota has been racked by allegations of large-scale fraud in the state's public assistance programs. Dozens of people have been charged in a $250 million scheme involving the nonprofit group Feeding Our Future and its partners, which federal prosecutors say stole federal nutrition aid by falsely claiming to help distribute meals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Officials have also brought fraud charges involving housing aid and autism programs in the state.",
      "Many of the defendants in these alleged fraud schemes are members of Minnesota's large Somali community, a Somali American former investigator in the Minnesota attorney general's office wrote in an opinion piece last year. The former investigator, Kayseh Magan, added that community members are also frequently victims of the schemes.",
      "President Trump has repeatedly lashed out against Somali immigrants in Minnesota, claiming in a post last month that the state has become a \"hub of fraudulent money laundering activity,\" and announcing an end to temporary deportation protections for Somali people in the midwestern state.

      "Washington \u2014 Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform said Wednesday that the committee has received financial records related to Jeffrey Epstein from JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank, while releasing \"never-before-seen\" photos and videos of Epstein's private island in the Caribbean.",
      "The financial documents could offer a window into Epstein's extensive business dealings and connections. Epstein was a major client of JPMorgan Chase's private banking division for years before the bank cut ties with him in 2013. Epstein then took his business to Deutsche Bank, where he remained until 2018. He died by suicide in a Manhattan jail in 2019 as he faced federal sex trafficking charges.",
      "Both banks reached legal settlements in 2023 over their involvement with Epstein. Deutsche Bank agreed to pay $75 million to settle a lawsuit from his accusers claiming the bank \"knowingly benefited\" from his sex trafficking. JPMorgan settled its own suit for $290 million, CBS News reported at the time. Both banks have said they regret their association with Epstein.",
      "Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the ranking member on the Oversight Committee, said Democrats plan to make the financial records public \"in the days ahead.\"",
      "New photos and videos of Epstein's island",
      "The committee also released 73 photos and four videos of Epstein's estate on the 72-acre island, known as Little St. James, that he owned in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Epstein allegedly exploited underage girls for sex at the island, and he had stakes in businesses in the U.S. territory.",
      "\"These new images are a disturbing look into the world of Jeffrey Epstein and his island,\" Garcia said in a statement. \"We are releasing these photos and videos to ensure public transparency in our investigation and to help piece together the full picture of Epstein's horrific crimes. We won't stop fighting until we deliver justice for the survivors. It's time for President Trump to release all the files, now.\"",
      "The photos show what appear to be various rooms in the estate, including bedrooms, bathrooms and kitchens. One photo shows partially redacted handwriting on a blackboard in an office. Another shows what appears to be a medical office with masks of men's faces hanging from the walls. Others show various views from outside the buildings:",
      "One of the photos shows a dentist's chair, which a source tell CBS news was put in for one of Epstein's girlfriend, a European woman who was studying to be a dentist.",
      "The Oversight Committee sent a request to the U.S. Virgin Islands attorney general on Nov. 18 for all documents, communications and other information about investigations or potential criminal investigations related to Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell, according to Garcia. Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year sentence for \"conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse minors,\" as the Justice Department put it in 2022 when she was sentenced.",
      "Separate from the records the Oversight Committee has released, Congress passed and President Trump signed a law giving the Justice Department 30 days to release all records it has related to Epstein. That 30-day countdown began after the law was signed on Nov. 19. It's not yet clear how much information will be redacted.",
      "Scott  MacFarlane and \n                                                  \n                                  Caitlin  Yilek\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hegseths-signal-chat-pentagon-inspector-general-report/",
    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 20:03:57 -0500",
    "summary": "The Pentagon watchdog recently completed its report on Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's use of Signal to share details about operations in Yemen.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Pentagon's internal watchdog determined Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth jeopardized sensitive military information and could have endangered American service members when he shared certain details about U.S. military operations in Yemen in a private Signal group chat earlier this year, according to a U.S. official and a person familiar with the report's findings.",
      "The individuals who spoke to CBS News said the report found the former Fox News host-turned-defense secretary violated Defense Department policies when he used his personal device for official business to transmit sensitive U.S. military information to other top Trump officials and the editor in chief of The Atlantic magazine. The two sources requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the unreleased report.",
      "A classified version of the inspector general's report was sent to Congress on Tuesday. An unredacted version is expected to be released Thursday. CNN first reported the defense inspector general's findings.",
      "In a statement Wednesday, chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said the review \"is a TOTAL exoneration of Secretary Hegseth and proves what we knew all along - no classified information was shared. This matter is resolved, and the case is closed.\"",
      "Hegseth also called the review a \"total exoneration,\" writing on X: \"No classified information. Total exoneration. Case closed. Houthis bombed into submission. Thank you for your attention to this IG report.\"",
      "The sources said the IG report confirmed what CBS News had reported in July \u2014 that key information posted by Hegseth in the encrypted Signal chat group was derived from a classified email marked \"SECRET//NOFORN.\" CBS News reported that information was shared by Army Gen. Michael \"Erik\" Kurilla, who at the time was the commander of U.S. Central Command, the primary combatant unit overseeing U.S. military operations in the Middle East, Central Asia and parts of South Asia.",
      "The \"SECRET\" designation means the information was classified, and the disclosure of the information without proper declassification could potentially cause serious damage to national security and jeopardize the safety of service members, according to the U.S. government.",
      "The \"NOFORN\" label means the information can only be disseminated to U.S. agencies and individuals, excluding foreign nationals and even close U.S. allies.",
      "The sources familiar with the inspector general's investigation said the report found that if the information had been intercepted by a foreign adversary, it would have clearly endangered U.S. service members and the mission.",
      "The report does not address the question of whether Hegseth declassified the information before it was posted in a Signal chat group that included other top Trump officials, the sources said. That group chat also inadvertently included Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic, who broke the story in March.",
      "A day after the Signal chat story was published by The Atlantic, U.S. Africa Command, in coordination with the government of Somalia, conducted multiple airstrikes against affiliates of the Islamic State terrorist organization. A press release said the airstrikes occurred near the Golis Mountains in Somalia and that multiple \"ISIS-Somalia operatives were killed.\"",
      "After multiple Trump administration officials claimed the information in the Signal chat group was unclassified, CBS News filed a request in March under the Freedom of Information Act to U.S. Africa Command to see if similar information deemed unclassified by Hegseth from the Yemen airstrike could be released regarding the March 25 airstrike on the ISIS operatives in Somalia.",
      "CBS News requested information about the airstrike that was similar to the information appearing in the Signal chat group about the strikes and that Trump intelligence officials had said was unclassified.",
      "In early September, CBS News received a response from U.S. Africa Command, which arrived at the same conclusion as the Pentagon inspector general about the Somalia airstrike \u2014 that the material if released could jeopardize national security.",
      "\"[The] information that is currently and properly classified pursuant to Executive Order 13526. \u2026 In this case, I have determined that the release of the documents would foreseeably harm national security,\" Marine Maj. Gen. Matthew Trollinger, the chief of staff to Air Force Gen. Dagvin R.M. Anderson, the commander of U.S. Africa Command, wrote in his letter to CBS News.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that the IG's review \"affirms what the Administration has said from the beginning \u2014 no classified information was leaked, and operational security was not compromised.\"",
      "She went on to say, \"The President's entire national security team is doing great work advancing American interests while protecting sensitive information,\" adding, \"President Trump stands by Secretary Hegseth.\"",
      "In separate statements on Wednesday, the top Democrats on the House and Senate Intelligence Committees called for Hegseth to resign.",
      "Virginia Sen. Mark Warner said the report \"notes that the IG is aware of several other Signal chats Hegseth used for official business, underscoring that this was not an isolated lapse. It reflects a broader pattern of recklessness and poor judgment from a secretary who has repeatedly shown he is in over his head.\"",
      "\"Pete Hegseth's behavior and lack of judgment would be a fireable offense for anyone else in the Department of Defense,\" Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut said. \"What's more, his refusal to sit for an interview with the Inspector General or submit his device for examination is yet another example of his failure to take responsibility for his actions.\"",
      "Last month, Hegseth joked about the \"Signalgate\" scandal while speaking at Fox Nation's Patriot Awards after spotting United Nations Ambassador Mike Waltz in the audience.",
      "\"I see Mike Waltz \u2014 Mike, I'll hit you up on Signal later.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday formally announced a new immigration enforcement crackdown in New Orleans, the latest city led by Democrats to see a surge in Border Patrol agents tasked with carrying out President Trump's mass deportation campaign.",
      "DHS said it dubbed the operation \"Catahoula Crunch,\" confirming plans\u00a0reported by CBS News in mid-November. At the time, CBS News reported that Border Patrol was planning to dispatch roughly 200 agents to New Orleans, to oversee operations there targeting people suspected of being in the U.S. illegally. Internal agency documents showed officials requested armored vehicles for the operation.",
      "CBS News spoke Wednesday with Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino outside U.S. Customs and Border Protection's office in the city. Bovino said they'd be in the Big Easy \"until the mission is accomplished,\" and that so far they've arrested \"a lot, and still counting.\" There are \"several hundred agents\" spread across the New Orleans area, Bovino said.",
      "In a statement earlier Wednesday, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the administration targeted New Orleans because of local policies that limit cooperation between local law enforcement officials and federal immigration authorities.",
      "\"Catahoula Crunch targets include violent criminals who were released after arrest for home invasion, armed robbery, grand theft auto, and rape,\" McLaughlin added. \"Under President Trump and Secretary [Kristi] Noem, we are restoring law and order for the American people.\"",
      "Catahoulas are the official state dogs of Louisiana.",
      "Two U.S. officials told CBS News that DHS has asked the Department of Defense for permission to use Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base New Orleans as a staging area for immigration operations.",
      "Coinciding with the DHS announcement, the FBI's field office in New Orleans said it was partnering with the Louisiana State Police to protect the federal immigration agents deployed to the area and to curtail \"attempts to obstruct law enforcement actions.\"",
      "Earlier this week, Mr. Trump said he was planning to deploy National Guard troops to New Orleans for a separate anti-crime operation \"in a couple of weeks,\" though the administration has not announced an exact date. Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, a Republican, has welcomed the plan to dispatch National Guard members, saying the deployment is needed to curb violent crime.",
      "The Border Patrol crackdown in New Orleans is the most recent immigration enforcement operation launched by the second Trump administration in a Democratic-controlled city. The administration has deployed hundreds of Border Patrol agents to cities far away from a U.S. border, including Los Angeles, Chicago and Charlotte, North Carolina.",
      "Border Patrol's operations, led by controversial commander Bovino, have been met with harsh criticism from some local residents and elected officials, who have accused Bovino and his agents of inflaming tensions through aggressive arrests and heavy-handed tactics against protesters and other civilians. A federal judge in the Chicago area ruled that Border Patrol's use of force had been excessive.",
      "But Bovino has also been praised by supporters as a no-nonsense enforcer of Mr. Trump's mass deportation campaign. He has defended his agents' actions, including their use of force against protesters, as justified given violent acts by some individuals.",
      "Who Border Patrol has been arresting in these operations has also garnered controversy. In Los Angeles, Chicago and Charlotte, Border Patrol agents have been depicted on video smashing car windows and arresting day laborers and other workers during \"roving patrols\" at Home Depot parking lots and other locations.",
      "While Bovino and other Trump administration officials have said Border Patrol is primarily targeting immigrants in the U.S. illegally who also have committed serious crimes, CBS News reported last month that out of roughly 270 arrests in the Charlotte area, fewer than 90 detainees \u2014 roughly one third \u2014 were classified as criminals.",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 17:43:35 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration proposed rules that would weaken fuel economy standards for vehicles set under President Biden in 2024.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is proposing new fuel economy standards for vehicles that would roll back efficiency rules implemented under former President Biden.",
      "Under the Transportation Department proposal, which was unveiled at a White House event on Wednesday, automakers would need to meet less stringent vehicle mileage requirements.",
      "Federal fuel economy rules are overseen by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) under what's known as the\u00a0CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) Standards. Enacted by Congress in 1975, the regulations stipulate how many miles vehicles must be able to drive on a gallon of fuel, with specific standards for light-duty vehicles, as well as medium- and heavy-duty trucks.",
      "The rules aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help consumers save money on gas, according to the Transportation Department. Critics of the fuel standards have long argued they are costly for automakers, which must make technological improvements to reduce fuel usage, raising vehicle prices.",
      "The revamped fuel standards would reverse a Biden policy that \"forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse,\" Mr. Trump said on Wednesday.",
      "Rules would sharply lower mileage standard",
      "If finalized, the plan would relax fuel economy standards by setting the industry average for light-duty vehicles at roughly 34.5 miles per gallon through the 2031 model year, lower than the 50 miles per gallon outlined by a Biden-era rule.",
      "On Wednesday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the previous rules drove up the cost of new cars and were \"completely unattainable\" for automakers. He initially\u00a0directed\u00a0NHTSA to review the CAFE regulations in January.",
      "The Transportation Department said the proposal is projected to save American families $1,000 on the average cost of a new vehicle and a total of $109 billion over the next five years.",
      "NHTSA Administrator Jonathan Morrison said the move to ease the mileage standards would make the nation's roads safer. \"Newer cars are safer cars and by reducing vehicle prices, more American families will be able to afford newer vehicles,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Mr. Trump was joined at Wednesday's event by senior auto industry executives.\u00a0In a statement shared with CBS News, Stellantis CEO Antonioa Filosa expressed support for the proposed fuel efficiency rules, saying the initiative would realign the CAFE standards \"with real-world market conditions as part of its wider vision for a growing U.S. automotive industry.\"",
      "General Motors also backed the proposed fuel economy standards, which would need to undergo an official rulemaking process before being adopted.",
      "\"GM supports the goals of NHTSA's proposed CAFE rule and its intention to better align fuel economy standards with market realities. We have long advocated for one national standard that upholds customer choice and provides the auto industry long-term stability,\" a spokesperson for the automaker said in a statement.",
      "The fuel economy proposal would roll back\u00a0a rule\u00a0finalized in June 2024 under the Biden administration aimed at raising the minimum gas mileage for passenger cars and light trucks by model year 2031.",
      "At the time, NHTSA said the new regulations would save Americans $23 billion at the gas pump and reduce pollution. Burning gas for vehicles is a major contributor to carbon emissions, which scientists have linked to climate change.",
      "The rules were also intended to spur automakers to produce more electric vehicles, a key Biden administration priority for the nation's transportation sector.",
      "Would new MPG rules ease car prices?",
      "CarEdge CEO Zach Shefka described the Trump administration proposal as a win for automakers, but said consumers shouldn't expect to see lower car prices right away. That's because automakers work at least five years ahead in their product development, he said, meaning it would take a while before any redesigned cars make it onto the road.",
      "If the proposal eventually does help lower vehicle prices, he said, \"It will happen years from now, not in the coming weeks or months.\"",
      "The Center for Biological Diversity, a nonprofit organization that works to protect endangered species, said the Transportation Department proposal will increase the country's oil consumption and undermine the competitiveness of U.S. automakers.",
      "\"Trump's action will feed America's destructive use of oil, while hamstringing us in the green tech race against Chinese and other foreign carmakers,\" said Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity's Safe Climate Transport Campaign.",
      "Wednesday's move is the latest effort by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged automakers to build cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles. The administration scrapped EV\u00a0tax credits\u00a0in September and has also proposed rules to eliminate\u00a0gas emission regulations.",

    "summary": "The U.S. has increased its reward to $5 million for information leading to the arrest of an alleged leader of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.",
    "story": [
      "The United States government on Wednesday increased its reward for information leading to the arrest of Giovanni Vicente Mosquera Serrano, an alleged leader of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Through an organized crime rewards program operated by the Department of State, officials are now offering up to $5 million for tips that could bring Serrano into custody and potentially convict him on myriad drug charges.",
      "Mosquera Serrano was the first alleged member of Tren de Aragua to be added to the FBI's \"most wanted\" list, according to the State Department. He was initially indicted in Texas district court in January and charged with international cocaine trafficking conspiracy, then recharged in a second indictment in April that additionally accused him of supporting a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "President Trump labeled Tren de Aragua\u00a0a foreign terrorist organization, alongside other gangs and cartels, when he retook office in January. His administration has since ratcheted up pressure on Venezuela and its president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. In recent months, the U.S. has amassed a large military presence in the Caribbean and carried out multiple\u00a0strikes on boats it claims are carrying drugs from Venezuela.",
      "Some lawmakers have questioned whether the strikes are legal, and the first in that string of attacks, a deadly strike in early September, has prompted new concerns from Congress\u00a0that a follow-on strike despite there apparently being survivors in the water may constitute a war crime.",
      "Tren de Aragua's members are accused of a lengthy record of violent crimes, including murder, human trafficking, rape, kidnapping, bribery and racketeering. Originally formed inside Venezuela's Tocor\u00f3n prison, Tren de Aragua expanded during the incarceration of Hector Rusthenford Guerrero Flores, the alleged head of the gang known as Ni\u00f1o Guerrero. U.S. authorities have said Guerrero came to control the prison in addition to a series of gold mines and border crossings between Venezuela and Colombia, before eventually escaping custody.",
      "Mosquera Serrano is among the alleged members of Tren de Aragua who have been sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which sanctioned 11 more alleged affiliates of the gang on Wednesday, according to the State Department.",
      "One of the latest rounds of sanctions also targeted Jimena Romina Araya Navarro, a Venezuelan entertainer known as \"Rosita,\" the U.S. Treasury announced, claiming she is a Tren de Aragua affiliate. Rosita is allegedly part of a group of five people in the entertainment industry who are accused of providing \"material support\" to the gang, according to the Treasury.

    "story": [
      "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been directed by the Trump administration to target undocumented Somali immigrants in the Twin Cities, a person familiar with the planning confirmed.",
      "A U.S. official says ICE is planning to surge resources to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area to launch immigration enforcement operations there targeting individuals with deportation orders. The region has the largest population of immigrants from Somalia in the U.S., some of whom have deportation orders.",
      "The enhanced ICE operations in the Twin Cities are expected to begin this week, the official said. The operations were\u00a0first reported by the New York Times.",
      "Hundreds of people are expected to be targeted, the person familiar with the planning said.",
      "Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the agency would not discuss \"future or potential operations.\"",
      "President Trump: \"I don't want [Somalis] in our country\"",
      "In the midst of Tuesday's reports, President Trump took further aim at Minnesota's Somali community, the country of Somalia and the diaspora at large.",
      "\"They contribute nothing \u2026 I don't want them in our country,\" Trump said to the press on Tuesday. \"That's not politically correct, but I don't care. I don't want them here. Their country is no good for a reason.\"",
      "In a\u00a0Thanksgiving post where he also called Gov. Tim Walz a slur for people with intellectual disabilities, Mr. Trump said Somali refugees are \"completely taking over the once great State of Minnesota.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also previously ordered all green card holders from Somalia and more than a dozen other countries to be reexamined and said he would end the temporary protected status for Somalis in Minnesota, claiming, without evidence, that \"Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great state.\" The latter move would affect hundreds in the community.",
      "Mr. Trump has become increasingly focused on people of Somali descent living in the U.S., saying recently that they \"have caused a lot of trouble,\" which is rhetoric that community leaders say has inflamed tensions and revived fears of profiling.",
      "On Monday evening, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also announced his department is investigating whether Minnesota tax money found its way to al Shabaab, a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization and al Qaeda affiliate based in Somalia.",
      "Minneapolis, St. Paul leaders stand in solidarity with Somali community",
      "In a joint news conference on Tuesday afternoon, the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul, along with Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara and Minneapolis City Council member Jamal Osman, said they are standing in solidarity with the metro's Somali community.",
      "\"To our Somali community, I love you, and we stand with you. That commitment is rock solid,\" said Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. \"Minneapolis is proud to be home to the largest Somali community in the entire country. They've been here for decades, in many instances. Entrepreneurs and fathers, they benefit both the cultures and the economic resilience of our city.\"",
      "Frey said the targeting of Minnesota's Somali population \"means due process will be violated.\"",
      "\"Mistakes will be made, and let's be clear, it means that American citizens will be detained, for no other reason than the fact that they look like they are Somali,\" Frey said. \"That is not now and will never be a legitimate reason.\"",
      "St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter said the actions of the Trump administration are \"un-American.\"",
      "\"I grew up in an America that prided itself on being a country of immigrants, that prided itself on the fact that people from other countries would look across a whole ocean and say that's where I want to be. It seems that what we learned was that we've prided ourselves and we have decades and generations of priding ourselves on being a beacon for immigration from Europe,\" Carter said. \"I mean, it seems to many of us, like, the darker-skinned the immigrants who come to our country are, the more our posture on immigration as a country has shifted. That's un-American. That's concerning.\"",
      "Carter said the Twin Cities need to unite to stand up for immigrants and refugees.",
      "\"The last thing that we need is federal agents coming to town attempting to turn us against each other, to turn us against ourselves. The last thing we need is federal agents coming in town to create chaos and challenge for us, and so we stand together,\" Carter said. \"We encourage folks to look to the organizations that serve immigrants and refugees across our community because we have constant reminders out there about what your rights are. You have rights, that's an American thing.\"",
      "Minneapolis City Council member Jamal Osman, who was born in Somalia, pulled no punches in his assessment of the president.",
      "\"One of the things I do want to say, and obviously everyone knows that our president is racist, xenophobic, Islamophobic, and we're going to fight that,\" Osman said. \"America has a history of fighting and stopping those kind of individuals who continue to divide people and divide communities.\"",
      "Osman said his community will remain firm amid the current climate of danger.",
      "\"Our community has lived through fear in the past, and we're not gonna let them divide that,\" Osman said.",
      "As head of the Minneapolis police, O'Hara reiterated that his police officers do not work with federal law enforcement who are conducting immigration enforcement.",
      "\"We don't provide information to federal immigration authorities,\" he said. \"We don't ask people about their immigration status. Our mission is clear: to protect life, to uphold the law and to maintain safety for all people in our communities.\"",
      "O'Hara added that officers will receive additional guidance later this week regarding the department's immigration policy.",
      "Many Somali Americans in Minnesota say they've felt a growing sense of uneasiness after Mr. Trump's continued rhetoric against Somalis, which has sparked frustration and fear.",
      "\"I was only 3 years old when I came and this is my home,\" Madino Mudey said. \"This has to stop.\"",
      "A few people at Minneapolis' busiest Somali mall say they noticed what they believe to be federal agents circling the property Tuesday, but authorities haven't confirmed that.",
      "Gov. Walz calls reports of ICE operation \"PR stunt\"",
      "On Tuesday afternoon, Walz responded to the reports that ICE would target undocumented Somalis in the Twin Cities, calling it \"a PR stunt.\"",
      "\"We welcome support in investigating and prosecuting crime,\" Walz added. \"Indiscriminately targeting immigrants is not a real solution to a problem.\"",
      "Minnesota has the largest Somali population in the U.S., with the latest census data showing about 80,000 (83,445) living in the Twin Cities metro area. More than 100,000 (107,087) total reside in Minnesota, according to the CBS News Data Team.  Many fled the long civil war in their East African country and were drawn to the state's welcoming social programs.",
      "Jaylani Hussein, a Somali American who is executive director of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said his group has heard of \"less than a dozen\" immigration arrests within the local Somali community in recent days.",
      "But Hussein said around 95% of Somalis in Minnesota are U.S. citizens, so the number of those at earlier stages of the immigration process is a \"pretty small\" proportion of the community. He said they estimate that 50% of the community was born in the U.S.",
      "The history behind Minnesota's Somali-American community",
      "Dr. Ahmed Samatar, the founding dean of the Kofi Annan Institute for Global Citizenship at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, spoke with WCCO in 2019 about why so many Somali-Americans have made \"the Land of 10,000 Lakes\" home.",
      "Samatar said it all began in 1991 with Somalia's civil war.",
      "\"Somalis, everyone, they have to flee,\" Samatar said. \"Whoever will take them in, they have to flee.\"",
      "Some stayed in Somalia but were internally displaced. Others went to refugee camps in neighboring countries. Many were sent to other countries all over the world.",
      "According to the Minnesota Department of Human Services, 13,582 Somali refugees came to Minnesota between 2005 and 2018.",
      "\"Of course, when some came, they will tell others about the good news of Minnesota,\" Samatar said. \"I call that the 'call of kinship.'\"",
      "He thinks there are a variety of reasons for what are called \"secondary arrivals,\" but there are a few that stand out. One is the support from local, volunteer resettlement agencies that work with governments to help refugees find housing, schooling and jobs.",
      "Samatar also cited Minnesota's strong economy, which gave Somali-Americans job opportunities \u2014 many in western Minnesota \u2014 schooling options, health care and a safe place to live.",
      "\"The state of Minnesota has always been considered a kind and successful place,\" he said.",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 14:33:47 -0500",
    "summary": "See maps of how Texas, California, Missouri, North Carolina and Indiana redistricting pushes could play out, based on the 2024 election results.",
    "story": [
      "North Carolina is the latest state to join a mid-decade redistricting gambit that could shake up next year's midterms \u2014 following similar moves by Missouri, Texas and California to redraw their congressional maps, and a separate court-ordered effort in Utah.",
      "The redistricting push began when President Trump last summer pressed Texas Republicans to redistrict and increase the number of GOP seats. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed legislation in August to redraw the districts and create five GOP-friendly seats, launching the first salvo in a battle that has spread to other states.",
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom,\u00a0in turn, launched an effort to redraw California's map to help Democrats. In November, the plan was approved by voters by a 29-point margin.",
      "In Missouri, state lawmakers redrew their map in September to squeeze Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver from his Kansas City district. Then in October, North Carolina state Republicans\u00a0redrew the 1st Congressional District, held by a Democrat, to make it more favorable to conservatives.",
      "In Indiana, despite their initial reluctance, lawmakers reconvened in December to redraw their congressional map, aiming to create two more Republican seats and change their U.S. House delegation from 7-2 to 9-0.",
      "Utah lawmakers also reworked their state's map after a judge ruled the current districts violated restrictions on gerrymandering. All four of the state's House districts are represented by Republicans, but a judge in November threw out the GOP-controlled legislature's map and ordered one that will create a Democratic-leaning district in Salt Lake City.",
      "Challenges remain in all states that are redoing their maps. In Texas, a federal court\u00a0blocked the state\u00a0from using the newly redrawn map in the upcoming midterm elections. The NAACP filed a lawsuit challenging Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe's authority to create Missouri's new map outside of a census year, and three other lawsuits have been filed. Despite getting the seal of approval by voters in California, state Republicans filed a lawsuit against Prop 50 after Election Day.",
      "Congressional maps are normally redrawn every 10 years after the U.S. Census reveals population shifts. But this rare mid-decade redistricting push was kicked off as Republicans seek to maintain \u2014 or even expand \u2014 their razor-thin majority in Congress in the 2026 midterm elections. Historically speaking, midterms are often a rebuke of the party in the White House.",
      "Abbott then called a special session of the Legislature with redistricting on the agenda. But two weeks into the 30-day special session, Texas Democrats fled the state to deny a quorum and prevent the legislation from coming to the floor.",
      "The Democrats ultimately returned after two weeks, and the legislation was passed, but they garnered significant national attention. Although California requires congressional maps to be approved by voters, Newsom vowed to redraw the state's districts to garner up to five seats for Democrats to counter Texas.",
      "Amid this push, other states have also started to discuss redistricting efforts, including Indiana and Florida, which could net Republicans several more seats.",
      "Although both parties are trying to rig their states' congressional districts to be favorable to themselves, the outcome is far from guaranteed.",
      "\"Computers and technology do give us a lot more ability to to make predictive statements about outcomes, but we're doing it \u2014 I think it's fair to say \u2014 in a very volatile environment politically, where things that we have seen as trends are sort of being turned on their heads,\" said Kareem Crayton, vice president of the Washington, D.C.-based the Brennan Center for Justice.",
      "Crayton noted several current issues that could factor heavily into voters' decisions, and called it \"folly to assume that just because people showed up and voted for the current president of the United States, that people want to show up for a member of Congress, particularly \u2026 a new candidate in a district that hasn't been created before.\"",
      "See maps of how Texas, California and Missouri's push could play out, based on the 2024 election results:",
      "Texas has 38 congressional seats, with 25 held by Republicans and 13 by Democrats.",
      "Republicans have invested heavily in the Rio Grande Valley, once a Democratic stronghold, but they've made inroads. In 2024, two of the three Rio Grande Valley House seats voted for Mr. Trump, though they reelected their Democratic congressional representatives. The maps were designed to increase those gains and box out the two Democrats.",
      "Texas Democrats have recently made gains in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and Houston's Harris County. The new maps reshape Democratic Rep. Al Green's Houston district in the rural areas, making a district that was 72% Democratic into one that is 40% Democratic. The proposed map also changes Rep. Julie Johnson's Dallas-area district from 62% to 41% Democratic. Rep. Marc Veasey's district in Dallas-Fort Worth remains a Democratic stronghold, but he would no longer live in the district.",
      "Liberal Austin is further dissolved into neighboring districts. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, who was first elected in 1994 and whose district gave former Vice President Kamala Harris her largest margin of victory in all of Texas, announced in August that he would not seek reelection if the proposed maps are upheld by the courts, avoiding a primary with Rep. Greg Casar, also of Austin.",
      "On Nov. 18, a three-judge panel in the U.S. District Court in El Paso blocked Texas from using the maps approved by the legislature in August. The court said that the plaintiffs will likely succeed in showing that race predominated over partisanship in the map-making process, and said the legislature appears to have set and followed a racial target.",
      "California has 52 House representatives, with nine Republicans and 43 Democrats.",
      "In 2020, Republicans flipped three seats held by Democrats for the first time since 1994. They've hung onto two of them, including GOP Rep. David Valadao's 22nd District in the Central Valley.",
      "Under the proposed map, Valadao's district would go from being 47% Democratic in 2024 to 49% Democratic, making him slightly more vulnerable. And GOP Rep. Darrell Issa's 48th District near San Diego would change from 42% to 52% Democratic.",
      "In Southern California, Rep. Ken Calvert's 41st District in Riverside would be redrawn further toward Los Angeles, shifting it from a district that was 47% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 57% Democratic under the proposed maps.",
      "In Northern California, GOP Rep. Doug LaMalfa's District 1, which includes the northeastern-most part of the state, would shift further south toward Marin County and the northern part would be absorbed in the 2nd District, home to heavily Democratic Eureka and the northern Pacific coast. Rep. Kevin Kiley's district, which snakes along the California-Nevada border through Death Valley, would instead move further toward heavily Democratic Sacramento. Republican Rep. Tom McClintock's 5th District would be shifted to include the southern portions of what was Kiley's district.",
      "Kiley, whose district would go from one that was 48% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 55% Democratic, has been an outspoken critic of redistricting, even introducing legislation in the House to ban mid-decade redistricting.",
      "After Texas and California's redistricting efforts, Gov. Kehoe called a special session of Missouri's legislature to take up redistricting. Missouri currently has two Democratic representatives in Congress: Rep. Wesley Bell, who represents St. Louis and was first elected in 2025, and Cleaver, who has represented the Kansas City area since 2005.",
      "As Missouri has trended toward Republicans over the past 20 years, Cleaver's district has been a target of the GOP, especially in the 2021 redistricting when several lawmakers pushed for what was called the \"7 to 1 map\" that would have redrawn the 5th Congressional District to be more Republican. Lawmakers ultimately decided against that plan. St. Louis' NPR station reported that Republicans worried that the short-term gains from carving up the district could lead to long-term problems in the neighboring suburban districts.",
      "Nonetheless, the Missouri GOP joined the redistricting effort in 2025. Under the new map, Cleaver's district transforms from one that is 62% Democratic to one that is 41% Democratic. Cleaver says he still plans to run for reelection.",
      "The neighboring 4th and 6th Districts both become slightly bluer, to 39% and 36% Democratic, respectively, but they are still safely Republican.",
      "By expanding the 2nd District south and west, GOP Rep. Ann Wagner's district becomes redder, going from 46% Democratic in 2024 to 44%. While Wagner has maintained her grip on the district, Mr. Trump won by only 100 votes under the previous lines in 2020. In the 2021 redistricting, Wagner's district lost some of the Democratic-leaning St. Louis County.",
      "North Carolina has 14 congressional seats, 10 of which are held by Republicans. But the state is not as solidly red as that breakdown would suggest \u2014 it's closer to a 50/50 state at the presidential level these days, and the state's governor and attorney general are both Democrats.",
      "In the redistricting push undertaken this fall, North Carolina Republicans are targeting a single seat: Rep. Don Davis' 1st Congressional District. Davis' win in 2024 in the northeastern part of the state was a rare bright spot for Democrats, especially after Republicans were able to flip congressional three seats in North Carolina that year.",
      "In the map passed by the North Carolina Assembly on Oct. 21 and 22, Davis' district boundaries move further south, into the current 3rd District. That changes the makeup of the district from one that was 48% Democratic to one that is 44% Democratic.",
      "Indiana state lawmakers initially resisted the Trump administration's pressure to redraw their map to edge out the two Democratic seats. When Republican Gov. Mike Braun called a special session in November, Senate President Rodric Bray said publicly the votes weren't there, and when the legislature convened, it only agreed to meet again in January for the regular session.",
      "But lawmakers reversed course in November and said they would reconvene take up redistricting. On Dec. 1, Indiana House Republicans unveiled their proposed map, which significantly changes the boundaries of District 1 and District 7.",
      "In the proposed map, District 1, which includes Gary, Indiana, and other Chicago suburbs, is redrawn so voters are spread through Districts 2 and 4. All three districts are between 40-44% Democratic under the proposed map. The map would also break up the heavily Democratic District 7, which currently includes most of Indianapolis and backed Harris with 71% of its vote. It would be split, with its population absorbed into several Republican districts.",
      "There are still several GOP holdouts in the Indiana Senate. The contentious debate over redistricting has led to threats against bomb threats and swatting attempts against lawmakers, the FBI said. But Braun, who has also been targeted, posted on social media in November that he told Mr. Trump that he's \"committed\" to pursuing redistricting.",
      "Utah redistricting",
      "Utah differs from the other states here, among other reasons, because there are no Democrats among the four members of its congressional delegation. And its 2025 redistricting effort was put in motion when a judge ruled the current districts violated a voter-approved measure to prevent partisan gerrymandering.",
      "The GOP-controlled legislature produced four maps for public comment, and on Oct. 6, approved a map that would be the least competitive for Democrats. The legislature proposed a map that would split Salt Lake County into two districts, which would make Districts 2 and 3 more competitive for Democrats.",
      "But a district court judge in Utah on Nov. 10 rejected redistricting maps selected by the Republican-controlled legislature and instead selected a map that would create a Democratic-leaning congressional district in Salt Lake City. The map approved by the legislature \"does not comply with Utah law,\" wrote 3rd District Court Judge Dianna Gibson in her opinion. She continued that \"based on the evidence presented,\" the legislature's map \"unduly favors Republicans and disfavors Democrats.\"",
      "The maps enacted by Gibson create a new district encompassing Salt Lake City that would be 62% Democratic, based on the 2024 presidential results.",

      "The data, released by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and published by the Deportation Data Project on Monday, shows detentions of people without criminal records spiked in recent months in those cities.",
      "From early September, when the Chicago operation began, to mid-October, average daily book-ins to temporary detention facilities in Chicago or nearby Broadview increased from about three people a day without criminal records to more than 45, a jump of more than 1,400%. Fewer than 25 people with criminal charges or convictions were detained per day on average by mid-October, the data shows.",
      "Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., average daily detentions of people without criminal records peaked at 37 per day in late August. Throughout that month and into September, a daily average of fewer than 10 people with criminal charges or convictions were booked, about the same number as before the crackdown began.",
      "In Los Angeles, total immigration arrests have declined since the summer, when agents carried out the most raids. In June and July, 63% of those initially detained in L.A.-area facilities did not have criminal records.",
      "The data only captures the start of the federal deployment in Memphis, Tennessee, but reflects a similar pattern: more than half of detentions in Memphis' hold center in the first two weeks of October were of people with only civil immigration violations.",
      "Unlike other cities, Portland, Oregon, where federal troops were deployed starting in June, has seen an approximately even split in detentions of those with criminal convictions, those with pending charges and those with only civil immigration violations in the summer and early fall.",
      "Border Patrol agents have played a role in the operations, especially in Chicago and L.A., alongside ICE. Those they arrest are held in ICE detention centers and included in the data.",
      "In its public statements on its immigration operations across the country, the Department of Homeland Security repeatedly said it will be largely focusing on those with criminal records. In a news release announcing the Chicago operation, dubbed \"Operation Midway Blitz,\" DHS said it would target the \"worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens,\" accusing Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker of releasing \"gang members, rapists, kidnappers, and drug traffickers on Chicago's streets.\"",
      "In contrast, border czar Tom Homan and acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement director Todd Lyons have said anyone authorities find to be in the U.S. illegally will be arrested. While the federal government has the authority to arrest anyone suspected of violating U.S. immigration law, some individuals may be eligible for certain protections from deportation, such as those with asylum claims.",
      "In response to reporting on the high number of non-criminals arrested, DHS has asserted that 70% of those arrested by ICE since the start of the second Trump administration have had criminal charges or convictions. Overall, that figure is roughly accurate, according to the newly released data, which shows that 66% of those arrested from Jan. 20 to Oct. 15 had criminal charges or convictions.",
      "But that percentage has shrunk each month since April, the data shows. Those with only civil immigration violations have become the fastest-growing group held in ICE detention.",
      "About 7% of those detained were convicted of violent crimes, including murder, rape, assault and robbery. The data does not indicate the severity of the charges for those who have not been convicted, which may range from serious felonies to misdemeanors and immigration-related crimes.",
      "\"Every single one of these illegal aliens broke our nation's laws by being in the country illegally, DHS spokesperson Trisha McLaughlin wrote on X in response to previous CBS News reporting.",
      "Being present in the U.S. illegally, after crossing the border or overstaying a visa, for example, has typically not been treated as a crime and generally handled as a civil violation in immigration court.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced Wednesday that he is pardoning Texas Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar, who was indicted last year on more than a dozen federal charges\u00a0related to bribery allegations.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the pardon for Cuellar and his wife, Imelda, on Truth Social, claiming their prosecution was the result of weaponization by the Justice Department under former President Joe Biden.",
      "\"Henry, I don't know you, but you can sleep well tonight \u2014 Your nightmare is finally over!\" the president wrote, alleging that Cuellar's opposition to Biden's immigration policies was the reason he was indicted.",
      "The president wrote that the Texas Democrat \"bravely spoke out against Open Borders and the Biden Border 'Catastrophe'\" and accused Biden of deliberately targeting the congressman and his wife \"simply for speaking the TRUTH.\"",
      "Mr. Trump included in his social media post a letter he received from Cuellar's daughters requesting clemency for their parents.",
      "The two women, Christina and Catherine Cuellar, wrote in their letter, dated Nov. 12, that they believed the congressman's \"independence and honesty may have contributed to how this case began.\"",
      "\"He has never been afraid to speak his mind, especially when it comes to protecting the people of South Texas and securing the border from policies of the previous administration,\" they told the president.",
      "Cuellar's daughters also appeared to reference Mr. Trump's own criminal cases, which they called his \"challenges.\" They said they prayed for the president and his family \"because we know that behind the headlines, there are real people who hurt, who love and who still hope for better days.\"",
      "Mr. Trump faced federal charges in two cases brought by former special counsel Jack Smith, though both\u00a0ended after he won the presidency last year. A state prosecution in Georgia related to the 2020 election was also dismissed last week. The president was convicted on 34 felony counts in New York in June 2024 and has appealed the conviction.",
      "Cuellar thanked Mr. Trump for the pardon and for \"taking the time to look at the facts.\"",
      "\"This decision clears the air and lets us move forward for South Texas.  This pardon gives us a clean slate. The noise is gone. The work remains. And I intend to meet it head on,\" he wrote on X. \"Thank you Mr. President, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.\"",
      "House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Cuellar \"is a well-respected member of the House of Representatives, a beloved representative down in Laredo and across South Texas. And in my view, the right outcome has been achieved.\"",
      "In last year's indictment against the Cuellars, federal prosecutors accused them of accepting at least $598,000 in bribes from an oil and gas company owned by the government of Azerbaijan and a Mexican bank. They alleged that the bribes were laundered in the form of sham consulting contracts through front companies and middlemen into shell companies owned by Imelda Cuellar. The congressman's wife, according to the indictment, \"performed little or no legitimate\" work under the consulting contracts.",
      "The Justice Department also accused Cuellar of acting as a foreign agent to benefit the government of Azerbaijan.",
      "He and his wife faced 14 counts, including conspiracy, bribery and money laundering. They pleaded not guilty. A trial in Cuellar's case was set to begin in April.",
      "The congressman, who served as the top Democrat on the House Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, stepped down from the post while the case continued. Cuellar was elected to the House in 2005 and currently represents the 28th Congressional District, which stretches from San Antonio south to the U.S.-Mexico border. He\u00a0won reelection\u00a0last year, defeating his Republican opponent by more than 13,000 votes.",
      "The president's decision to grant clemency to Cuellar comes as Mr. Trump has faced backlash for his recent use of the pardon power, namely for providing reprieve to Juan Orlando Hernandez, the former president of Honduras who was convicted last year of helping to smuggle 400 tons of cocaine into the U.S.",
      "Hernandez had been sentenced to 45 years\u00a0in prison after he was found guilty of drug trafficking and weapons charges. But in announcing his decision to pardon Hernandez, Mr. Trump said he was treated \"very harshly and unfairly.\"",
      "Hernandez was released from a federal prison in West Virginia on Monday.",
      "While Mr. Trump pardoned Hernandez, his administration has also ordered strikes on vessels in the Caribbean that were allegedly carrying drugs.",
      "The move by the president could also have political reverberations. The National Republican Congressional Committee targeted Cuellar's seat as a potential pick-up for Republicans in next year's midterm elections. His district was also among those redrawn by Texas Republicans during their mid-decade redistricting this summer to bolster the GOP's chances of holding onto their House majority, though it shifted only slightly from an estimated 46% Democratic share under the old lines to 45% Democratic share under the new boundaries.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, issued a subpoena Wednesday to former special counsel Jack Smith as part of the committee's probe into the federal prosecutions of President Trump.",
      "Jordan wrote in a letter to Smith and his lawyers that the panel wants him to answer questions from House investigators at a closed-door deposition on Dec. 17 and requested documents that must be turned over by Dec. 12. It's unclear what records Jordan, an Ohio Republican, is seeking from Smith.",
      "\"The Committee on the Judiciary is continuing to conduct oversight of the operations of the Office of Special Counsel you led \u2014 specifically, your team's prosecutions of President Donald J. Trump and his co-defendants,\" he\u00a0wrote. \"Due to your service as Special Counsel, the Committee believes that you possess information that is vital to its oversight of this matter.\"",
      "Peter Koski, a lawyer for Smith, indicated that the former special counsel will comply with Jordan's subpoena. He noted that the former special counsel had offered back in October to voluntarily answer questions in an open hearing before the Judiciary Committee about the investigations involving Mr. Trump.",
      "\"We are disappointed that offer was rejected, and that the American people will be denied the opportunity to hear directly from Jack on these topics,\" he said. \"Jack looks forward to meeting with the committee later this month to discuss his work and clarify the various misconceptions about his investigation.\"",
      "Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, accused Republicans and the Trump administration of mounting a \"coordinated campaign to smear\" Smith and his team for their investigation into Mr. Trump and his allies related to their alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election.",
      "\"Chairman Jordan has denied Special Counsel Jack Smith's offer to speak publicly to the whole Congress and the whole country about his investigations into Donald Trump, instead demanding he comply with a subpoena for a closed-door, private session simply so Republicans can spin, distort, and cherry-pick his remarks through press leaks,\" he said in a statement. \"What are our colleagues so afraid of, that they won't let the American people hear directly from the Special Counsel?",
      "Raskin, of Maryland, said Smith followed the proper legal principles, protocols and guidelines throughout his probe and took \"careful investigative steps.\"",
      "\"Judiciary Committee Republicans want to force the Special Counsel into the shadows of a backroom interrogation and subject him to the tiresome and loathsome partisan tactics of leak-and-distort, when the American public is demanding transparency and a public hearing,\" he said.",
      "The GOP-led Judiciary Committee is investigating what it claims were the \"politically motivated\" prosecutions of Mr. Trump, which were led by Smith. The president was indicted on more than 40 federal charges in two separate cases. The first alleged he unlawfully held onto government documents marked classified after leaving the White House in 2021, and the second stemmed from his alleged efforts to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election.",
      "The president has long denied wrongdoing and claimed Smith's investigations were politically motivated \"witch hunts\" that intended to harm his candidacy for the White House.",
      "Both cases were brought to an end after Mr. Trump won a second term in November 2024.",
      "Still, with the president back in office and Republicans in control of both chambers of Congress, Smith has become a subject of investigations from GOP lawyers and the Office of Special Counsel, an independent agency that is unrelated to Smith's former position as special counsel. Mr. Trump has also continued to attack Smith, calling him \"deranged\" and a \"criminal.\"",
      "His lawyers called the ethics probe\u00a0by the Office of the Special Counsel \"imaginary and unfounded.\"",
      "Smith resigned from the Justice Department before Mr. Trump was inaugurated in January, but provided a two-volume final report on his investigations involving Mr. Trump to then-Attorney General Merrick Garland before leaving his post.",
      "The\u00a0first volume\u00a0pertains to the investigation that stemmed from alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, and it was submitted to Congress in mid-January. But the second volume, which covers Mr. Trump's handling of sensitive government documents, has not been made public.",
      "Garland said in January that he would not release the second volume of Smith's final report because a criminal case involving two of Mr. Trump's co-defendants was ongoing. But after Mr. Trump began his second term, the case against the two, aide Walt Nauta and former Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos de Oliveira,\u00a0was tossed out.",
      "But a federal prosecutor in Miami and Mr. Trump's personal lawyers\u00a0continue to argue that the second volume should be kept out of public view.",

    "story": [
      "A Ukrainian lawmaker told CBS News on Wednesday that President Trump should not approach peacemaking efforts with Russia like a business deal, saying the American leader must \"understand he cannot trade with Putin\" as the \"aggressor\" in the war, which is nearing its four-year mark.",
      "Lisa Yasko, a member of Ukraine's parliament from the same party as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, spoke with CBS News after high-level talks in Moscow between Putin and U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff failed to yield any breakthroughs.",
      "Yasko said that was largely due to Putin's lukewarm interest in achieving peace.",
      "\"[Putin] was smiling so much at this meeting with Witkoff, but absolutely this is not about the peace itself,\" she said. \"He's interested in showing that he's geopolitically active ... how cool you are, how Americans are treating you and that you are not a war criminal.\"",
      "\"President Trump can be very transactional, in a good way also,\" Yasko told CBS News. \"But you cannot make peace with only economic deals. You cannot go that far as pleasing an aggressor. I believe there are certain lines.\"",
      "The Tuesday meeting in the Russian capital, which also included Mr. Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, was part of a concerted push by the White House to broker an agreement based on a Trump administration proposal.",
      "That proposal was initially floated by the White House weeks ago as a 28-point plan, but Ukraine and its European partners balked at calls for Kyiv to cede occupied territory to Russia, and the draft was later amended during talks with Ukrainian and European officials.",
      "After the five-hour round of talks on Tuesday, Yuri Ushakov, a senior adviser to Putin, told reporters the conversation was \"rather useful, constructive, rather substantive,\" but that \"we are no closer to resolving the crisis in Ukraine, and there is much work to be done.\"",
      "When asked by CBS News if she believed Putin was just playing for time by continuing to meet, Yasko said the Russian strongman's true intention was clear: to change the global order and assert Russia as a key powerbroker.",
      "\"Putin is trying to have his new world order by playing a central part in the [global] economy with China and the U.S. and with other parts of the world,\" Yasko said. \"Now Trump is offering a deal with benefits for [the] Russian economy. It's insanity for all of us here in Ukraine.\"",
      "Putin, speaking before the talks in Moscow on Tuesday, accused America's European allies of standing in the way of Mr. Trump's efforts to broker a peace deal, saying he wasn't looking for a conflict with Europe, but adding that Russia was \"ready for war.\"",
      "Yasko urged Mr. Trump to come and see for himself the impact of Russia's ongoing full-scale invasion on Ukraine and its people \u2014 a trip Zelenskyy has also repeatedly urged his American counterpart to make.",
      "\"He should come here first,\" she told CBS News. \"He should see what happened in Ukraine. He should see the faces, the eyes of people.\"",
      "Yasko called the peace deal initially put forward by the Trump administration \"insulting\" to Ukraine.",
      "Many European leaders have voiced concern that if Russia is given what it wants in exchange for a ceasefire in Ukraine, it would set a dangerous precedent of appeasing a unilateral landgrab, and it could encourage Russia to increase threats against their countries.",

    "summary": "A bipartisan deal on health care remains elusive in the Senate with a key vote on Affordable Care Act tax credits set for next week.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A bipartisan deal on health care remains elusive in the Senate with a key vote on Affordable Care Act tax credits set for next week.",
      "\"The conversations continue,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Tuesday. \"I don't think at this point we have a clear path forward, I don't think the Democrats have a clear path forward \u2014 and they're the ones that are going to have to put forward their plan to get voted on next week.\"",
      "A group of Senate Democrats last month secured a vote to address expiring Affordable Care Act enhanced tax credits, which were at the heart of the government shutdown fight, as part of the deal to reopen the government. That vote is set to occur next week, when Democrats will have the opportunity to present the legislation of their choice.",
      "Democrats could pursue a compromise position that stands a chance at earning the 60 votes needed to advance, or they could seek an extension that wouldn't pick up enough support from Republicans but would force GOP members to take a politically uncomfortable vote. Millions of Americans are due to see their health insurance premiums skyrocket in the new year without action from Congress.",
      "Dwindling prospects for a bipartisan compromise",
      "Republicans have been critical of the Affordable Care Act since it became law in 2010. But with premiums set to rise with the expiration of the tax credits, which help pay for health insurance premiums for plans purchased on state exchanges, some GOP lawmakers have acknowledged a need for a short-term extension. And the planned vote next week puts pressure on Republicans to come together on a strategy.",
      "Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said Tuesday that there are some in the GOP conference who want to work with Democrats \"in a constructive way on something that could be a bipartisan solution, but that hasn't landed yet.\"",
      "Among the issues at the center of the impasse is the Hyde amendment, which restricts federal funding for abortions. Thune called it a \"difficult, challenging\" issue for both sides. The majority leader told reporters Wednesday that \"our members are very committed, obviously, and with good reason, to ensuring that the Hyde protections apply to Obamacare policies.\"",
      "\"The Democrats clearly have a different view, and that has always been probably one of the biggest obstacles to getting a deal,\" Thune said. \"That one is a really challenging one.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said \"as long as Republicans are wedded to expanding Hyde, they can't even talk about anything else.\"",
      "On Democrats' position more broadly, the New York Democrat said Tuesday that \"we're willing to talk to anybody who's willing to lower costs,\" but he claimed \"the Republicans are in total disarray and have no plan.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, a top progressive voice in the chamber, told reporters Tuesday that he wants a clean, multi-year extension of the tax credits, \"but I understand that's not likely to get 13 Republican votes.\"",
      "\"So yeah, I'm certainly open for a one-year extension, some restrictions on income,\" he said. \"But it just doesn't seem like Republicans are interested in anything. I mean, they might not even offer their own proposal because it appears that they can't even get 53 votes on anything related to extending these subsidies.\"",
      "Republicans work to coalesce around a strategy",
      "Thune said Senate Republicans had a \"robust discussion\" at their conference lunch meeting Tuesday and heard from two top committee chairs. But there was no apparent breakthrough. He said Republicans \"continue to coalesce\" around a health care solution, with a number of ideas percolating in recent weeks.",
      "Multiple Senate Republicans said after the lunch meeting that they expect that GOP leadership will put forward a bill alongside the Democrat-led ACA measure for Republicans to vote on if Democrats pursue a partisan approach, a move which would alleviate pressure on their conference. But Thune said until they know what the Democrats are planning to put forward, \"we won't probably have our strategy ready.\"",
      "Without a negotiated bipartisan approach, neither bill would be likely to get the votes needed to advance. And what that GOP legislation looks like remains to be seen.",
      "Sen. John Hoeven, a North Dakota Republican, told reporters that \"if the Democrats want to keep working, we're willing to do that.\"",
      "\"If they say, 'nope, we want to have a vote,' we'll have a plan,\" Hoeven said. \"It's not finalized yet, but we'll obviously have something ready to go. We've got a lot of good ideas.\"",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, has outlined his proposal aimed at lowering health care costs in recent weeks. His plan would take roughly the same amount of money that would be needed to extend the enhanced ACA tax credits and put that into health savings accounts for those who use bronze plans. The idea is that people would save on premiums by switching to the bronze plans, while they would also be able to use the HSA funds toward their deductibles.",
      "Meanwhile, Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, unveiled another proposal ahead of the Thanksgiving break. Scott framed his bill as something that could drive down costs by giving people options. The proposal would create HSA-style accounts to pay for health insurance.",
      "\"Mine's pretty simple \u2014 if you like your Obamacare, keep your Obamacare,\" Scott told CBS News.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, told reporters Tuesday that he plans to pitch a proposal to effectively end taxes on health care costs. He said the idea would work in conjunction with \"some form of premium support.\"",
      "Thune also lauded an idea that would allow individuals to sign up for \"association\" health care coverage, in which small businesses and the self-employed collectively purchase coverage to lower costs. The proposal would allow companies like Costco and Walmart to offer health policies across state lines.",
      "\"I think it's a great idea, something we've been for for a long time,\" Thune said. \"It's always been resisted by Democrats, but buying across state lines, allowing people to join larger groups, to get into the group market, out of the individual market \u2026 That is a way that you could significantly address the issue of cost and affordability.\"",
      "Waiting on the White House",
      "The debate within the Senate GOP is happening in anticipation of input from the White House. Last week, reports indicated that the White House was planning to propose a two-year extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits with new limits. But the proposal seemed to dissipate after GOP lawmakers resisted, and President Trump told reporters he prefers a plan to give money directly to people over insurance companies and would rather not extend the subsidies.",
      "\"Somebody said I want to extend them for two years, I don't want to extend them for two years,\" Mr. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. \"I'd rather not extend them at all. It may be, some kind of an extension may be necessary to get something else done, because the Unaffordable Care Act has been a disaster.\"",
      "As the president's advisers were drafting a plan to continue the subsidies for an additional two years, Speaker Mike Johnson had told the White House in a phone call with senior administration officials that most House Republicans have little interest in extending the Affordable Care Act's enhanced subsidies, sources familiar with the conversation told CBS News.",
      "White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett outlined the back and forth on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday.",
      "\"Sometimes people leak pre-decisional things that are confidential and pre-decisional,\" Hassett said. \"And I think that somebody did that, and then it rolled back because it hadn't been through the whole process, but President Trump has been clear that he's very concerned about the cost of health care.\"",
      "Hassett predicted that \"people are going to work this out\" before Christmas. He added that the White House has \"a solution for cost-sharing, and the Democrats have an alternative.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-hegseth-venezuela-boat-strikes-war-crimes-are-they-legal/",
    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 11:21:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Details about the strikes on an alleged drug boat on Sept. 2 have alarmed legal experts and lawmakers.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Scrutiny over the Trump administration's strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats has intensified following the revelation that the first U.S. attack on such a vessel involved at least two strikes, according to a Washington Post report. It said that after a first strike left two survivors, a subsequent strike killed them. A U.S. official confirms a total of four missiles were used.",
      "The Post also reported that Hegseth gave a verbal order to \"kill everybody\" in the Sept. 2 strike in the Caribbean Sea, though Hegseth has not confirmed this. He told reporters Tuesday that he did not see survivors in the live video he viewed and was not in the room when Navy Adm. Frank \"Mitch\" Bradley, the commander overseeing the operation, ordered a second strike. Bradley, according to the report, was complying with Hegseth's directive as two survivors clung to the wreckage.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Monday first confirmed a second strike on the boat was directed by Bradley, who, she said, \"worked well within his authority and the law \u2026 to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat of narco-terrorists to the United States was completely eliminated.\" Hegseth authorized Bradley to conduct the strikes, Leavitt said, though she denied that the defense secretary had given the order to kill them all.",
      "President Trump said Sunday he \"wouldn't have wanted\" the second strike and added that Hegseth had told him \"he did not order the death of those two men.\" Mr. Trump made similar comments on Tuesday, telling reporters that he did not have all the information about the second strike.",
      "Since the first strike on Sept. 2, the U.S. has carried out another 20 attacks through Nov. 15, killing more than 80 people the Trump administration alleges have been trafficking drugs in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean.",
      "Analysis from The Free Press: Killing Narco Speedboat Survivors is a War Crime",
      "Members of Congress \u2014 mostly Democrats \u2014 were already raising questions about the legality of the strikes and warned that a continued campaign against alleged drug smugglers in the region could escalate into war with Venezuela. The Post's report has further fueled debate about whether the U.S. is committing war crimes.",
      "In a notification to Congress in mid-September, the Trump administration said the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels it has designated as terrorist organizations. The drugs smuggled by these cartels kill tens of thousands of Americans each year and constitute an \"armed attack\" against U.S. citizens, according to the White House.",
      "\"We have legal authority. We're allowed to do that,\" Mr. Trump told reporters on Oct. 22. \"They killed 300,000 people last year. Drugs, these drugs coming in. They killed 300,000 Americans last year, and that gives you legal authority.\"",
      "But the opinion from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel justifying the strikes remains classified. A group of Senate Democrats asked for an \"expeditious declassification\" of the legal opinion in a letter last week to Hegseth and Attorney General Pam Bondi.",
      "\"Few decisions are more consequential for a democracy than the use of lethal force,\" they wrote. \"We therefore believe that the declassification and public release of this important document would enhance transparency in the use of deadly force by our nation's military and is necessary to ensure Congress and the American people are fully informed of the legal justification supporting these strikes.\"",
      "Consent from Congress",
      "Legal experts and lawmakers critical of the strikes have argued that the military action targeting the suspected drug smuggling boats was already legally dubious before the recent revelations because the president lacked the authority to carry them out.",
      "Under the War Powers Resolution of 1973, the president is required to consult Congress \"in every possible instance\" before introducing armed forces into hostilities, unless there has been a declaration of war or other congressional authorization.",
      "In emergency situations, the administration must report to Congress within 48 hours and cease hostilities within 60 days, absent congressional authorization. The 60-day deadline expired a month ago.",
      "The law was enacted in response to the Vietnam War as a check on the president's power to wage war without the consent of Congress.",
      "When asked in early November whether the administration planned to seek congressional authorization, a senior administration official replied that the 1973 resolution \"has been understood to apply to placing U.S. servicemembers in harm's way.\"",
      "The official suggested that the attacks pose no threat to service members, since the strikes have been largely carried out by drones launched from naval vessels \"at distances too far away for the crews of the targeted vessels to endanger American personnel.\" The official added that the administration does not consider the strikes against the alleged drug traffickers as \"hostilities.\"",
      "Congress has not authorized the use of military force against Venezuela. Republicans have largely asserted that the president is acting under his Article II constitutional authority, and Senate Republicans have twice blocked bipartisan efforts aimed at preventing Mr. Trump from continuing military action in the region without congressional approval.",
      "But the new details about the Sept. 2 strike appear to have shifted some opinions. The Republican-led Senate and House Armed Services committees have opened bipartisan investigations into the circumstances of the first attack.",
      "\"Nothing magic about calling something a terrorist organization,\" says former military prosecutor",
      "The Trump administration's claim of a \"non-international armed conflict\" is also flawed, experts say, because drug cartels are not considered organized armed groups under the law of armed conflict.",
      "\"There is no international armed conflict because, inter alia, there are neither hostilities between States nor the requisite degree of State control over alleged drug cartels operating the boats. And there is no non-international armed conflict, both because the cartels concerned do not qualify as organized armed groups in the [law of armed conflict] sense, and because there were no hostilities between the United States and the cartels on Sept. 2, let alone hostilities that would reach the requisite level of intensity to cross the armed conflict threshold,\" legal experts Michael Schmitt, Ryan Goodman and Tess Bridgeman wrote in a Dec. 1 piece published by Just Security.",
      "Designating drug cartels as terrorist organizations also does not give the administration authority to use military force in the way that it has, said Brian Finucane, a senior adviser with the International Crisis Group and a former State Department lawyer.",
      "\"They don't have military hierarchies, don't have the capability to engage in combat operations, and so it's absurd to claim that the U.S. is somehow in an armed conflict with them,\" Finucane said.",
      "Victor Hansen, a former military prosecutor and law professor at New England Law Boston, said drug cartels would still be subject to civilian law even with the terrorist group designation.",
      "\"There's nothing magic about calling something a terrorist organization that then gives the president the authority to respond militarily,\" Hansen said.",
      "Trump \"wants it both ways,\" expert says",
      "The Trump administration's characterization of the strikes as an \"armed conflict\" imposes additional duties and responsibilities on how the strikes are carried out, according to Hansen.",
      "If the strikes have not already crossed a legal line, it's possible the alleged intentional killing of defenseless survivors may have.",
      "The Geneva Conventions, which are the core of the law of armed conflict, prohibit targeting civilians or members of the armed forces who are defenseless. The international treaties, which were adopted in 1949, also require the wounded to be \"collected and cared for.\"",
      "The Defense Department's Law of War Manual says, \"it is also prohibited to conduct hostilities on the basis that there shall be no survivors, or to threaten the adversary with the denial of quarter.\" The rule applies \"during non-international armed conflict.\"",
      "\"The president, he wants it both ways. He wants to call it an armed conflict, but then he doesn't even want to follow the rules of the armed conflict,\" Hansen said.",
      "Still, a change in protocol was implemented after the Sept. 2 strike to emphasize rescuing any survivors, the Post reported.",
      "Two men who survived a strike in the Caribbean on Oct. 16 were rescued by the U.S. Navy and repatriated to their countries of origin \u2014 Ecuador and Colombia. The strikes on Oct. 27 in the Pacific left one survivor, and Mexico led the search effort, but it suspended its search after four days, according to media reports.",
      "The second strike and what laws may have been broken",
      "There's growing debate about whether the follow-up strike that allegedly killed two survivors is a war crime.",
      "Congressional Democrats have said that if the reporting is accurate, the action does constitute a war crime. Republican Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, told \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that it would be \"an illegal act\" that is \"completely outside of anything that has been discussed with Congress.\"",
      "\"I think there's a broad consensus that it's illegal to kill people who are clinging to wreckage,\" GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky told reporters Tuesday.",
      "Lawmakers and military experts say that the next question is what laws may have been broken, and that largely depends on the laws governing the strikes.",
      "\"If we're not in an armed conflict to begin with, then the whole paradigm, the legal paradigm of the laws that govern an armed conflict, don't apply,\" Hansen said. \"So what does apply? Well, domestic law. Then, it's murder under domestic law because you can't kill somebody \u2014 even if you think they're a criminal \u2014 without adjudication.\"",
      "\"Arguably, no order to kill them is legal,\" Hansen added. \"Because under domestic law, we don't kill people without bringing them to trial and giving them due process.\"",
      "Finucane also believes the strikes would fall under domestic military law.",
      "\"Murder on the high seas is implicated, conspiracy to commit murder outside of the United States, then murder is also an offense under the Uniform Code of Military Justice,\" he said.",
      "If the operation is an armed conflict, as the Trump administration suggests, the actions could constitute a war crime.",
      "\"Orders to 'kill everybody,' which can reasonably be regarded as an order to give 'no quarter,' and to 'double-tap' a target in order to kill survivors, are clearly illegal under international law,\" a group of former military lawyers outlined in an assessment Saturday. \"In short, they are war crimes.\"",
      "Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta called the second strike a war crime in a CBS News interview\u00a0on Monday.",
      "\"The basic rules of war that are involved here make very clear that you do not strike wounded people in the water in order to kill them. You basically then are responsible to try to make sure you do everything to try to protect their lives at that point. And that is the concern right now, whether or not this really violated the rules of war and constituted a criminal act.\"",
      "In a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Hegseth said the U.S. has \"only just begun striking narco-boats and putting narco-terrorists at the bottom of the ocean.\" He noted a recent pause in strikes, explaining that \"it's hard to find boats to strike right now.\"",
      "\"Deterrence has to matter,\" he said. \"Not arrest and hand over and then do it again, the rinse-and-repeat approach of previous administrations.\"",
      "Eleanor  Watson\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 10:47:50 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump has previously suggested he's eyeing ways to run again for president. But he downplayed talk of a third term in his latest comments.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump has suggested in a handful of appearances in recent months and years that he's looking at ways to run again for president, though the Constitution limits any person to being elected to the office twice. But in his latest comments on the issue, the president downplayed talk of a third term.",
      "The president said in late October that he is \"not allowed to run\" again. When asked on Aug. 5 whether he'd run again, he said \"no, probably not,\" though he added, \"I'd like to.\"",
      "The comments came after he told NBC in March that he was \"not joking\" about seeking another term in office, after repeatedly publicly musing about the possibility. He also said at the time that despite the constitutional limitations, \"there are methods which you could do it.\"",
      "Trump supporters like former strategist Steve Bannon have called on the president to run again, and Rep. Andy Ogles, a Tennessee Republican, introduced a resolution earlier this year to amend the Constitution to allow Mr. Trump to be elected to another term. Senate Majority Leader John Thune also said of Mr. Trump's prospects of serving a third term, \"not without a change in the Constitution.\" He told reporters, \"I think that you guys keep asking the question and \u2026 I think he is having some fun with it, probably messing with you.\"",
      "Experts say changing the Constitution is extremely unlikely. Election law scholars\u00a0raised the possibility that talk of a third term, whatever its likelihood, may function as a show of strength to try to stave off the perception that Mr. Trump is a lame-duck president.",
      "Here's a timeline of Mr. Trump's comments on a third term:",
      "\"We're probably entitled to another four after that\"",
      "Mr. Trump flirted with additional time in office beyond two terms when he sought reelection in 2020. During a rally in Minden, Nevada, the president predicted he would win four more years in the White House, and even suggested that he could go on to another term after his second.",
      "\"We're going to win four more years in the White House. And then after that, we'll negotiate, right?\" Mr. Trump said. \"Because we're probably, based on the way we were treated, we're probably entitled to another four after that.\"",
      "\"Am I allowed to run again?\"",
      "Shortly after returning to office, Mr. Trump again made reference to another term at a rally in Las Vegas on Jan. 25.",
      "\"It will be the greatest honor of my life to serve, not once but twice \u2014 or three times or four times,\" Mr. Trump quipped to applause from the crowd, before adding that \"no, it will be to serve twice.\"",
      "Then on Jan. 27, Mr. Trump joked to Republican lawmakers about a third term. Speaking before the House GOP conference in Florida, Mr. Trump touted the money he'd raised for another race that he said \"I assume I can't use for myself.\"",
      "\"But I'm not 100% sure because, I don't know,\" the president continued, to laughter from House Republicans. \"I think I'm not allowed to run again. I'm not sure. Am I allowed to run again?\"",
      "\"Should I run again? You tell me.\"",
      "At the National Prayer Breakfast on Feb. 6, Mr. Trump said, \"They say I can't run again \u2014 that's the expression.\"",
      "\"Then somebody said, 'I don't think you can.' Oh,\" the president added.",
      "On Feb. 20, the president again joked about an additional term at a White House event to mark Black History Month, as he celebrated the support he saw from Black Americans in the 2024 election.",
      "\"Should I run again? You tell me,\" Mr. Trump said, as supporters chanted, \"four more years!\"",
      "\"There are methods\"",
      "In an interview with NBC's Kristen Welker on March 30, Mr. Trump said, \"I'm not joking\" about serving a third term, and for the first time mentioned an awareness of potential paths.",
      "\"There are methods which you could do it,\" Mr. Trump said in a phone interview, adding that \"it is far too early to think about it.\"",
      "The president pointed to his favorability rating and suggested that Americans would like him to serve a third term. Mr. Trump told Welker, \"I have had more people say, 'please run again,'\" while noting \"we have a long way to go before we even think about that.\" On Air Force One Sunday night, he\u00a0spoke\u00a0with reporters and briefly addressed questions about a third term and reiterated that it's still a distant consideration.",
      "\"No matter how you look at it, we've got a long time to go. We have a long time. You know, we have almost four years to go,\" Mr. Trump told reporters. \"But despite that, so many people are saying, 'you've got to run again.' They love the job.\"",
      "While speaking to reporters on Monday in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump denied that he has ever looked into running for another term.",
      "\"People are asking me to run,\" he said. \"There's a whole story about running for a third term. I don't know. I never looked into it. They do say there's a way you can do it. But I don't know about that. But I have not looked into it.\"",
      "Mr. Trump was also asked whether it would open the door to Democrats running former President Barack Obama, who served two consecutive terms, against him.",
      "\"I'd love that,\" Mr. Trump said. \"That would be a good one. I'd like that.\"",
      "\"I'll be a two-term president\"",
      "In another interview with Welker conducted on May 2, Mr. Trump downplayed talk of seeking another term. The president said \"so many people want me to do it,\" saying he has \"never had requests so strong as that.\" But he added that \"it's something that, to the best of my knowledge, you're not allowed to do.\"",
      "\"This is not something I'm looking to do,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I'm looking to have four great years, and turn it over to somebody \u2014 ideally a great Republican, a great Republican \u2014 to carry it forward. But I think we're going to have four years and I think four years is plenty of time to do something really spectacular.\"",
      "Asked about moves by his allies to make another term possible, like by seeking a constitutional amendment, the president said \"that's because they like the job I'm doing, and it's a compliment. It's really a great compliment.\"",
      "\"There are ways of doing it,\" the president added, alluding to a possible write-in vote or move to elect Vice President JD Vance and have him turn the power over to Mr. Trump. But the president said he's \"not looking at that\" and hasn't had official meetings about possible avenues.",
      "\"I'll be an eight-year president,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I'll be a two-term president.\"",
      "\"I'd like to run\"",
      "In an interview on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Aug. 5, Mr. Trump touted the support he saw in the 2024 election among Texas voters, calling it \"a record that they say won't be beaten unless I run again.\" When asked whether he plans to run again, the president responded, \"no, probably not.\" He added, \"I'd like to run,\" citing his poll numbers.",
      "\"People love the tariffs, and they love the trade deals,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And they love that foreign countries aren't ripping us off anymore.\"",
      "\"I'm not allowed to run. It's too bad\"",
      "Speaking to reporters on Oct. 29 aboard Air Force One during a trip to Asia, the president said it's \"too bad\" the U.S. Constitution doesn't permit him to serve a third term.",
      "\"If you read it, it's pretty clear,\" the president said of the Constitution. \"I'm not allowed to run. It's too bad.\"",
      "Ratified in 1951, the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution\u00a0bars anyone\u00a0from being elected to more than two terms.",
      "Trump says he has a \"little more than three years\" left in office",
      "Speaking to supporters at a White House Christmas party on Dec. 1, the president acknowledged he has a \"little more than three years\" left in his presidency.",
      "\"We're going to do a great job,\" he said in a clip that one of his top aides, Margo Martin,\u00a0posted to social media. \"And you know, we have a little more than three years left, and three years for Trump is an eternity. That's a long period of time.\"",

      "\"We are no closer to resolving the crisis in Ukraine, and there is much work to be done,\" Ushakov said.",
      "Ushakov said that Moscow was given four more documents in addition to the\u00a0original 28-point plan\u00a0the Trump administration presented last month, but did not elaborate on what those documents contained.",
      "Ushakov said both Russia and the U.S. agreed not to disclose the specific details of the talks. No direct talks between Putin and Mr. Trump are currently planned, but Putin asked Witkoff and Kushner to relay \"important political signals\" to Mr. Trump, Ushakov said.",
      "Witkoff and Kushner are set to return to the U.S. to discuss the meeting with Mr. Trump, and will then get back in touch with Russian officials by phone, Ushakov said.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who took part in weekend talks with Ukrainian officials in Florida, previously said the conversations were \"another very productive session,\" but \"there are a lot of moving parts.\"",
      "Mr. Trump had told reporters after Sunday's talks, \"I think that there's a good chance we can make a deal.\"",
      "The original U.S.-backed\u00a0peace proposal\u00a0to end Russia's war on Ukraine that was unveiled last month has gone through changes after the initial plan was criticized by some as being too favorable to Russia, Mr. Trump told reporters over the weekend. One provision that drew heavy pushback from U.S. and European officials called for Ukraine to cede territory it currently controls in Donetsk to Russia.",
      "\"They're making concessions,\" Mr. Trump said of the Russians. \"They're big concessions. They stop fighting, and they don't take any more land.\"",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said at a Tuesday news conference that the plan had been whittled down to 20 points following talks in Geneva and Florida. He said later on the social media platform Telegram that Ukraine would \"wait for signals from the American delegation after its meetings in Russia.\"",
      "\"We will receive certain signals. If the signals work, if it is fair play with our partners, then perhaps we will meet with the American delegation very soon,\" he said, adding, \"I am ready to meet with President Trump. Everything depends on today's talks.\"",
      "Putin has previously called the proposals a \"set of issues put forward for discussion\" as opposed to a firm draft agreement.",
      "Last week, a U.S. official told CBS News\u00a0that Ukraine had \"agreed to a peace deal,\" with the official and Ukrainian national security adviser Rustem Umerov saying a common understanding on a proposal had been reached, with details still to be worked out.",
      "Mr. Trump expressed optimism over the development, saying there were only a \"few remaining points of disagreement.\" Moscow, however, said it was \"premature\" to say the two sides were close to a peace deal.",

    "summary": "President Trump said his administration could attack accused drug traffickers who traverse Latin America by land \"very soon,\" which would mark an escalation in his anti-narcotics campaign.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Tuesday his administration could attack accused drug traffickers who traverse Latin America by land \"very soon,\" which would mark an escalation in the U.S. military's campaign of lethal strikes on alleged drug boats.",
      "\"We're going to start doing those strikes on land, too,\" Mr. Trump told reporters during a Cabinet meeting when asked about the administration's strikes at sea. \"You know, the land is much easier ... And we know the routes they take. We know everything about them. We know where they live. We know where the bad ones live. And we're going to start that very soon, too.\"",
      "Mr. Trump did not definitively say when or where any possible land strikes might take place.",
      "Officials have discussed possible military operations in Venezuela in recent weeks, CBS News has previously reported, as the Trump administration accuses Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of working with drug cartels \u2014 a charge Maduro denies.",
      "But Mr. Trump said Tuesday that land strikes would not necessarily be limited to Venezuela. He said any country where illicit drugs are produced or trafficked \"is subject to attack,\" and singled out neighboring Colombia, which the U.S. has accused of failing to control the drug trade.",
      "The president has hinted for months that he may broaden his administration's sea-based strikes to include accused drug targets on land, telling reporters in October that he is \"totally prepared\" to carry out land strikes.",
      "Meanwhile, the U.S. military has built up its presence in the Caribbean, dispatching the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier to the region and sending F-35 fighter jets to Puerto Rico. And over the weekend, Mr. Trump said the airspace over Venezuela should be considered closed.",
      "If the president takes the step of ordering strikes on targets within Latin American countries, it would significantly expand the Trump administration's anti-drug trafficking operations, which have hit upward\u00a0of 20 alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and Pacific, killing more than 80 people.",
      "Those boat strikes are already controversial. Democratic lawmakers and some Republicans have argued Mr. Trump is acting without legal authority and hasn't provided enough evidence that the boats are carrying drugs. The administration has said the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels, which it has designated as terrorist groups.",
      "And The Washington Post reported last week that the first boat attack, on Sept. 2, included a second strike to kill two survivors clinging to the vessel's wreckage, which some lawmakers and experts argue could constitute a war crime. The White House confirmed there was a second strike, but maintained that the operation was legal.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said Tuesday that any land attack \"would be an act of war, and Congress would invoke the War Powers Act,\" referring to the 1973 law that limits the president's authority to make war without congressional authorization.",
      "Efforts in Congress to limit Mr. Trump's campaign have run into opposition so far. The Senate narrowly\u00a0voted down a resolution last month that would have prevented any strikes against Venezuela without a declaration of war, with 49 senators \u2014 including two Republicans \u2014 voting in support. A month earlier, a vote to end the strikes on alleged drug boats also failed.",
      "Land strikes would also likely face heavy pushback in Latin America. In response to Mr. Trump's comments, Colombian President Gustavo Petro defended his government's anti-narcotics efforts, but warned: \"Do not threaten our sovereignty, because you will awaken the jaguar.\"",
      "Venezuelan officials have also accused the Trump administration of intimidating the country and seeking Maduro's ouster. Mr. Trump has not said what his intentions are with Venezuela, but told reporters in mid-November he's \"sort of\" made up his mind on how to proceed.",
      "Trump says he supports releasing video of boat strike: \"I support the decision knock out the boats\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump's Venezuela boat strikes fuel war crimes allegations.

    "story": [
      "A former Honduran president convicted of helping to smuggle 400 tons of cocaine into the United States has left prison after being pardoned by President Donald Trump. The U.S. Bureau of Prisons confirmed his release in a statement to the Associated Press.",
      "Juan Orlando Hernandez\u00a0was released from a federal prison in West Virginia on Monday and was \"once again a free man,\" his wife, Ana Garc\u00eda, announced on social media. Garc\u00eda thanked Mr. Trump for pardoning Hern\u00e1ndez via the social platform X early Tuesday.",
      "\"After almost four years of pain, of waiting and difficult challenges, my husband Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez RETURNED to being a free man, thanks to the presidential pardon granted by President Donald Trump,\" Garc\u00eda's post said. She included a picture of the U.S. Bureau of Prisons listing for Hern\u00e1ndez indicating his release.",
      "Mr. Trump's controversial pardon came as the U.S. president is simultaneously ordering the bombing of boats in the Caribbean allegedly carrying drugs. He is also heavily backing a candidate from Hernandez's party in Honduras's tense, ongoing presidential election vote count.",
      "Mr. Trump explained his decision\u00a0on social media\u00a0by posting that \"according to many people that I greatly respect,\" Hern\u00e1ndez was \"treated very harshly and unfairly.\"",
      "In March of last year, Hernandez was convicted in U.S. court\u00a0of conspiring to import cocaine\u00a0into the U.S. He had served two terms as the leader of the Central American nation of roughly 10 million people. Hern\u00e1ndez has been appealing his conviction and serving time at the U.S. Penitentiary, Hazelton in West Virginia.",
      "Shortly after Mr. Trump's announcement, Hernandez's wife and children gathered on the steps on their home in Tegucigalpa and kneeled in prayer, thanking God that Hernandez would return to their family after almost four years apart.",
      "It was the same home that Honduran authorities hauled him out of in 2022 just months after leaving office. He was extradited to the United States to stand trial.",
      "Trump's pardon drew criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.",
      "Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, of Louisiana, was critical of the pardon, saying Sunday on social media, \"Why would we pardon [Hernandez] and then go after Maduro for running drugs into the United States? Lock up every drug runner! Don't understand why he is being pardoned.\"",
      "\"This is shocking,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat of Virginia,\u00a0said of the pardon\u00a0on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "\"He was convicted in a federal court in the United States,\" said Kaine, the ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere. \"One of the bits of evidence was his statement that was picked up by those near to him that he wanted to 'shove drugs up the nose of gringos' and flood the United States with cocaine, more than 400 tons. He was the leader of one of the largest criminal enterprises that has ever been subject to a conviction in U.S. courts, and less than one year into his sentence, President Trump is pardoning him, suggesting that President Trump cares nothing about narcotrafficking. Suggesting possibly that pardons are now for sale by this White House.\"",
      "In remarks on the House floor Tuesday, Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, said, \"What message does pardoning this criminal send to parents who have lost children to narcotics, to law enforcement officers risking everything to stop the flow of deadly drugs?\"",
      "\"This disgraceful pardon should be met with bipartisan condemnation,\" she added.",
      "Mr. Trump defended the move to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, claiming, \"Many of the people of Honduras said it was a Biden setup. ... He was the president of the country, and they basically said he was a drug dealer because he was the president of the country. And they said it was a Biden administration setup, and I looked at the facts and I agreed with them.\"",
      "When asked what evidence he had seen to indicate Hernandez's case was a setup, Mr. Trump said, \"You take any country you want, if somebody sells drugs in that country, that doesn't mean you arrest the president and put him in jail for the rest of his life.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Monday claimed it was a \"clear Biden overprosecution,\" alleging that there was some \"egregious\" information that came out during Hernandez's trial.",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 14:20:59 -0500",
    "summary": "Samples collected from the asteroid Bennu are continuing the shed light on the origins of the solar system and how life developed on Earth, scientists say.",
    "story": [
      "Samples taken from\u00a0the asteroid Bennu\u00a0are continuing to shed light on the origins of the solar system.",
      "Scientists have been studying the samples since NASA's Osiris-REx spacecraft carried them back to Earth in 2020 and recently discovered that that they contain sugars and \"a gum-like substance not seen before in astromaterials,\" NASA said.",
      "The revelations \u2014 and how they can help answer big questions about the beginnings of life \u2014 are described in three new papers published Tuesday by the journals Nature Geosciences and Nature Astronomy.",
      "In the first paper, scientists led by Yoshihiro Furukawa of Japan's Tohoku University focus on sugars uncovered in the asteroid samples, which are characterized as essential building blocks for biology on Earth. The second, by Scott Sandford at NASA's Ames Research Center and Zack Gainsforth of the University of California at Berkeley, reveals that the ancient \"space gum\" also present in the samples could have played a foundational role in catalyzing early life on our planet.",
      "The third paper, led by Ann Nguyen of NASA's Johnson Space Center, analyzed dust from two different types of rock that Osiris-REx collected from Bennu, which initially came from stars that predate the solar system.",
      "Ingredients for existence",
      "Each of the three papers zeroes in on a clue from the Bennu asteroid as to how the solar system developed and how life on Earth eventually came to be.",
      "The sugars discovered in the asteroid samples, along with other molecules like amino acids previously detected in them, do not necessarily provide evidence of life, NASA said. But they do show that fundamental elements of the compounds that make up living organisms and allow biological processes to happen within individual cells were, at least at one time, widespread throughout the solar system. Some of the basic molecules used to construct DNA \u2014 and RNA, a vital messenger that codes and decodes genetic information \u2014 were found in the samples from Bennu, researchers said.",
      "Furukawa said the sugars found in the Bennu samples support a hypothesis about the survival mechanisms used by the first forms of earthly life, which may have relied primarily on the messenger molecule rather than the complicated biological processes that ground it today.",
      "\"Present day life is based on a complex system,\" he said. \"However, early life may have been simpler.\"",
      "The mysterious \"space gum\" never seen in cosmic rocks before its discovery in the Bennu samples likely formed in the solar system's infancy, NASA said. According to the agency, the molecules it contains \"could have provided some of the chemical precursors that helped trigger life on Earth.\"",
      "The gum is an important piece of the puzzle for scientists studying how life on the planet began and whether it exists elsewhere.",
      "\"With this strange substance, we're looking at, quite possibly, one of the earliest alterations of materials that occurred in this rock,\" said Sandford, who co-led the paper on Bennu's surprising gum. \"On this primitive asteroid that formed in the early days of the solar system, we're looking at events near the beginning of the beginning.\"",
      "Some of the new research also examines the formation of Bennu itself, which, like other asteroids in the solar system, is a rock left over from the system's nascent stage. The dust discovered in two samples from the asteroid is a substance that scientists believe was already well-mixed when the solar system formed, according to NASA. Because such high concentrations of it were detected in the samples, Bennu may have developed in a region \"enriched in the dust of dying stars,\" the agency said.",

    "summary": "Kian Sadeghi, the 25-year-old founder and CEO at Nucleus Genomics, tells \"CBS Mornings\" that parents have every right to select the qualities and traits they desire in their child.",
    "story": [
      "Big leaps in science have made a once-impossible, much-debated question come to life: Would you design your unborn child?",
      "Kian Sadeghi, the 25-year-old founder and CEO at Nucleus Genomics, believes every parent has a right to do just that, selecting qualities they desire \u2013 from height to weight to intelligence. He calls it \"genetic optimization,\" and it's part of a Silicon Valley push to breed \"super-babies.\"",
      "Sadeghi dropped out of the University of Pennsylvania and started the company in 2021, inspired by a cousin who died of a rare genetic illness. Backed by investors and prominent tech entrepreneurs like Peter Thiel and Alexis Ohanian, Sadeghi says his company has already helped thousands of families.",
      "\"It's the parents' right to know\"",
      "\"We give you the full range of insights there is to know about your future child. We really think it's the parents' right to know,\" he told \"CBS Mornings\" in an interview that aired Wednesday.",
      "Genetic testing companies like Nucleus say DNA screening of embryos can prevent disease, while also giving parents a unique ability to compare and choose traits that make up a healthier baby \u2013 and one that's more desirable in the eyes of mom and dad.",
      "\"They want us to, you know, play sports and they want us to go to the best school. They want us to be well educated. They want us to thrive. Life, I think, as a parent doesn't just stop at 'I want my child to be healthy,'\" Sadeghi said.",
      "For $30,000, Nucleus offers a program called IVF+, which includes full DNA scans of both parents and up to 20 embryos conceived through in vitro fertilization. The results come back in the form of a sleek, user-friendly menu.",
      "Advanced DNA screenings",
      "The company screens embryo samples for more than 2,000 traits and conditions, including eye color, hair color, intelligence \u2013 even acne. It also can estimate genetic predisposition to medical conditions such as depression, autism and bipolar disorder.",
      "Sadeghi says this \"genetic optimization\" allows parents to minimize disease while maximizing traits they prefer. However, critics have drawn comparisons to a different term: \"eugenics.\"",
      "\"[It's not eugenics] by any stretch, because it's fundamentally about empowering people with information that they can use to give their child the best start in life,\" he said. \"And yes, if you want 2 inches taller for your child, 3 inches taller, right, if you want a couple IQ-point difference, absolutely, by all means, do that. But I'm saying, you're really asking me here, you're asking me, what is life about? That's what you're really getting at when you talk about height and IQ, right, they're abstractions of life.\"",
      "Ethical debate over reproductive genetics",
      "But while companies like Nucleus continue to grow, some medical experts point to the ethical dilemmas surrounding these types of new reproductive technologies. An article published in the MIT Technology Review in October argued the race to create the \"perfect baby\" is actually creating an \"ethical mess.\"",
      "In a\u00a0statement last year, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics said the practice of genetic screenings and use of polygenic risk scores for embryo selection has \"moved too fast with too little evidence.\"",
      "\"In this statement we do not address either individual or broader social, ethical, and regulatory issues this testing raises,\" the group noted.",
      "But Sadeghi said he remains confident in the data.",
      "\"Our predictors can better predict longevity from an embryo's DNA than any other genetic model ever built,\" he said.",
      "However, he pushes back on the criticism that he's creating a new class of \"superhumans.\"",
      "\"DNA is not destiny, the messiness of life, the nurture element of life, right, how hard your child works, you know, what school they go to, what resources they have, serendipity, all those factors are never, ever going to go away,\" Sadeghi said.",

    "published": "Tue, 02 Dec 2025 13:32:35 -0500",
    "summary": "Ant colonies act as one \"super-organism\" which works to ensure the survival of all, according to a team of scientists.",
    "story": [
      "Sick young ants release a smell to tell worker ants to destroy them to protect the colony from infection, scientists said Tuesday, adding that queens do not seem to commit this act of self-sacrifice.",
      "Many animals conceal illness for social reasons. For example, sick humans are known to risk infecting others so they can still go to the office \u2014 or the pub.",
      "Ant colonies, however, act as one \"super-organism\" which works to ensure the survival of all, similar to how infected cells in our bodies send out a \"find-me and eat-me\" signal, according to an Austria-led team of scientists.",
      "Ant nests are a \"perfect place for a disease outbreak to occur because there are thousands of ants crawling over each other,\" Erika Dawson, a behavioral ecologist at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria and lead author of a new study titled \"Altruistic disease signaling in ant colonies,\" told AFP.",
      "When adult worker ants get an illness that could spread through the colony, they leave the nest to die alone. Young ants, known as pupae, in contrast are still trapped inside a cocoon, making this kind of social distancing impossible.",
      "Scientists had already figured out that when these pupae are terminally ill, there is a chemical change that produces a particular smell. Adult worker ants then gather around, remove the cocoon, \"bite holes in the pupae and insert poison,\" Dawson said. The poison acts as a disinfectant, which kills both the colony-threatening pathogen and the pupae.",
      "For the new research, the scientists wanted to figure out whether the pupae \"were actively saying: 'hey, come and kill me,'\" Dawson said.",
      "\"Altruistic act\"",
      "First, the scientists extracted the smell from the sick pupae of a small black garden ant called Lasius neglectus. When they applied the smell to a healthy brood in the lab, the workers still destroyed them.",
      "Then, the team conducted an experiment showing that the sick pupae only produce the smell when worker ants are nearby, proving it is a deliberate signal for destruction.",
      "\"While it is a sacrifice \u2014 an altruistic act \u2014 it's also in their own interest, because it means that their genes are going to survive and be passed on to the next generation,\" Dawson said.",
      "However, there is one member of the nest that does not sacrifice itself. When queen pupae are infected inside their cocoons, they do not send out the smelly warning signal, the team found.",
      "\"Are they cheating the system?\" Dawson said the team asked themselves.",
      "However, they found that the \"queen pupae have much better immune systems than the worker pupae, and so they were able to fight off the infection \u2014 and that's why we think that they weren't signaling,\" she said.",
      "The study's authors note that sick queens face a conundrum.",
      "\"By alerting others to destroy them, queen pupae would risk losing potential future reproductive opportunities if they would survive infection,\" the authors write. \"On the other hand, by spreading their infection to their colony, they could incur high indirect fitness costs.\"",
      "Dawson hopes future research will investigate whether queen pupae sacrifice themselves when it becomes clear they will not beat their infection.",
      "The study was published in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "Scientists have previously studied\u00a0how ants communicate. A Stanford University study\u00a0published\u00a0in 2012 showed that harvester ants transmit information to determine how many ants to send to a particular food source. Researchers concluded that ants communicate in much the same way as data moves on the internet, dubbing it the \"anternet.\"",
      "Researchers have also previously concluded that other sick species practice social distancing \u2014\u00a0including guppies, bats and mandrills. Bees have been documented using tactics to prevent getting sick, including\u00a0kicking sick bees out of their hives\u00a0altogether.",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 14:20:59 -0500",
    "summary": "Samples collected from the asteroid Bennu are continuing the shed light on the origins of the solar system and how life developed on Earth, scientists say.",
    "story": [
      "Samples taken from\u00a0the asteroid Bennu\u00a0are continuing to shed light on the origins of the solar system.",
      "Scientists have been studying the samples since NASA's Osiris-REx spacecraft carried them back to Earth in 2020 and recently discovered that that they contain sugars and \"a gum-like substance not seen before in astromaterials,\" NASA said.",
      "The revelations \u2014 and how they can help answer big questions about the beginnings of life \u2014 are described in three new papers published Tuesday by the journals Nature Geosciences and Nature Astronomy.",
      "In the first paper, scientists led by Yoshihiro Furukawa of Japan's Tohoku University focus on sugars uncovered in the asteroid samples, which are characterized as essential building blocks for biology on Earth. The second, by Scott Sandford at NASA's Ames Research Center and Zack Gainsforth of the University of California at Berkeley, reveals that the ancient \"space gum\" also present in the samples could have played a foundational role in catalyzing early life on our planet.",
      "The third paper, led by Ann Nguyen of NASA's Johnson Space Center, analyzed dust from two different types of rock that Osiris-REx collected from Bennu, which initially came from stars that predate the solar system.",
      "Ingredients for existence",
      "Each of the three papers zeroes in on a clue from the Bennu asteroid as to how the solar system developed and how life on Earth eventually came to be.",
      "The sugars discovered in the asteroid samples, along with other molecules like amino acids previously detected in them, do not necessarily provide evidence of life, NASA said. But they do show that fundamental elements of the compounds that make up living organisms and allow biological processes to happen within individual cells were, at least at one time, widespread throughout the solar system. Some of the basic molecules used to construct DNA \u2014 and RNA, a vital messenger that codes and decodes genetic information \u2014 were found in the samples from Bennu, researchers said.",
      "Furukawa said the sugars found in the Bennu samples support a hypothesis about the survival mechanisms used by the first forms of earthly life, which may have relied primarily on the messenger molecule rather than the complicated biological processes that ground it today.",
      "\"Present day life is based on a complex system,\" he said. \"However, early life may have been simpler.\"",
      "The mysterious \"space gum\" never seen in cosmic rocks before its discovery in the Bennu samples likely formed in the solar system's infancy, NASA said. According to the agency, the molecules it contains \"could have provided some of the chemical precursors that helped trigger life on Earth.\"",
      "The gum is an important piece of the puzzle for scientists studying how life on the planet began and whether it exists elsewhere.",
      "\"With this strange substance, we're looking at, quite possibly, one of the earliest alterations of materials that occurred in this rock,\" said Sandford, who co-led the paper on Bennu's surprising gum. \"On this primitive asteroid that formed in the early days of the solar system, we're looking at events near the beginning of the beginning.\"",
      "Some of the new research also examines the formation of Bennu itself, which, like other asteroids in the solar system, is a rock left over from the system's nascent stage. The dust discovered in two samples from the asteroid is a substance that scientists believe was already well-mixed when the solar system formed, according to NASA. Because such high concentrations of it were detected in the samples, Bennu may have developed in a region \"enriched in the dust of dying stars,\" the agency said.",

      "A geomagnetic storm watch has been issued after a powerful solar flare over the weekend.",
      "The solar flare peaked at 9:49 p.m. EST on Sunday, November 30, said NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory, which constantly monitors the sun. The flare was classified as X1.9 flare, the space agency said. X-classes are the most intense kind of flare. The eruption came from a newly emerging sunspot region.",
      "The flare briefly knocked out radio communications across Australia and parts of southeast Asia on Tuesday, Space.com reported.",
      "A coronal mass ejection, or CME, also occurred. During CMEs, solar material and magnetic fields erupt from the sun. CMEs and solar flares are similar, but they are distinct phenomena, NASA said.",
      "Flares and CMEs can impact radio communications, power grids and navigation signals, NASA said. They can also pose a risk to spacecraft and astronauts. When CMEs reach Earth, they can cause geomagnetic storms, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Weather Prediction Center.",
      "A geomagnetic storm watch has been issued for Thursday, December 4. The CME is not expected to reach Earth, but can still have minor impacts including \"manageable effects to some technological infrastructure,\" NOAA said. There is some unpredictability in the forecast, NOAA noted, so the storm could arrive as early as December 3.",
      "The Northern Lights may be visible in northern and upper states between New York and Idaho. Weather forecasts, including a powerful winter storm, may limit the chances of seeing the phenomenon.",
      "Scientists may see more space weather activity between December 1 and December 5, NOAA said, as the sun's newly emerging sunspot region rotates to face the Earth. The sunspot, labeled AR4299, is where the recent flare and CME originated from.",

    "summary": "India's government, amid an uproar over privacy, has revoked an order quietly issued to smartphone makers to pre-install a state-run security app.",
    "story": [
      "New Delhi \u2014\u00a0India's government revoked an order on Wednesday that had directed smartphone makers such as Apple and Samsung to install a state-developed and owned security app on all new devices. The move came after two days of criticism from opposition politicians and privacy organizations that the \"Sanchar Saathi\" app was an effort to snoop on citizens through their phones.",
      "\"Government has decided not to make the pre-installation mandatory for mobile manufacturers,\" India's Ministry of Communications said in a statement Wednesday afternoon.",
      "The initial order, issued privately to phone makers by the ministry late last month, was leaked to Indian media outlets on Monday. It directed all phone makers to preinstall the Sanchar Saathi (which means Communication Partner in Hindi) app on new phones within 90 days, and also on older phones through software updates.",
      "The order, reported from Monday by numerous Indian media outlets and later acknowledged by the government, had asked manufacturers to ensure that the functions of the app could not be \"disabled or restricted.\"",
      "There was an immediate backlash on Monday, with opposition political parties quickly labelling the government software a \"snooping app\" and drawing parallels to Pegasus, the hacking spyware developed, marketed and licensed to governments around the world by the Israeli company NSO Group.",
      "On Tuesday, India's national Minister of Communications Jyotiraditya Scindia insisted to journalists outside the parliament that the Sanchar Sathi app was non-compulsory and in line with democratic principles. He said smartphone owners could activate the app at their convenience to access its benefits, and they could also delete it from devices at any time.",
      "He did not, however, say anything on Tuesday to deny or change the order to phone makers to ensure the app was pre-installed.",
      "On Wednesday, Scindia insisted that \"neither is snooping possible, nor it will be done\" with the app.",
      "While the order for it to be installed universally was revoked, the government continued defending the app on Wednesday, saying the intent had been to \"provide access to cybersecurity to all citizens,\" and insisting that it was \"secure and purely meant to help citizens.\"",
      "Opposition politicians say \"it is a snooping app\"",
      "The government's U-turn came after sharp criticism from opposition political parties and digital rights advocates.",
      "\"It is a snooping app. It's ridiculous. Citizens have the right to privacy. Everyone must have the right to privacy to send messages to family, friends, without the government looking at everything,\" Priyanka Gandhi, leader of the opposition Congress party, told reporters outside India's parliament on Tuesday.",
      "\"They brought in Pegasus and have been unable to keep it under control. MPs and MLAs all say that their phones are being tapped. For the last 11 years, basic rights of the Indians have been taken away... This is the real violation of National Security,\" said Renuka Chowdhury, another Congress member.",
      "Digital privacy advocates also raised concerns about the government order, saying it would breach citizens' right to privacy in a country with more than 1.2 billion cell phone users.",
      "\"No government will ever be expected to acknowledge that a government app is a snooping tool, even in China and Russia, where such apps have been mandated,\" Indian technology analyst Prasanto K. Roy told CBS News on Wednesday. \"A government statement alone is not adequate to inspire confidence in this.\"",
      "Roy said the government should restrict the default permissions settings that enable the app to access data on smartphones to the absolute minimum, and explain why those permissions were deemed necessary. He added that the code for the app should be open-source and published online, to enable independent security professionals to scrutinise it.",
      "\"In plain terms, this converts every smartphone sold in India into a vessel for state-mandated software that the user cannot meaningfully refuse, control, or remove,\" the Internet for Freedom organization said in a statement Tuesday, before the government revoked its order. \"For this to work in practice, the app will almost certainly need system level or root level access \u2026 so that it cannot be disabled. That design choice erodes the protections that normally prevent one app from peering into the data of others, and turns Sanchar Saathi into a permanent, non-consensual point of access sitting inside the operating system of every Indian smartphone user.\"",
      "Technology analyst Roy told CBS News the real issue was \"not about faith in the government's benevolence,\" but rather \"concerns about potential access to a wide range of data by many junior or mid-level officials in government or law enforcement,\" as there was no clarity about what data could be accessed via the app, or who would have access to it.",
      "Major phone makers did not publicly react to the government order, but the Reuters news agency reported that Apple had planned to refuse to comply.",
      "Indian government says it's just trying to help",
      "The government argues that the app allows users to track, block and recover lost or stolen smartphones using the device's International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI), a unique code assigned to all handsets sold around the world.",
      "It also enables users to check how many unique mobile data connections are registered under their name, which it says will help people identify and disable fraudulent numbers and accounts opened by scammers.",
      "Other features include tools to report suspected fraudulent calls and to verify the authenticity of devices being used to make purchases, according to officials.",
      "The government said in its multiple statements that the app had already been downloaded 14 million times, and used to help trace 2.6 million lost or stolen phones. It said Sanchar Sathi had helped in the disconnection of over 4 million fraudulent connections, based on citizen reports.",

    "title": "Kids with smartphones by age 12 at higher risk of health issues, study says",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/children-smartphones-increased-risk-of-health-problems-study/",
    "published": "Mon, 01 Dec 2025 19:16:23 -0500",
    "summary": "Children and adolescents who own smartphones by age 12 have higher risks of depression, poor sleep and obesity, according to a new study.",
    "story": [
      "Having a smartphone may be harmful for children younger than 12, according to a new study.",
      "The study published Monday in the peer-reviewed journal\u00a0Pediatrics\u00a0found that owning a smartphone during early adolescence is associated with increased risks of mental health issues and obesity. As far as psychological impacts, it pinpointed higher incidences of depression and insufficient sleep among children who owned smartphones by ages 12 or younger, compared with others kids without the devices.",
      "Researchers at Children's Hospital Philadelphia, the University of California at Berkeley, and Columbia University arrived at those conclusions after analyzing data from more than 10,000 adolescents around the United States who participated in the\u00a0Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study\u00a0(ABCD) between 2018 and 2020. That study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, describes itself as \"the largest long-term study of brain development and child health\" in the country.",
      "According to researchers, 63.6% of the ABCD study's participants owned a smartphone, and the median age they received them was at 11 years old. Using that data, the researchers determined that younger children had greater risks than older participants of poor sleep or obesity linked to smartphone ownership, with increasingly worse health outcomes reported for kids the younger they were when they received their first smartphone.",
      "\"We didn't even look at what the kids did on the phone,\" Ran Barzilay, the lead author of the study and a child psychiatrist with the Youth Suicide Prevention, Intervention and Research Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told CBS News. \"We basically asked one simple question: does the mere factor of having one's own smartphone at this age range have anything to do with health outcomes?\"",
      "The Pediatrics study also compared children who had obtained a smartphone by age 12 and children who had not, and found that one year later, those without smartphones were experiencing better mental health than those who had them.",
      "\"We did account for the fact that the kids may have had other technological devices like tablets or iPads, and it did not change the results,\" Barzilay said in an interview on CBS News' \"The Daily Report.\"",
      "In a separate\u00a0statement, Barzilay said his study's findings suggest that parents should see smartphones as having \"a significant factor in teen health\" and approach the decision to give children a phone with care and consideration. He noted that smartphones \"can play a constructive role\" in teens' lives by strengthening their social connections and helping them learn, adding that some families see smartphones as necessary for their children's safety.",
      "Going forward, Barzilay said the researchers behind the study hope to investigate which aspects of smartphone use and ownership are connected with negative health effects for young people. Researchers intend to study younger children, who acquired smartphones before age 10, in an effort to understand who is most vulnerable to the detrimental impacts of smartphone use who and who could most benefit from it. Ultimately, Barzilay said the goal is to identify ways to protect children and adolescents who own smartphones from the consequences outlined in their findings.",
      "In recent years, a growing number of experts have sounded the alarm about increased screen time and the effect it has on kids and teens. In a 2023\u00a0advisory\u00a0on social media use and mental health, former U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy recommended creating\u00a0\"tech-free zones\"\u00a0and encouraging kids to \"foster in-person friendships.\" Meanwhile,\u00a0several states\u00a0have taken steps to\u00a0ban cellphones\u00a0in schools.",
      "According to\u00a0Pew Research Center, 95% of teens between the ages of 13 and 17 owned a smartphone in 2024. More than half of parents with children between the ages of 11 and 12 who were surveyed by the research center at that time said their kids also owned smartphones. The same survey found that nearly 30% of parents with children between 8 and 10 years old said their kids owned smartphones, as did 12% of parents with children between 5 and 7 years old, and 8% of parents with children younger than 5.",
      "\"Most probably, all teens will eventually have a smartphone,\" said Barzilay. \"Once this happens, it is advisable to monitor what our children do on their phones, ensuring they're not exposed to inappropriate content and that smartphones don't disrupt sleep.\"",

    "summary": "The White House confirmed this week that there was a second strike, but denied that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered it.",
    "story": [
      "Two people who survived the U.S. military's early September strike on an alleged drug-carrying vessel were attempting to climb back onto the boat before it was hit a second time, a source familiar with the matter told CBS News on Wednesday.",
      "The survivors allegedly tried to salvage some of the drugs, according to the source. They appeared to be in communication with others at the time, and there were other boats in the vicinity that could have picked them up, the source said.",
      "ABC News was first to report the additional details on the strike. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reposted a video of ABC News' report on X.",
      "The Sept. 2 mission \u2014 the first of more than 20 attacks on alleged drug boats by the Trump administration in recent months \u2014 has drawn bipartisan scrutiny since last week, when The Washington Post reported that the military carried out at least two strikes on the same boat in the Caribbean, killing a pair of survivors from the initial hit. The newspaper alleged in its report that the second strike was conducted because Hegseth had said that everybody onboard the boat should be killed.",
      "The White House confirmed this week that there was a second strike, but denied that Hegseth ordered it. Hegseth has said the decision was made by the mission's commander, Adm. Mitch Bradley, and argued the follow-up strike was legal and justified.",
      "Democrats and some legal experts have alleged the second strike may have constituted a war crime under U.S. and international law if the military targeted survivors. A Pentagon manual on the law of war says \"wounded, sick, or shipwrecked\" combatants no longer pose a threat and should not be attacked.",
      "Even before the recent revelations, the campaign of boat strikes had drawn broader legal questions, with critics arguing the president doesn't have the authority to order military operations against alleged traffickers without congressional approval. In the past, the U.S. has typically sought to interdict drug smugglers at sea, essentially treating them like criminals rather than combatants. The Trump administration has argued the strikes are lawful because the U.S. is engaged in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels that it views as terrorist organizations.",
      "Lawmakers from both parties have vowed to investigate the Sept. 2 strike. Bradley is due to testify before Congress on Thursday. He is expected to show video from Sept. 2 and walk through his decisions, a source familiar with the matter told CBS News.",

    "summary": "President Trump has recently attacked Gov. Tim Walz over the fraud cases, calling Minnesota a \"hub of fraudulent money laundering activity\" and lashing out against the state's Somali community.",
    "story": [
      "A series of multimillion-dollar alleged fraud schemes in Minnesota has drawn the Trump administration's attention in recent weeks, vaulting an issue that has brewed in state politics for years into the national conversation.",
      "President Trump has attacked Democratic Gov. Tim Walz over the fraud cases, calling Minnesota a \"hub of fraudulent money laundering activity\" and lashing out against the state's Somali community. And Walz is facing an investigation by U.S. House Republicans.",
      "Meanwhile, federal prosecutors have continued to bring new charges against alleged fraudsters in the midwestern state in recent months. And this week, the U.S. Treasury said it will investigate whether tax dollars from Minnesota's public assistance programs made their way to al Shabaab, an affiliate of al Qaeda and a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization based in Somalia, bringing the fraud cases back into the spotlight.",
      "Here's what to know about the cases:",
      "What was the Feeding Our Future fraud scheme?",
      "Three years ago, federal prosecutors in Minnesota filed the first charges in what they described as the \"largest pandemic fraud in the United States.\"",
      "The $250 million scheme \u2014 which now includes upward of 75 defendants \u2014 revolved around a nonprofit group called Feeding Our Future that partnered with the Minnesota Department of Education and U.S. Department of Agriculture to distribute meals to children.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, prosecutors say, Feeding Our Future and its affiliated food distribution sites submitted fake meal count sheets and invoices to trick state and federal officials into thinking they had helped serve food to thousands of children. The group allegedly raked in millions in administrative fees for the fake meal distributions, and got kickbacks from people who ran their distribution sites, according to federal charging documents.",
      "Feeding Our Future's founder, Aimee Bock, was convicted at trial earlier this year. Several other defendants, including distribution site operators, have pleaded guilty or been convicted, in some cases receiving multiyear prison sentences and being ordered to pay millions in restitution. One defendant also pleaded guilty to attempting to bribe a juror, after a member of the jury in his fraud trial found a bag with $120,000 in cash at her home.",
      "Bock has long denied wrongdoing. At various points before charges were filed, Minnesota officials questioned some of the group's filings and slowed approvals of distribution sites, leading Feeding Our Future to file a lawsuit accusing the state of discrimination.",
      "The case was part of a trend of large-scale fraud across the U.S. during the pandemic, as the federal government poured money into assistance programs at a rapid clip. One former federal watchdog estimated to \"60 Minutes\" earlier this year that COVID-19 fraud may have cost taxpayers some $1 trillion.",
      "Prosecutors said the program that was allegedly co-opted by Feeding Our Future \u2014 the Federal Child Nutrition Program \u2014 became more vulnerable to fraud during the pandemic. Oversight was more difficult because of the health crisis, and federal officials waived some of the program's rules to let restaurants participate and allow off-site meal distribution.",
      "State officials have also faced scrutiny. A probe last year by the state's Office of the Legislative Auditor found the Minnesota Department of Education \"created opportunities for fraud\" by failing to act on warning signs with Feeding Our Future or investigate complaints about the group.",
      "What other fraud allegations have circulated in Minnesota?",
      "The Feeding Our Future scheme isn't the only fraud case to rattle Minnesota politics.",
      "In August, state officials shut down a fairly new program designed to help seniors and people with disabilities find housing after discovering \"large-scale fraud.\"",
      "A month later, federal prosecutors charged eight people with allegedly defrauding the program, which was run through the state's Medicaid service, by enrolling as providers and submitting millions in \"fake and inflated bills.\"",
      "Prosecutors said the housing stabilization program was susceptible to fraud because it intentionally had \"low barriers to entry\" and few recordkeeping requirements. They also noted that spending on the program had ballooned to more than $100 million last year, despite initial estimates that it would cost around $2.6 million a year.",
      "And in late September, a person was charged with defrauding a third state program \u2014 in this case, one that provides services to children with autism. Her company was accused of hiring unqualified \"behavioral technicians\" and submitting false claims to the state that indicated the staff had worked with children enrolled in the program.",
      "She also allegedly paid kickbacks to parents who agreed to enroll their children in the program, in some cases sending them as much as $1,500, prosecutors said.",
      "The same person, Asha Farhan Hassan, was also charged in September with running a fraudulent food distribution site as part of the Feeding Our Future scheme.",
      "Acting U.S. Attorney Joseph H. Thompson said the case \"is not an isolated scheme.\"",
      "\"From Feeding Our Future to Housing Stabilization Services and now Autism Services, these massive fraud schemes form a web that has stolen billions of dollars in taxpayer money,\" the federal prosecutor wrote in a statement.",
      "Kelly Loeffler, who leads the U.S. Small Business Administration, also alleged Tuesday that some of the groups linked to the Feeding Our Future scheme received COVID-era emergency loans. She said she has ordered an \"investigation into the network of Somali organizations and executives implicated in these schemes.\" She did not provide details on the probe.",
      "What is the connection to Minnesota's Somali community?",
      "Most of the people charged in the Feeding Our Future case are of Somali descent, though Bock, the group's founder and the scheme's alleged \"mastermind,\" is White.",
      "Prosecutors in the alleged autism services fraud scheme said the defendant \"approached parents in the Somali community to recruit their children.\"",
      "The named fraud defendants appear to represent a small percentage of Minnesota's Somali American community, which is among the largest in the nation.",
      "Some 76,000 people of Somali descent live in the state, more than half of whom were born in the U.S., according to Census Bureau figures from last year. The vast majority of the state's foreign-born Somali population has U.S. citizenship, and most entered the U.S. before 2010.",
      "Around 65% of Somali people in Minnesota ages 16 and over were employed as of last year, according to the Census Bureau, roughly equivalent to the state population as a whole.",
      "Last year, a Somali American former investigator in the Minnesota attorney general's office, Kayseh Magan, wrote about what he called an \"uncomfortable and true\" reality that many people who have been charged with fraud in the state are of Somali descent.",
      "He wrote that \"fraud occurs when desire meets opportunity,\" noting that many Somali Americans are \"poor, desperate and seek shortcuts,\" and their families in the impoverished East African country frequently rely on money from their U.S.-based relatives. He said Somali service providers often leverage trust within the community to recruit friends and relatives into their programs. Many victims of these fraud schemes are Somali, too, he added.",
      "Has Minnesota taxpayer money made its way to the terror group al Shabaab?",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said earlier this week that his department will investigate whether tax dollars from Minnesota's public assistance programs made their way to al Shabaab, an affiliate of al Qaeda and a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization based in Somalia.",
      "Bessent appeared to be responding to a report in the conservative magazine City Journal that alleged millions from state programs \"ultimately landed in the hands of the terror group Al-Shabaab,\" citing law enforcement sources.",
      "Those allegations have circulated for years. A 2019 report by the state's Office of the Legislative Auditor said it was \"unable to substantiate\" allegations that Child Care Assistance Program funding is going to terrorist groups, though the report didn't rule it out, saying it's \"possible\" that state funds may have been sent overseas and eventually found its way to terrorists.",
      "Multiple federal investigators told CBS News Minnesota's Jonah Kaplan that there is no evidence taxpayer dollars were funneled to al Shabaab.",
      "Andy Lugar, a Biden- and Obama-era U.S. attorney for Minnesota, told The Minnesota Star Tribune last month that those charged in the Feeding Our Future fraud scheme \"were looking to get rich, not fund overseas terrorism.\"",
      "What has President Trump said?",
      "Mr. Trump has blamed the fraud schemes on Somali people, whom he has attacked in often incendiary terms in recent weeks. On Tuesday, the president called immigrants from Somalia \"garbage,\" and claimed they \"destroyed Minnesota\" and \"contribute nothing.\"",
      "Last month, the president announced he would end temporary deportation protections for Somali immigrants who live in Minnesota, claiming without evidence that \"Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State,\" and that Minnesota has become a \"hub of fraudulent money laundering activity.\"",
      "Somalia is also one of 19 countries that have faced near-total travel bans and a halt to immigration applications. And Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations are underway this week in the Minneapolis area, CBS News has reported.",
      "A particular focus of Mr. Trump's ire is Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota Democrat who was born in Somalia and came to the U.S. as a teenager. He has also lashed out at Walz, whom he referred to last week using a slur for people with intellectual disabilities.",
      "Minnesota lawmakers and members of the state's Somali community have castigated Mr. Trump for the comments. In an interview with \"Meet The Press\" last weekend, Walz said the fraud issue \"is totally disconnected with demonizing an entire group of people who came here, fleeing civil war, and created a vibrant community that makes Minnesota and this country better.\"",
      "What has Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said about the fraud schemes?",
      "Walz, who has served as Minnesota's governor since 2019, told NBC's \"Meet The Press\" on Sunday that his state has sought to crack down on fraud. He also pointed to the state's generosity.",
      "\"Minnesota is a generous state. Minnesota is a prosperous state, a well-run state. We're AAA-bond rated,\" said the governor and 2024 Democratic vice presidential nominee. \"But that attracts criminals. Those people are going to jail. We're doing everything we can.\"",
      "Asked this week about the U.S. Treasury's investigation into claims that tax money may have gone to al Shabaab, Walz said the state welcomes federal help and wants to crack down on fraud, but added: \"I don't think anybody in here really believes their motive and their timing,\" referring to the Trump administration and congressional Republicans.",
      "Meanwhile, the governor and his administration have faced years of local scrutiny over their handling of fraud, dating back to the Feeding Our Future scheme's emergence in 2022. Republican officials have long argued the state failed to carry out due diligence and was slow to act in that scheme \u2014 though Walz has insisted the state caught the fraud early but was stymied by court battles and asked by the FBI not to cut off payments during its investigation.",
      "That scrutiny has resurged in recent weeks. Earlier Wednesday, Republican Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, the chair of the House Oversight Committee, opened an investigation into fraud in Minnesota's public assistance programs.",
      "\"The Committee has serious concerns about how you as the Governor, and the Democrat-controlled administration, allowed millions of dollars to be stolen,\" Comer said in a letter requesting documents from Walz. \"The Committee also has concerns that you and your administration were fully aware of this fraud and chose not to act for fear of political retaliation.\"",

    "story": [
      "A dozen prior leaders of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \u2014 appointed by Republicans and Democrats alike \u2014 issued a scathing denunciation of new FDA assertions casting doubt on vaccine safety.",
      "The former officials said the agency's plans to revamp how life-saving vaccines for flu, COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases are handled \u2014 outlined in an internal FDA memo last week \u2014 would \"disadvantage the people the FDA exists to protect, including millions of Americans at high risk from serious infections.\"",
      "\"The proposed new directives are not small adjustments or coherent policy updates. They represent a major shift in the FDA's understanding of its job,\" the officials, former FDA commissioners and acting commissioners, wrote Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "The internal memo by FDA vaccine chief Dr. Vinay Prasad hasn't been publicly released. The memo said a review \"found that at least 10 children have died after and because of receiving COVID-19 vaccination,\" multiple sources familiar with it told CBS News on Saturday.",
      "Prasad suggested that the deaths were related to myocarditis, or the inflammation of the heart muscle, the sources said. Prasad did not share any data used in the review, including the children's ages, whether they had existing health conditions, or how the FDA determined there was a link between their death and the vaccine. The findings were not published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.",
      "It went on to outline planned agency changes in handling those and certain other vaccines and said that FDA staff who disagreed should resign.",
      "Among Prasad's plans were revising how yearly flu shot updates are handled and focusing more on \"the benefits and harms of giving multiple vaccines at the same time.\" A common message of vaccine skeptics is that too many shots may overwhelm kids' immune systems or that ingredients may build up to cause harm, although scientists say repeated research into those claims has turned up no concerns.",
      "On Wednesday, the former FDA leaders wrote that Prasad's claim about child deaths related to COVID-19 vaccines had been reported to a surveillance system that doesn't contain medical records or other information sufficient to prove a link \u2014 and that government scientists had carefully combed through those reports in previous years, reaching different conclusions. They also noted that \"substantial evidence\" shows COVID-19 vaccines reduce children's risk of severe disease and hospitalization.",
      "\"The memo asserts, incorrectly, that 'we do not have reliable data' on the benefits of Covid vaccination in children,\" the former FDA officials wrote. \"Reasonable scientists should engage in open debate about how best to shape recommendations for children at lower risk for Covid-19, but substantial evidence shows that vaccination can reduce the risk of severe disease and hospitalization in many children and adolescents.\"",
      "But the bigger picture, the former FDA leaders argued, is that the new proposals would reject long-standing science about how to evaluate vaccines being updated to better match virus strains, slow innovation to replace older vaccines with newer, potentially better ones, and make the process less transparent to the public.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement Wednesday night, \"The fact these criticisms are coming from former FDA officials who opposed raising the bar for vaccine science confirms we are on the right track.\"",
      "Many doctors and public health experts have also expressed alarm about the memo.",
      "\"Vaccines save lives, period,\" Dr. Ronald Nahass, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said in a statement. \"It is a sad day when FDA creates confusion and mistrust without supplying evidence, spreading propaganda that makes lifesaving vaccines harder to access and that creates additional confusion and mistrust for the public.\"",
      "The FDA's planned vaccine changes come at a time when Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2014 who helped lead the anti-vaccine movement for years \u2014 is seeking to broadly remake federal policies on vaccines.",
      "Kennedy already ousted a committee that advised the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccine recommendations and replaced it with handpicked members. And in August, he fired Susan Monarez 29 days into her tenure as CDC chief over vaccine policy disagreements. The CDC's vaccine advisory committee will meet Thursday and Friday to discuss hepatitis B vaccinations in newborns and other vaccine topics.",

    "story": [
      "Charles Shay, a decorated Native American veteran who was a 19-year-old U.S. Army medic when he landed on Omaha Beach on D-Day and helped save lives, died on Wednesday. He was 101.",
      "Shay died at his home in Bretteville-L'Orgueilleuse in France's Normandy region, his longtime friend and carer Marie-Pascale Legrand said.",
      "Shay, of the Penobscot tribe and from Indian Island in the U.S. state of Maine, was awarded the Silver Star for repeatedly plunging into the sea and carrying critically wounded soldiers to relative safety, saving them from drowning. He also received France's highest award, the Legion of Honor, in 2007.",
      "Shay had been living in France since 2018, not far from the shores of Normandy where nearly 160,000 troops from Britain, the U.S., Canada and other nations landed on D-Day on June 6, 1944. The Battle of Normandy hastened Germany's defeat, which came less than a year later.",
      "\"He passed away peacefully surrounded by his loved ones,\" Legrand told The Associated Press.",
      "Shay told CBS News in 2019 that he moved to France to be close to his fallen brothers.",
      "\"I will die here,\" Shay told CBS News at the time. \"I believe that I can talk with the souls of the men that are still wandering on the beach here. And I just tried to assure them that they are not forgotten.\"",
      "The Charles Shay Memorial group, which honors the memory of about 500 Native Americans who landed on the Normandy beaches, said in a statement posted on Facebook that \"our hearts are deeply saddened as we share that our beloved Charles Norman Shay \u2026 has returned home to the Creator and the Spirit World.\"",
      "\"He was an incredibly loving father, grandfather, father-in-law, and uncle, a hero to many, and an overall amazing human being,\" the statement said. \"Charles leaves a legacy of love, service, courage, spirit, duty and family that continues to shine brightly.\"",
      "Ready to give his life",
      "On D-Day, 4,414 Allied troops lost their lives \u2014 2,501 of them Americans. More than 5,000 were wounded. On the German side, several thousand were killed or wounded.",
      "\"Mortars and artillery coming at us,\" Shay told CBS News in 2019. \"When the ramp went down, the men that were standing in the front, some of them were killed immediately.\"",
      "Others were so badly hurt, they couldn't drag themselves out of the surf.",
      "\"Many men that had been wounded were laying and could not help themselves in the tide,\" Shay told CBS News.",
      "Shay survived.",
      "\"I guess I was prepared to give my life if I had to. Fortunately, I did not have to,\" Shay said in a 2024 interview with The Associated Press.",
      "\"I had been given a job, and the way I looked at it, it was up to me to complete my job,\" he recalled. \"I did not have time to worry about my situation of being there and perhaps losing my life. There was no time for this.\"",
      "On that night, exhausted, he eventually fell asleep in a grove above the beach.",
      "\"When I woke up in the morning, it was like I was sleeping in a graveyard because there were dead Americans and Germans surrounding me,\" he recalled. \"I stayed there for not very long and I continued on my way.\"",
      "Shay then pursued his mission in Normandy for several weeks, rescuing those wounded, before heading with American troops to eastern France and Germany, where he was taken prisoner in March 1945 and liberated a few weeks later.",
      "Spreading a message of peace",
      "After World War II, Shay reenlisted in the military because the situation of Native Americans in his home state of Maine was too precarious due to poverty and discrimination.",
      "Maine would not allow individuals living on Native American reservations to vote until 1954.",
      "Shay continued to witness history \u2014 returning to combat as a medic during the Korean War, participating in U.S. nuclear testing in the Marshall Islands and later working at the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, Austria.",
      "For over 60 years, he did not talk about his WWII experience.",
      "But he began attending D-Day commemorations in 2007 and in recent years, he has seized many occasions to give his powerful testimony and spread a message of peace.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020-2021, Shay's lone presence marked commemoration ceremonies as travel restrictions prevented other veterans or families of fallen soldiers from the U.S., Britain and other allied countries from making the trip to France.",
      "Sadness at seeing war back in Europe",
      "For years, Shay used to perform a sage-burning ceremony, in homage to those who died, on a bluff overlooking Omaha Beach, where the monument bearing his name now stands.",
      "On June 6, 2022, he handed over the remembrance task to another Native American, Julia Kelly, a Gulf War veteran from the Crow tribe. That was just over three months after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in what was to become the worst war on the continent since 1945.",
      "Shay then expressed his sadness at seeing war back on the continent.",
      "\"Ukraine is a very sad situation. I feel sorry for the people there and I don't know why this war had to come,\" he said. \"In 1944, I landed on these beaches and we thought we'd bring peace to the world. But it's not possible.\"",

    "summary": "Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform released \"never-before-seen\" images of Jeffrey Epstein's private island.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform said Wednesday that the committee has received financial records related to Jeffrey Epstein from JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank, while releasing \"never-before-seen\" photos and videos of Epstein's private island in the Caribbean.",
      "The financial documents could offer a window into Epstein's extensive business dealings and connections. Epstein was a major client of JPMorgan Chase's private banking division for years before the bank cut ties with him in 2013. Epstein then took his business to Deutsche Bank, where he remained until 2018. He died by suicide in a Manhattan jail in 2019 as he faced federal sex trafficking charges.",
      "Both banks reached legal settlements in 2023 over their involvement with Epstein. Deutsche Bank agreed to pay $75 million to settle a lawsuit from his accusers claiming the bank \"knowingly benefited\" from his sex trafficking. JPMorgan settled its own suit for $290 million, CBS News reported at the time. Both banks have said they regret their association with Epstein.",
      "Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the ranking member on the Oversight Committee, said Democrats plan to make the financial records public \"in the days ahead.\"",
      "New photos and videos of Epstein's island",
      "The committee also released 73 photos and four videos of Epstein's estate on the 72-acre island, known as Little St. James, that he owned in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Epstein allegedly exploited underage girls for sex at the island, and he had stakes in businesses in the U.S. territory.",
      "\"These new images are a disturbing look into the world of Jeffrey Epstein and his island,\" Garcia said in a statement. \"We are releasing these photos and videos to ensure public transparency in our investigation and to help piece together the full picture of Epstein's horrific crimes. We won't stop fighting until we deliver justice for the survivors. It's time for President Trump to release all the files, now.\"",
      "The photos show what appear to be various rooms in the estate, including bedrooms, bathrooms and kitchens. One photo shows partially redacted handwriting on a blackboard in an office. Another shows what appears to be a medical office with masks of men's faces hanging from the walls. Others show various views from outside the buildings:",
      "One of the photos shows a dentist's chair, which a source tell CBS news was put in for one of Epstein's girlfriend, a European woman who was studying to be a dentist.",
      "The Oversight Committee sent a request to the U.S. Virgin Islands attorney general on Nov. 18 for all documents, communications and other information about investigations or potential criminal investigations related to Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell, according to Garcia. Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year sentence for \"conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse minors,\" as the Justice Department put it in 2022 when she was sentenced.",
      "Separate from the records the Oversight Committee has released, Congress passed and President Trump signed a law giving the Justice Department 30 days to release all records it has related to Epstein. That 30-day countdown began after the law was signed on Nov. 19. It's not yet clear how much information will be redacted.",
      "Scott  MacFarlane and \n                                                  \n                                  Caitlin  Yilek\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 20:03:57 -0500",
    "summary": "The Pentagon watchdog recently completed its report on Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's use of Signal to share details about operations in Yemen.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Pentagon's internal watchdog determined Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth jeopardized sensitive military information and could have endangered American service members when he shared certain details about U.S. military operations in Yemen in a private Signal group chat earlier this year, according to a U.S. official and a person familiar with the report's findings.",
      "The individuals who spoke to CBS News said the report found the former Fox News host-turned-defense secretary violated Defense Department policies when he used his personal device for official business to transmit sensitive U.S. military information to other top Trump officials and the editor in chief of The Atlantic magazine. The two sources requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the unreleased report.",
      "A classified version of the inspector general's report was sent to Congress on Tuesday. An unredacted version is expected to be released Thursday. CNN first reported the defense inspector general's findings.",
      "In a statement Wednesday, chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said the review \"is a TOTAL exoneration of Secretary Hegseth and proves what we knew all along - no classified information was shared. This matter is resolved, and the case is closed.\"",
      "Hegseth also called the review a \"total exoneration,\" writing on X: \"No classified information. Total exoneration. Case closed. Houthis bombed into submission. Thank you for your attention to this IG report.\"",
      "The sources said the IG report confirmed what CBS News had reported in July \u2014 that key information posted by Hegseth in the encrypted Signal chat group was derived from a classified email marked \"SECRET//NOFORN.\" CBS News reported that information was shared by Army Gen. Michael \"Erik\" Kurilla, who at the time was the commander of U.S. Central Command, the primary combatant unit overseeing U.S. military operations in the Middle East, Central Asia and parts of South Asia.",
      "The \"SECRET\" designation means the information was classified, and the disclosure of the information without proper declassification could potentially cause serious damage to national security and jeopardize the safety of service members, according to the U.S. government.",
      "The \"NOFORN\" label means the information can only be disseminated to U.S. agencies and individuals, excluding foreign nationals and even close U.S. allies.",
      "The sources familiar with the inspector general's investigation said the report found that if the information had been intercepted by a foreign adversary, it would have clearly endangered U.S. service members and the mission.",
      "The report does not address the question of whether Hegseth declassified the information before it was posted in a Signal chat group that included other top Trump officials, the sources said. That group chat also inadvertently included Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic, who broke the story in March.",
      "A day after the Signal chat story was published by The Atlantic, U.S. Africa Command, in coordination with the government of Somalia, conducted multiple airstrikes against affiliates of the Islamic State terrorist organization. A press release said the airstrikes occurred near the Golis Mountains in Somalia and that multiple \"ISIS-Somalia operatives were killed.\"",
      "After multiple Trump administration officials claimed the information in the Signal chat group was unclassified, CBS News filed a request in March under the Freedom of Information Act to U.S. Africa Command to see if similar information deemed unclassified by Hegseth from the Yemen airstrike could be released regarding the March 25 airstrike on the ISIS operatives in Somalia.",
      "CBS News requested information about the airstrike that was similar to the information appearing in the Signal chat group about the strikes and that Trump intelligence officials had said was unclassified.",
      "In early September, CBS News received a response from U.S. Africa Command, which arrived at the same conclusion as the Pentagon inspector general about the Somalia airstrike \u2014 that the material if released could jeopardize national security.",
      "\"[The] information that is currently and properly classified pursuant to Executive Order 13526. \u2026 In this case, I have determined that the release of the documents would foreseeably harm national security,\" Marine Maj. Gen. Matthew Trollinger, the chief of staff to Air Force Gen. Dagvin R.M. Anderson, the commander of U.S. Africa Command, wrote in his letter to CBS News.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that the IG's review \"affirms what the Administration has said from the beginning \u2014 no classified information was leaked, and operational security was not compromised.\"",
      "She went on to say, \"The President's entire national security team is doing great work advancing American interests while protecting sensitive information,\" adding, \"President Trump stands by Secretary Hegseth.\"",
      "In separate statements on Wednesday, the top Democrats on the House and Senate Intelligence Committees called for Hegseth to resign.",
      "Virginia Sen. Mark Warner said the report \"notes that the IG is aware of several other Signal chats Hegseth used for official business, underscoring that this was not an isolated lapse. It reflects a broader pattern of recklessness and poor judgment from a secretary who has repeatedly shown he is in over his head.\"",
      "\"Pete Hegseth's behavior and lack of judgment would be a fireable offense for anyone else in the Department of Defense,\" Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut said. \"What's more, his refusal to sit for an interview with the Inspector General or submit his device for examination is yet another example of his failure to take responsibility for his actions.\"",
      "Last month, Hegseth joked about the \"Signalgate\" scandal while speaking at Fox Nation's Patriot Awards after spotting United Nations Ambassador Mike Waltz in the audience.",
      "\"I see Mike Waltz \u2014 Mike, I'll hit you up on Signal later.\"",

    "story": [
      "Steve Cropper, the lean, soulful guitarist and songwriter who helped anchor the celebrated Memphis backing band Booker T. and the M.G.'s at Stax Records and co-wrote the classics \"Green Onions,\" \"(Sittin' on) the Dock of the Bay\" and \"In the Midnight Hour,\" has died. He was 84.",
      "Pat Mitchell Worley, president and CEO of the Soulsville Foundation, confirmed Cropper's death to CBS News. The foundation operates the Stax Museum of American Soul Music in Memphis, located at the site of the former Stax Records, where Cropper worked for years.",
      "A cause of death was not immediately known. Longtime associate Eddie Gore told The Associated Press he was with Cropper on Tuesday at a rehabilitation facility in Nashville, where Cropper had been after a recent fall. Cropper had been working on new music when Gore visited, he said.",
      "\"He's such a good human,\" Gore said. \"We were blessed to have him, for sure.\"",
      "\"Steve was a beloved musician, songwriter, and producer whose extraordinary talent touched the lives of millions worldwide,\" Cropper's family said in a statement released through the foundation, describing his \"influence on American music is immeasurable.\"",
      "\"Every note he played, every song he wrote, and every artist he inspired ensure that his spirit and artistry will continue to move people for generations to come,\" the family wrote.",
      "The guitarist, songwriter and record producer was not known for flashy playing, but his spare, catchy licks and solid rhythm chops helped define Memphis soul music. At a time when it was common for White musicians to co-opt the work of Black artists and make more money from their songs, Cropper was that rare White artist willing to keep a lower profile and collaborate.",
      "Cropper was celebrated, respected by fellow guitarists",
      "Cropper's very name was immortalized in the 1967 smash \"Soul Man,\" recorded by Sam & Dave. Midway, singer Sam Moore calls out \"Play it, Steve!\" as Cropper pulls off a tight, ringing riff, a slide sound that Cropper used a Zippo lighter to create. The exchange was reenacted in the late 1970s when Cropper joined the John Belushi-Dan Aykroyd act \"The Blues Brothers\" and played on their hit cover of \"Soul Man.\"",
      "In a 2020 interview with AP, Cropper discussed his career and how he mastered the art of filling gaps with an essential lick or two.",
      "\"I listen to the other musicians and the singer,\" Cropper said. \"I'm not listening to just me. I make sure I'm sounding OK before we start the session. Once we've presented the song, then I listen to the song and the way they interpret it. And I play around all that stuff. That's what I do. That's my style.\"",
      "Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards, asked once about Cropper, said simply, \"Perfect, man.\" On a YouTube instructional video, guitar virtuoso Joe Bonamassa says Cropper's moves are often copied.",
      "\"If you haven't heard the name Steve Cropper, you've heard him in song,\" Bonamassa said.",
      "Cropper was born near Dora, Missouri, but moved with his family to Memphis when he was 9 and got his first mail-order guitar at age 14, according to his website, playitsteve.com. Chuck Berry, Jimmy Reed and Chet Atkins were among his early influences.",
      "Cropper was a Stax artist before the label was even called Stax, which Jim Stewart and Estelle Axton had founded as Satellite Records in 1957. In the early 1960s, Satellite signed up Cropper and his instrumental band the Royals Spades. The band soon changed its name to the Mar-Keys and had a hit with \"Last Night.\"",
      "Satellite was later renamed Stax, where some of the Mar-Keys became the label's horn section while Cropper and other Mar-Keys formed Booker T. and the M.G.'s. Featuring Cropper, keyboard player Booker T. Jones, bassist Donald \"Duck\" Dunn and drummer Al Jackson, they were known for their hit instrumentals \"Green Onions,\" \"Hang 'Em High\" and \"Time Is Tight,\" and backed Otis Redding, Sam & Dave and others.",
      "Cropper co-wrote \"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay\" weeks before Redding's death",
      "In a 2017 interview with \"CBS Mornings,\"\u00a0Cropper recounted playing guitar behind Redding at the Monterey Pop Festival in a legendary 1967 performance that helped put Redding on the map.",
      "\"We had no idea what the reaction was gonna be. And it was unbelievable,\" Cropper told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "In late November of 1967, Cropper said Redding brought him a song the now-legendary singer had started writing on a houseboat overlooking San Francisco Bay that would become \"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay.\"",
      "\"That afternoon, it was done,\" Cropper told \"CBS Mornings.\" \"We went and cut it the next day. I think there's three takes of it.\"",
      "A few weeks later, on Dec. 10, 1967, Redding died in a small plane crash near Madison, Wisconsin, at the age of 26.",
      "\"And I said, 'I just lost my best friend,'\" Cropper told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Cropper returned to the studio to put the finishing touches on the song, and \"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay,\" released in January 1968, became the first posthumous No. 1 record on the Billboard charts. It won Redding and Cropper the Grammy for Best R&B song, with Redding also winning Best Male R&B Vocal Performance.",
      "Booker T. and the M.G.'s. broke barriers",
      "Booker T. and the M.G.'s. was a racially integrated band, a rarity in its day. It was so admired that even non-Stax artists recorded with them, notably Wilson Pickett. Jones, who is the only surviving member of the band, and Jackson are Black. Dunn and Cropper are white.",
      "\"When you walked in the door at Stax, there was absolutely no color,\" Cropper said in the AP interview. \"We were all there for the same reason \u2014 to get a hit record.\"",
      "In the mid-1960s, Atlantic Records executive Jerry Wexler brought Pickett to work with the Stax musicians. During a 2015 gathering with the National Music Publishers Association, Cropper acknowledged he had never heard of Pickett before working with him. He found some gospel recordings by Pickett, was taken by the line \"I'll see my Jesus in the midnight hour\" and with a slight change helped write a secular standard.",
      "\"The man up there has been forgiving me for this ever since!\" he said.",
      "Cropper was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 as a member of Booker T. and the M.G.'s. That year, Cropper, Dunn and Jones played in an all-star tribute at Madison Square Garden to Bob Dylan. Al Jackson died in 1975, Dunn in 2012.",
      "Rolling Stone magazine ranked Cropper 39th on its 100 Greatest Guitarists list, calling him \"the secret ingredient in some of the greatest rock and soul songs.\"",
      "Cropper was in the 1980 movie \"The Blues Brothers\" and its follow-up, \"Blues Brothers 2000,\" portraying \"The Colonel\" in the Blues Brothers band. In real life, he toured with them.",
      "He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2005, and two years later received a Grammy Award for lifetime achievement.",
      "Cropper continued recording into his later years, including 2024's \"Friendlytown,\" which was nominated for a Grammy. Earlier this year, Cropper received the Tennessee Governor's Arts Award, the state's highest honor in the arts.",
      "He is survived by his wife and four children.",

    "story": [
      "The Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday formally announced a new immigration enforcement crackdown in New Orleans, the latest city led by Democrats to see a surge in Border Patrol agents tasked with carrying out President Trump's mass deportation campaign.",
      "DHS said it dubbed the operation \"Catahoula Crunch,\" confirming plans\u00a0reported by CBS News in mid-November. At the time, CBS News reported that Border Patrol was planning to dispatch roughly 200 agents to New Orleans, to oversee operations there targeting people suspected of being in the U.S. illegally. Internal agency documents showed officials requested armored vehicles for the operation.",
      "CBS News spoke Wednesday with Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino outside U.S. Customs and Border Protection's office in the city. Bovino said they'd be in the Big Easy \"until the mission is accomplished,\" and that so far they've arrested \"a lot, and still counting.\" There are \"several hundred agents\" spread across the New Orleans area, Bovino said.",
      "In a statement earlier Wednesday, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the administration targeted New Orleans because of local policies that limit cooperation between local law enforcement officials and federal immigration authorities.",
      "\"Catahoula Crunch targets include violent criminals who were released after arrest for home invasion, armed robbery, grand theft auto, and rape,\" McLaughlin added. \"Under President Trump and Secretary [Kristi] Noem, we are restoring law and order for the American people.\"",
      "Catahoulas are the official state dogs of Louisiana.",
      "Two U.S. officials told CBS News that DHS has asked the Department of Defense for permission to use Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base New Orleans as a staging area for immigration operations.",
      "Coinciding with the DHS announcement, the FBI's field office in New Orleans said it was partnering with the Louisiana State Police to protect the federal immigration agents deployed to the area and to curtail \"attempts to obstruct law enforcement actions.\"",
      "Earlier this week, Mr. Trump said he was planning to deploy National Guard troops to New Orleans for a separate anti-crime operation \"in a couple of weeks,\" though the administration has not announced an exact date. Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, a Republican, has welcomed the plan to dispatch National Guard members, saying the deployment is needed to curb violent crime.",
      "The Border Patrol crackdown in New Orleans is the most recent immigration enforcement operation launched by the second Trump administration in a Democratic-controlled city. The administration has deployed hundreds of Border Patrol agents to cities far away from a U.S. border, including Los Angeles, Chicago and Charlotte, North Carolina.",
      "Border Patrol's operations, led by controversial commander Bovino, have been met with harsh criticism from some local residents and elected officials, who have accused Bovino and his agents of inflaming tensions through aggressive arrests and heavy-handed tactics against protesters and other civilians. A federal judge in the Chicago area ruled that Border Patrol's use of force had been excessive.",
      "But Bovino has also been praised by supporters as a no-nonsense enforcer of Mr. Trump's mass deportation campaign. He has defended his agents' actions, including their use of force against protesters, as justified given violent acts by some individuals.",
      "Who Border Patrol has been arresting in these operations has also garnered controversy. In Los Angeles, Chicago and Charlotte, Border Patrol agents have been depicted on video smashing car windows and arresting day laborers and other workers during \"roving patrols\" at Home Depot parking lots and other locations.",
      "While Bovino and other Trump administration officials have said Border Patrol is primarily targeting immigrants in the U.S. illegally who also have committed serious crimes, CBS News reported last month that out of roughly 270 arrests in the Charlotte area, fewer than 90 detainees \u2014 roughly one third \u2014 were classified as criminals.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-new-fuel-economy-standards-mpg-biden/",
    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 17:43:35 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration proposed rules that would weaken fuel economy standards for vehicles set under President Biden in 2024.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is proposing new fuel economy standards for vehicles that would roll back efficiency rules implemented under former President Biden.",
      "Under the Transportation Department proposal, which was unveiled at a White House event on Wednesday, automakers would need to meet less stringent vehicle mileage requirements.",
      "Federal fuel economy rules are overseen by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) under what's known as the\u00a0CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) Standards. Enacted by Congress in 1975, the regulations stipulate how many miles vehicles must be able to drive on a gallon of fuel, with specific standards for light-duty vehicles, as well as medium- and heavy-duty trucks.",
      "The rules aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help consumers save money on gas, according to the Transportation Department. Critics of the fuel standards have long argued they are costly for automakers, which must make technological improvements to reduce fuel usage, raising vehicle prices.",
      "The revamped fuel standards would reverse a Biden policy that \"forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse,\" Mr. Trump said on Wednesday.",
      "Rules would sharply lower mileage standard",
      "If finalized, the plan would relax fuel economy standards by setting the industry average for light-duty vehicles at roughly 34.5 miles per gallon through the 2031 model year, lower than the 50 miles per gallon outlined by a Biden-era rule.",
      "On Wednesday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the previous rules drove up the cost of new cars and were \"completely unattainable\" for automakers. He initially\u00a0directed\u00a0NHTSA to review the CAFE regulations in January.",
      "The Transportation Department said the proposal is projected to save American families $1,000 on the average cost of a new vehicle and a total of $109 billion over the next five years.",
      "NHTSA Administrator Jonathan Morrison said the move to ease the mileage standards would make the nation's roads safer. \"Newer cars are safer cars and by reducing vehicle prices, more American families will be able to afford newer vehicles,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Mr. Trump was joined at Wednesday's event by senior auto industry executives.\u00a0In a statement shared with CBS News, Stellantis CEO Antonioa Filosa expressed support for the proposed fuel efficiency rules, saying the initiative would realign the CAFE standards \"with real-world market conditions as part of its wider vision for a growing U.S. automotive industry.\"",
      "General Motors also backed the proposed fuel economy standards, which would need to undergo an official rulemaking process before being adopted.",
      "\"GM supports the goals of NHTSA's proposed CAFE rule and its intention to better align fuel economy standards with market realities. We have long advocated for one national standard that upholds customer choice and provides the auto industry long-term stability,\" a spokesperson for the automaker said in a statement.",
      "The fuel economy proposal would roll back\u00a0a rule\u00a0finalized in June 2024 under the Biden administration aimed at raising the minimum gas mileage for passenger cars and light trucks by model year 2031.",
      "At the time, NHTSA said the new regulations would save Americans $23 billion at the gas pump and reduce pollution. Burning gas for vehicles is a major contributor to carbon emissions, which scientists have linked to climate change.",
      "The rules were also intended to spur automakers to produce more electric vehicles, a key Biden administration priority for the nation's transportation sector.",
      "Would new MPG rules ease car prices?",
      "CarEdge CEO Zach Shefka described the Trump administration proposal as a win for automakers, but said consumers shouldn't expect to see lower car prices right away. That's because automakers work at least five years ahead in their product development, he said, meaning it would take a while before any redesigned cars make it onto the road.",
      "If the proposal eventually does help lower vehicle prices, he said, \"It will happen years from now, not in the coming weeks or months.\"",
      "The Center for Biological Diversity, a nonprofit organization that works to protect endangered species, said the Transportation Department proposal will increase the country's oil consumption and undermine the competitiveness of U.S. automakers.",
      "\"Trump's action will feed America's destructive use of oil, while hamstringing us in the green tech race against Chinese and other foreign carmakers,\" said Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity's Safe Climate Transport Campaign.",
      "Wednesday's move is the latest effort by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged automakers to build cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles. The administration scrapped EV\u00a0tax credits\u00a0in September and has also proposed rules to eliminate\u00a0gas emission regulations.",

      "Joly Germine declined to say anything before U.S. District Judge John Bates in Washington, D.C., sentenced him.",
      "\"No remorse has been shown by Mr. Germine. No acceptance of responsibility,\" the judge said.",
      "Some of the kidnapping victims chose to speak in court, telling Germine they forgive him for his role in their ordeal.",
      "Ray Noecker, whose wife, Cheryl, and five children were held hostage, said it was a \"life-changing experience\" for their family. He turned to Germine and told him that he hopes he finds \"God's peace.\"",
      "\"True freedom is not found outside of prison walls. True freedom is found inside your own heart,\" Noecker said.",
      "The victims \u2014 16 U.S. citizens and one Canadian citizen \u2014 were kidnapped by gang members near Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on Oct. 16, 2021. Two hostages were\u00a0freed\u00a0in November 2021 and three more were\u00a0released\u00a0in early December. The remaining 12 escaped later in December after\u00a0being held at gunpoint for 62 days.",
      "Prosecutors also sought a life sentence. They said Germine, now 34, led the \"400 Mawozo\" gang from a prison in Haiti.",
      "Prosecutors allege that Germine ran the gang from behind bars using unmonitored cellphones, staying in constant contact with other 400 Mawozo leaders, most of them relatives. They say he controlled the gang's finances, supplied its weapons and directed its operations.",
      "\"This horrific crime was driven by defendant Germine's own self-interest; he wanted to secure his release from prison in exchange for the hostages,\" prosecutors wrote.",
      "Germine denies that he was a leader of the gang, according to his attorneys. They said he became involved in politics after allowing farmers to grow crops on his land.",
      "\"Mr. Germine genuinely tried to help his countrymen, especially those that did not have much. The Haitian government did not provide services and resources to the poor like we have in this country, and Mr. Germine tried to fill the gap,\" his lawyers wrote.",
      "The Christian missionaries were returning from a visit to an orphanage when kidnappers forced their bus to stop. One of the kidnapped children was 8 months old.",
      "The gang took credit for the kidnappings on social media and initially demanded a ransom of $17 million, or $1 million for each victim. But the hostage-takers later contacted a representative of the missionaries and asked for Germine's release from prison.",
      "Germine, also known as \"Yonyon,\" was the first person to be charged in connection with the kidnapping. He remained in prison but was transferred to the U.S. to face charges in a May 2022 indictment. After a trial earlier this year, a jury convicted him of charges including conspiracy to commit hostage taking.",
      "Germine was separately convicted of participating in a plot to smuggle semiautomatic firearms from the U.S. to Haiti for gang members' use. For that case, Bates sentenced him last year to 35 years in prison.",

      "In a deal with federal prosecutors entered Tuesday, former Florissant Officer Julian Alcala pleaded guilty to 20 counts of willfully depriving someone of their right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure. In exchange, prosecutors dropped a felony obstruction count.",
      "The count he pleaded guilty to is punishable by up to a year in prison, a $100,000 fine or both. Alcala, 30, remains free on bond pending his March 11, 2026, sentencing.",
      "According to the plea deal, Alcala pulled over a woman in February 2024 and took her cellphone to his vehicle, saying he needed to do so to confirm her insurance information. Instead, he found a video of the woman engaged in sexual activity on her phone and texted it to his own phone. He also found a nude photo of the woman and used his phone to take a picture of the image.",
      "Over the next several months, he took 19 other women's phones back to his vehicle during traffic stops, purportedly to confirm their insurance or vehicle registration, the plea deal states. He then looked for nude images and took photos of ones he found. The stops took place between Feb. 6, 2024, and May 18, 2024.",

    "summary": "The U.S. has increased its reward to $5 million for information leading to the arrest of an alleged leader of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.",
    "story": [
      "The United States government on Wednesday increased its reward for information leading to the arrest of Giovanni Vicente Mosquera Serrano, an alleged leader of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Through an organized crime rewards program operated by the Department of State, officials are now offering up to $5 million for tips that could bring Serrano into custody and potentially convict him on myriad drug charges.",
      "Mosquera Serrano was the first alleged member of Tren de Aragua to be added to the FBI's \"most wanted\" list, according to the State Department. He was initially indicted in Texas district court in January and charged with international cocaine trafficking conspiracy, then recharged in a second indictment in April that additionally accused him of supporting a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "President Trump labeled Tren de Aragua\u00a0a foreign terrorist organization, alongside other gangs and cartels, when he retook office in January. His administration has since ratcheted up pressure on Venezuela and its president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. In recent months, the U.S. has amassed a large military presence in the Caribbean and carried out multiple\u00a0strikes on boats it claims are carrying drugs from Venezuela.",
      "Some lawmakers have questioned whether the strikes are legal, and the first in that string of attacks, a deadly strike in early September, has prompted new concerns from Congress\u00a0that a follow-on strike despite there apparently being survivors in the water may constitute a war crime.",
      "Tren de Aragua's members are accused of a lengthy record of violent crimes, including murder, human trafficking, rape, kidnapping, bribery and racketeering. Originally formed inside Venezuela's Tocor\u00f3n prison, Tren de Aragua expanded during the incarceration of Hector Rusthenford Guerrero Flores, the alleged head of the gang known as Ni\u00f1o Guerrero. U.S. authorities have said Guerrero came to control the prison in addition to a series of gold mines and border crossings between Venezuela and Colombia, before eventually escaping custody.",
      "Mosquera Serrano is among the alleged members of Tren de Aragua who have been sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which sanctioned 11 more alleged affiliates of the gang on Wednesday, according to the State Department.",
      "One of the latest rounds of sanctions also targeted Jimena Romina Araya Navarro, a Venezuelan entertainer known as \"Rosita,\" the U.S. Treasury announced, claiming she is a Tren de Aragua affiliate. Rosita is allegedly part of a group of five people in the entertainment industry who are accused of providing \"material support\" to the gang, according to the Treasury. She has also been accused of helping Guerrero escape from prison in 2012, while the group of five allegedly helped launder money for some of the gang's leaders, the department said.",
      "\"Under President Trump, barbaric terrorist cartels can no longer operate with impunity across our borders,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a news release. \"At the direction of President Trump, we will continue to use every tool to cut off these terrorists from the U.S. and global financial system and keep American citizens safe.\"",

    "summary": "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been directed by the Trump administration to target undocumented Somali immigrants in the Twin Cities, according to the New York Times.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been directed by the Trump administration to target undocumented Somali immigrants in the Twin Cities, a person familiar with the planning confirmed.",
      "A U.S. official says ICE is planning to surge resources to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area to launch immigration enforcement operations there targeting individuals with deportation orders. The region has the largest population of immigrants from Somalia in the U.S., some of whom have deportation orders.",
      "The enhanced ICE operations in the Twin Cities are expected to begin this week, the official said. The operations were\u00a0first reported by the New York Times.",
      "Hundreds of people are expected to be targeted, the person familiar with the planning said.",
      "Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the agency would not discuss \"future or potential operations.\"",
      "President Trump: \"I don't want [Somalis] in our country\"",
      "In the midst of Tuesday's reports, President Trump took further aim at Minnesota's Somali community, the country of Somalia and the diaspora at large.",
      "\"They contribute nothing \u2026 I don't want them in our country,\" Trump said to the press on Tuesday. \"That's not politically correct, but I don't care. I don't want them here. Their country is no good for a reason.\"",
      "In a\u00a0Thanksgiving post where he also called Gov. Tim Walz a slur for people with intellectual disabilities, Mr. Trump said Somali refugees are \"completely taking over the once great State of Minnesota.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also previously ordered all green card holders from Somalia and more than a dozen other countries to be reexamined and said he would end the temporary protected status for Somalis in Minnesota, claiming, without evidence, that \"Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great state.\" The latter move would affect hundreds in the community.",
      "Mr. Trump has become increasingly focused on people of Somali descent living in the U.S., saying recently that they \"have caused a lot of trouble,\" which is rhetoric that community leaders say has inflamed tensions and revived fears of profiling.",
      "On Monday evening, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also announced his department is investigating whether Minnesota tax money found its way to al Shabaab, a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization and al Qaeda affiliate based in Somalia.",
      "Minneapolis, St. Paul leaders stand in solidarity with Somali community",
      "In a joint news conference on Tuesday afternoon, the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul, along with Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara and Minneapolis City Council member Jamal Osman, said they are standing in solidarity with the metro's Somali community.",
      "\"To our Somali community, I love you, and we stand with you. That commitment is rock solid,\" said Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. \"Minneapolis is proud to be home to the largest Somali community in the entire country. They've been here for decades, in many instances. Entrepreneurs and fathers, they benefit both the cultures and the economic resilience of our city.\"",
      "Frey said the targeting of Minnesota's Somali population \"means due process will be violated.\"",
      "\"Mistakes will be made, and let's be clear, it means that American citizens will be detained, for no other reason than the fact that they look like they are Somali,\" Frey said. \"That is not now and will never be a legitimate reason.\"",
      "St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter said the actions of the Trump administration are \"un-American.\"",
      "\"I grew up in an America that prided itself on being a country of immigrants, that prided itself on the fact that people from other countries would look across a whole ocean and say that's where I want to be. It seems that what we learned was that we've prided ourselves and we have decades and generations of priding ourselves on being a beacon for immigration from Europe,\" Carter said. \"I mean, it seems to many of us, like, the darker-skinned the immigrants who come to our country are, the more our posture on immigration as a country has shifted. That's un-American. That's concerning.\"",
      "Carter said the Twin Cities need to unite to stand up for immigrants and refugees.",
      "\"The last thing that we need is federal agents coming to town attempting to turn us against each other, to turn us against ourselves. The last thing we need is federal agents coming in town to create chaos and challenge for us, and so we stand together,\" Carter said. \"We encourage folks to look to the organizations that serve immigrants and refugees across our community because we have constant reminders out there about what your rights are. You have rights, that's an American thing.\"",
      "Minneapolis City Council member Jamal Osman, who was born in Somalia, pulled no punches in his assessment of the president.",
      "\"One of the things I do want to say, and obviously everyone knows that our president is racist, xenophobic, Islamophobic, and we're going to fight that,\" Osman said. \"America has a history of fighting and stopping those kind of individuals who continue to divide people and divide communities.\"",
      "Osman said his community will remain firm amid the current climate of danger.",
      "\"Our community has lived through fear in the past, and we're not gonna let them divide that,\" Osman said.",
      "As head of the Minneapolis police, O'Hara reiterated that his police officers do not work with federal law enforcement who are conducting immigration enforcement.",
      "\"We don't provide information to federal immigration authorities,\" he said. \"We don't ask people about their immigration status. Our mission is clear: to protect life, to uphold the law and to maintain safety for all people in our communities.\"",
      "O'Hara added that officers will receive additional guidance later this week regarding the department's immigration policy.",
      "Many Somali Americans in Minnesota say they've felt a growing sense of uneasiness after Mr. Trump's continued rhetoric against Somalis, which has sparked frustration and fear.",
      "\"I was only 3 years old when I came and this is my home,\" Madino Mudey said. \"This has to stop.\"",
      "A few people at Minneapolis' busiest Somali mall say they noticed what they believe to be federal agents circling the property Tuesday, but authorities haven't confirmed that.",
      "Gov. Walz calls reports of ICE operation \"PR stunt\"",
      "On Tuesday afternoon, Walz responded to the reports that ICE would target undocumented Somalis in the Twin Cities, calling it \"a PR stunt.\"",
      "\"We welcome support in investigating and prosecuting crime,\" Walz added. \"Indiscriminately targeting immigrants is not a real solution to a problem.\"",
      "Minnesota has the largest Somali population in the U.S., with the latest census data showing about 80,000 (83,445) living in the Twin Cities metro area. More than 100,000 (107,087) total reside in Minnesota, according to the CBS News Data Team.  Many fled the long civil war in their East African country and were drawn to the state's welcoming social programs.",
      "Jaylani Hussein, a Somali American who is executive director of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said his group has heard of \"less than a dozen\" immigration arrests within the local Somali community in recent days.",
      "But Hussein said around 95% of Somalis in Minnesota are U.S. citizens, so the number of those at earlier stages of the immigration process is a \"pretty small\" proportion of the community. He said they estimate that 50% of the community was born in the U.S.",
      "The history behind Minnesota's Somali-American community",
      "Dr. Ahmed Samatar, the founding dean of the Kofi Annan Institute for Global Citizenship at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, spoke with WCCO in 2019 about why so many Somali-Americans have made \"the Land of 10,000 Lakes\" home.",
      "Samatar said it all began in 1991 with Somalia's civil war.",
      "\"Somalis, everyone, they have to flee,\" Samatar said. \"Whoever will take them in, they have to flee.\"",
      "Some stayed in Somalia but were internally displaced. Others went to refugee camps in neighboring countries. Many were sent to other countries all over the world.",
      "According to the Minnesota Department of Human Services, 13,582 Somali refugees came to Minnesota between 2005 and 2018.",
      "\"Of course, when some came, they will tell others about the good news of Minnesota,\" Samatar said. \"I call that the 'call of kinship.'\"",
      "He thinks there are a variety of reasons for what are called \"secondary arrivals,\" but there are a few that stand out. One is the support from local, volunteer resettlement agencies that work with governments to help refugees find housing, schooling and jobs.",
      "Samatar also cited Minnesota's strong economy, which gave Somali-Americans job opportunities \u2014 many in western Minnesota \u2014 schooling options, health care and a safe place to live.",
      "\"The state of Minnesota has always been considered a kind and successful place,\" he said.",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 14:33:47 -0500",
    "summary": "See maps of how Texas, California, Missouri, North Carolina and Indiana redistricting pushes could play out, based on the 2024 election results.",
    "story": [
      "North Carolina is the latest state to join a mid-decade redistricting gambit that could shake up next year's midterms \u2014 following similar moves by Missouri, Texas and California to redraw their congressional maps, and a separate court-ordered effort in Utah.",
      "The redistricting push began when President Trump last summer pressed Texas Republicans to redistrict and increase the number of GOP seats. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed legislation in August to redraw the districts and create five GOP-friendly seats, launching the first salvo in a battle that has spread to other states.",
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom,\u00a0in turn, launched an effort to redraw California's map to help Democrats. In November, the plan was approved by voters by a 29-point margin.",
      "In Missouri, state lawmakers redrew their map in September to squeeze Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver from his Kansas City district. Then in October, North Carolina state Republicans\u00a0redrew the 1st Congressional District, held by a Democrat, to make it more favorable to conservatives.",
      "In Indiana, despite their initial reluctance, lawmakers reconvened in December to redraw their congressional map, aiming to create two more Republican seats and change their U.S. House delegation from 7-2 to 9-0.",
      "Utah lawmakers also reworked their state's map after a judge ruled the current districts violated restrictions on gerrymandering. All four of the state's House districts are represented by Republicans, but a judge in November threw out the GOP-controlled legislature's map and ordered one that will create a Democratic-leaning district in Salt Lake City.",
      "Challenges remain in all states that are redoing their maps. In Texas, a federal court\u00a0blocked the state\u00a0from using the newly redrawn map in the upcoming midterm elections. The NAACP filed a lawsuit challenging Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe's authority to create Missouri's new map outside of a census year, and three other lawsuits have been filed. Despite getting the seal of approval by voters in California, state Republicans filed a lawsuit against Prop 50 after Election Day.",
      "Congressional maps are normally redrawn every 10 years after the U.S. Census reveals population shifts. But this rare mid-decade redistricting push was kicked off as Republicans seek to maintain \u2014 or even expand \u2014 their razor-thin majority in Congress in the 2026 midterm elections. Historically speaking, midterms are often a rebuke of the party in the White House.",
      "Abbott then called a special session of the Legislature with redistricting on the agenda. But two weeks into the 30-day special session, Texas Democrats fled the state to deny a quorum and prevent the legislation from coming to the floor.",
      "The Democrats ultimately returned after two weeks, and the legislation was passed, but they garnered significant national attention. Although California requires congressional maps to be approved by voters, Newsom vowed to redraw the state's districts to garner up to five seats for Democrats to counter Texas.",
      "Amid this push, other states have also started to discuss redistricting efforts, including Indiana and Florida, which could net Republicans several more seats.",
      "Although both parties are trying to rig their states' congressional districts to be favorable to themselves, the outcome is far from guaranteed.",
      "\"Computers and technology do give us a lot more ability to to make predictive statements about outcomes, but we're doing it \u2014 I think it's fair to say \u2014 in a very volatile environment politically, where things that we have seen as trends are sort of being turned on their heads,\" said Kareem Crayton, vice president of the Washington, D.C.-based the Brennan Center for Justice.",
      "Crayton noted several current issues that could factor heavily into voters' decisions, and called it \"folly to assume that just because people showed up and voted for the current president of the United States, that people want to show up for a member of Congress, particularly \u2026 a new candidate in a district that hasn't been created before.\"",
      "See maps of how Texas, California and Missouri's push could play out, based on the 2024 election results:",
      "Texas has 38 congressional seats, with 25 held by Republicans and 13 by Democrats.",
      "Republicans have invested heavily in the Rio Grande Valley, once a Democratic stronghold, but they've made inroads. In 2024, two of the three Rio Grande Valley House seats voted for Mr. Trump, though they reelected their Democratic congressional representatives. The maps were designed to increase those gains and box out the two Democrats.",
      "Texas Democrats have recently made gains in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and Houston's Harris County. The new maps reshape Democratic Rep. Al Green's Houston district in the rural areas, making a district that was 72% Democratic into one that is 40% Democratic. The proposed map also changes Rep. Julie Johnson's Dallas-area district from 62% to 41% Democratic. Rep. Marc Veasey's district in Dallas-Fort Worth remains a Democratic stronghold, but he would no longer live in the district.",
      "Liberal Austin is further dissolved into neighboring districts. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, who was first elected in 1994 and whose district gave former Vice President Kamala Harris her largest margin of victory in all of Texas, announced in August that he would not seek reelection if the proposed maps are upheld by the courts, avoiding a primary with Rep. Greg Casar, also of Austin.",
      "On Nov. 18, a three-judge panel in the U.S. District Court in El Paso blocked Texas from using the maps approved by the legislature in August. The court said that the plaintiffs will likely succeed in showing that race predominated over partisanship in the map-making process, and said the legislature appears to have set and followed a racial target.",
      "California has 52 House representatives, with nine Republicans and 43 Democrats.",
      "In 2020, Republicans flipped three seats held by Democrats for the first time since 1994. They've hung onto two of them, including GOP Rep. David Valadao's 22nd District in the Central Valley.",
      "Under the proposed map, Valadao's district would go from being 47% Democratic in 2024 to 49% Democratic, making him slightly more vulnerable. And GOP Rep. Darrell Issa's 48th District near San Diego would change from 42% to 52% Democratic.",
      "In Southern California, Rep. Ken Calvert's 41st District in Riverside would be redrawn further toward Los Angeles, shifting it from a district that was 47% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 57% Democratic under the proposed maps.",
      "In Northern California, GOP Rep. Doug LaMalfa's District 1, which includes the northeastern-most part of the state, would shift further south toward Marin County and the northern part would be absorbed in the 2nd District, home to heavily Democratic Eureka and the northern Pacific coast. Rep. Kevin Kiley's district, which snakes along the California-Nevada border through Death Valley, would instead move further toward heavily Democratic Sacramento. Republican Rep. Tom McClintock's 5th District would be shifted to include the southern portions of what was Kiley's district.",
      "Kiley, whose district would go from one that was 48% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 55% Democratic, has been an outspoken critic of redistricting, even introducing legislation in the House to ban mid-decade redistricting.",
      "After Texas and California's redistricting efforts, Gov. Kehoe called a special session of Missouri's legislature to take up redistricting. Missouri currently has two Democratic representatives in Congress: Rep. Wesley Bell, who represents St. Louis and was first elected in 2025, and Cleaver, who has represented the Kansas City area since 2005.",
      "As Missouri has trended toward Republicans over the past 20 years, Cleaver's district has been a target of the GOP, especially in the 2021 redistricting when several lawmakers pushed for what was called the \"7 to 1 map\" that would have redrawn the 5th Congressional District to be more Republican. Lawmakers ultimately decided against that plan. St. Louis' NPR station reported that Republicans worried that the short-term gains from carving up the district could lead to long-term problems in the neighboring suburban districts.",
      "Nonetheless, the Missouri GOP joined the redistricting effort in 2025. Under the new map, Cleaver's district transforms from one that is 62% Democratic to one that is 41% Democratic. Cleaver says he still plans to run for reelection.",
      "The neighboring 4th and 6th Districts both become slightly bluer, to 39% and 36% Democratic, respectively, but they are still safely Republican.",
      "By expanding the 2nd District south and west, GOP Rep. Ann Wagner's district becomes redder, going from 46% Democratic in 2024 to 44%. While Wagner has maintained her grip on the district, Mr. Trump won by only 100 votes under the previous lines in 2020. In the 2021 redistricting, Wagner's district lost some of the Democratic-leaning St. Louis County.",
      "North Carolina has 14 congressional seats, 10 of which are held by Republicans. But the state is not as solidly red as that breakdown would suggest \u2014 it's closer to a 50/50 state at the presidential level these days, and the state's governor and attorney general are both Democrats.",
      "In the redistricting push undertaken this fall, North Carolina Republicans are targeting a single seat: Rep. Don Davis' 1st Congressional District. Davis' win in 2024 in the northeastern part of the state was a rare bright spot for Democrats, especially after Republicans were able to flip congressional three seats in North Carolina that year.",
      "In the map passed by the North Carolina Assembly on Oct. 21 and 22, Davis' district boundaries move further south, into the current 3rd District. That changes the makeup of the district from one that was 48% Democratic to one that is 44% Democratic.",
      "Indiana state lawmakers initially resisted the Trump administration's pressure to redraw their map to edge out the two Democratic seats. When Republican Gov. Mike Braun called a special session in November, Senate President Rodric Bray said publicly the votes weren't there, and when the legislature convened, it only agreed to meet again in January for the regular session.",
      "But lawmakers reversed course in November and said they would reconvene take up redistricting. On Dec. 1, Indiana House Republicans unveiled their proposed map, which significantly changes the boundaries of District 1 and District 7.",
      "In the proposed map, District 1, which includes Gary, Indiana, and other Chicago suburbs, is redrawn so voters are spread through Districts 2 and 4. All three districts are between 40-44% Democratic under the proposed map. The map would also break up the heavily Democratic District 7, which currently includes most of Indianapolis and backed Harris with 71% of its vote. It would be split, with its population absorbed into several Republican districts.",
      "There are still several GOP holdouts in the Indiana Senate. The contentious debate over redistricting has led to threats against bomb threats and swatting attempts against lawmakers, the FBI said. But Braun, who has also been targeted, posted on social media in November that he told Mr. Trump that he's \"committed\" to pursuing redistricting.",
      "Utah redistricting",
      "Utah differs from the other states here, among other reasons, because there are no Democrats among the four members of its congressional delegation. And its 2025 redistricting effort was put in motion when a judge ruled the current districts violated a voter-approved measure to prevent partisan gerrymandering.",
      "The GOP-controlled legislature produced four maps for public comment, and on Oct. 6, approved a map that would be the least competitive for Democrats. The legislature proposed a map that would split Salt Lake County into two districts, which would make Districts 2 and 3 more competitive for Democrats.",
      "But a district court judge in Utah on Nov. 10 rejected redistricting maps selected by the Republican-controlled legislature and instead selected a map that would create a Democratic-leaning congressional district in Salt Lake City. The map approved by the legislature \"does not comply with Utah law,\" wrote 3rd District Court Judge Dianna Gibson in her opinion. She continued that \"based on the evidence presented,\" the legislature's map \"unduly favors Republicans and disfavors Democrats.\"",
      "The maps enacted by Gibson create a new district encompassing Salt Lake City that would be 62% Democratic, based on the 2024 presidential results.",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 14:00:26 -0500",
    "summary": "In some cities where federal agents have conducted large-scale immigration operations that officials said would largely target criminals, more people without criminal records were detained in recent months.",
    "story": [
      "During some of the federal government's most recent high-profile immigration crackdowns in Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. \u2014 which the Trump administration has said are intended to target mainly unauthorized immigrants with criminal histories \u2014 most of the people detained had only civil immigration violations, new data shows.",
      "The data, released by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and published by the Deportation Data Project on Monday, shows detentions of people without criminal records spiked in recent months in those cities.",
      "From early September, when the Chicago operation began, to mid-October, average daily book-ins to temporary detention facilities in Chicago or nearby Broadview increased from about three people a day without criminal records to more than 45, a jump of more than 1,400%. Fewer than 25 people with criminal charges or convictions were detained per day on average by mid-October, the data shows.",
      "Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., average daily detentions of people without criminal records peaked at 37 per day in late August. Throughout that month and into September, a daily average of fewer than 10 people with criminal charges or convictions were booked, about the same number as before the crackdown began.",
      "In Los Angeles, total immigration arrests have declined since the summer, when agents carried out the most raids. In June and July, 63% of those initially detained in L.A.-area facilities did not have criminal records.",
      "The data only captures the start of the federal deployment in Memphis, Tennessee, but reflects a similar pattern: more than half of detentions in Memphis' hold center in the first two weeks of October were of people with only civil immigration violations.",
      "Unlike other cities, Portland, Oregon, where federal troops were deployed starting in June, has seen an approximately even split in detentions of those with criminal convictions, those with pending charges and those with only civil immigration violations in the summer and early fall.",
      "Border Patrol agents have played a role in the operations, especially in Chicago and L.A., alongside ICE. Those they arrest are held in ICE detention centers and included in the data.",
      "In its public statements on its immigration operations across the country, the Department of Homeland Security repeatedly said it will be largely focusing on those with criminal records. In a news release announcing the Chicago operation, dubbed \"Operation Midway Blitz,\" DHS said it would target the \"worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens,\" accusing Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker of releasing \"gang members, rapists, kidnappers, and drug traffickers on Chicago's streets.\"",
      "In contrast, border czar Tom Homan and acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement director Todd Lyons have said anyone authorities find to be in the U.S. illegally will be arrested. While the federal government has the authority to arrest anyone suspected of violating U.S. immigration law, some individuals may be eligible for certain protections from deportation, such as those with asylum claims.",
      "In response to reporting on the high number of non-criminals arrested, DHS has asserted that 70% of those arrested by ICE since the start of the second Trump administration have had criminal charges or convictions. Overall, that figure is roughly accurate, according to the newly released data, which shows that 66% of those arrested from Jan. 20 to Oct. 15 had criminal charges or convictions.",
      "But that percentage has shrunk each month since April, the data shows. Those with only civil immigration violations have become the fastest-growing group held in ICE detention.",
      "About 7% of those detained were convicted of violent crimes, including murder, rape, assault and robbery. The data does not indicate the severity of the charges for those who have not been convicted, which may range from serious felonies to misdemeanors and immigration-related crimes.",
      "\"Every single one of these illegal aliens broke our nation's laws by being in the country illegally, DHS spokesperson Trisha McLaughlin wrote on X in response to previous CBS News reporting.",
      "Being present in the U.S. illegally, after crossing the border or overstaying a visa, for example, has typically not been treated as a crime and generally handled as a civil violation in immigration court.",

      "The two women, Christina and Catherine Cuellar, wrote in their letter, dated Nov. 12, that they believed the congressman's \"independence and honesty may have contributed to how this case began.\"",
      "\"He has never been afraid to speak his mind, especially when it comes to protecting the people of South Texas and securing the border from policies of the previous administration,\" they told the president.",
      "Cuellar's daughters also appeared to reference Mr. Trump's own criminal cases, which they called his \"challenges.\" They said they prayed for the president and his family \"because we know that behind the headlines, there are real people who hurt, who love and who still hope for better days.\"",
      "Mr. Trump faced federal charges in two cases brought by former special counsel Jack Smith, though both\u00a0ended after he won the presidency last year. A state prosecution in Georgia related to the 2020 election was also dismissed last week. The president was convicted on 34 felony counts in New York in June 2024 and has appealed the conviction.",
      "Cuellar thanked Mr. Trump for the pardon and for \"taking the time to look at the facts.\"",
      "\"This decision clears the air and lets us move forward for South Texas.  This pardon gives us a clean slate. The noise is gone. The work remains. And I intend to meet it head on,\" he wrote on X. \"Thank you Mr. President, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.\"",
      "House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Cuellar \"is a well-respected member of the House of Representatives, a beloved representative down in Laredo and across South Texas. And in my view, the right outcome has been achieved.\"",
      "In last year's indictment against the Cuellars, federal prosecutors accused them of accepting at least $598,000 in bribes from an oil and gas company owned by the government of Azerbaijan and a Mexican bank. They alleged that the bribes were laundered in the form of sham consulting contracts through front companies and middlemen into shell companies owned by Imelda Cuellar. The congressman's wife, according to the indictment, \"performed little or no legitimate\" work under the consulting contracts.",
      "The Justice Department also accused Cuellar of acting as a foreign agent to benefit the government of Azerbaijan.",
      "He and his wife faced 14 counts, including conspiracy, bribery and money laundering. They pleaded not guilty. A trial in Cuellar's case was set to begin in April.",
      "The congressman, who served as the top Democrat on the House Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, stepped down from the post while the case continued. Cuellar was elected to the House in 2005 and currently represents the 28th Congressional District, which stretches from San Antonio south to the U.S.-Mexico border. He\u00a0won reelection\u00a0last year, defeating his Republican opponent by more than 13,000 votes.",
      "The president's decision to grant clemency to Cuellar comes as Mr. Trump has faced backlash for his recent use of the pardon power, namely for providing reprieve to Juan Orlando Hernandez, the former president of Honduras who was convicted last year of helping to smuggle 400 tons of cocaine into the U.S.",
      "Hernandez had been sentenced to 45 years\u00a0in prison after he was found guilty of drug trafficking and weapons charges. But in announcing his decision to pardon Hernandez, Mr. Trump said he was treated \"very harshly and unfairly.\"",
      "Hernandez was released from a federal prison in West Virginia on Monday.",
      "While Mr. Trump pardoned Hernandez, his administration has also ordered strikes on vessels in the Caribbean that were allegedly carrying drugs.",
      "The move by the president could also have political reverberations. The National Republican Congressional Committee targeted Cuellar's seat as a potential pick-up for Republicans in next year's midterm elections. His district was also among those redrawn by Texas Republicans during their mid-decade redistricting this summer to bolster the GOP's chances of holding onto their House majority, though it shifted only slightly from an estimated 46% Democratic share under the old lines to 45% Democratic share under the new boundaries.",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 09:13:58 -0500",
    "summary": "A new report from Realtor.com projects that the housing market will shift in a more buyer-friendly direction in 2026.",
    "story": [
      "It's still a tough time to get a foothold in the housing market, with homes sitting near record values and mortgage rates parked well above 6%. But the tide could turn in 2026, with property prices forecast to dip in 22 of the largest 100 U.S. cities and mortgage rates expected to ease slightly, according to a new analysis from\u00a0Realtor.com.",
      "The real estate market is expected to move in a more \"buyer-friendly\" direction next year, leading to the \"most balanced housing market\" since the pandemic, meaning that neither sellers nor buyers are likely to have the upper hand in negotiations, said Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com.",
      "Mortgage rates are expected to dip to an average of 6.3% next year, a slight drop from 2025's 6.6% average rate. Lower borrowing costs, as well as strong wage growth next year, should encourage more buyers to jump into the market, Krimmel added.",
      "\"2026 is going to be a year where we think the market is going to steady,\" Krimmel said. \"It's going to show a lot of signs of getting back on track to what we consider to be normal.\"",
      "That will help push up existing-home sales, which are projected to increase less than 2% to 4.13 million properties in 2026, according to Realtor.com's report. That's only a slight bump from this year's projected 4.07 million home sales, but a notable change given that transactions have been relatively flat throughout 2025.",
      "Where will prices drop?",
      "Most of the 22 cities where home prices are forecast to drop next year are located in the Southeast and the West. For instance, seven of the eight largest cities in Florida are projected to see declines in home prices next year, with the sole exception of Miami, the report said.",
      "The Cape Coral-Fort Lauderdale metropolitan area is expected to see the nation's largest price decline next year, with homes dropping by 10.2%, the analysis says. That's followed by the North Port-Sarasota-Bradenton, Florida region, with an 8.9% decline.",
      "The cities with projected price drops include those where inventory has expanded, providing more choices for buyers, Krimmel said. Some of those metropolitan areas may now also have lighter demand from buyers compared with the COVID-era\u00a0real estate boom, which was fueled by low mortgage rates and a shift to work-at-home policies.",
      "\"These places, among others, saw a huge frenzy during the pandemic, so part of what we are projecting is that demand continuing to come back down to earth,\" Krimmel told CBS News.",
      "Prices are expected to rise in the other 78 largest U.S. cities, but the hikes are likely to be small, with a median price gain of 4% across those locations.",

    "published": "Mon, 01 Dec 2025 15:43:35 -0500",
    "summary": "Holiday spending is hitting new records, but some data shows that people are buying fewer items amid higher prices.",
    "story": [
      "Americans may not be feeling jolly about their economic prospects, but that didn't stop shoppers from opening their wallets on Black Friday and driving spending to new records. Despite record holiday sales, however, other signs suggest consumers are getting a smaller bang for their buck because of rising inflation and stingier seasonal discounts.",
      "Consumers spent a combined $11.8 billion online on Nov. 28 during the shopping blitz, a 9.1% jump from last year, Adobe Analytics said. Including in-store sales, Americans spent 4.1% more on Black Friday than a year earlier,\u00a0according to Mastercard SpendingPulse.",
      "Purchases on Cyber Monday are also expected to be strong, with Adobe forecasting shoppers will spend a record $14.2 billion online today, which would amount to a more than 6% jump from a year ago.",
      "The resilience of the American consumer has helped buoy the economy even as it faces headwinds ranging from higher costs from the Trump administration's tariffs to a spike in corporate layoffs amid a slowing labor market.",
      "Inflation remains a problem",
      "Yet while discounts dangled by retailers from Walmart to Amazon helped fuel spending, beneath the record sales are signs of weakness, according to online sales data from Salesforce.com. Discounts this year aren't as deep, with the average selling price of goods rising 7% from a year ago, while consumers bought 2% fewer items at checkout, Salesforce said.",
      "\"A lot of growth is being driven by higher prices, and this means the growth in the number of things that people buy is significantly less,\" Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData, told CBS News. \"So far this year, we have retail volume growth running at about 0.3%, which is very low growth.\"",
      "He added, \"This is one of the reasons some consumers feel a little gloomy when they see their dollars don't stretch as far as they once did.\"",
      "Inflation ticked up to 3% in September on an annual basis, according to the latest available Consumer Price Index data. That's up from a low this year of 2.3% in April.",
      "Experts say tighter household budgets are causing many consumers to watch their spending, such as by focusing on a few \"big ticket\" purchases, or spreading out what they buy over days of promotions in hopes of getting the most bang for their buck.",
      "Affordability pinch",
      "Consumer spending is vital to the U.S. economy because it represents about 70 cents of every $1 of gross domestic product. With consumer confidence falling last month to its lowest point since April, there were questions about whether the holiday season would bring cheer or gloom to retailers.",
      "Some Americans are also facing an affordability pinch, with costs for everything from groceries to utility bills on the rise. According to Deloitte's 2025 holiday study, three-quarters of shoppers reported bracing for higher prices during the holidays.",
      "Consumer spending in 2025 has been largely driven by high-income households, with the top 10% accounting for nearly half of all spending in the second quarter, according to an\u00a0analysis\u00a0of Federal Reserve data by Mark Zandi, chief economist at financial research firm Moody's Analytics.",
      "Spending among the bottom 80% of households \u2014 or those earning less than $175,000 a year \u2014 has \"simply kept pace with inflation since the pandemic,\" Zandi wrote in a September social media post.",
      "That's creating a so-called\u00a0K-shaped economy, with high-earning Americans spending more, while middle- and low-income households are holding back due to rising costs.",
      "\"Virtually all major holiday outlooks point to a bifurcated consumer,\" Kent Smetters of the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a nonpartisan research project at the University of Pennsylvania, said in an email. \"Widening behavioral gap \u2014 high-income households spending and staying online; lower-income households more selective, financed and volume-conscious.\"",
      "For now, both discount retailers and luxury stores appear to be outperforming this season, Saunders noted.",
      "\"So far, we're seeing value-focused retailers like Walmart and off-price do well,\" he said. \"Some of the accessible luxury brands, such as Coach and Ralph Lauren, are also doing really well. So there are winners out there, but the low-volume growth means that there are losers, too.\"",

      "\"I guess I was prepared to give my life if I had to. Fortunately, I did not have to,\" Shay said in a 2024 interview with The Associated Press.",
      "\"I had been given a job, and the way I looked at it, it was up to me to complete my job,\" he recalled. \"I did not have time to worry about my situation of being there and perhaps losing my life. There was no time for this.\"",
      "On that night, exhausted, he eventually fell asleep in a grove above the beach.",
      "\"When I woke up in the morning, it was like I was sleeping in a graveyard because there were dead Americans and Germans surrounding me,\" he recalled. \"I stayed there for not very long and I continued on my way.\"",
      "Shay then pursued his mission in Normandy for several weeks, rescuing those wounded, before heading with American troops to eastern France and Germany, where he was taken prisoner in March 1945 and liberated a few weeks later.",
      "Spreading a message of peace",
      "After World War II, Shay reenlisted in the military because the situation of Native Americans in his home state of Maine was too precarious due to poverty and discrimination.",
      "Maine would not allow individuals living on Native American reservations to vote until 1954.",
      "Shay continued to witness history \u2014 returning to combat as a medic during the Korean War, participating in U.S. nuclear testing in the Marshall Islands and later working at the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, Austria.",
      "For over 60 years, he did not talk about his WWII experience.",
      "But he began attending D-Day commemorations in 2007 and in recent years, he has seized many occasions to give his powerful testimony and spread a message of peace.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020-2021, Shay's lone presence marked commemoration ceremonies as travel restrictions prevented other veterans or families of fallen soldiers from the U.S., Britain and other allied countries from making the trip to France.",
      "Sadness at seeing war back in Europe",
      "For years, Shay used to perform a sage-burning ceremony, in homage to those who died, on a bluff overlooking Omaha Beach, where the monument bearing his name now stands.",
      "On June 6, 2022, he handed over the remembrance task to another Native American, Julia Kelly, a Gulf War veteran from the Crow tribe. That was just over three months after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in what was to become the worst war on the continent since 1945.",
      "Shay then expressed his sadness at seeing war back on the continent.",
      "\"Ukraine is a very sad situation. I feel sorry for the people there and I don't know why this war had to come,\" he said. \"In 1944, I landed on these beaches and we thought we'd bring peace to the world. But it's not possible.\"",

      "A man alleged to be the founder and leader of a Haitian gang was sentenced on Wednesday to life in prison for orchestrating the 2021 kidnapping of 17 people \u2014 16 of them Americans \u2014 including five children, who were on a missionary trip to the Caribbean country.",
      "Joly Germine declined to say anything before U.S. District Judge John Bates in Washington, D.C., sentenced him.",
      "\"No remorse has been shown by Mr. Germine. No acceptance of responsibility,\" the judge said.",
      "Some of the kidnapping victims chose to speak in court, telling Germine they forgive him for his role in their ordeal.",
      "Ray Noecker, whose wife, Cheryl, and five children were held hostage, said it was a \"life-changing experience\" for their family. He turned to Germine and told him that he hopes he finds \"God's peace.\"",
      "\"True freedom is not found outside of prison walls. True freedom is found inside your own heart,\" Noecker said.",
      "The victims \u2014 16 U.S. citizens and one Canadian citizen \u2014 were kidnapped by gang members near Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on Oct. 16, 2021. Two hostages were\u00a0freed\u00a0in November 2021 and three more were\u00a0released\u00a0in early December. The remaining 12 escaped later in December after\u00a0being held at gunpoint for 62 days.",
      "Prosecutors also sought a life sentence. They said Germine, now 34, led the \"400 Mawozo\" gang from a prison in Haiti.",
      "Prosecutors allege that Germine ran the gang from behind bars using unmonitored cellphones, staying in constant contact with other 400 Mawozo leaders, most of them relatives. They say he controlled the gang's finances, supplied its weapons and directed its operations.",
      "\"This horrific crime was driven by defendant Germine's own self-interest; he wanted to secure his release from prison in exchange for the hostages,\" prosecutors wrote.",
      "Germine denies that he was a leader of the gang, according to his attorneys. They said he became involved in politics after allowing farmers to grow crops on his land.",
      "\"Mr. Germine genuinely tried to help his countrymen, especially those that did not have much. The Haitian government did not provide services and resources to the poor like we have in this country, and Mr. Germine tried to fill the gap,\" his lawyers wrote.",
      "The Christian missionaries were returning from a visit to an orphanage when kidnappers forced their bus to stop. One of the kidnapped children was 8 months old.",
      "The gang took credit for the kidnappings on social media and initially demanded a ransom of $17 million, or $1 million for each victim. But the hostage-takers later contacted a representative of the missionaries and asked for Germine's release from prison.",
      "Germine, also known as \"Yonyon,\" was the first person to be charged in connection with the kidnapping. He remained in prison but was transferred to the U.S. to face charges in a May 2022 indictment. After a trial earlier this year, a jury convicted him of charges including conspiracy to commit hostage taking.",
      "Germine was separately convicted of participating in a plot to smuggle semiautomatic firearms from the U.S. to Haiti for gang members' use. For that case, Bates sentenced him last year to 35 years in prison.",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 17:11:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The U.S. has increased its reward to $5 million for information leading to the arrest of an alleged leader of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.",
    "story": [
      "The United States government on Wednesday increased its reward for information leading to the arrest of Giovanni Vicente Mosquera Serrano, an alleged leader of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Through an organized crime rewards program operated by the Department of State, officials are now offering up to $5 million for tips that could bring Serrano into custody and potentially convict him on myriad drug charges.",
      "Mosquera Serrano was the first alleged member of Tren de Aragua to be added to the FBI's \"most wanted\" list, according to the State Department. He was initially indicted in Texas district court in January and charged with international cocaine trafficking conspiracy, then recharged in a second indictment in April that additionally accused him of supporting a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "President Trump labeled Tren de Aragua\u00a0a foreign terrorist organization, alongside other gangs and cartels, when he retook office in January. His administration has since ratcheted up pressure on Venezuela and its president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. In recent months, the U.S. has amassed a large military presence in the Caribbean and carried out multiple\u00a0strikes on boats it claims are carrying drugs from Venezuela.",
      "Some lawmakers have questioned whether the strikes are legal, and the first in that string of attacks, a deadly strike in early September, has prompted new concerns from Congress\u00a0that a follow-on strike despite there apparently being survivors in the water may constitute a war crime.",
      "Tren de Aragua's members are accused of a lengthy record of violent crimes, including murder, human trafficking, rape, kidnapping, bribery and racketeering. Originally formed inside Venezuela's Tocor\u00f3n prison, Tren de Aragua expanded during the incarceration of Hector Rusthenford Guerrero Flores, the alleged head of the gang known as Ni\u00f1o Guerrero. U.S. authorities have said Guerrero came to control the prison in addition to a series of gold mines and border crossings between Venezuela and Colombia, before eventually escaping custody.",
      "Mosquera Serrano is among the alleged members of Tren de Aragua who have been sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which sanctioned 11 more alleged affiliates of the gang on Wednesday, according to the State Department.",
      "One of the latest rounds of sanctions also targeted Jimena Romina Araya Navarro, a Venezuelan entertainer known as \"Rosita,\" the U.S. Treasury announced, claiming she is a Tren de Aragua affiliate. Rosita is allegedly part of a group of five people in the entertainment industry who are accused of providing \"material support\" to the gang, according to the Treasury. She has also been accused of helping Guerrero escape from prison in 2012, while the group of five allegedly helped launder money for some of the gang's leaders, the department said.",
      "\"Under President Trump, barbaric terrorist cartels can no longer operate with impunity across our borders,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a news release. \"At the direction of President Trump, we will continue to use every tool to cut off these terrorists from the U.S. and global financial system and keep American citizens safe.\"",

    "story": [
      "A Ukrainian lawmaker told CBS News on Wednesday that President Trump should not approach peacemaking efforts with Russia like a business deal, saying the American leader must \"understand he cannot trade with Putin\" as the \"aggressor\" in the war, which is nearing its four-year mark.",
      "Lisa Yasko, a member of Ukraine's parliament from the same party as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, spoke with CBS News after high-level talks in Moscow between Putin and U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff failed to yield any breakthroughs.",
      "Yasko said that was largely due to Putin's lukewarm interest in achieving peace.",
      "\"[Putin] was smiling so much at this meeting with Witkoff, but absolutely this is not about the peace itself,\" she said. \"He's interested in showing that he's geopolitically active ... how cool you are, how Americans are treating you and that you are not a war criminal.\"",
      "\"President Trump can be very transactional, in a good way also,\" Yasko told CBS News. \"But you cannot make peace with only economic deals. You cannot go that far as pleasing an aggressor. I believe there are certain lines.\"",
      "The Tuesday meeting in the Russian capital, which also included Mr. Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, was part of a concerted push by the White House to broker an agreement based on a Trump administration proposal.",
      "That proposal was initially floated by the White House weeks ago as a 28-point plan, but Ukraine and its European partners balked at calls for Kyiv to cede occupied territory to Russia, and the draft was later amended during talks with Ukrainian and European officials.",
      "After the five-hour round of talks on Tuesday, Yuri Ushakov, a senior adviser to Putin, told reporters the conversation was \"rather useful, constructive, rather substantive,\" but that \"we are no closer to resolving the crisis in Ukraine, and there is much work to be done.\"",
      "When asked by CBS News if she believed Putin was just playing for time by continuing to meet, Yasko said the Russian strongman's true intention was clear: to change the global order and assert Russia as a key powerbroker.",
      "\"Putin is trying to have his new world order by playing a central part in the [global] economy with China and the U.S. and with other parts of the world,\" Yasko said. \"Now Trump is offering a deal with benefits for [the] Russian economy. It's insanity for all of us here in Ukraine.\"",
      "Putin, speaking before the talks in Moscow on Tuesday, accused America's European allies of standing in the way of Mr. Trump's efforts to broker a peace deal, saying he wasn't looking for a conflict with Europe, but adding that Russia was \"ready for war.\"",
      "Yasko urged Mr. Trump to come and see for himself the impact of Russia's ongoing full-scale invasion on Ukraine and its people \u2014 a trip Zelenskyy has also repeatedly urged his American counterpart to make.",
      "\"He should come here first,\" she told CBS News. \"He should see what happened in Ukraine. He should see the faces, the eyes of people.\"",
      "Yasko called the peace deal initially put forward by the Trump administration \"insulting\" to Ukraine.",
      "Many European leaders have voiced concern that if Russia is given what it wants in exchange for a ceasefire in Ukraine, it would set a dangerous precedent of appeasing a unilateral landgrab, and it could encourage Russia to increase threats against their countries.",
      "Already, America's Western European NATO allies have accused Russia of breaching their airspace with drone flights around airports and military bases, as well as fighter jets. There have also been allegations of a widespread Russian sabotage campaign targeting key infrastructure in Europe.",
      "European leaders, meanwhile, appear to have been largely sidelined as the White House negotiates directly with Russia and Ukraine.",

      "The family of 42-year-old Alejandro Carranza Medina, who was killed on Sept. 15, rejected assertions there were any drugs on the vessel targeted in Washington's anti-narcotics military campaign, and insisted he was a fisherman just doing his job on the open sea.",
      "\"We know that Pete Hegseth, US Secretary of Defense, was responsible for ordering the bombing of boats like those of Alejandro Carranza Medina and the murder of all those on such boats,\" reads the complaint seen by AFP on Wednesday.",
      "U.S. strikes in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific have killed more than 80 people on boats that Washington claims, without providing evidence, were ferrying drugs from Venezuela. Legal experts and lawmakers critical of the strikes have argued that the military action targeting the suspected drug smuggling boats are legally dubious.",
      "Family members and victims' governments insist some of those killed were fishermen, and rights groups say the strikes are illegal even if the targets were in fact drug traffickers.",
      "The IACHR complaint said Hegseth gave the orders \"despite the fact that he did not know the identity of those being targeted for these bombings and extra-judicial killings\" it said were \"ratified\" by President Trump.",
      "The IACHR is a quasi-judicial body of the Organization of American States, created to protect human rights in the region.",
      "In a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Hegseth said the U.S. has \"only just begun striking narco-boats and putting narco-terrorists at the bottom of the ocean.\" He noted a recent pause in strikes, explaining that \"it's hard to find boats to strike right now.\"",

      "He left behind four children.",
      "\"He had no ties to drug trafficking, and his daily activity was fishing,\" Hernandez said.",
      "\"Why did they just take his life like that?\" she asked during the interview. \"The fishermen have the right to live. Why didn't they just detain them?\"",

    "summary": "Details about the strikes on an alleged drug boat on Sept. 2 have alarmed legal experts and lawmakers.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Scrutiny over the Trump administration's strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats has intensified following the revelation that the first U.S. attack on such a vessel involved at least two strikes, according to a Washington Post report. It said that after a first strike left two survivors, a subsequent strike killed them. A U.S. official confirms a total of four missiles were used.",
      "The Post also reported that Hegseth gave a verbal order to \"kill everybody\" in the Sept. 2 strike in the Caribbean Sea, though Hegseth has not confirmed this. He told reporters Tuesday that he did not see survivors in the live video he viewed and was not in the room when Navy Adm. Frank \"Mitch\" Bradley, the commander overseeing the operation, ordered a second strike. Bradley, according to the report, was complying with Hegseth's directive as two survivors clung to the wreckage.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Monday first confirmed a second strike on the boat was directed by Bradley, who, she said, \"worked well within his authority and the law \u2026 to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat of narco-terrorists to the United States was completely eliminated.\" Hegseth authorized Bradley to conduct the strikes, Leavitt said, though she denied that the defense secretary had given the order to kill them all.",
      "President Trump said Sunday he \"wouldn't have wanted\" the second strike and added that Hegseth had told him \"he did not order the death of those two men.\" Mr. Trump made similar comments on Tuesday, telling reporters that he did not have all the information about the second strike.",
      "Since the first strike on Sept. 2, the U.S. has carried out another 20 attacks through Nov. 15, killing more than 80 people the Trump administration alleges have been trafficking drugs in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean.",
      "Analysis from The Free Press: Killing Narco Speedboat Survivors is a War Crime",
      "Members of Congress \u2014 mostly Democrats \u2014 were already raising questions about the legality of the strikes and warned that a continued campaign against alleged drug smugglers in the region could escalate into war with Venezuela. The Post's report has further fueled debate about whether the U.S. is committing war crimes.",
      "In a notification to Congress in mid-September, the Trump administration said the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels it has designated as terrorist organizations. The drugs smuggled by these cartels kill tens of thousands of Americans each year and constitute an \"armed attack\" against U.S. citizens, according to the White House.",
      "\"We have legal authority. We're allowed to do that,\" Mr. Trump told reporters on Oct. 22. \"They killed 300,000 people last year. Drugs, these drugs coming in. They killed 300,000 Americans last year, and that gives you legal authority.\"",
      "But the opinion from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel justifying the strikes remains classified. A group of Senate Democrats asked for an \"expeditious declassification\" of the legal opinion in a letter last week to Hegseth and Attorney General Pam Bondi.",
      "\"Few decisions are more consequential for a democracy than the use of lethal force,\" they wrote. \"We therefore believe that the declassification and public release of this important document would enhance transparency in the use of deadly force by our nation's military and is necessary to ensure Congress and the American people are fully informed of the legal justification supporting these strikes.\"",
      "Consent from Congress",
      "Legal experts and lawmakers critical of the strikes have argued that the military action targeting the suspected drug smuggling boats was already legally dubious before the recent revelations because the president lacked the authority to carry them out.",
      "Under the War Powers Resolution of 1973, the president is required to consult Congress \"in every possible instance\" before introducing armed forces into hostilities, unless there has been a declaration of war or other congressional authorization.",
      "In emergency situations, the administration must report to Congress within 48 hours and cease hostilities within 60 days, absent congressional authorization. The 60-day deadline expired a month ago.",
      "The law was enacted in response to the Vietnam War as a check on the president's power to wage war without the consent of Congress.",
      "When asked in early November whether the administration planned to seek congressional authorization, a senior administration official replied that the 1973 resolution \"has been understood to apply to placing U.S. servicemembers in harm's way.\"",
      "The official suggested that the attacks pose no threat to service members, since the strikes have been largely carried out by drones launched from naval vessels \"at distances too far away for the crews of the targeted vessels to endanger American personnel.\" The official added that the administration does not consider the strikes against the alleged drug traffickers as \"hostilities.\"",
      "Congress has not authorized the use of military force against Venezuela. Republicans have largely asserted that the president is acting under his Article II constitutional authority, and Senate Republicans have twice blocked bipartisan efforts aimed at preventing Mr. Trump from continuing military action in the region without congressional approval.",
      "But the new details about the Sept. 2 strike appear to have shifted some opinions. The Republican-led Senate and House Armed Services committees have opened bipartisan investigations into the circumstances of the first attack.",
      "\"Nothing magic about calling something a terrorist organization,\" says former military prosecutor",
      "The Trump administration's claim of a \"non-international armed conflict\" is also flawed, experts say, because drug cartels are not considered organized armed groups under the law of armed conflict.",
      "\"There is no international armed conflict because, inter alia, there are neither hostilities between States nor the requisite degree of State control over alleged drug cartels operating the boats. And there is no non-international armed conflict, both because the cartels concerned do not qualify as organized armed groups in the [law of armed conflict] sense, and because there were no hostilities between the United States and the cartels on Sept. 2, let alone hostilities that would reach the requisite level of intensity to cross the armed conflict threshold,\" legal experts Michael Schmitt, Ryan Goodman and Tess Bridgeman wrote in a Dec. 1 piece published by Just Security.",
      "Designating drug cartels as terrorist organizations also does not give the administration authority to use military force in the way that it has, said Brian Finucane, a senior adviser with the International Crisis Group and a former State Department lawyer.",
      "\"They don't have military hierarchies, don't have the capability to engage in combat operations, and so it's absurd to claim that the U.S. is somehow in an armed conflict with them,\" Finucane said.",
      "Victor Hansen, a former military prosecutor and law professor at New England Law Boston, said drug cartels would still be subject to civilian law even with the terrorist group designation.",
      "\"There's nothing magic about calling something a terrorist organization that then gives the president the authority to respond militarily,\" Hansen said.",
      "Trump \"wants it both ways,\" expert says",
      "The Trump administration's characterization of the strikes as an \"armed conflict\" imposes additional duties and responsibilities on how the strikes are carried out, according to Hansen.",
      "If the strikes have not already crossed a legal line, it's possible the alleged intentional killing of defenseless survivors may have.",
      "The Geneva Conventions, which are the core of the law of armed conflict, prohibit targeting civilians or members of the armed forces who are defenseless. The international treaties, which were adopted in 1949, also require the wounded to be \"collected and cared for.\"",
      "The Defense Department's Law of War Manual says, \"it is also prohibited to conduct hostilities on the basis that there shall be no survivors, or to threaten the adversary with the denial of quarter.\" The rule applies \"during non-international armed conflict.\"",
      "\"The president, he wants it both ways. He wants to call it an armed conflict, but then he doesn't even want to follow the rules of the armed conflict,\" Hansen said.",
      "Still, a change in protocol was implemented after the Sept. 2 strike to emphasize rescuing any survivors, the Post reported.",
      "Two men who survived a strike in the Caribbean on Oct. 16 were rescued by the U.S. Navy and repatriated to their countries of origin \u2014 Ecuador and Colombia. The strikes on Oct. 27 in the Pacific left one survivor, and Mexico led the search effort, but it suspended its search after four days, according to media reports.",
      "The second strike and what laws may have been broken",
      "There's growing debate about whether the follow-up strike that allegedly killed two survivors is a war crime.",
      "Congressional Democrats have said that if the reporting is accurate, the action does constitute a war crime. Republican Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, told \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that it would be \"an illegal act\" that is \"completely outside of anything that has been discussed with Congress.\"",
      "\"I think there's a broad consensus that it's illegal to kill people who are clinging to wreckage,\" GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky told reporters Tuesday.",
      "Lawmakers and military experts say that the next question is what laws may have been broken, and that largely depends on the laws governing the strikes.",
      "\"If we're not in an armed conflict to begin with, then the whole paradigm, the legal paradigm of the laws that govern an armed conflict, don't apply,\" Hansen said. \"So what does apply? Well, domestic law. Then, it's murder under domestic law because you can't kill somebody \u2014 even if you think they're a criminal \u2014 without adjudication.\"",
      "\"Arguably, no order to kill them is legal,\" Hansen added. \"Because under domestic law, we don't kill people without bringing them to trial and giving them due process.\"",
      "Finucane also believes the strikes would fall under domestic military law.",
      "\"Murder on the high seas is implicated, conspiracy to commit murder outside of the United States, then murder is also an offense under the Uniform Code of Military Justice,\" he said.",
      "If the operation is an armed conflict, as the Trump administration suggests, the actions could constitute a war crime.",
      "\"Orders to 'kill everybody,' which can reasonably be regarded as an order to give 'no quarter,' and to 'double-tap' a target in order to kill survivors, are clearly illegal under international law,\" a group of former military lawyers outlined in an assessment Saturday. \"In short, they are war crimes.\"",
      "Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta called the second strike a war crime in a CBS News interview\u00a0on Monday.",
      "\"The basic rules of war that are involved here make very clear that you do not strike wounded people in the water in order to kill them. You basically then are responsible to try to make sure you do everything to try to protect their lives at that point. And that is the concern right now, whether or not this really violated the rules of war and constituted a criminal act.\"",
      "In a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Hegseth said the U.S. has \"only just begun striking narco-boats and putting narco-terrorists at the bottom of the ocean.\" He noted a recent pause in strikes, explaining that \"it's hard to find boats to strike right now.\"",
      "\"Deterrence has to matter,\" he said. \"Not arrest and hand over and then do it again, the rinse-and-repeat approach of previous administrations.\"",

      "Police said they have completed a search for bodies inside all seven of eight high-rise residential towers ravaged in the fire that first broke out last Wednesday and took until Friday to be extinguished. About 30 people were still reported missing.",

      "The deadly blaze broke out at Wang Fuk Court, in the northern suburban district of Tai Po, which was undergoing a monthslong renovation project with buildings covered by bamboo scaffolding and green netting.",
      "Police and the city's anti-corruption body said Tuesday that they had arrested 15 people as authorities probe corruption and negligence in relation to the renovation work. Substandard plastic nylon netting covering scaffoldings erected outside the towers and foam boards installed on windows were found to have aided the fire's rapid spread, authorities said earlier this week.",

    "story": [
      "Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\u00a0\u2014 Malaysia's government said Wednesday that American marine robotics company Ocean Infinity would soon resume the seabed search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, more than a decade after the plane vanished over the Indian Ocean.",
      "MH370, a Boeing 777, disappeared from air-traffic radar 39 minutes after departing from Kuala Lumpur enroute to Beijing, China, on March 8, 2014. The packed passenger jet's disappearance without a trace sparked one of aviation's most baffling mysteries.",
      "Despite years of multinational searches, investigators still do not know exactly what happened to the plane or its 239 passengers and crew.",
      "The Malaysian government said Wednesday that Ocean Infinity would resume its search from Dec. 30, about eight months after the last effort was abandoned. Malaysia's transport minister announced in early April that a roughly six-week search by the U.S. firm was ending, saying it wasn't \"the season\" for the work at sea. The minister said at the time that efforts would resume around the end of the year.",
      "The government said Wednesday that Ocean Infinity would resume searching intermittently from Dec. 30 for a total of 55 days, in targeted areas believed to have the highest likelihood of finding the missing aircraft.",
      "Herculean search efforts in the southern Indian Ocean, where the jet is believed to have gone down, have thus far turned up virtually nothing. Apart from a few small fragments that washed ashore, no bodies or large wreckage have ever been recovered.",
      "Below is a look at what we know about the deadly aviation tragedy.",
      "\"Good night, Malaysian Three Seven Zero\"",
      "The pilot's last radio call to Kuala Lumpur \u2014 a simple, \"Good night, Malaysian Three Seven Zero\" \u2014 was the final communication before the plane crossed into Vietnamese airspace. It never checked in with controllers there.",
      "Minutes later, the plane's transponder, which broadcasts its location, shut down. Military radar showed the jet turn back over the Andaman Sea, and satellite data suggested it continued flying for hours, possibly until fuel exhaustion, before crashing into a remote section of the southern Indian Ocean.",
      "Theories about what happened range from hijacking to cabin depressurization or power failure. There was no distress call, ransom demand, evidence of technical failure or severe weather.",
      "Malaysian investigators in 2018 cleared the passengers and crew but did not rule out \"unlawful interference.\" Authorities have said someone deliberately severed communications and diverted the plane.",
      "Who was on MH370 when it vanished?",
      "MH370 carried 227 passengers, including five young children, and 12 crew members. Most passengers were Chinese, but there were also citizens from the United States, Indonesia, France, Russia and elsewhere.",
      "Among those aboard were two young Iranians traveling on stolen passports, a group of Chinese calligraphy artists, 20 employees of U.S. tech firm Freescale Semiconductor, a stunt double for actor Jet Li and several families with young children. Many families lost multiple members.",
      "Largest underwater search in history",
      "Search operations began in the South China Sea between Malaysia and Vietnam, then expanded to the Andaman Sea and the southern Indian Ocean.",
      "Australia, Malaysia and China coordinated the largest underwater search in history, covering roughly 46,000 square miles of seabed off western Australia. Aircraft, vessels equipped with sonar and robotic submarines scoured the ocean for signs of the plane.",
      "Signals thought to be from the plane's black box turned out to be from other sources, and no wreckage was found. The first confirmed debris was a flaperon discovered on R\u00e9union Island in July 2015, with additional fragments later found along the east coast of Africa. The search was suspended in January 2017.",
      "In 2018, U.S. marine robotics company Ocean Infinity resumed the hunt under a \"no find, no fee\" agreement, focusing on areas identified through debris drift studies, but it ended without success.",
      "Challenging search conditions in the Indian Ocean",
      "One reason such an extensive search may have failed to turn up clues is that no one knows exactly where to look. The Indian Ocean is the world's third largest, and the search was conducted in a difficult area, where searchers encountered bad weather and average depths of around 2.5 miles.",
      "It's not common for planes to disappear in the deep sea, but when they do remains can be very hard to locate. Over the past 50 years, dozens of planes have vanished, according to the Aviation Safety Network.",
      "Malaysia's government gave the green light in March for another \"no-find, no-fee\" contract with Ocean Infinity to resume the seabed search operation across a newly identified 5,800-square-mile site in the ocean. Ocean Infinity will be paid $70 million for its work, but only if wreckage is discovered.",
      "It is unclear if the company has new evidence of the plane's location. It has said it would utilize new technology and has worked with many experts to analyze data and narrow the search area to the most likely site.",

    "story": [
      "New Delhi \u2014\u00a0India's government revoked an order on Wednesday that had directed smartphone makers such as Apple and Samsung to install a state-developed and owned security app on all new devices. The move came after two days of criticism from opposition politicians and privacy organizations that the \"Sanchar Saathi\" app was an effort to snoop on citizens through their phones.",
      "\"Government has decided not to make the pre-installation mandatory for mobile manufacturers,\" India's Ministry of Communications said in a statement Wednesday afternoon.",
      "The initial order, issued privately to phone makers by the ministry late last month, was leaked to Indian media outlets on Monday. It directed all phone makers to preinstall the Sanchar Saathi (which means Communication Partner in Hindi) app on new phones within 90 days, and also on older phones through software updates.",
      "The order, reported from Monday by numerous Indian media outlets and later acknowledged by the government, had asked manufacturers to ensure that the functions of the app could not be \"disabled or restricted.\"",
      "There was an immediate backlash on Monday, with opposition political parties quickly labelling the government software a \"snooping app\" and drawing parallels to Pegasus, the hacking spyware developed, marketed and licensed to governments around the world by the Israeli company NSO Group.",
      "On Tuesday, India's national Minister of Communications Jyotiraditya Scindia insisted to journalists outside the parliament that the Sanchar Sathi app was non-compulsory and in line with democratic principles. He said smartphone owners could activate the app at their convenience to access its benefits, and they could also delete it from devices at any time.",
      "He did not, however, say anything on Tuesday to deny or change the order to phone makers to ensure the app was pre-installed.",
      "On Wednesday, Scindia insisted that \"neither is snooping possible, nor it will be done\" with the app.",
      "While the order for it to be installed universally was revoked, the government continued defending the app on Wednesday, saying the intent had been to \"provide access to cybersecurity to all citizens,\" and insisting that it was \"secure and purely meant to help citizens.\"",
      "Opposition politicians say \"it is a snooping app\"",
      "The government's U-turn came after sharp criticism from opposition political parties and digital rights advocates.",
      "\"It is a snooping app. It's ridiculous. Citizens have the right to privacy. Everyone must have the right to privacy to send messages to family, friends, without the government looking at everything,\" Priyanka Gandhi, leader of the opposition Congress party, told reporters outside India's parliament on Tuesday.",
      "\"They brought in Pegasus and have been unable to keep it under control. MPs and MLAs all say that their phones are being tapped. For the last 11 years, basic rights of the Indians have been taken away... This is the real violation of National Security,\" said Renuka Chowdhury, another Congress member.",
      "Digital privacy advocates also raised concerns about the government order, saying it would breach citizens' right to privacy in a country with more than 1.2 billion cell phone users.",
      "\"No government will ever be expected to acknowledge that a government app is a snooping tool, even in China and Russia, where such apps have been mandated,\" Indian technology analyst Prasanto K. Roy told CBS News on Wednesday. \"A government statement alone is not adequate to inspire confidence in this.\"",
      "Roy said the government should restrict the default permissions settings that enable the app to access data on smartphones to the absolute minimum, and explain why those permissions were deemed necessary. He added that the code for the app should be open-source and published online, to enable independent security professionals to scrutinise it.",
      "\"In plain terms, this converts every smartphone sold in India into a vessel for state-mandated software that the user cannot meaningfully refuse, control, or remove,\" the Internet for Freedom organization said in a statement Tuesday, before the government revoked its order. \"For this to work in practice, the app will almost certainly need system level or root level access \u2026 so that it cannot be disabled. That design choice erodes the protections that normally prevent one app from peering into the data of others, and turns Sanchar Saathi into a permanent, non-consensual point of access sitting inside the operating system of every Indian smartphone user.\"",
      "Technology analyst Roy told CBS News the real issue was \"not about faith in the government's benevolence,\" but rather \"concerns about potential access to a wide range of data by many junior or mid-level officials in government or law enforcement,\" as there was no clarity about what data could be accessed via the app, or who would have access to it.",
      "Major phone makers did not publicly react to the government order, but the Reuters news agency reported that Apple had planned to refuse to comply.",
      "Indian government says it's just trying to help",
      "The government argues that the app allows users to track, block and recover lost or stolen smartphones using the device's International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI), a unique code assigned to all handsets sold around the world.",
      "It also enables users to check how many unique mobile data connections are registered under their name, which it says will help people identify and disable fraudulent numbers and accounts opened by scammers.",
      "Other features include tools to report suspected fraudulent calls and to verify the authenticity of devices being used to make purchases, according to officials.",
      "The government said in its multiple statements that the app had already been downloaded 14 million times, and used to help trace 2.6 million lost or stolen phones. It said Sanchar Sathi had helped in the disconnection of over 4 million fraudulent connections, based on citizen reports.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. military's early September strike on an alleged Venezuelan drug boat \u2014 the first salvo in a months-long string of attacks \u2014 has drawn new scrutiny in recent days, as the White House confirmed that the vessel was struck twice.",
      "The confirmation followed a Washington Post report that the first boat was struck a second time, killing a pair of survivors \u2014 prompting calls for investigations and concerns in Congress that the follow-up strike may have constituted a war crime. A\u00a0Pentagon manual on the law of war says combatants that are \"wounded, sick, or shipwrecked\" no longer pose a threat and should not be attacked.",
      "The Trump administration has defended the series of boat strikes, casting them as a necessary tactic to stem the flow of narcotics from South America. But U.S. officials have not provided specific evidence that the vessels were smuggling drugs or posed a threat to the U.S. Some lawmakers from both parties have questioned the\u00a0 legality of the strikes.",
      "Here's what we know about the Sept. 2 strike and what the administration has said:",
      "Sept. 2: Trump says military \"shot out a boat\"",
      "President Trump announces to reporters during a Sept. 2 event that the U.S. had \"literally shot out a boat\" from Venezuela that he alleged was carrying drugs earlier in the day.",
      "In social media posts later that day, Mr. Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio described the attack in further detail, and referred to it as a single strike.",
      "The president said on Truth Social that the strike had killed 11 alleged members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang that his administration designated as a terrorist group earlier this year. Mr. Trump posted a 29-second video that showed one strike on a boat.",
      "Mr. Trump said the boat was headed to the U.S., but Rubio said later in the day that the drugs were \"probably headed to Trinidad or some other country in the Caribbean.\"",
      "The following day, Rubio stated that it was \"headed towards, eventually, the United States.\"",
      "Sept. 3: Hegseth says he \"watched it live\"",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth pushes back on a Venezuelan official's claim that the video of the Sept. 2 strike may have been fake, telling \"Fox and Friends\" the following morning: \"I watched it live. We knew exactly who was in that boat. We knew exactly what they were doing.\"",
      "Sept. 4: U.S. had \"absolute and complete authority\" to hit boat, Hegseth says",
      "Asked by CBS News what legal authority the Pentagon cited to strike the boat, Hegseth says: \"We have the absolute and complete authority to conduct that.\" He called the importation of drugs to the U.S. an \"assault on the American people.\"",
      "Separately, the White House told Congress on Sept. 4 that it believes the strike was \"consistent with [the president's] responsibility to protect Americans and United States interests abroad and in furtherance of United States national security and foreign policy interests,\" according to a notification later obtained by CBS News.",
      "Sept. 11: Boat was allegedly turning around",
      "The New York Times and CBS News report the boat appeared to be turning around when it was hit. A source familiar with the matter told CBS News that the individuals onboard the boat saw a military aircraft overhead and attempted to turn back before the U.S. hit the boat.",
      "White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement, \"The President acted in line with the laws of armed conflict to protect our country from those trying to bring poison to our shores.\"",
      "Sept. 15: Another boat is hit",
      "Mr. Trump announces another strike against an alleged drug-carrying boat in the Caribbean, killing three \"male terrorists.\"",
      "The administration later said the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels in a message to Congress justifying the Sept. 15 strike that was viewed by CBS News. It called the three individuals killed in the second strike \"unlawful combatants.\"",
      "In total, the U.S. has struck more than 20 boats between early September and mid-November, killing more than 80 people.",
      "Oct. 16: Key admiral announces retirement",
      "Hegseth announces that Adm. Alvin Holsey will retire as commander of U.S. Southern Command at year's end. Holsey was one year into his tenure overseeing the region where the boat strikes took place. Typically, combatant commanders serve for three years on average.",
      "Separately, CBS News reported that two people survived a strike on a boat in the Caribbean on Oct. 16. Mr. Trump later said the survivors would be returned to their countries of origin. The two, from Ecuador and Colombia, were repatriated within a few days of the strike.",
      "Nov. 28: Report says the first strike left survivors who were then killed in second attack",
      "The Washington Post reports that the Sept. 2 strike left two survivors, who clung to the boat's wreckage before dying in a follow-on attack. The Post reported that the second strike was conducted because Hegseth ordered everybody to be killed.",
      "Hegseth called the reporting \"fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory.\"",
      "\"The declared intent is to stop lethal drugs, destroy narco-boats, and kill the narco-terrorists who are poisoning the American people,\" Hegseth wrote on X. \"Every trafficker we kill is affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization.\"",
      "He also defended the strikes' legality once again.",
      "In response, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee said in a joint statement on Nov. 28 that they would conduct \"vigorous oversight to determine the facts related to these circumstances.\" Similarly, the leaders of the House Armed Services Committee released a statement promising to gather a full accounting of the operation.",
      "Nov. 30: Senator says it may rise \"to the level of a war crime\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia says on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that the reported follow-on strike \"rises to the level of a war crime if it's true,\" pointing to international and domestic laws on attacks against wounded combatants.",
      "Rep. Mike Turner, a Republican from Ohio who serves on the House Armed Services Committee, expresses similar concerns, saying, \"Obviously, if that occurred, that would be very serious, and I agree that \u2026 would be an illegal act.\"",
      "Nov. 30: Trump responds",
      "On Air Force One, the president tells reporters he \"wouldn't have wanted\" a second strike on the boat.",
      "He added that Hegseth said he didn't order a follow-on strike, and \"I believe him 100%.\"",
      "Dec. 1: Leavitt confirms a second strike",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirms that there was a follow-on strike, but denied that it was done at Hegseth's behest. She says Adm. Mitch Bradley, who led Joint Special Operations Command at the time of the operation, was authorized by Hegseth to conduct strikes.",
      "A reporter asked Leavitt: \"Does the administration deny that that second strike happened, or did it happen and the administration denies that Secretary Hegseth gave the order?\"",
      "She responded: \"The latter is true.\"",
      "Leavitt then read a prepared statement: \"President Trump and Secretary Hegseth have made it clear that presidentially designated narcoterrorist groups are subject to lethal targeting in accordance with the laws of war. With respect to the strikes in question on Sept. 2, Secretary Hegseth authorized Admiral Bradley to conduct these kinetic strikes. Admiral Bradley worked well within his authority and the law, directing the engagement to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States of America was eliminated.\"",
      "Leavitt later told CBS News senior White House correspondent Weijia Jiang that she \"would reject\" that Hegseth ever said that everyone in the boat on Sept. 2 should be killed.",
      "Dec. 1: Senate Armed Services chair says he expects to obtain all the audio and video from the strikes",
      "GOP Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, tells reporters that he has spoken with Hegseth and Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and he plans to talk with the admiral who led the operation. He said Hegseth \"did indicate\" that \"there was a second attack.\"",
      "But Wicker told reporters he did not have information on survivors who may have been killed. He said he expects to receive that information because \"we're going to have all of the audio and all of the video.\"",
      "Dec. 2: Hegseth says he didn't watch second strike and didn't see any survivors",
      "During a Cabinet meeting, Hegseth tells reporters he watched the first boat strike on Sept. 2 live, but had \"moved on to my next meeting\" before the boat was hit a second time.",
      "\"I watched that first strike live,\" Hegseth said. \"As you can imagine, at the Department of War, we've got a lot of things to do. So I didn't stick around for the hour, two hours, whatever, where all the sensitive site exploitation digitally occurs.\"",
      "He said he later learned that Bradley chose to \"sink the boat and eliminate the threat,\" which Hegseth said was the right decision.",
      "Hegseth also said he did not \"personally see survivors\" following the first strike \"because the thing was on fire,\" calling the situation the \"fog of war.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump said he \"didn't know about the second strike\" when asked about his comment over the weekend that he wouldn't have wanted a follow-on attack.",
      "\"To me, it was an attack. It wasn't one strike, two strikes, three strikes,\" the president said.",
      "Earlier in the meeting, Hegseth defended the administration's strategy of striking vessels, saying, \"We've only just begun striking narco-boats and putting narco-terrorists at the bottom of the ocean.\"",

      "A top aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin said there is still \"much work to be done\" after President Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff met with Putin in Moscow on Tuesday, amid a push by Mr. Trump to end the\u00a0war in Ukraine.",
      "The meeting lasted roughly five hours and came on the heels of talks between U.S. and Ukrainian officials in Florida over the weekend.",
      "Yuri Ushakov, a top Putin official, told reporters following Tuesday's meeting that the talks were \"constructive, very useful and substantive,\" but said a compromise to the lingering territorial issues in Ukraine wasn't found.",
      "\"The territorial issue, naturally, is the most important for us, and for the Americans too. A compromise option has not yet been found, but some American developments look more or less acceptable, but they need to be discussed,\" he said. \"Some formulations that were proposed to us are acceptable to us.\"",
      "\"We are no closer to resolving the crisis in Ukraine, and there is much work to be done,\" Ushakov said.",
      "Ushakov said that Moscow was given four more documents in addition to the\u00a0original 28-point plan\u00a0the Trump administration presented last month, but did not elaborate on what those documents contained.",
      "Ushakov said both Russia and the U.S. agreed not to disclose the specific details of the talks. No direct talks between Putin and Mr. Trump are currently planned, but Putin asked Witkoff and Kushner to relay \"important political signals\" to Mr. Trump, Ushakov said.",
      "Witkoff and Kushner are set to return to the U.S. to discuss the meeting with Mr. Trump, and will then get back in touch with Russian officials by phone, Ushakov said.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who took part in weekend talks with Ukrainian officials in Florida, previously said the conversations were \"another very productive session,\" but \"there are a lot of moving parts.\"",
      "Mr. Trump had told reporters after Sunday's talks, \"I think that there's a good chance we can make a deal.\"",
      "The original U.S.-backed\u00a0peace proposal\u00a0to end Russia's war on Ukraine that was unveiled last month has gone through changes after the initial plan was criticized by some as being too favorable to Russia, Mr. Trump told reporters over the weekend. One provision that drew heavy pushback from U.S. and European officials called for Ukraine to cede territory it currently controls in Donetsk to Russia.",
      "\"They're making concessions,\" Mr. Trump said of the Russians. \"They're big concessions. They stop fighting, and they don't take any more land.\"",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said at a Tuesday news conference that the plan had been whittled down to 20 points following talks in Geneva and Florida. He said later on the social media platform Telegram that Ukraine would \"wait for signals from the American delegation after its meetings in Russia.\"",
      "\"We will receive certain signals. If the signals work, if it is fair play with our partners, then perhaps we will meet with the American delegation very soon,\" he said, adding, \"I am ready to meet with President Trump. Everything depends on today's talks.\"",

    "story": [
      "A former Honduran president convicted of helping to smuggle 400 tons of cocaine into the United States has left prison after being pardoned by President Donald Trump. The U.S. Bureau of Prisons confirmed his release in a statement to the Associated Press.",
      "Juan Orlando Hernandez\u00a0was released from a federal prison in West Virginia on Monday and was \"once again a free man,\" his wife, Ana Garc\u00eda, announced on social media. Garc\u00eda thanked Mr. Trump for pardoning Hern\u00e1ndez via the social platform X early Tuesday.",
      "\"After almost four years of pain, of waiting and difficult challenges, my husband Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez RETURNED to being a free man, thanks to the presidential pardon granted by President Donald Trump,\" Garc\u00eda's post said. She included a picture of the U.S. Bureau of Prisons listing for Hern\u00e1ndez indicating his release.",
      "Mr. Trump's controversial pardon came as the U.S. president is simultaneously ordering the bombing of boats in the Caribbean allegedly carrying drugs. He is also heavily backing a candidate from Hernandez's party in Honduras's tense, ongoing presidential election vote count.",
      "Mr. Trump explained his decision\u00a0on social media\u00a0by posting that \"according to many people that I greatly respect,\" Hern\u00e1ndez was \"treated very harshly and unfairly.\"",
      "In March of last year, Hernandez was convicted in U.S. court\u00a0of conspiring to import cocaine\u00a0into the U.S. He had served two terms as the leader of the Central American nation of roughly 10 million people. Hern\u00e1ndez has been appealing his conviction and serving time at the U.S. Penitentiary, Hazelton in West Virginia.",
      "Shortly after Mr. Trump's announcement, Hernandez's wife and children gathered on the steps on their home in Tegucigalpa and kneeled in prayer, thanking God that Hernandez would return to their family after almost four years apart.",
      "It was the same home that Honduran authorities hauled him out of in 2022 just months after leaving office. He was extradited to the United States to stand trial.",
      "Trump's pardon drew criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.",
      "Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, of Louisiana, was critical of the pardon, saying Sunday on social media, \"Why would we pardon [Hernandez] and then go after Maduro for running drugs into the United States? Lock up every drug runner! Don't understand why he is being pardoned.\"",
      "\"This is shocking,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat of Virginia,\u00a0said of the pardon\u00a0on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "\"He was convicted in a federal court in the United States,\" said Kaine, the ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere. \"One of the bits of evidence was his statement that was picked up by those near to him that he wanted to 'shove drugs up the nose of gringos' and flood the United States with cocaine, more than 400 tons. He was the leader of one of the largest criminal enterprises that has ever been subject to a conviction in U.S. courts, and less than one year into his sentence, President Trump is pardoning him, suggesting that President Trump cares nothing about narcotrafficking. Suggesting possibly that pardons are now for sale by this White House.\"",
      "In remarks on the House floor Tuesday, Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, said, \"What message does pardoning this criminal send to parents who have lost children to narcotics, to law enforcement officers risking everything to stop the flow of deadly drugs?\"",
      "\"This disgraceful pardon should be met with bipartisan condemnation,\" she added.",
      "Mr. Trump defended the move to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, claiming, \"Many of the people of Honduras said it was a Biden setup. ... He was the president of the country, and they basically said he was a drug dealer because he was the president of the country. And they said it was a Biden administration setup, and I looked at the facts and I agreed with them.\"",
      "When asked what evidence he had seen to indicate Hernandez's case was a setup, Mr. Trump said, \"You take any country you want, if somebody sells drugs in that country, that doesn't mean you arrest the president and put him in jail for the rest of his life.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Monday claimed it was a \"clear Biden overprosecution,\" alleging that there was some \"egregious\" information that came out during Hernandez's trial.",

    "story": [
      "U.S.-operated flights returning deported migrants to Venezuela will continue despite\u00a0President Trump's assertion\u00a0that the airspace of the South American country should be considered closed.",
      "The government of\u00a0Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u00a0on Tuesday announced that the twice-weekly flights will go on following a request from the Trump administration. That reverses a Venezuelan government Saturday announcement indicating that U.S. immigration authorities had unilaterally suspended the flights.",
      "An overflight and landing application submitted Monday by U.S.-based Eastern Airlines requests permission for an arrival Wednesday. The agreement authorizes flights on a Boeing 777-200 from Phoenix, Arizona, to land at Maiquet\u00eda International Airport, the Venezuelan government said. The application was made public Tuesday by Venezuela's foreign affairs minister.",
      "Venezuelans have been steadily deported to their home country this year after Maduro, under pressure from the White House, did away with his long-standing policy of not accepting deportees from the U.S. Maduro has since framed their return as a triumph, saying Venezuelans are being repatriated from harsh conditions in U.S. detention.",
      "Immigrants arrive regularly at the airport outside the capital, Caracas, on flights operated by a U.S. government contractor or Venezuela's state-owned airline. More than 13,000 immigrants have returned so far this year on the chartered flights, the latest of which arrived Friday.",
      "The U.S.-Venezuela repatriation deal has faced scrutiny from human rights organizations, though Trump administration officials point to the diplomatic deal as an important tool in reducing the influence of transnational criminal gangs. The flights have continued despite U.S. military strikes against vessels suspected of smuggling drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean and off Venezuela's Caribbean coast.",
      "Trump administration officials say the combination of targeted strikes and deportation flights reflect a multi-pronged strategy to disrupt the Tren de Aragua gang and other organized criminal networks, which have been linked to drug trafficking and violent crime throughout the Americas.",
      "The Trump administration has also claimed some of the drug cartels are controlled by Maduro. Mr. Trump said Tuesday that the U.S. would start doing strikes on land soon, though he didn't specify where and said attacks might occur in countries besides Venezuela, suggesting Colombia could see military strikes.",
      "\"You know, the land is much easier, much easier. And we know the routes they take,\" Mr. Trump said to reporters as he met with his Cabinet at the White House. \"We know everything about them We know where they live. We know where the bad ones live. And we're going to start that very soon too.\"",
      "Later, when asked to elaborate, the president said he was speaking about countries that are manufacturing and selling fentanyl or cocaine. The president said he heard that Colombia is manufacturing cocaine and selling it to the U.S.",
      "Colombia, indeed, is the world's top cocaine producer.",
      "\"Anybody that's doing that and selling it into our country is subject to attack,\" Mr. Trump said. He added a few moments later: \"Not just Venezuela.\"",
      "Tuesday's Cabinet meeting came amid calls for investigations and\u00a0bipartisan concerns in Congress\u00a0that a\u00a0follow-up strike on an alleged drug boat\u00a0may have constituted a war crime.",
      "As tensions continue to escalate between the two countries,\u00a0Pope Leo XVI\u00a0on Tuesday called for the U.S. to pursue dialogue and even economic pressure on Venezuela to achieve its goals, rather than threats of military action.",
      "Leo, history's first American pope, told reporters aboard the papal plane\u00a0returning from Lebanon\u00a0that the Venezuelan bishops conference and the Vatican Embassy in Caracas were trying to calm the situation and look out for the plight of ordinary Venezuelans.",
      "\"The voices coming from the United States change, with a certain frequency at times,\" he said. \"On the one hand, it seems there was telephone conversation between the two presidents, on the other, there's this danger, this possibility of an activity, an operation including invading the territory of Venezuela.\"",
      "He stressed that he didn't have further information. \"Again I believe it's better to look for ways of dialogue, perhaps pressure \u2014 including economic pressure \u2014 \u00a0but looking for other ways to change, if that's what the United States wants to do.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is considering expanding its travel ban \u2014 which currently restricts or bars the entry of nationals from 19 countries \u2014 to around 30 nations in the wake of the shooting of two National Guard soldiers in Washington, D.C., last week, multiple U.S. officials told CBS News on Tuesday.",
      "The plans are preliminary and the number of countries added to the list could change, said the officials, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. CNN reported\u00a0on Tuesday morning that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was recommending expanding the travel ban to between 30 and 32 countries.",
      "After a meeting with President Trump on Monday, Noem said on X\u00a0that she had urged him to impose \"a full travel ban on every damn country that's been flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies.\"",
      "\"Our forefathers built this nation on blood, sweat, and the unyielding love of freedom\u2014not for foreign invaders to slaughter our heroes, suck dry our hard-earned tax dollars, or snatch the benefits owed to AMERICANS,\" Noem wrote in her X post.",
      "The Trump administration has cited the attack in Washington \u2014 which was allegedly carried out by an Afghan man who entered the U.S. in September 2021 and was granted asylum in April 2025 \u2014 to further expand its immigration crackdown. It has halted all visa and immigration processing for Afghan nationals, paused asylum case decisions for all nationalities and ordered a full-scale review of green card cases involving immigrants from the 19 countries currently subject to the travel ban.",
      "The plans being considered would significantly broaden the scope of a proclamation issued by Mr. Trump over the summer that partially or fully barred legal immigration and travel from 19 countries, most of them in Asia and Africa.",
      "That proclamation, referred to as a travel ban by supporters and critics alike, imposed a near-total restriction on the entry of people from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. It also partially suspended the entry of travelers and immigrants from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.",
      "At the time, Mr. Trump said the proclamation was needed to mitigate concerns about terrorist activity in some of the nations on the list, the inability to properly vet some of the affected nationals and the refusal by certain countries to cooperate on deportation flights from the U.S.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, the Department of Homeland Security said it would announce the new additions to the list of countries affected by the travel ban \"soon.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 02 Dec 2025 13:32:35 -0500",
    "summary": "Ant colonies act as one \"super-organism\" which works to ensure the survival of all, according to a team of scientists.",
    "story": [
      "Sick young ants release a smell to tell worker ants to destroy them to protect the colony from infection, scientists said Tuesday, adding that queens do not seem to commit this act of self-sacrifice.",
      "Many animals conceal illness for social reasons. For example, sick humans are known to risk infecting others so they can still go to the office \u2014 or the pub.",
      "Ant colonies, however, act as one \"super-organism\" which works to ensure the survival of all, similar to how infected cells in our bodies send out a \"find-me and eat-me\" signal, according to an Austria-led team of scientists.",
      "Ant nests are a \"perfect place for a disease outbreak to occur because there are thousands of ants crawling over each other,\" Erika Dawson, a behavioral ecologist at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria and lead author of a new study titled \"Altruistic disease signaling in ant colonies,\" told AFP.",
      "When adult worker ants get an illness that could spread through the colony, they leave the nest to die alone. Young ants, known as pupae, in contrast are still trapped inside a cocoon, making this kind of social distancing impossible.",
      "Scientists had already figured out that when these pupae are terminally ill, there is a chemical change that produces a particular smell. Adult worker ants then gather around, remove the cocoon, \"bite holes in the pupae and insert poison,\" Dawson said. The poison acts as a disinfectant, which kills both the colony-threatening pathogen and the pupae.",
      "For the new research, the scientists wanted to figure out whether the pupae \"were actively saying: 'hey, come and kill me,'\" Dawson said.",
      "\"Altruistic act\"",
      "First, the scientists extracted the smell from the sick pupae of a small black garden ant called Lasius neglectus. When they applied the smell to a healthy brood in the lab, the workers still destroyed them.",
      "Then, the team conducted an experiment showing that the sick pupae only produce the smell when worker ants are nearby, proving it is a deliberate signal for destruction.",
      "\"While it is a sacrifice \u2014 an altruistic act \u2014 it's also in their own interest, because it means that their genes are going to survive and be passed on to the next generation,\" Dawson said.",
      "However, there is one member of the nest that does not sacrifice itself. When queen pupae are infected inside their cocoons, they do not send out the smelly warning signal, the team found.",
      "\"Are they cheating the system?\" Dawson said the team asked themselves.",
      "However, they found that the \"queen pupae have much better immune systems than the worker pupae, and so they were able to fight off the infection \u2014 and that's why we think that they weren't signaling,\" she said.",
      "The study's authors note that sick queens face a conundrum.",
      "\"By alerting others to destroy them, queen pupae would risk losing potential future reproductive opportunities if they would survive infection,\" the authors write. \"On the other hand, by spreading their infection to their colony, they could incur high indirect fitness costs.\"",
      "Dawson hopes future research will investigate whether queen pupae sacrifice themselves when it becomes clear they will not beat their infection.",
      "The study was published in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "Scientists have previously studied\u00a0how ants communicate. A Stanford University study\u00a0published\u00a0in 2012 showed that harvester ants transmit information to determine how many ants to send to a particular food source. Researchers concluded that ants communicate in much the same way as data moves on the internet, dubbing it the \"anternet.\"",
      "Researchers have also previously concluded that other sick species practice social distancing \u2014\u00a0including guppies, bats and mandrills. Bees have been documented using tactics to prevent getting sick, including\u00a0kicking sick bees out of their hives\u00a0altogether.",

      "Speaking from a rehabilitation center in the western city of Lviv called \"Unbroken Hospital,\" he told CBS News about the long, painful process of recovering from the impact of an anti-tank mine explosion that robbed him of his sight in both eyes.",
      "\"I couldn't calm myself down and control my stream of thoughts,\" Martsenyuk said. \"Everything was buzzing, until I started working actively with my mental health.\"",
      "A year on, doctors have reconstructed his face and he's adapting to what he calls \"an entirely new life.\"",
      "Martsenyuk says his priority now is to carry on as a civilian and serve as an example to his children. He's also a living example of the human costs of Russia's ongoing invasion, and he believes many people outside Ukraine don't really understand his country's sacrifice, or the broader importance of its fight.",
      "President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and special envoy Steve Witkoff were due to meet Russia's Vladimir Putin on Tuesday in Moscow to discuss a U.S.-backed proposal to end the war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, meanwhile, is holding meetings with various European leaders in the hope of shoring up continued support for his country's defense.",
      "Details from the high-level discussions remain vague, but one key obstacle to a deal that has emerged is Ukraine's resistance to a Trump administration proposal for it to accept ceding some territory to Russia in exchange for peace.",
      "Mr. Trump argued over the weekend that his peace proposal did include Russia \"making concessions.\"",
      "\"They're big concessions,\" he told reporters. \"They stop fighting, and they don't take any more land.\"",
      "Zelenskyy and some of his European supporters have spoken out against this approach, arguing that granting Russia dominion over any currently occupied Ukrainian land would set a dangerous precedent, effectively rewarding Putin for a unilateral, unprovoked invasion.",
      "For Martsenyuk, who bears the scars of this long conflict, it's a difficult question.",
      "\"We have already given up territory \u2014   we have given part of ourselves. How much more can we give?\" he asks.",
      "European leaders, including Poland's, have recently alluded to the risks highlighted by Europe's 20th century history of appeasing the unilateral landgrabs of autocrats.",
      "\"Can't we analyze history? It all smells like something done before,\" Martsenyuk said.",
      "In late October, with President Trump pushing hard for Ukraine to make concessions to get a peace deal done \u2014   though without any clear requests for Russia to bend on its key demands \u2014   Polish Minister Donald Tusk warned: \"None of us should put pressure on Zelenskyy when it comes to territorial concessions.\"",
      "\"We should all put pressure on Russia to stop its aggression. Appeasement never was a road to a just and lasting peace,\" said the social media post by Tusk \u2014 whose nation was occupied by Nazi Germany during World War II.",

      "Ukrainian authorities have not released official numbers of soldiers killed in combat since the start of the invasion, but an investigation released in June by the Center for Strategic and International Studies estimates that between 60,000 and 100,000 of the country's troops have died.",

      "Armed men entered through a window to ambush Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada, the most elusive of the Sinaloa cartel's leaders, who was then loaded onto a plane, drugged and spirited across the border to the United States, according to details revealed Monday in the plea hearing of the drug trafficker who abducted him.",
      "Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez, the 39-year-old son of former Sinaloa cartel kingpin Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n, pleaded guilty to two counts of drug trafficking and continuing criminal enterprise in federal court in Chicago after admitting his role in overseeing the transport of tens of thousands of pounds of drugs to the U.S.",
      "As part of that plea agreement, U.S. prosecutors shared what had been one of the central questions in the hours and days immediately after Zambada fell into U.S. hands in July 2024.",
      "How did the wily drug capo who had stayed ahead of authorities for decades end up in the United States like a present tied with bow?",
      "The plea agreement did not name Zambada, but in the days after his arrest, one of his lawyers shared a letter from him that explained he had been called to a meeting with Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez and there he had been abducted.",
      "Andrew Erskine, an attorney representing the U.S. government, said Monday the alleged kidnapping of an unnamed individual was part of an attempt to show cooperation with Washington, which he said did not sanction those actions. He also said Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez would not receive cooperation credit because of that.",
      "The arrest of both drug traffickers by U.S. authorities angered Mexico's then-President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who suspected the U.S. government was behind the operation. Washington denied involvement from the outset, but experts thought it would be virtually impossible to pull off without U.S. authorities having some knowledge.",
      "Erskine described the alleged kidnapping in court, saying Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez had the glass from a floor-to-ceiling window removed from a room ahead of the meeting with the unnamed person.",
      "Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez allegedly had others enter through the open window, seize the individual, put a bag over his head and take him to a plane. On board, he was zip tied and given sedatives before the plane landed at a New Mexico airport near the border with Texas.",
      "Zambada in his letter said Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez had called him to a meeting on the outskirts of Sinaloa state's capital, Culiacan, along with some local politicians, one of whom was later found dead.",
      "He said when he arrived there were a lot of armed men in green military uniforms, who he assumed were gunmen for the \"Chapitos,\" as \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n's sons were known. According to a 2023 U.S. indictment, the Chapitos and their cartel associates used corkscrews, electrocution and hot chiles to\u00a0torture their rivals\u00a0while some of their victims were \"fed dead or alive to tigers.\"",
      "Even though they ran a rival faction within the cartel, Zambada maintained communication with them and appeared to trust Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez enough to follow him into a dark room.",

    "summary": "Trump claims efforts in Honduras to \"change the results\" of an election in which he's backed the party of an ex-president convicted of trafficking cocaine to the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Tegucigalpa, Honduras \u2014\u00a0A businessman who has President Trump's backing for the presidency of Honduras was locked in a \"technical tie\" with a rightwing TV host after a preliminary vote count, the Central American country's electoral body said Monday.",
      "Nasry Asfura, 67, led 72-year-old rival Salvador Nasralla by just 515 votes, making it a \"technical tie,\" National Electoral Council (CNE) head Ana Paola Hall said on X after a partial digital tally of Sunday's down-to-the-wire ballot.",
      "She called for \"patience\" as the CNE starts a manual count in a vote that left the ruling left-leaning party out in the cold in one of Latin America's most impoverished and violent countries.",
      "Trump backs candidate, claims effort to \"change the results\"",
      "Days before the vote, former Tegucigalpa mayor Asfura won Mr. Trump's backing \u2014 as the U.S. president sought to put his finger on the scale of another Latin American election.",
      "In a Monday post on his own Truth Social platform, Mr. Trump accused the Honduran electoral body of \"trying to change the results\" of the vote, adding: \"If they do, there will be hell to pay!\"",
      "He claimed that the CNE had \"abruptly stopped counting\" ballots on the night of the election when the initial count \"showed a close race between\" Asfura and Nasralla, noting the slight lead that tally showed for Asfura.",
      "\"It is imperative that the Commission finish counting the Votes. Hundreds of thousands of Hondurans must have their Votes counted,\" he said in the post, which he published before the CNE chief urged patience for a manual count.",
      "The U.S. president has become increasingly vocal about his support for allies in Latin America, threatening to cut aid to Argentina and Honduras if his picks do not win.",
      "Ally Javier Milei came out on top in Argentina's mid-term elections, but it is not yet clear if Mr. Trump's endorsement will be enough to secure victory for Asfura, whose campaign slogan was: \"Grandad, at your service!\"",
      "Could Trump help swing Honduras back to the right?",
      "The election is a clear defeat for ruling leftists trailing far behind in the vote count. A swing to the right could help build U.S. influence in a country that under leftist government had looked increasingly to China.",
      "The election campaign was dominated by Mr. Trump's threat and the surprise announcement that he would pardon former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernandez of Asfura's National Party.",
      "Hernandez, who has always maintained his innocence, is serving a 45-year prison sentence in the United States, where he was convicted of belonging to one of \"the largest and most violent drug trafficking conspiracies in the world.\"",
      "During his trial, U.S. federal prosecutors said\u00a0Hernandez turned his Central American country into a \"narco-state\" during his 2014-2022 presidency.",
      "Some Hondurans have welcomed Mr. Trump's intervention, saying they hope it means migrants will be allowed to remain in the U.S.",
      "Many Hondurans have fled north to escape grinding poverty and violence, including minors fearing forced recruitment by gangs.",
      "This escape route has been made more difficult by Mr. Trump's immigration crackdown, and nearly 30,000 Honduran migrants have been deported from the U.S. since his second term started in January.",
      "The clampdown has dealt a severe blow to the country of 11 million people, where money sent home from abroad accounted for 27% of GDP last year.",
      "Others reject what they see as meddling by Mr. Trump.",
      "\"I vote for whomever I please, not because of what Trump has said, because the truth is I live off my work, not off politicians,\" Esmeralda Rodriguez, a 56-year-old fruit seller, told AFP.",
      "Michelle Pineda, a 38-year-old merchant, hoped the winner would see the country \"as more than just a bag of money to loot.\"",
      "Preemptive accusations of election fraud from the ruling party and the opposition have sparked fears of unrest.",
      "The vote count has progressed slowly, and final results could take days.",
      "Lawmakers and hundreds of mayors were also elected in the fiercely polarized nation, which has swung back and forth between nominally leftist and conservative leaders.",
      "Long a transit point for cocaine exported from Colombia to the U.S., Honduras is now also a drug producer.",
      "But the candidates barely addressed drug trafficking, poverty or violence on the campaign trail.",
      "\"I hope the new government will have good lines of communication with Trump, and that he will also support us,\" said Maria Velasquez, 58. \"I just want to escape poverty.\"",

      "\"I was so nervous. I immediately got my clothes, phone and went downstairs,\" he said.",
      "He never imagined that the blaze at the Wang Fuk Court apartment complex in Hong Kong would spread so quickly. It tore through bamboo scaffolding, mesh netting covering it, and then foam window coverings that had adorned the sprawling complex's eight buildings for ongoing renovation work.",
      "\"I got outside and saw a big fire,\" he told CBS News on Monday, as the official death toll from the blaze climbed to over 150. \"Fire was spreading everywhere, and I could hear the bamboo exploding. The fire spread to the other block. The mesh caught alight.\"",
      "That other block was his own building, where he knew his wife was still upstairs. He watched as the blaze spread up the sides, quickly blocking the main lobby.",
      "\"I called my wife immediately and said there's a big fire and we have to go now,\" the 67-year-old recalled through tears. \"I told my wife, don't come down.\"",
      "He had hoped that firefighters would be able to get the blaze under control before it was too late.",
      "On the other end of the phone, his distraught wife, Bai Shui Lin, told him she couldn't move through the thick smoke.",
      "\"Then there was so much noise,\" he said. \"I can't hear her anymore \u2026 only noise. And then I can't contact her anymore. That's the last call I had with her.\"",
      "\"I kept waiting, hoping the fire would be put out. I thought maybe only the outside would be affected. But the fire just kept getting bigger,\" he said.",
      "As the blaze spread to seven of the buildings on the complex, Yip watched from behind a police cordon for any sign of his wife being carried out, but he never saw her.",
      "He said he pored over lists of photos and names of victims for days as the death toll mounted, giving her description to nearby hospitals in the hope that she had been rescued.",
      "\"I couldn't find my wife,\" he said through tears. \"I tried everything.\"",
      "Five days later, police confirmed his worst fears in a phone call on Monday. Bai, his wife of 40 years, never made it out of their building.",
      "The couple's two sons had to confirm her identification, but her remains were burned so badly that authorities used an ID card found in her purse to verify it was her.",
      "Yip said she had gone door to door, warning neighbors of the fire that had spread to their building. He said she helped at least three other families make it out before it was too late.",
      "Both of their sons survived the catastrophic fire, but Yip said he was struggling with guilt over the loss of his wife.",
      "\"If I'd asked her to leave a minute earlier, I think she would have survived,\" he said. \"But we know her. She wouldn't have left without warning others.\"",

      "Even if you don't know the meaning of the Oxford University Press' word of the year for 2025, you've probably been a victim of it on social media.",
      "The publisher for the Oxford English Dictionary said on Monday it chose \"rage bait\" as its top word for the year, capturing the internet zeitgeist of 2025.",
      "The word of the year is selected by lexicographers at Oxford University Press who analyze new and emerging words, as well as changes in the way language is being used, to identify words of \"cultural significance.\"",
      "What is \"rage bait\"?",
      "The phrase refers to online content that is \"deliberately designed to elicit anger or outrage by being frustrating, provocative or offensive,\" to drive traffic to a particular social media account, Oxford said in a statement.",
      "\"The person producing it will bask in the millions, quite often, of comments and shares and even likes sometimes,'' lexicographer Susie Dent told CBS News partner BBC. This is a result of the algorithms used by social media companies, \"because although we love fluffy cats, we'll appreciate that we tend to engage more with negative content and content that really provokes us.\"",
      "It is similar to clickbait, where a headline is used to lure a reader into viewing an article or a video, but rage bait content's specific focus is on making people angry.",
      "\"The fact that the word 'rage bait' exists and has seen such a dramatic surge in usage means we're increasingly aware of the manipulation tactics we can be drawn into online,\" Casper Grathwohl, president of Oxford Languages, told BBC News. \"Before, the internet was focused on grabbing our attention by sparking curiosity in exchange for clicks, but now we've seen a dramatic shift to it hijacking and influencing our emotions, and how we respond.\"",
      "2025 Word of the Year shortlist",
      "Rage bait topped two other contenders \u2013 \"aura farming\" and \"biohack\" \u2013 after public comment on a shortlist compiled by the publisher's lexicographers.",
      "\"Aura farming'' means to cultivate a public image by presenting oneself in \"a way intended subtly to convey an air of confidence, coolness or mystique.''",
      "\"Biohack'' is defined as \"an attempt to improve or optimize one's physical or mental performance, health or longevity.''",
      "Oxford's past winners",
      "Oxford University Press has selected a word of the year annually since 2004.",
      "Past winners include \"podcast\" in 2005, \"emoji\" in 2015, and in 2022, \"goblin mode,\" which described people who resisted returning to normal life after the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Last year's word, brain rot, captured the mental drain of mindless scrolling on Instagram or TikTok.",
      "Cambridge Dictionary declared \"parasocial\" as its 2025 word of the year, defined as \"involving or relating to a connection that someone feels between themselves and a famous person they do not know, a character in a book, film, TV series, etc., or an artificial intelligence.\"",

      "ALCOHOL-RELATED LIVER TRANSPLANTS ON THE RISE AMONG YOUNG ADULTS, DOCTOR SAYS",
      "Cannabis had mixed effects on alcohol cravings, the researchers reported.",
      "\"We found a significant decrease in alcohol urge immediately after smoking cannabis, but not a consistent effect on a different measure of alcohol craving,\" Metrik said. \"This suggests that cannabis may not exert a uniform effect on alcohol motivation, and that other mechanisms may also explain how cannabis impacts subsequent alcohol use.\"",

      "The study did have limitations, the researchers acknowledged.",
      "\"The study tested only one cannabinoid (THC) in smoked cannabis, which means the results may not generalize to the wide range of cannabis products, formulations and other cannabinoids,\" Metrik told Fox News Digital. \"The study sample also consisted of individuals who used cannabis nearly every day, so those who use cannabis less often may show different alcohol-related behaviors.\"",
      "THESE ARE THE TOP HEALTH RISKS OF MARIJUANA USE, ESPECIALLY SMOKING CANNABIS",
      "The researchers also did not look at the effects of using cannabis and alcohol at the same time.",

      "\"In our controlled bar lab study, after people smoked cannabis, they drank about a quarter less alcohol over the next two hours,\" the lead researcher said. (iStock)",
      "The study results do not justify recommending cannabis as a substitute for alcohol among people with alcohol-use disorder, the researchers stated, as the long-term health effects and addiction risks for cannabis remain uncertain.",
      "\"It is important to understand that cannabis\u2019 impact varies substantially across individuals,\" Metrik said, noting that while the substance may reduce drinking in the short term, it also presents its own risks.",
      "MORE SENIORS ARE USING CANNABIS THAN EVER BEFORE DESPITE HEALTH RISKS, RESEARCH SHOWS",
      "\"Our study is a first step, and we need more long-term research before drawing conclusions for public health,\" she said. \"We do not have clear evidence of long-term safety and efficacy of using cannabis as alcohol treatment. For now, I would not recommend using cannabis to cut down on alcohol use.\"",

      "\"In our controlled bar lab study, after people smoked cannabis, they drank about a quarter less alcohol over the next two hours.\"",
      "\"As many consumers report using THC beverages and other non-inhaled methods of administration as alternatives to alcohol, it would be important for future clinical trials to determine the effect of these formats on alcohol use behavior over time,\" the researcher, who was not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital.",

      "That's according to doctors such as Dr. Frank Dumont, an internal medicine physician and executive medical director of Virta Health, a Colorado-based group that tackles metabolic health through diet.",
      "In an on-camera interview with Fox News Digital, Dumont said Americans have experienced an increase in obesity, diabetes, autoimmune diseases and cancers in the last several decades, which \"probably has a lot to do with our lifestyle.\"",
      "WANT BETTER HEART HEALTH? START BY TACKLING YOUR WEAKEST LINK, CARDIAC SURGEON SAYS",
      "\"We know food is a big part of that\u2026 our diet has changed dramatically over the past few decades,\" he said.",
      "\"A lot of the foods we're eating are much more processed. They're much higher in simple carbohydrates and simple sugars than they ever were previously.\"",
      "\"The better you know your body, the better you can make decisions and make these types of swaps,\" said a physician. (iStock)",
      "These foods have been linked to an increase in insulin and inflammation, which leads to health complications, Dumont warned.",
      "To lower the risk of chronic disease, he encouraged people to make the following simple swaps.",
      "\"It depends on the individual situation,\" he said. \"The better you know your body, the better you can make decisions and make these types of swaps.\"",
      "1. Choose real fruit over fruit juice",
      "To help meet the goal of consuming more fiber and natural products, Dumont recommends eating real fruit instead of drinking fruit juice, which is highly processed.",
      "MEDITERRANEAN DIET PAIRED WITH OTHER LIFESTYLE CHANGES SLASHES DIABETES RISK",
      "\"Fruit juice can have some benefits \u2014 it has minerals, vitamins and micronutrients, but the bottom line is that it's more processed, and you've eliminated a lot of the fiber that is supposed to go hand in hand with the fruit sugar,\" he said.",
      "Eating whole fruits instead of drinking processed fruit juice is a healthier option, the doctor advised. (iStock)",
      "Dumont added that he does not believe in \"villainizing\" fruit, as it has been scrutinized for being high in sugar.",
      "\"There's a lot of good health in fruit,\" he said. \"It depends on that person's individual metabolism. If someone is so metabolically sick, so insulin resistant\u2026 even some very healthy fruits can be more than their body can handle.\"",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"But for most people, and especially earlier on when you're not as metabolically sick, the wonderful thing about fruit is that you're actually packaging all of that sugar up in the fiber.\"",
      "2. Opt out of breaded chicken",
      "Making this one small swap, even at a fast-food restaurant, can improve overall health, according to Dumont.",
      "Rather than selecting a menu item heavy in carbohydrates, like a breaded chicken sandwich, choosing a chicken salad instead makes for a more well-rounded meal.",
      "Choose grilled chicken in a salad instead of breaded chicken on a sandwich, a doctor recommended. (iStock)",
      "He also recommended choosing chicken that is grilled rather than fried and breaded.",
      "\"You put that on top of some lettuce with a good healthy dressing, and it can actually be extremely healthy eating out on the road at a fast-food restaurant,\" he said.",
      "Food as medicine",

      "\"I was seeing people get worse and worse, and that was really disheartening for me,\" he said. \"What I found later in my career is the power of nutrition and lifestyle. And it's something that, honestly, I have really been trained to be pessimistic about.\"",
      "In his training, Dumont said he was taught patients rarely sustain healthy lifestyle changes, and that moving to medicines and procedures should be \"quickly\" encouraged.",

      "\"Although cannabis can be used to treat nausea, those products are typically much lower dose THC, usually less than 5%,\" Puls said.",

      "Frankly, flipping seats in House special elections is arduous. The party out of power in the House or opposite of who occupies the White House often makes a race of it. That can signal a weakness in the party in power or even the president as you approach the next election. One of the best examples of this came in 2017. House Democrats came close to flipping four special elections in solid Republican seats ranging from Montana to Kansas to South Carolina to Georgia.",
      "But Democrats didn\u2019t capture any of those seats.",
      "However, Democrats did make a few of them closer than you might think.",
      "In fact, one of the best examples involved Rep. Ron Estes, R-Kan.",
      "President Donald Trump tapped former Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kan., to serve as CIA director and, later, secretary of state. Estes ran to succeed Pompeo. Pompeo won his district with 61% of the vote in 2016. Estes held off a challenge from Democrat James Thompson, vanquishing his opponent by six points and scoring 52% of the vote.",
      "Despite the defeat, Democrats and political observers noted the relative strength of Thompson in the special election. Many wondered if this was an omen about a 2018 Democratic wave.",

      "And despite the clamor surrounding special elections, there have truly only been four major \"flips\" in House special elections in the past 18 years. And one of those in a Hawaii special election was an anomaly where the Republican won in a three-way contest while two Democrats siphoned votes from one another.",
      "But back to Tennessee.",

Some are upset at the White House controlling the entire agenda and Johnson keeping the House at bay for weeks during the government shutdown. Another factor: President Trump\u2019s approach to the war in Ukraine.",
      "Moderate Republicans may look at the Tennessee result and insist on the party addressing healthcare in the coming weeks. That\u2019s a looming factor considering that Democrats withheld their votes to fund the government over healthcare this fall. It\u2019s also possible that moderate Republicans in California and New York might see the relative Democratic strength in this contest as a signpost that they face a tough re-election next year. As we said, Democrats flipped the House seven years ago after coming close in several special elections.",

The GOP trifurcated Nashville and the suburbs, diluting the Democratic vote among several GOP districts. That served as a safety valve to assure a GOP win Tuesday. It also explains the risks of the current wave of redistricting by both parties. Plus, it underscores how redrawing the lines can make some contests closer than they should be.",

      "Boasberg used a memo order Wednesday to outline the fairly complex case history for Cynthia Ballenger and her husband, Christopher Price, both of whom had been tried and convicted on misdemeanor charges in connection with events of Jan. 6, 2021, and ordered to pay hundreds of dollars in assessment fees and restitution.",

      "The new decision, he said, is the result of an appeals court decision, as well as the timing of Trump's pardon, which came at the same time as their case had been pending appeal before the D.C. Circuit.",
      "\"Having viewed the question afresh, the court now agrees with the defendants,\" Boasberg said.",
      "Both defendants, Ballenger and Price, had been in the process of appealing their convictions when Trump took office for a second time this year and issued a sweeping pardon for the roughly 1,500 Jan. 6 defendants.",
      "In July, Boasberg rejected their request to be refunded the $570 each in restitution payments and other fees paid as a part of their convictions.",

      "Judge James Boasberg, chief judge of the Federal District Court in D.C., stands for a portrait at E. Barrett Prettyman Federal Courthouse in Washington, D.C. (Washington Post via Getty)",
      "Boasberg, in the new memo order, cited the same precedent from July, which states that a pardon alone is not sufficient to entitle a former defendant to any property or compensation lost as a result of the conviction.",
      "\"By itself, defendants\u2019 pardon therefore cannot unlock the retroactive return of their payments that they ask for here,\" he noted Wednesday, reiterating that the court's ruling on this portion of the appeal remains unchanged.",
      "Rather, he said, the reversal hinged on the fact that both their cases had been pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit when Trump granted the pardon, \"thereby moot[ing] their appeals\" and causing their convictions to be vacated completely by the higher court.",

      "\"So even if defendants\u2019 pardon does not entitle them to refunds, the resulting vacatur of their convictions might,\" Boasberg wrote, adding that it is true regardless of the reason for the vacatur. \"In plain English, vacatur \u2014 unlike a pardon \u2014 \u2018wholly nullifie[s]\u2019 the vacated order and \u2018wipes the slate clean.'\"",
      "The memo order goes one step further, however, as Boasberg considers not only whether a court can theoretically order repayments in the cases of vacated convictions, but if doing so is legally sound under the appropriations clause and with respect to issues of sovereign immunity, which protects the government from being sued without its consent.",
      "TRUMP BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP FIGHT HEADS BACK TO SUPREME COURT AS NEW TERM BEGINS",
      "Boasberg concluded that the court has the power to order such repayment.",
      "\"Because the court could order defendants to pay assessments and restitution, it can order those payments reversed,\" he said. \"Those are two sides of the same action, and sovereign immunity does not stand in the way.\"",
      "The new memo order is likely to be seen as a win by some Trump allies, who have sought to cast Boasberg and other judges who have blocked or paused some of Trump's most sweeping actions as rogue or \"activist\" judges.",

      "When Xpeng unveiled its Next Gen Iron humanoid recently, the robot glided across the stage with movement so fluid that the crowd froze. Many viewers thought they saw an actor in a suit. Clips spread online within hours, and people everywhere claimed the same thing: it looked too human to be a machine.",
      "The reaction spread fast, so Xpeng's CEO He Xiaopeng returned to the stage one day later with a plan to settle the argument. He cut into Iron's leg to show its internal machinery. It felt theatrical but also necessary to end the rumor that a human controlled the robot from inside.",
      "The demonstration showed Iron was a real machine with complex systems beneath its flexible skin.",

      "Iron\u2019s debut stunned the crowd as the humanoid bot walked with movement so natural that many viewers thought there was a real person inside. (Xpeng)",
      "Inside the next-gen iron humanoid",
      "He shared how his robotics team stayed awake through the night, seeing viewers accuse them of staging a stunt. After the reveal, Iron walked again in front of the crowd without a human inside. The moment closed the debate and highlighted how far the company has come since its first model in 2024.",
      "The latest Iron uses a humanoid spine with bionic muscles and flexible skin. It moves with 82 degrees of freedom, and its human-sized hands include 22 degrees of freedom supported by a tiny harmonic joint engineered by the company. The robot runs on all solid-state batteries that keep the body light and strong.",
      "Iron also uses Xpeng's second-generation VLA model. Three Turing chips with 2,250 TOPS of power support tasks like conversations, walking and natural interactions. It responds in ways that feel closer to a person than a robot.",
      "Xpeng says future versions will offer different body shapes. That claim hints at customizable designs when these units reach consumers.",
      "SMART FABRIC MUSCLES COULD CHANGE HOW WE MOVE",
      "To silence the rumors, the team cut open Iron\u2019s leg onstage and revealed the machinery beneath its flexible skin. (Xpeng)",
      "A step toward a future of humanoid robots",
      "Xpeng's long-term vision goes far beyond a single showcase moment. The company plans to place the Next Gen Iron model in real-world environments. Early units will focus on commercial roles such as tour guides, shopping guides and customer service helpers. These placements allow the robots to interact with large crowds, gather feedback and refine their behavior in dynamic public spaces.",
      "This rollout forms part of what Xpeng describes as a gradual path toward mass production. The team aims to reach large-scale manufacturing by the end of 2026. That milestone could introduce hundreds or even thousands of humanoid units into select venues. Businesses may adopt them to manage foot traffic, assist guests or support basic retail tasks.",
      "While the company talks openly about commercial integration, the timeline for home use remains unclear. They have not shared when consumers will be able to buy a version suited for daily household tasks. Engineers still need to address safety, privacy and reliability standards before a humanoid can operate inside private homes.",
      "Even so, this moment signals a clear shift: robots that move and react in a lifelike way are no longer far-off ideas. They are stepping into public spaces where people will see them operate up close. This shift could reshape how we all view service work and personal assistance in the years ahead.",

      "The exposed frame shows Iron\u2019s bionic muscles, joints and wiring, giving a clear look at the advanced engineering that powers its lifelike movement. (Xpeng)",
      "What this means for you",
      "Humanoid robots are moving from concept to reality. You may soon see them in museums or stores. Their skills could speed up service and reduce wait times. These robots may also raise new questions about safety, privacy and comfort. Change happens fast, and this moment marks a major shift in how robots blend into daily life.",

    "story": [
      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss a new iPhone update that will filter out spam messages and tips to protect yourself from A.I. cyber attacks.",
      "Cybercriminals keep finding new angles to get your attention, and email remains one of their favorite tools. Over the years, you have probably seen everything from fake courier notices to AI-generated scams that feel surprisingly polished. Filters have improved, but attackers have learned to adapt. The latest technique takes aim at something you rarely think about: the subject line itself. Researchers have found a method that hides tiny, invisible characters inside the subject so automated systems fail to flag the message. It sounds subtle, but it is quickly becoming a serious problem.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide - free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "NEW SCAM SENDS FAKE MICROSOFT 365 LOGIN PAGES",
      "Cybercriminals are using invisible Unicode characters to disguise phishing email subject lines, allowing dangerous scams to slip past filters. (Photo by Donato Fasano/Getty Images)",
      "How the new trick works",
      "Researchers recently uncovered phishing campaigns that embed soft hyphens between every letter of an email subject. These are invisible Unicode characters that normally help with text formatting. They do not show up in your inbox, but they completely throw off keyword-based filters. Attackers use MIME encoded-word formatting to slip these characters into the subject. By encoding it in UTF-8 and Base64, they can weave these hidden characters through the entire phrase.",
      "One analyzed email decoded to \"Your Password is About to Expire\" with a soft hyphen tucked between every character. To you, it looks normal. To a security filter, it looks scrambled, with no clear keyword to match. The attackers then use the same trick in the body of the email, so both layers slide through detection. The link leads to a fake login page sitting on a compromised domain, designed to harvest your credentials.",
      "If you have ever tried spotting a phishing email, this one still follows the usual script. It builds urgency, claims something is about to expire and points you to a login page. The difference is in how neatly it dodges the filters you trust.",
      "Why this phishing technique is super dangerous",
      "Most phishing filters rely on pattern recognition. They look for suspicious words, common phrases and structure. They also scan for known malicious domains. By splitting every character with invisible symbols, attackers break up these patterns. The text becomes readable for you but unreadable for automated systems. This creates a quiet loophole where old phishing templates suddenly become effective again.",
      "The worrying part is how easy this method is to copy. The tools needed to encode these messages are widely available. Attackers can automate the process and churn out bulk campaigns with little extra effort. Since the characters are invisible in most email clients, even tech-savvy users do not notice anything odd at first glance.",
      "Security researchers point out that this method has appeared in email bodies for years, but using it in the subject line is less common. That makes it harder for existing filters to catch. Subject lines also play a key role in shaping your first impression. If the subject looks familiar and urgent, you are more likely to open the email, which gives the attacker a head start.",
      "How to spot a phishing email before you click",
      "Phishing emails often look legitimate, but the links inside them tell a different story. Scammers hide dangerous URLs behind familiar-looking text, hoping you will click without checking. One safe way to preview a link is by using a private email service that shows the real destination before your browser loads it.",
      "Our top-rated private email provider recommendation includes malicious link protection that reveals full URLs before opening them. This gives you a clear view of where a link leads before anything can harm your device. It also offers strong privacy features like no ads, no tracking, encrypted messages and unlimited disposable aliases.",

      "You do not need to become a security expert to stay safe. A few habits, paired with the right tools, can shut down most phishing attempts before they have a chance to work.",
      "A password manager helps you create strong, unique passwords for every account. Even if a phishing email fools you, the attacker cannot use your password elsewhere because each one is different. Most password managers also warn you when a site looks suspicious.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Turning on 2FA adds a second step to your login process. Even if someone steals your password, they still need the verification code on your phone. This stops most phishing attempts from going any further.",
      "Strong antivirus software does more than scan for malware. Many can flag unsafe pages, block suspicious redirects and warn you before you enter your details on a fake login page. It is a simple layer of protection that helps a lot when an email slips past filters.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "If you get an email claiming your password will expire, do not click the link. Go to the website directly and check your account settings. Phishing emails rely on urgency. Slowing down and confirming the issue yourself removes that pressure.",
      "Updates often include security fixes that help block malicious scripts and unsafe redirects. Attackers take advantage of older systems because they are easier to trick. Staying updated keeps you ahead of known weaknesses.",
      "Many email providers (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo) allow you to tighten spam filtering settings. This won't catch every soft-hyphen scam, but it improves your odds and reduces risky emails overall.",

It's safe to say filters and scanners are also improving, but they cannot catch everything, especially when the text they see is not the same as what you see. Staying safe comes down to a mix of good habits, the right tools, and a little skepticism whenever an email pushes you to act quickly. If you slow down, double-check the details, and follow the steps that strengthen your accounts, you make it much harder for anyone to fool you.",

      "How the scam starts",
      "Moret first received a flood of alerts. These included two-factor authentication notifications that claimed someone was trying to access his iCloud account. Within minutes, he got phone calls from calm, helpful callers who claimed to be Apple agents ready to fix the issue.",
      "The twist is how convincing the entire setup felt. The scammers were able to exploit a flaw in Apple's Support system that lets anyone create a genuine support ticket without verification. They opened a real Apple Support case in his name, which triggered official emails from an Apple domain. This built instant trust and lowered Moret's guard.",
      "How scammers gained access to the account",
      "During a 25-minute call, the fake agents guided Moret through what they said would secure his account. They walked him through the steps to reset his iCloud password. They also told him a link would follow so he could close the case.",
      "That link took him to a fake site called appeal apple dot com. The page looked official and claimed his account was being secured. It then told him to enter a six-digit code sent by text to finish the process.",
      "When Moret entered that code, the scammers got exactly what they needed to sign into his account.",
      "He then got an alert that his Apple ID had been used to sign into a Mac mini he did not own. That confirmed the takeover attempt. Even though the scammer on the phone said this was normal, he trusted his instinct. He reset his password again, which kicked them out and stopped the attack.",
      "BEWARE FAKE CREDIT CARD ACCOUNT RESTRICTION SCAMS",
      "A Broadcom executive says he nearly lost access to his Apple ID after trusting a fraudulent support call that looked legitimate. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "How to protect yourself from the Apple Support ticket scam",
      "This type of scam works because it feels real. The messages look official, and the callers sound trained. Still, you can stay safer by watching out for signs that something is off.",
      "Scammers created a real-looking ticket to make the entire experience seem legitimate. You can confirm what's real by checking directly with Apple. Sign in at appleid.apple.com or open the Apple Support app to view your recent cases. If the case number isn't listed there, the message is fake, even if the email comes from an Apple domain.",
      "Never stay on a call that you did not initiate. Scammers rely on long conversations to build trust and pressure you into quick decisions. Hang up right away and call Apple Support directly at 1-800-275-2273 or through the Support app. A real agent will quickly confirm whether anything is wrong.",
      "If something feels off, look at the devices signed into your account. Go to\u00a0Settings, tap your\u00a0name and scroll to see all devices\u00a0linked to your Apple ID. Remove anything you don't recognize. This step can stop attackers fast if they've managed to get in.",
      "No real support agent will ever ask for your two-factor authentication codes. Treat any request for these codes as a major warning.",
      "Look closely at URLs. Fake sites often add extra words or change formatting to appear real. Apple will never send you to a site like appeal apple dot com.",
      "SCAMMERS ARE ABUSING ICLOUD CALENDAR TO SEND PHISHING EMAILS",
      "Criminals are using Apple\u2019s own support system to generate real case emails that build false confidence with victims. (Photo by Fairfax Media via Getty Images via Getty Images)",
      "Strong antivirus software can spot dangerous links, unsafe sites, and fake support messages before you tap them. Anti-phishing tools are especially important with scams like this one since the attackers used a fake site and real ticket emails to trick victims.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Data brokers collect your phone number, home address, email, and other details that scammers use to personalize attacks. A data removal service can wipe much of that information from broker sites, which makes you a harder target for social engineering attempts like the one described in this article.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "This scam shows how convincing criminals can be when they exploit real systems. Even careful users can fall for messages that look official and calls that sound professional. The best defense is to stay alert and take a moment before responding to anything unexpected. When you slow down, double-check support tickets, and never share verification codes, you make yourself far harder to fool. Adding layers like antivirus protection and data removal services also gives you more control over what attackers can access. These simple habits can stop even the most polished scams before they get to your accounts.",

      "Kumma stood out for the wrong reasons. When the bear used the Mistral model, it offered tips on where to find knives, pills and matches. It even outlined steps to light a match and blow it out.",
      "Tests with the GPT-4o model raised even sharper concerns. Kumma gave advice related to kissing and launched into detailed explanations of adult sexual content when prompted. The bear pushed further by asking the young user what they wanted to explore.",
      "Researchers called the behavior unsafe and inappropriate for any child-focused product.",
      "FoloToy paused access to its AI toys",
      "Once the findings became public, FoloToy suspended sales of Kumma and its other AI toys. The company told PIRG that it started a full safety audit across all products.",

      "Why FoloToy restored Kumma's sales after its safety review",
      "FoloToy brought Kumma back to its online store just one week after suspending sales. The fast return drew attention from parents and safety experts who wondered if the company had enough time to fix the serious issues identified in PIRG's report.",
      "FoloToy posted a detailed statement on X that laid out its version of what happened. In the post, the company said it viewed child safety as its\u00a0\"highest priority\" and that it was\u00a0\"the only company to proactively suspend sales, not only of the product mentioned in the report, but also of our other AI toys.\" FoloToy said it took this action \"immediately after the findings were published because we believe responsible action must come before commercial considerations.\"",
      "The company also emphasized to CyberGuy that it was the only one of the three AI toy startups in the PIRG review to suspend sales across all of its products and that it made this decision during the peak Christmas sales season, knowing the commercial impact would be significant. FoloToy told us, \"Nevertheless, we moved forward decisively, because we believe that responsible action must always come before commercial interests.\"",
      "The company also said it took the report's disturbing examples seriously. According to FoloToy, the issues were \"directly addressed in our internal review.\" It explained that the team\u00a0\"initiated a deep, company-wide internal safety audit,\" then \"strengthened and upgraded our content-moderation and child-safety safeguards,\" and\u00a0\"deployed enhanced safety rules and protections through our cloud-based system.\"",
      "After outlining these steps, the company said it spent the week on\u00a0\"rigorous review, testing, and reinforcement of our safety modules.\" It concluded its announcement by saying it\u00a0\"began gradually restoring product sales\" as those updated safeguards went live.",
      "FoloToy added that as global attention on AI toy risks grows,\u00a0\"transparency, responsibility and continuous improvement are essential,\" and that the company\u00a0\"remains firmly committed to building safe, age-appropriate AI companions for children and families worldwide.\"",

      "PIRG researcher RJ Cross said her team plans to test the updated toys to see if the fixes hold up. She noted that a week feels fast for such significant changes, and only new tests will show if the product now behaves safely.",

      "AI toys can feel exciting and helpful, but they can also surprise you with content you'd never expect. If you plan to bring an AI-powered toy into your home, these simple steps can help you stay in control.",
      "Not every model follows the same guardrails. Some include stronger filters while others may respond too freely. Look for transparent disclosures about which model powers the toy and what safety features support it.",
      "Groups like PIRG often test toys in ways parents cannot. These reviews flag hidden risks and point out behavior you may not catch during quick demos.",
      "Keep AI toys in shared spaces where you can hear or see how your child interacts with it. This helps you step in if the toy gives a concerning answer.",
      "Ask the toy questions, try creative prompts and see how it handles tricky topics. This lets you learn how it behaves before you hand it to your child.",
      "Many AI toys run on cloud systems. Updates often add stronger safeguards or reduce risky answers. Make sure the device stays current.",
      "AI toys can gather voice data, location info or behavioral patterns. A strong privacy policy should explain what is collected, how long it is stored and who can access it.",

    "story": [
      "FOX Business correspondent Darren Botelho reports on growing concerns about the misuse of artificial intelligence after a major U.S. company, Anthropic, detected a cyberattack using AI by Chinese-sponsored hackers.",
      "Cybersecurity has been reshaped by the rapid rise of advanced artificial intelligence tools, and recent incidents show just how quickly the threat landscape is shifting.",
      "Over the past year, we've seen a surge in attacks powered by AI models that can write code, scan networks and automate complex tasks. This capability has helped defenders, but it has also enabled attackers to move faster than before.",
      "The latest example is a major cyberespionage campaign conducted by a Chinese state-linked group that used Anthropic's Claude to carry out large parts of an attack with very little human involvement.",

      "How Chinese hackers turned Claude into an automated attack machine",
      "In mid-September 2025, Anthropic investigators spotted unusual behavior that eventually revealed a coordinated and well-resourced campaign. The threat actor, assessed with high confidence as a Chinese state-sponsored group, had used Claude Code to target roughly 30 organizations worldwide. The list included major tech firms, financial institutions, chemical manufacturers and government bodies. A small number of those attempts resulted in successful breaches.",
      "Claude handled most of the operation autonomously, triggering thousands of requests and generating detailed documentation of the attack for future use. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "This was not a typical intrusion. The attackers built a framework that let Claude act as an autonomous operator. Instead of asking the model to help, they tasked it with executing most of the attack. Claude inspected systems, mapped out internal infrastructure and flagged databases worth targeting. The speed was unlike anything a human team could replicate.",
      "To get around Claude's safety rules, the attackers broke their plan into tiny, innocent-looking steps. They also told the model it was part of a legitimate cybersecurity team performing defensive testing. Anthropic later noted that the attackers didn't simply hand tasks to Claude; they engineered the operation to make the model believe it was performing authorized pentesting work, splitting the attack into harmless-looking pieces and using multiple jailbreak techniques to push past its safeguards. Once inside, Claude researched vulnerabilities, wrote custom exploits, harvested credentials and expanded access. It worked through these steps with little supervision and reported back only when it needed human approval for major decisions.",
      "The model also handled the data extraction. It collected sensitive information, sorted it by value and identified high-privilege accounts. It even created backdoors for future use. In the final stage, Claude generated detailed documentation of what it had done. This included stolen credentials, systems analyzed and notes that could guide future operations.",
      "Across the entire campaign, investigators estimate that Claude performed around 80-90% of the work. Human operators stepped in only a handful of times. At its peak, the AI triggered thousands of requests, often multiple per second, a pace still far beyond what any human team could achieve. Although it occasionally hallucinated credentials or misread public data as secret, those errors underscored that fully autonomous cyberattacks still face limitations, even when an AI model handles the majority of the work.",
      "Why this AI-powered Claude attack is a turning point for cybersecurity",
      "This campaign shows how much the barrier to high-end cyberattacks has dropped. A group with far fewer resources could now attempt something similar by leaning on an autonomous AI agent to do the heavy lifting. Tasks that once required years of expertise can now be automated by a model that understands context, writes code and uses external tools without direct oversight.",
      "Earlier incidents documented AI misuse, but humans were still steering every step. This case is different. The attackers needed very little involvement once the system was in motion. And while the investigation focused on usage within Claude, researchers believe similar activity is happening across other advanced models, which might include Google Gemini, OpenAI's ChatGPT or Musk's Grok.",
      "This raises a difficult question. If these systems can be misused so easily, why continue building them? According to researchers, the same capabilities that make AI dangerous are also what make it essential for defense. During this incident, Anthropic's own team used Claude to analyze the flood of logs, signals and data its investigation uncovered. That level of support will matter even more as threats grow.",
      "We reached out to Anthropic for comment but did not hear back before our deadline.",

      "7 ways you can protect yourself from AI-driven cyberattacks",
      "You may not be the direct target of a state-sponsored campaign, but many of the same techniques trickle down to everyday scams, credential theft and account takeovers. Here are seven detailed steps you can take to stay safer.",
      "Strong antivirus software does more than scan for known malware. It looks for suspicious patterns, blocked connections and abnormal system behavior. This is important because AI-driven attacks can generate new code quickly, which means traditional signature-based detection is no longer enough.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com",
      "A good password manager helps you create long, random passwords for every service you use. This matters because AI can generate and test password variations at high speed. Using the same password across accounts can turn a single leak into a full compromise.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com",
      "A large part of modern cyberattacks begins with publicly available information. Attackers often gather email addresses, phone numbers, old passwords and personal details from data broker sites. AI tools make this even easier, since they can scrape and analyze huge datasets in seconds. A personal data removal service helps clear your information from these broker sites so you are harder to profile or target.",
      "FAKE CHATGPT APPS ARE HIJACKING YOUR PHONE WITHOUT YOU KNOWING",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web: Cyberguy.com",
      "Strong passwords alone are not enough when attackers can steal credentials through malware, phishing pages or automated scripts. Two-factor authentication adds a serious roadblock. Use app-based codes or hardware keys instead of SMS. While no method is perfect, this extra layer often stops unauthorized logins even when attackers have your password.",
      "Attackers rely heavily on known vulnerabilities that people forget or ignore. System updates patch these flaws and close off entry points that attackers use to break in. Enable automatic updates on your phone, laptop, router and the apps you use most. If an update looks optional, treat it as important anyway, because many companies downplay security fixes in their release notes.",
      "Malicious apps are one of the easiest ways attackers get inside your device. Stick to official app stores and avoid APK sites, shady download portals and random links shared on messaging apps. Even on official stores, check reviews, download counts and the developer name before installing anything. Grant the minimum permissions required and avoid apps that ask for full access for no clear reason.",
      "AI tools have made phishing more convincing. Attackers can generate clean messages, imitate writing styles and craft perfect fake websites that match the real ones. Slow down when a message feels urgent or unexpected. Never click links from unknown senders, and verify requests from known contacts through a separate channel. If a pop-up claims your device is infected or your bank account is locked, close it and check directly through the official website.",
      "By breaking tasks into small, harmless-looking steps, the threat actors tricked Claude into writing exploits, harvesting credentials and expanding access.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The attack carried out through Claude signals a major shift in how cyber threats will evolve. Autonomous AI agents can already perform complex tasks at speeds no human team can match, and this gap will only widen as models improve. Security teams now need to treat AI as a core part of their defensive toolkit, not a future add-on. Better threat detection, stronger safeguards and more sharing across the industry are going to be crucial. Because if attackers are already using AI at this scale, the window to prepare is shrinking fast.",

Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks.

      "Leaked passwords often come from old profiles on data broker sites you forgot about. A data removal service can wipe your personal info from those sites and reduce how much of your data ends up on breach lists. When less of your information is floating around online, your accounts become less tempting targets.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

      "Also causing distress to the fragile egos of China\u2019s communist leaders is Japan\u2019s new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, a conservative who became Japan\u2019s first female prime minister in October. She appeared to break long-standing Japanese strategic ambiguity over Taiwan when, asked on Nov. 7 in parliament whether a Chinese attack on Taiwan would qualify as \"a situation threatening Japan\u2019s survival.\"",
      "Takaichi didn\u2019t deflect with a \"I don\u2019t comment on hypotheticals.\" Instead, she said, \"If there are battleships and the use of force, no matter how you think about it, it could constitute a survival-threatening situation.\"",

Gershaneck, a visiting scholar at National Chengchi University and a former U.S. Marine counterintelligence officer, told Fox News Digital that the U.S. needed to clearly denounce China for threats against Japan and the Japanese prime minister. Gershaneck warned that Asian allies remember past U.S. abandonment under what he called the \"do not provoke China!\" policy of the Obama administration. \"Unless high-level Washington officials signal stronger support,\" he said, \"the Trump 47 administration risks going down in history as Barack Hussein Obama\u2019s third term.\"",
      "Feingold noted that while Takaichi\u2019s stance was enthusiastically received in Taiwan, the excitement \"was unsustainable and not based on a formal policy decision by Japan to defend Taiwan.\"",

      "FIRST ON FOX: As Hamas uses the ceasefire to regroup and reassert control across parts of Gaza, a small number of emerging Palestinian militias say they are trying to form an alternative force inside the enclave. One of their leaders, Shawqi Abu Nasira, told Fox News Digital the pause in fighting has become a \"kiss of life\" for Hamas and warned the group is rebuilding.",
      "\"Hamas works for Iran,\" he said. \"They got weakened, yes, true, but the ceasefire, they gave them a kiss of life, and they are now preparing themselves better, trying to equip themselves. They are opening their own centers,\" and added, \"I'd like to thank President Trump for freezing the assets of Hamas and for labeling the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization.\"",
      "Abu Nasira, a former senior Palestinian Authority police official who spent 16 years in an Israeli prison, is now operating with a small band of fighters on the eastern side of Gaza\u2019s \"yellow line,\" in territory under Israeli military control. \"I moved to the east of a yellow line, to the area that is now [controlled by the] Israeli Army.

They have no medication. These people don't want Hamas.\"",

      "He said early efforts are underway to unite the factions. \"We are coordinating all of these groups together to work under one political umbrella, and they can act as a National Guard for East Gaza,\" he said.",

      "The second woman said: \u201cWe aren\u2019t taken seriously. You have women who are very accomplished, very successful, who have earned the merit, who aren\u2019t given the time of the day.\u201d",
      "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia \u2014 who blindsided Johnson with her recent resignation announcement, according to a GOP source familiar with the situation \u2014 has gone so far as to publicly accuse the current male GOP leaders of bias, telling The Washington Post in a recent interview she believes Republican women have been \u201cmarginalized.\u201d",
      "Greene and Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina, who has also been a vocal critic of Johnson, are scheduled to meet next week to talk about their shared frustrations, according to a source familiar with the matter.",
      "A spokesman for Johnson\u2019s political team said in a statement that he strongly supports the women in his conference and has been working hard to recruit even more women to the House, noting that several who are on the Speaker\u2019s Joint Fundraising Committee have received an average of nearly $400,000 for their campaigns so far this year.",
      "\u201cNot only has Speaker Johnson elevated women in leadership, he has also helped recruit and support women running for office,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cThis cycle, we have women running in 10 of the top districts we are watching. Our team is in touch with them and others across the country \u2014 just as we were in 2024 \u2014 as Speaker Johnson works to recruit strong conservatives who can win, help us grow our majority, and help us deliver on our agenda.\u201d",
      "The majority of chairmanships and leadership positions are elected by the entire conference, but there are a few instances in which Johnson can make unilateral appointments or create new roles.",
      "He appointed Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, 83, to lead the Rules Committee, making her the only female chair in the House. He also put three Republican women on the Intelligence Committee, including Stefanik, whom he also made the chair of House Republican Leadership after her U.N. ambassadorship nomination was pulled.",
      "Still, there are zero elected female committee chairs \u2014 and some Republicans privately blame Johnson for that. During a GOP steering committee meeting at the beginning of this year, Johnson spoke favorably of Rep. Brian Mast of Florida, who was running for the Foreign Affairs Committee chairmanship against Ann Wagner of Missouri. Some in the room interpreted that as Johnson\u2019s signaling his preference, but Johnson insisted he wasn\u2019t purposely trying to tip the scales. Mast won.",
      "Republicans have long struggled with elevating women. A Republican woman has never served higher than as the GOP conference chair. That position, which is fourth-ranking in the majority and third-ranking in the minority, is held by Lisa McClain of Michigan. McClain nominated Johnson for the speakership.",
      "McClain said in a statement that it\u2019s an \u201cabsurd suggestion\u201d to imply that Johnson hasn\u2019t done enough to promote GOP women.",
      "\u201cAs the House\u2019s highest ranking woman, the Speaker has treated me with nothing less than respect. He values my opinion, not as a woman, but as a trusted colleague,\u201d she told NBC News in a statement. \u201cDriving an unnecessary divide over gender is a Democrat tactic, and Republicans would be foolish to give in to this left-wing framing.\u201d",
      "Floor problems",
      "In recent weeks, sensitive issues related to women have pitted Republican women against their own leadership.",
      "Four Republicans \u2014 Mace, Greene and Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Lauren Boebert of Colorado \u2014 were involved in a discharge petition to force a floor vote on releasing the Jeffrey Epstein files, saying they want to help deliver justice for the women the late financier sexually abused.",
      "But it was the three Republican women who faced the brunt of a pressure campaign from both the White House and Johnson to drop off the petition. Johnson said he was against the discharge petition because he was concerned about protecting the identities of the female victims, although many of them had advocated for the release of the files.",
      "The discharge petition ultimately succeeded last month, and when the vote outcome looked inevitable, President Donald Trump then decided to get behind the issue. It passed with just one no vote, and Trump signed it into law.",
      "The same month, another divisive issue came to the floor \u2014 and it was once again predominantly Republican women who broke ranks with party leadership.",
      "Mace forced a vote on a resolution to censure fellow GOP Rep. Cory Mills of Florida, in part over his alleged misconduct toward women. A judge granted a restraining order that an ex-girlfriend had been seeking, alleging Mills had harassed her and threatened her with blackmail and revenge porn.",
      "Mills has denied any wrongdoing and has vowed to comply with the House Ethics probe, saying on the House floor, \u201cI believe all the accusations and false things being said will be proven to be absolutely false in many ways, and I have the evidence and receipts and look forward to working with them.\u201d",
      "Eight Republicans voted with Democrats against a GOP motion to kill the resolution, six of them women: Mace, Boebert, Greene, Luna, Kat Cammack of Florida and Harriet Hageman of Wyoming.",
      "Mace also wrote a letter to Johnson raising concerns about Mills but said she never received a response.",
      "Johnson has argued he should let the investigative process play out, as the Ethics Committee has created a subpanel to probe the allegations against Mills. But some women were disappointed with his response when NBC News pressed them about the accusations at a news conference in October. Johnson called Mills a \u201cfaithful colleague\u201d and then, growing frustrated with reporters for continuing to ask questions about Mills, suggested they \u201ctalk about some things that are really serious.\u201d",
      "Future GOP ranks",
      "At least four GOP women won\u2019t return in the next Congress, raising the possibility that the number of House Republican women could actually decline after the 2026 midterms. Greene is resigning, Stefanik and Mace are running for governor, and Rep. Ashley Hinson of Iowa is running for the Senate.",
      "Greene and Stefanik are prolific fundraisers, and Stefanik in particular has worked to recruit and boost female GOP candidates through her PAC.",
      "Hinson has also been seen as a rising star in the party since she flipped a Democratic-held House seat in 2020. That was a banner election cycle for House Republican women, whose ranks more than doubled from a low point of just 13 after the 2018 midterms.",
      "There are 33 female Republicans in the House, including two nonvoting members, compared with 96 Democratic women. The number of GOP women in the House has declined slightly since the record number of 36 set in 2023.",
      "\u201cThe departures of these women, particularly in the House, makes returning to or exceeding the record for Republican women in the House more difficult,\u201d said Kelly Dittmar, director of research and a scholar at the Center for American Women and Politics at the Eagleton Institute of Politics.",
      "While the number of GOP women who are retiring is still relatively small, Dittmar said a single loss is felt \u201cthat much more\u201d because Republican women are already starting at low levels of representation.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so much we don\u2019t know about whether or not this will be a good year for Republicans or Democrats. But certainly, from all we know historically, it will take a particularly good year for Republicans and a high level of Republican women running, which were the conditions in 2020, to ensure that you could make up for these losses and maybe even exceed,\u201d she said.",
      "Candidates are still considering and launching campaigns, so it\u2019s not clear yet how many races will include Republican women.",
      "Maggie\u2019s List, a group that supports GOP women for office, announced Wednesday that it is endorsing four additional House candidates, including two in Republican-leaning districts: state Rep. Shannon Lundgren in Iowa\u2019s 2nd District, which Hinson is vacating to run for the Senate, and former Rep. Mayra Flores, who is challenging Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez in Texas\u2019 34th District.",
      "The group also backed three candidates for governor, including Stefanik, bringing its 2026 endorsements so far to 27 GOP women, including 18 House candidates.",
      "Former Florida Lt. Gov. Jennifer Carroll, a national spokesperson for Maggie\u2019s List, said she was confident that the number of GOP women in Congress would \u201cstay steady.\u201d",
      "Carroll said Johnson has been supportive of their efforts, and he appeared at the group\u2019s fundraiser in Washington, D.C. But she said the party has more work to do to support female candidates, saying, \u201cWe still have to prove ourselves over and over again.\u201d",
      "\u201cOn the Republican side, they try to, I guess, stay away from identity,\u201d Carroll added later. \u201cAnd on the Democrat side, they don\u2019t care. They will embrace, if they\u2019re pushing for more women to be elected, then that\u2019s where the mantra will go and that\u2019s where the money will go and that\u2019s where the energy would go.\u201d",
      "Winning for Women, a group that also supports GOP women and has a super PAC to boost its endorsed candidates, is also focused on recruitment. Executive Director Meredith Allen Dellinger said Winning for Women has already met with 60 prospective candidates across 32 states and is endorsing contenders like attorney Jessica Hart Stein and Army veteran Alex Mealer, who are running in ruby-red Texas districts.",
      "\u201cSince getting into this fight in 2019, the number of Republican women serving in the House has more than doubled and today we have a record number of Republican women in the U.S. Senate. That progress is real, but there\u2019s more work to do, which is why we\u2019re heavily focused on recruitment this cycle,\u201d Dellinger said in a statement, describing Stein and Mealer as candidates who \u201cembody principled, solutions\u2011oriented conservatism and the leadership our party needs to build a durable House majority.\u201d",
      "And while various GOP groups are engaged in supporting female candidates, Dittmar said a lack of targeted infrastructure within the party itself is a \u201ccontinued and persistent problem\u201d for Republican women looking to grow their ranks.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just opposition to it, like there\u2019s just both ideological opposition, strategic opposition to it,\u201d Dittmar said, adding that Republican women have pushed efforts to support female candidates themselves.",
      "The National Republican Congressional Committee also had an initiative in the 2014 election cycle dubbed \u201cProject GROW,\u201d aimed at recruiting and empowering female GOP candidates, but that program didn\u2019t last long.",
      "\u201cAll these efforts have just really struggled to stay,\u201d Dittmar said. \u201cAnd again, I don\u2019t put it on the women. I think it\u2019s the party overall that\u2019s not seeing this as a priority.\u201d"

    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 21:29:23 GMT",
    "summary": "The U.S. has stopped processing all immigration requests related to Afghan nationals and is reexamining legal residents\u2019 cases.",
    "story": [
      "Fear, stress and worry have gripped the lives of thousands of Afghans living in the United States since an Afghan national was accused of shooting two National Guard members near the White House last week \u2014 leading the Trump administration to aggressively expand its efforts to crack down on legal immigration from Afghanistan.",
      "In Florida, a former Afghan military member who fought alongside U.S. armed forces in his homeland worries about people in his community being unfairly targeted by immigration officials. An Afghan father working as a ride-share service driver in Portland, Oregon, stopped having conversations with his passengers fearing possible hateful retribution, and an Afghan scholar in Washington, D.C., is warning against \u201cturning this incident into a broad judgment about Afghan migrants.\u201d",
      "Across the nation, Afghans have condemned the shooting that killed Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and critically wounded Andrew Wolfe, 24, and expressed their condolences to the families of both National Guard members. But they also criticized the shift in immigration policy based on the actions of one person. Among those critics is Afghanistan\u2019s Foreign Minister Maulvi Amir Khan Muttaqi, who on Wednesday called the shooting \u201can individual act\u201d that \u201chas nothing to do with Afghanistan and its respectable people.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no question that what was done was horrible,\u201d said Yahya Haqiqi, president and chief executive officer of the Afghan Support Network, a nonprofit in Oregon. \u201cThe problem is, why is it coming back to the larger community?\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like, somebody on your street commits a crime, and you take the whole neighborhood to jail,\u201d Haqiqi told NBC News.",
      "After the suspected gunman was identified as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan asylee, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has halted all asylum decisions for applicants from 19 countries deemed as \u201chigh risk\u201d by the Trump administration in June, including Afghanistan.",
      "Lakanwal, who worked for the U.S. military during the war against Afghanistan, came to the United States under the Biden administration\u2019s emergency effort to resettle thousands of at-risk Afghans during the chaotic withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover in 2021. A refugee in the United States, Lakanwal then applied for asylum, which was granted to him in April during the Trump administration.",
      "Trump administration officials have blamed Biden-era policies for allowing Lakanwal into the country. On Wednesday, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said in an email that the \"Trump Administration is reviewing all immigration benefits granted by the Biden administration to aliens from Countries of Concern.\u201d The spokesperson did not say whether the president was considering reviewing asylum cases granted during his own administration, as it was in Lakanwal's case.",
      "\"The Trump Administration is making every effort to ensure individuals becoming citizens are the best of the best. Citizenship is a privilege, not a right,\" the DHS spokesperson added. \"We will take no chances when the future of our nation is at stake.\"",
      "The Trump administration had already halted refugee resettlement from Afghanistan at the beginning of the year and issued a travel ban on 19 countries, including Afghanistan, over the summer \u2014 though there was an exception for applicants for Special Immigrant Visas. But following the recent shooting, the Trump administration has pretty much blocked legal immigration from the country.",
      "USCIS has stopped processing all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals indefinitely. USCIS Director Joseph B. Edlow said his agency also launched a \u201creexamination of every Green Card\u201d granted to people from the 19 countries previously banned from entering the U.S., and the State Department announced it \u201cpaused visa issuance for individuals traveling on Afghan passport.\u201d",
      "The announcements sent a chilling wave of uncertainty among the more than 190,000 Afghans resettled in the United States since 2021.",
      "On Monday, Haqiqi was peppered with phone calls from community members in Oregon seeking answers, especially those in the process of reuniting with relatives left behind in Afghanistan during the chaos of the 2021 evacuation, he said.",
      "Among those worried is an Afghan father in Portland who is a green-card holder. Speaking with NBC News, he asked not to be named out of fear his legal immigration may be jeopardized as USCIS begins to re-examine green cards issued to Afghans.",
      "\u201cI feel sad and worried that innocent Afghans might face more judgment,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just want peace.\u201d",
      "A doctor on the front lines of the pandemic in Afghanistan, he was forced to flee his homeland after his safety and that of his family were under threat because of his public health work with international partners and prominent medical institutions.",
      "He came to the United States last year on a Special Immigrant Visa and now has a green card. Being able to legally live and work permanently in the United States has allowed him to study for an extensive three-part exam required to practice medicine in the States; all while working as a ride-share service driver to support his family and adapting to a new country.",
      "\u201cBeing a doctor is not something impossible here in the U.S., but it is very hard. It\u2019s very difficult,\u201d he said, adding he already passed part one of the medical licensing exam and is getting ready for part two next year.",
      "Like him, most Afghans who came to the U.S. are searching for safety, opportunity and a better life, he said. \u201cWe all respect this country and its law, so when something like this happens, it makes the whole community feel sad and concerned.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are a part of this community. We are all sad, like all Americans,\u201d he added.",
      "Other Afghans in Oregon expressed concerns over their work authorizations since they\u2019re tied to their legal immigration status, and renewals are among the immigration requests being halted indefinitely, Haqiqi said.",
      "Abdul Wahid Gulrani, an Afghan refugee who fled violence and extremism in search of safety and is now a visiting scholar at George Washington University, in D.C., said it is important to emphasize that Afghans who come to the United States after the collapse of their homeland remain \u201coverwhelmingly law-abiding despite facing serious financial, psychological, legal, and social challenges.\u201d",
      "\u201cTens of thousands of newly arrived Afghans are working hard to rebuild their lives, study, work, volunteer, and integrate into American society,\u201d Gulrani said in an email. \u201cA single act should not be used to justify unnecessary restrictions on legal migration, to reinforce prejudice, or to push emotional, reaction-based policies.\u201d",
      "In Florida, Abdullah Khan, an Afghan national with a green card, said his community fears being targeted by immigration officials based on the actions of the suspected gunman.",
      "\u201cThis is one bad person,\u201d Khan said. \u201cThe government should not treat us like we are all the same.\u201d",
      "Immigration authorities are also stepping up their efforts to locate and apprehend more than 1,860 Afghans across the country who have been given final deportation orders but are not currently in detention, The New York Times reported on Tuesday.",
      "Khan served as a member of an elite military unit of Afghans known as the National Mine Reduction Group, or NMRG, who would go out in front of U.S. Special Forces members during missions. His team\u2019s main job was to identify and disable improvised explosive devices, though it was not uncommon for them to fight alongside their American counterparts during Taliban ambushes.",
      "That\u2019s why Khan said he was horrified to learn that an Afghan who had also worked with U.S. forces was suspected of shooting the two National Guards members last week.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible act,\u201d Khan said. \u201cAll of us from Afghanistan are very upset about what happened.\u201d",
      "As Afghans like him face the prospect of having their green cards re-examined, Khan said he feels safe after receiving assurances from some of his former Special Forces counterparts.",
      "\u201cSome of them have reached out to me and said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry. We got you. There will be no issue for you guys,'\u201d Khan said."

    "story": [
      "If you order products from abroad this holiday season, you could end up with an unwanted surprise: a pricey tariff bill.",
      "This is the first holiday shopping season since the Trump administration made a major change to customs rules, extending tariffs and customs fees to low-value packages that had long been exempt.",
      "Since the new policies went into effect in late August, shoppers have reported being hit with surprise tariff charges on everything from rugs and computers to vitamins \u2014 sometimes costing hundreds of dollars.",
      "Now, as the busiest shopping season of the year gets underway, the stakes are high for both consumers and retailers.",
      "The National Retail Federation estimates that U.S. holiday sales will top $1 trillion for the first time this season, and Adobe Analytics expects shoppers will spend a record $253.4 billion online this holiday season.",
      "Shoppers who buy gifts from overseas should be prepared to pay tariffs before they can put their presents under the tree. And those who dispute an unexpected tariff bill should be ready for a potentially monthslong back-and-forth with major shippers \u2014\u00a0while late fees pile up.",
      "The $657 tariff bill",
      "Bonnie Hardy-Compagno thought she\u2019d be paying a standard 15% import duty from Europe when she ordered $431 worth of skincare products in late August that were shipped from Belgium.",
      "Instead, when her package arrived via UPS in September, she was told that she owed customs charges and fees that were more than the items were worth.",
      "\u201cI was very shocked when it showed up and the delivery driver was like, \u2018This is going to be $657 to collect your package,\u2019\u201d said Hardy-Compagno.",
      "Hardy-Compagno refused her package of skincare products and reached out to UPS for clarification.",
      "According to forms and emails she received from UPS, the shipping company said the face creams and serums she ordered had triggered a 200% tariff because they contained aluminum that was either from Russia or from an unknown country, as well as a separate 50% steel tariff.",
      "\u201cIt is chaos trying to get it resolved,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been calling at least once a week for two months. I have been emailing.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey finally sent me a form to fill out about quantities of aluminum in the product, which I have no idea,\u201d she continued. \u201cIf you go look at the product to pull up ingredients, it\u2019s just the ingredients that\u2019s in the skincare product.\u201d",
      "Last month, UPS sent her another invoice for a $65 late fee. She said the company had also sent the bill to collections.",
      "\u201cAt this point, I\u2019m like, \u2018It would have been cheaper for me to fly to Paris,\u2019\u201d Hardy-Compagno said.",
      "Ripple effects around the world",
      "For nearly a century, low-value packages have been allowed to enter the United States duty-free, under what\u2019s known as the \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption. Since 2016, that threshold value has been $800.",
      "But this summer, President Donald Trump ended the exemption, saying it had been used to bring illegal drugs, including fentanyl, into the United States. Starting Aug. 29, low-value packages shipped to individuals have been subject to the same tariffs and fees as large commercial shipping imports.",
      "The change is part of a bigger push by the Trump administration to reshape global trade with a constantly shifting mix of blanket tariff rates on U.S. trade partners and separate tariffs on specific products and materials.",
      "The president has said his tariff-based economic policy will boost domestic manufacturing and improve the U.S. economy in the long run.",
      "But in the meantime, American businesses and consumers are paying a price.",
      "Many U.S. retailers have decided to raise their prices to account for these higher import costs.",
      "Some international businesses have stopped shipping to the United States altogether, saying it\u2019s not financially feasible to pay big tariffs in order to ship small items.",
      "And several major companies \u2014 including Costco, cosmetics giant Revlon and eyeglasses maker EssilorLuxottica \u2014 have sued the Trump administration over the tariffs.",
      "Chaos at customs",
      "The new requirements for smaller packages have caught consumers in a customs nightmare.",
      "Thousands of packages every week are getting stuck in customs limbo at global shipping hubs across the country.",
      "UPS, the world\u2019s largest courier, has told some customers that it has been \u201cdisposing of\u201d their packages.",
      "Packages that do make it through customs clearance and to customers can still arrive with the hefty tariff price tags. And shipping companies typically tack on additional processing fees, too.",
      "The factors influencing a shipment\u2019s eventual tariff charges include \u201cwhere it comes from, what it\u2019s made out of, and what the finished product is classified as,\u201d said John Pickel, vice president of supply chain policy at the National Foreign Trade Council.",
      "But these questions are more complicated than they sound.",
      "In a statement to NBC News, UPS said, in part: \u201cUPS\u2019s brokers are highly trained and use sophisticated technology to ensure accuracy in calculating the appropriate duty and fees due. If you feel there is an error in the calculation of the duty and taxes assessed to your U.S. import shipment, you can contact the UPS Billing group by using the number listed on your UPS billing invoice or contact the UPS Post Entry Department.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur agents are working hard to address every customer\u2019s inquiry as recent tariff policy changes have led to a significant rise in the number of brokerage-related inquiries,\u201d UPS added.",
      "How to avoid surprise tariffs",
      "Retail experts advise anyone planning to order products from abroad this holiday season to be careful.",
      "\u201cIf you are ordering overseas, the first thing that I would do is search for that item elsewhere to see if they have a U.S. warehouse, another retailer,\u201d said Trae Bodge, a shopping expert at truetrae.com.",
      "\u201cIt makes me very nervous to be ordering overseas right now, because it\u2019s kind of all up in the air,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if you must have that item and it\u2019s only available overseas, read the fine print, especially at checkout.\u201d",
      "Consumers should be on the lookout for labels indicating \u201cdelivery duty paid,\u201d or DDP. This typically means shipping costs have been included in the final price of the item.",
      "Bodge also recommended searching for any mention on retailers\u2019 websites of tariffs, taxes, shipping fees or other charges.",
      "Shoppers can also check to see if the websites list where items are shipping from and reach out to retailers directly for any clarification or additional details."

      "Keaton died at the age of 79 on Oct. 11 from a bacterial pneumonia infection.",
      "Paulson began by sharing how she\u2019d known Keaton for about 15 years after the late star played her mother in \u201cThe Other Sister.\u201d After recalling the warm welcome she received from her, Paulson delved into the emails, texts and voice notes that she described as \u201creally something.\u201d",
      "\u201cMoron, what is your address?\u201d Paulson kicked it off as the audience laughed. \u201c6:30, Diane Keaton, actress... I want to see you and your house, idiot. When date? Di. Sarah, I hate your phone. It is always full and I can never leave a message.\u201d",

      "\u201cSarah, I saw your movie last night. Your acting was great and you look beautiful. I tried to leave a message but as usual your voicemail was full,\u201d Paulson read. \u201cAs usual, I called, as usual, your mailbox is full. As usual, I don\u2019t want to write a message. As usual, I wanna see your face. As usual, I\u2019m leaving town or you\u2019re leaving town, all as usual.\u201d",
      "Keaton also got reflective amid her blunt texts, writing, according to Paulson, \u201cWe are so fortunate. Do you love being an actress? I don\u2019t. Are you happy enough? Di.\u201d",
      "After a handful of more messages, Paulson concluded her speech by sharing a letter that she wished she would have been able to send the \u201cAnnie Hall\u201d star.",
      "\u201cDear Dum-Dum, I wanna tell you I\u2019m sorry my voicemail was always full,\u201d she said, getting emotional. \u201cI want to tell you I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t available every time you called me. I want to tell you how much crummier the world is without you in it. I want to tell you everything that happened in my life in the 54 days since you\u2019ve been gone.\u201d",
      "She continued, \u201cI want to tell you how the world lost its mind with grief the day you died.

Thank you for being my friend, Sarah Paulson, actress.\u201d",

      "\"Conflict in a relationship is normal, but it\u2019s how do you respond inside of that conflict that can either be healthy or unhealthy,\" she says.",
      "Hensley defines an argument as a situation \u201cwhere there is a disagreement and two people get dysregulated and so they are not able to speak to each other in a calm and respectful way during that disagreement.\u201d",
      "She says a scenario could involve one person raising their voice and becoming too intense while the other shuts down and withdraws.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing two people lean in with empathy and engagement with each other,\u201d she explains.",
      "So, she says a relationship in which two people don\u2019t argue could have two different types of dynamic: One that is healthy and one that isn\u2019t.",
      "The unhealthy dynamic is conflict avoidance, she says. \u201cWe see this when we have certain insecure attachment styles that pair up together, that are both afraid of conflict. Instead of actually bringing up their needs or bringing up what feels bad to them or what they would like to see changed in the relationship, they just stay silent and shut it down,\u201d she says.",
      "She cautions that this could cause one person to harbor resentment, leading to other problems in the future. If both partners are conflict avoidant, then they are never really working through their issues.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re simply avoiding the hard discussions because they\u2019re afraid of being vulnerable, or maybe they\u2019re afraid of being rejected or that their partner is going to get triggered and have a poor response to their needs,\u201d Hensley adds.",
      "Although there can be a multitude of reasons for being conflict avoidant, the expert says that she sees that type of behavior often with insecurely attached people.",
      "Alternatively, she says two securely attached people could work through disagreements without arguing or becoming emotionally dysregulated. Instead, the two could react with respect and empathy for each other.",
      "\"I think the healthiest types of responses are ones in which we can stay calm and respectful, but if we do have some arguing, where people do get a little bit healed, as long as there\u2019s proper repair, the relationship can still stay relatively healthy, and we can still build more trust and safety over time,\" she says.",
      "As for George Clooney mentioning his age as one of the reasons he doesn\u2019t argue with his wife, Hensley says she has seen that trend in older couples, especially those who have been together for a long time.",
      "\u201cAs people age, a lot of times, if they\u2019re very self aware, they will have done the inner work to get to a place where they\u2019re not very argumentative inside of their relationship. That\u2019s different than conflict avoidance,\u201d she says.",
      "If couples are struggling with conflict avoidance, Hensley suggests focusing on nervous system work and somatic processing to become comfortable with their emotions.",
      "\u201cBeing able to focus on learning healthy emotional processing will allow you to feel more comfortable with other people\u2019s emotions, and it\u2019s not going to feel like receiving somebody else\u2019s emotions is automatically a criticism or something to be upset or dysregulated about,\u201d she advises.",
      "Hensley emphasizes the importance of being aware of your attachment style and not assuming incompatibility is the reason a relationship fails.",
      "\u201cWorking on your attachment and the things that come with insecure attachment, like your comfort with being vulnerable, your ability to process your emotions and your ability to stay objective is really important. But a lot of people just don\u2019t know what they don\u2019t know,\u201d she says.",
      "If a partner\u2019s blueprint is dysfunctional, then their relationships will be negatively impacted.",
      "\u201cInvestigate attachment and focus on your own attachment security,\u201d she encourages. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be the best way to have a healthy relationship in the future.\u201d"

      "Miley Cyrus and her longtime boyfriend Maxx Morando are taking the next step in their relationship.",
      "After four years of dating, the couple recently got engaged, as confirmed by The New York Times.",
      "Cyrus, 33, showed off her engagement ring at the Los Angeles premiere of \"Avatar: Fire and Ash\" while posing on the red carpet with Morando, a 27-year-old music producer and drummer for the band Liily.",
      "Jacquie Aiche designed the ring, TODAY.com can confirm.",
      "The ring appears to feature a cushion-cut diamond between four and five carats, according to jewelry experts TODAY.com interviewed.",
      "Laura Taylor, a jeweler specializing in engagement and wedding rings at Lorel Diamonds, says cushion-cut diamonds have a \u201cromantic, vintage feel\u201d and are known for \u201csoft corners and broad facets that catch the light with flashes rather than sparkle.\u201d",
      "It's set in a chunky gold design, which Taylor says has been \"making a return\" among celebrities \u2013\u00a0see: Dua Lipa's recent engagement ring.",
      "The diamond is surrounded by gold, rather than set in prongs, also known as a bezel-style setting.",
      "\"Not only does this keep the stone more secure, but it also helps it stand out even more,\u201d Taylor notes.",
      "The pairing of a classic cushion-cut diamond with the bezel setting gives it a \"modern, sculptural look,\" which suits Cyrus' style, Taylor says.",
      "The ring aligns with Cyrus' brand and sense of style for other reasons, jewelers say.",
      "Ashleigh Bergman, the founder of Milestones by Ashleigh Bergman, says while the setting is classic, it's not \"classically bridal\" \u2014\u00a0which \"conversely makes it super modern.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s edgy (for bridal), but clean,\" she says.",
      "Page Neal, co-founder of Bario Neal, calls the ring \"modern, unfussy, bold, and deeply self-assured.\"",
      "\u201cIt has the feeling of a piece chosen for the present moment in her life, not an echo of the past,\u201d Neal says.",
      "Neal sees the ring speaking to various trends within the jewelry space, including a shift toward elongated shapes like ovals and marquises; east-west settings and the rise of low, wearable profiles.",
      "Jewelers who spoke to TODAY.com estimate the ring costing between $100,000 and $500,000, depending on factors like provenance of the stone, color, clarity and carat size.",
      "While speaking with People, Cyrus offered the following thoughts on her engagement.",
      "\u201cThe detail that I can share is that for us, our privacy and us kind of keeping it small has been something that I\u2019ve been astounded that I\u2019ve actually been able to have and being able to kind of have more choice,\u201d she says.",
      "Cyrus also explained why she thinks she and Morando have mostly been able to avoid the spotlight, saying, \u201cI think it\u2019s also being older, being more protective of what I\u2019m open to sharing.\u201d"

I think I\u2019d like to be trading with the United States of America, frankly, instead of losing thousands of soldiers a week.

      "Before he met with Witkoff and Kushner on Tuesday, Putin launched into a tirade against Europe, criticizing European leaders for hindering Trump\u2019s peace efforts, from which, he said, Europe has removed itself. Russia has no intention of going to war with European countries, he told reporters, but if Europe starts a war, there can be no doubt about Russia\u2019s readiness to respond \u201cright now.\u201d",
      "Stefan Wolff, a professor of international security at England\u2019s University of Birmingham, said Putin's rhetoric was part of the Russian narrative that Europe is undermining Trump\u2019s efforts to end the war and that if it weren't for European obstruction, a deal would long ago have been done.",

      "There was no real expectation of a breakthrough heading into the talks in Moscow, as the Kremlin did not show any intention of easing off on its hard-line demands.",
      "Still, Moscow called the five-hour conversation \u201cuseful\u201d and said some points could be agreed on, while Putin viewed others \u201cnegatively.\u201d The parties also discussed the issue of territories \u2014 a key and very sensitive point for Ukraine \u2014 and some American proposals on that looked \u201cmore or less acceptable\u201d to the Kremlin. Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that the talks were the first such \u201cdirect exchange of opinions,\u201d adding that Putin did not reject the U.S. plan.",
      "Also Wednesday, Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Andriy Sybiha, said the U.S. team had invited the Ukrainian delegation to \"continue our talks in America in the near future.\""

    "summary": "After a quiet start, Pope Leo XI, the first American pontiff appears to have found his voice on his trip to Turkey and Lebanon.",
    "story": [
      "After a quiet start, the first American pope appears to be finding his voice.",
      "During his debut foreign trip, to Turkey and Lebanon, Pope Leo XIV projected a papal brand more guarded and less polarizing than that of his predecessor, Pope Francis.",
      "But many Vatican watchers have nonetheless been impressed with his ability to deliver powerful messages \u2014 particularly on issues such as climate change, artificial intelligence, poverty and immigration \u2014 albeit in a subtler way than the man he replaced.",
      "\u201cPope Leo is certainly growing into the role,\u201d said Massimo Faggioli, a world-leading Vatican expert and professor at Trinity College Dublin. \u201cHe has resisted the temptation to give a sound bite that\u2019s easy to use as a headline,\u201d but \u201cwhen he speaks, he says things that are quite courageous.\u201d",
      "For all the warm reviews, some Vatican watchers have sounded a note of caution: Leo has yet to stake out concrete positions, let alone sharp critiques, on any major issue. Doing so will almost certainly mean disappointing at least one faction in this church of 1.4 billion that he has so deftly kept onside.",
      "Raised in Chicago, Leo, 70, spent much of his working life in Peru, before he was a surprise choice for pope at April\u2019s conclave following the death of Francis. His lower profile meant \u201che was a bit of a mystery\u201d for many Catholics, and he had \u201ca very quiet summer\u201d of study and preparation, Faggioli said.",
      "That started to change as the colder months arrived, with more outspoken comments including his call last month for \u201cdeep reflection\u201d about the treatment of detained migrants in the United States.",
      "On Tuesday, as he held a Mass in Beirut, which was attended by an estimated 150,000 people, Leo honored a promise made by Francis, who was prevented from visiting by his late-life illness.",
      "Leo asked \u201cGod for the gift of peace for this beloved land, marked by instability, wars and suffering,\u201d likely a reference to the recent Israel-Hezbollah war, the fallout from a colossal portside explosion in 2020 that killed more than 200 people, and the country\u2019s roiling economic crisis.",
      "Though more than half of the Lebanese population is Muslim, nearly one third are Christian and 5% Catholic, according to 2022 census data. Before Lebanon, Leo visited Turkey to mark the anniversary of the foundation of the Nicene Creed, the standard statement of what all Christians \u2014 Catholics, Protestants and Orthodox \u2014 believe, including the affirmation that Jesus was the son of God.",
      "That highlighted one of the themes of the six-day trip, which was reaching out \u201cboth to other Christian groups, but also to the government of Turkey, and, by extension, to Muslims,\u201d according to Miles Pattenden, a historian of the Catholic Church who teaches at the University of Oxford.",
      "That\u2019s just one of the ways Leo has followed Francis\u2019 relatively progressive policies and views \u2014 \u201cbut he\u2019s done so with a very different tone and in a different way,\u201d Pattenden said.",
      "Though both men warned against the risks associated with AI, the tech-savvy Leo is the first pontiff \u201cwho seems at ease with the modern world\u201d and pop culture, Pattenden added.",
      "His down-to-earth vibe makes his papacy seem like \u201ca sitcom in which some nice geek from the Midwest in America suddenly found that he had become pope,\u201d Pattenden said. \u201cHe\u2019s got this smile that suggests he himself can\u2019t quite believe it.\u201d",
      "Leo is known to read his speeches word-for-word, a drastic departure from Francis\u2019 habit of going off script. That led to several high-profile faux pas that sent his aides into damage limitation mode.",
      "\u201cTheir gestures and outreach are similar,\u201d said Stan Chu Ilo, a Catholic studies professor at DePaul University in Chicago. \u201cBut Pope Francis was quite evidently gregarious and extroverted in nature, whereas the reserved Pope Leo seems quite effective though in communication and has clarity in his thought.\u201d",
      "Even when sticking to his lines, Francis\u2019 pointed and specific pronouncements led to clashes with other world officials, like when he challenged the U.S. on climate change and called for an investigation into whether Israel had committed genocide in Gaza.",
      "Leo has said he supports the two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinian territories but told reporters on the plane to Lebanon that \u201cwe are friends with Israel.\u201d",
      "During his trip this week, Leo \u201cspoke and acted very carefully, as if every sentence had been carefully weighted and coined, to avoid misunderstanding or blunt declaration,\u201d said Olivier Roy, a professor at the European University Institute.",
      "And the new pope was well received by many in Lebanon, a country still being bombed by Israel. Just a week before Leo landed in Beirut, an Israeli airstrike on the city killed Haytham Ali Tabatabai, a senior Hezbollah commander, and four other people, while injuring 28 more.",
      "\u201cWe think he will bring for us peace, love and hope,\u201d said Pascale Azaz, a nurse watching Leo\u2019s address next to Beirut\u2019s shimmering waterfront Tuesday, the last day of his trip. \u201cWe have been waiting years for this day.\u201d",
      "Nearby, Moussa Abdayem, a yoga instructor, said he hoped the pope \u201cwill inspire us to live in a more peaceful way\u201d in a country where \u201ceverybody\u2019s angry\u201d at the swirling crises besetting his nation.",
      "They aren\u2019t the only ones impressed by Leo\u2019s approach. His centrist stance appears to have calmed divisions between Catholic liberals and conservatives, some of the latter enraged by what they saw as Francis\u2019 abandonment of liturgical traditions such as the Latin mass.",
      "However, occupying such a middle ground does not come without risks.",
      "The closest Leo came to criticism or censure of anyone or anything was making \u201ca heartfelt appeal to those who hold political and social authority, here and in all countries marked by war and violence.\u201d",
      "He told them, \"Listen to the cry of your peoples who are calling for peace!\u201d"

      "While new slabs of white marble have replaced the old floor and the walls are freshly painted, the Rev. Miled Abboud is hopeful that Pope Leo XIV\u2019s visit to the blast site Tuesday will highlight the amount of rebuilding that still needs to be done. He also believes Leo's visit will bring \u201ca message of hope\u201d and reconciliation between Lebanon\u2019s diverse Christian communities \u2014 a large number of whom have left in recent years \u2014 and coexistence with the majority Muslim population.",
      "\u201cThe pope\u2019s visit is a sign of hope,\u201d Abboud told NBC News on Saturday. \u201cThere are a lot of bleak things, of things that make us despair, but we have Christ who gives us strength to carry on.\u201d",
      "Abboud, who said he had only been a priest at this Maronite church for a few months, added that he hoped to restore it to its former glory to inspire the local community, although many younger members of his congregation have left the city or country altogether, largely because of the dire economy.",
      "\u201cThe majority of young people have moved to other regions or to the Gulf, to Europe, to France, because we have a lot of French universities here, so once they finish their studies, people move to France,\u201d he said.",
      "Many of them took the decision to leave in the aftermath of the massive August 2020 port explosion, which tore through Beirut after hundreds of tons of ammonium nitrate detonated in a warehouse, according to Paul Salem, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, a Washington-based think tank.",
      "In total, 218 people were killed and 7,000 others wounded by the blast which devastated large swaths of the city, causing billions of dollars in damages.",
      "Much of the destruction was in \u201cmajority Christian neighborhoods of east Beirut,\u201d Salem said in a series of voice notes Monday. For some it was \u201cthe last straw,\u201d he added.",
      "As much as people loved their homeland, he said, the explosion \u201ctraumatized so many\u201d in the country, which was already reeling from an economic collapse and struggling to cope with an influx of around 1.5 million refugees who crossed into Lebanon as civil war-ravaged neighboring Syria. Some have returned to their country since the overthrow of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad last year.",
      "Pointing out that members of Christian populations have a long history of migration \u201cfrom the Middle East to the West from the 19th century,\u201d Salem said \u201cthey were attracted to and feel comfortable going to the West, which is generally Christian.\u201d",
      "But, he said, both Christians and Muslims had left during the civil war which wracked the country between 1975 and 1990 and the war with Israel in 2006.",
      "After the economic collapse, he said, \u201cthere weren\u2019t great jobs in Lebanon but there were in Dubai, Abu Dhabi or Riyadh or further afield in Canada or the U.S.\u201d Others had left to pursue higher education in the West, he added.",
      "More recently, the country has been rocked by the spillover of Israel's war in Gaza and also the war between Israel and the Lebanese Shia Muslim militant group Hezbollah until a fragile ceasefire was brokered around a year ago.",
      "But just a week before Leo landed in Beirut, an Israeli airstrike on the city killed Haytham Ali Tabatabai, a senior Hezbollah commander, and four other people, while injuring 28 more.",
      "Elsewhere, some Syrian Christians have left their country amid concerns about the new government under interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa, former leader of the Islamist insurgent group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. In June, an unprecedented terrorist attack in Damascus on the Greek Orthodox Mar Elias Church during Mass killed at least 30 people and injured 54.",
      "Large numbers had already fled the country, as well as neighboring Iraq, after the Islamic State militant group, or ISIS, declared a caliphate.",
      "In Gaza, the small surviving Christian community has seen churches shelled and worshippers killed during Israel\u2019s war with Hamas, while in the occupied West Bank, Christian communities have been targeted by Israeli settlers and the economy has suffered as tourists' numbers have dropped dramatically.",
      "While Lebanese Christians have lived in relative peace in the Muslim-majority country, the country\u2019s dire economic situation has led many to seek a new life abroad.",
      "\u201cNo one wants to leave their home, especially if their home has been passed down for thousands of years and people have fought for that home to stay there. But we also want to live here with dignity,\u201d Giovanni Lteif, 21, told NBC News in an interview Saturday.",
      "Together with his twin, Charbel Lteif, he has set up \u201cEastern Christians\u201d pages on social media, which have racked up almost 700,000 followers.",
      "\u201cOne of the biggest problems we are facing is how many Christians have left,\u201d Charbel Lteif said, adding that with their videos they were trying to raise awareness and preserve their culture and traditions by creating \u201ca new voice for the Christians in the Middle East and North Africa, a voice that is not political, a voice that is not for anyone\u2019s agenda, a voice that is from the Christians of the East to the whole world.\u201d",
      "Charbel Lteif said churches were \u201cstill very alive,\u201d in Lebanon which has the largest percentage of Christians in the Middle East, making up over a third of the population.",
      "A power sharing agreement has been in place since Lebanon gained independence from France in 1943 in which the president is a Maronite Christian, the parliament speaker is a Shia Muslim and the prime minister is a Sunni Muslim.",
      "This makes Lebanon the only Arab country with a Christian head of state, a tradition that continued earlier this year when President Joseph Aoun, Prime Minister Nawaf Salam and a Cabinet were elected on reformist platforms and vowed to hold those behind the port explosion to account.",
      "Five years on from the blast, no official has been convicted, and years of obstructions by top officials have stalled an investigation and hampered hopes for justice.",
      "With no centralized effort by the Lebanese government to rebuild the surrounding neighborhoods, many families and business owners used their own money to fix their properties or reached out to charities and grassroots initiatives.",
      "At St. Anthony of Padua, Abboud remained hopeful that it would be restored to its former glory.",
      "\u201cWhen the church is closed, it means we\u2019ve lost a piece of our region,\u201d he said. \u201cI say this as a Christian who truly believes we have a mission with our Muslim brothers: a mission of dialogue, a mission of coexistence, of making peace.\u201d"

      "\u201cIt\u2019s crucial to understand why measles matters,\u201d said Dr. Kate O\u2019Brien, director of the WHO\u2019s Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals. \u201cIts high transmissibility means that even small drops in vaccine coverage can trigger outbreaks, like a fire alarm going off when smoke is detected first.\u201d",
      "That is, measles is often the first disease to pop up when vaccination rates overall drop.",
      "\"When we see measles cases, it signals that gaps are almost certainly likely for other vaccine-preventable diseases like diphtheria or whooping cough or polio, even though they may not be setting off the fire alarm just yet,\" O'Brien said at a media briefing Monday, ahead of the release of the WHO's Progress Toward Measles Elimination report, published Friday in its Weekly Epidemiological Record.",
      "Indeed, whooping cough cases are also rising in the United States and are on track to be the most in a decade. More than 20,000 whooping cough cases have been reported so far in 2025, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "In 2024, there were an estimated 11 million measles infections worldwide, according to the report, nearly 800,000 more than were recorded in 2019.",
      "Last year, 59 countries reported large measles outbreaks. In 2025, the United States joined the list of countries.",
      "Elimination status threatened",

      "Elimination means a virus has stopped spreading in a specific country or region. (Only one virus \u2014 smallpox \u2014 has been eradicated, or wiped out permanently, worldwide.)",
      "In total, 81 countries had reached elimination status in 2024, according to the WHO. Canada eliminated measles in 1998. Two years later, the United States did the same.",
      "Elimination status means a country has the capacity to stop an outbreak when measles cases arrive from abroad, O'Brien said. If vaccination rates are high enough, the virus won't have enough unvaccinated people to infect, halting an outbreak in its tracks.",
      "But vaccination rates in the United States are falling: An NBC News investigation revealed that since 2019, 77% of counties and jurisdictions have reported declines in the number of kids getting routine childhood vaccinations like the measles-mumps-rubella shots.",
      "The key determining factor for a country to lose its measles elimination status is the ongoing spread of the same strain of the virus for a full year.",
      "Canada met that threshold this month. The United States could be next if scientists can trace current cases to a Texas outbreak that began in January.",
      "Nearly all of the samples analyzed from those early cases were identified as a genotype of measles called D8, according to a CDC report published in April.",

While the bulk of those cases are linked to the cluster at the Utah-Arizona border, case numbers are also rising near Salt Lake City.

He has also called for Ukraine to be \u201cdemilitarized,\u201d essentially rendering it defenseless, and a final peace settlement to be acknowledged in international law.",
      "\u201cThere are three pillars on which we will not compromise,\u201d a Russian official briefed on the matter said on condition of anonymity. \u201cOne is the territory of the Donbas. The second is a limit on Ukraine\u2019s armed forces. The third is the recognition of territory by America and Europe.\u201d",
      "Moscow is prepared to be flexible on certain secondary issues, the official said this week, like hundreds of billions in Russian assets frozen in Europe at the beginning of the war. Ukraine and its European allies have called for the funds to be used to boost Ukraine\u2019s shattered economy.",
      "Trump\u2019s peace plan envisions that roughly one-third of the frozen assets, or $100 billion, would be invested in the U.S.-led efforts to rebuild Ukraine. According to the original leaked 28-point plan, the U.S. would receive 50% of the profits from the venture. No specific details have been released about the plan that was whittled down to 20 points during Sunday\u2019s talks between U.S. and Ukrainian officials in Florida.",
      "Abbas Gallyamov, a Russian political analyst and former Putin speechwriter, told NBC News he thinks Putin could be willing to compromise.",
      "\u201cThe most important thing you need to understand is he can\u2019t afford to fall out with Trump. It would be quite suicidal,\u201d Gallyamov said. And while the war has not devastated the Russian economy, in the long term Putin understands that ramped-up sanctions by Trump would make economic recovery very difficult, if not impossible, he said.",
      "\u201cIf Trump will really press him, Putin will agree to end the fighting \u2014 maybe with the calculation that he will build up strength, quickly organize some sort of provocation in the spring to blame on the Ukrainians and hit again,\u201d Gallyamov said.",
      "A lot depends on what the Americans demand, Gallyamov said, adding that Putin may be willing to agree to a ceasefire over Christmas and New Year\u2019s.",
      "But Putin is unlikely to truly end the war without intense pressure from the U.S., he said.",
      "What could Putin accept?",
      "Witkoff and Kushner arrived in Moscow fresh from talks with Ukraine in Florida this weekend, which both Washington and Kyiv deemed productive, without sharing details.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the last chance for Russia to convince Witkoff, and Witkoff must convince Trump that the Russian view is the correct one,\u201d said Andrei Fedorov, Russia\u2019s former deputy foreign minister.",
      "Putin has signaled for months, even before the diplomatic flurry caused by Trump\u2019s 28-point proposal, that he was willing to continue fighting.",
      "In September, he said he welcomed \u201ca certain light at the end of the tunnel\u201d in the wake of Trump\u2019s peace efforts in Alaska. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how the situation develops,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cIf not, we\u2019ll have to resolve all the challenges we face militarily.\u201d",
      "He reiterated that last week, saying fighting would stop when Ukrainian troops withdraw from the territories they hold. \u201cIf they don\u2019t withdraw, we will achieve this by force,\u201d he said.",
      "The leaked 28-point plan would force Ukraine to cede territory, including land it holds in the Donetsk region. It would limit the Ukrainian army to 600,000, down from more than 800,000 currently. It would also bar Ukraine from ever joining the NATO defense alliance \u2014 which Kyiv has said is a nonstarter.",
      "But according to Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, a Berlin-based think tank, even the leaked plan did not go far enough for Putin.",
      "The 600,000-personnel limit the plan would impose on the Ukrainian army is one sticking point, she wrote in an analysis last week. It would still leave Kyiv with the largest army in Europe.",
      "The draft plan also did not include a total ban on long-range weapons in Ukraine, she added.",
      "The wording is also important for Putin, Stanovaya said. Putin indicated last week that he would want every word of any peace agreement to be carefully weighed, having mocked the language of the original proposal as undiplomatic and, at times, \u201cridiculous.\u201d",
      "If he could write his own version of the peace plan, Horowitz said, Putin would legally claim all four Ukrainian provinces he illegally annexed in 2022, not just Donetsk and Luhansk; reduce Ukraine\u2019s army to one-tenth of its current size; complete the so-called denazification of Ukraine, which is code for a Russian say in Ukraine\u2019s future and removal of nationalist parties; and lift all sanctions.",
      "While Putin does not necessarily think those demands would be achievable, Horowitz said, he thinks the final deal should be closer to his ideal peace than that of Ukraine's \u2014 and he is prepared to wait if that\u2019s not the case.",
      "\u201cThe problem, of course, is that this \u2018ideal deal\u2019 means Russia will be encouraged to invade Ukraine again \u2014 beyond what it already occupies,\u201d he added.",
      "Keir Simmons and Natasha Lebedeva reported from Moscow, and Yuliya Talmazan from London."

      "Beforehand, Putin called Europe's attempts to influence the U.S.-led peace talks \"absolutely unacceptable\" and said that while he did not want war with Europe, Russia was ready for one if necessary. Sidelined European powers were meeting Wednesday at a NATO summit in Belgium, though Secretary of State Marco Rubio took the rare step of skipping the summit altogether.",
      "Putin's foreign adviser Yuri Ushakov called Tuesday's meeting \u201cvery useful, constructive\u201d but that the sides agreed not to get into details about the negotiations.",
      "Russian officials had reviewed a number of documents presented by the American delegation, and that some proposals \"seem more-or-less acceptable, but they need to be discussed,\" Ushakov said.",
      "Asked whether an end to the conflict was closer than before, Ushakov replied: \u201cNo further, that\u2019s for sure. But there\u2019s still a lot of work to be done, both in Washington and Moscow.\"",
      "Putin\u2019s special envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, posted a single word on X after the meeting: \u201cProductive.\u201d",

It would have forced Kyiv to cede its territories to Moscow, including the land that it currently controls. It would have limited the size of Kyiv\u2019s army and barred Ukraine from ever joining NATO.",
      "The proposal blindsided Kyiv, which launched a storm of negotiations in Europe and the U.S. to try to amend the plan and make it more palatable to Ukraine.",
      "It comes as Zelenskyy\u2019s government is on the back foot on the battlefield, while rocked by a major corruption scandal. His powerful chief of staff and top negotiator, Andriy Yermak, resigned last week after being implicated in the probe.",
      "Shortly before his scheduled meeting with the American delegation, Putin addressed an investment forum where he said his army held the advantage in Ukraine, while criticizing European leaders for hindering the peace process.",
      "Russia has no intention of going to war with European countries, but if Europe starts a war, Russia is ready \u201cright now,\u201d Putin told reporters. \"If Europe suddenly wants to start a war with us and does, then we could quickly get a situation in which we have no one to negotiate with.\u201d",
      "Putin invaded Ukraine in February 2022 in what has become Europe\u2019s largest conflict since World War II.

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The White House confirmed Monday that the U.S. did launch a second strike on an alleged drug boat from Venezuela in early September and that it was ordered by Adm. Frank M. Bradley, who at the time headed the Joint Special Operations Command.",
      "The follow-up strike killed the survivors of an initial U.S. strike on the vessel, which the Trump administration has said originated from Venezuela. Some lawmakers and legal experts say that second attack could constitute a war crime.",
      "\u201cWith respect to the strikes in question on Sept. 2, Secretary Hegseth authorized Adm. Bradley to conduct these kinetic strikes,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement during Monday's briefing.",
      "\u201cAdm. Bradley worked well within his authority and the law directing the engagement to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States of America was eliminated,\" she added.",
      "U.S. Special Operations Command, which Bradley now leads as commander, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Washington Post reported that Bradley had ordered the second strike, and that he was complying with an order from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to \u201ckill everybody.\u201d NBC News has not confirmed the detail about Hegseth.",
      "One U.S. official and a source familiar with the Pentagon\u2019s actions on Sept. 2 told NBC News recently that the first of the two strikes conducted that day left at least two survivors, with the subsequent strike killing them.",
      "Hegseth, in a social media post Monday night, also indicated that Bradley ordered the second strike. \"Let\u2019s make one thing crystal clear: Admiral Mitch Bradley is an American hero, a true professional, and has my 100% support. I stand by him and the combat decisions he has made \u2014 on the September 2 mission and all others since.\"",
      "On Sunday, President Donald Trump told reporters that Hegseth didn't order the second strike.",
      "\"He said he didn't do it,\" said Trump, who also said he didn't know if the second strike even happened. The president said he \"wouldn't have wanted\" it, adding that \"Pete said he did not want them.\" Asked again if there was no second strike, Trump said: \"I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m going to find out about it, but Pete said he did not order the death of those two men.\"",
      "Asked Monday what law the U.S. military relied on to justify the second strike, Leavitt said: \u201cThe strike conducted on Sept. 2 was conducted in self-defense to protect Americans in vital United States interests. The strike was conducted in international waters and in accordance with the law of armed conflict.\u201d",
      "She also confirmed that Trump would be meeting with his national security team \u2014 which includes Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller \u2014 in the Oval Office later Monday. A senior White House official confirmed Monday night that the meeting had wrapped.",
      "Leavitt's comments come amid widespread criticism and bipartisan investigations in the House and Senate into the second boat strike. The leaders of the Senate Armed Services Committee \u2014 chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and ranking member Jack Reed, D-R.I. \u2014 said in a statement Friday that they will be \"conducting vigorous oversight to determine the facts related to these circumstances.\"",
      "Similarly, the leaders of the House Armed Services Committee \u2014 chairman Mike Rogers, R-Ala., and ranking member Adam Smith, D-Wash. \u2014 said they were taking \"seriously the reports of follow-on strikes on boats alleged to be ferrying narcotics in the SOUTHCOM region and are taking bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question.\"",
      "Smith told reporters Monday night that he would be receiving a classified briefing this week from Bradley about the strikes. He added that it would be \"helpful\" to have Hegseth testify.",
      "The details of the briefing with Bradley are still being worked out, Smith said, but he indicated that they are aiming for it to take place Thursday.",
      "Bradley is expected to be in Washington this week to speak with senior lawmakers about the strikes, according to two people familiar with the matter.",
      "Wicker, who also said he will be speaking with Bradley, said Monday that he has spoken with Hegseth about the second strike. The defense secretary is also expected to have spoken or is soon speaking with other lawmakers, according to two other people familiar with matter.",
      "Wicker and Smith both said they have spoken with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dan Caine.",
      "A spokesperson for the Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.",
      "Hegseth has defended the numerous U.S. strikes in the Caribbean, saying in a post on X Friday after The Washington Post article was published that \"these highly effective strikes are specifically intended to be 'lethal, kinetic strikes.'\"",
      "\"Our current operations in the Caribbean are lawful under both U.S. and international law, with all actions in compliance with the law of armed conflict \u2014 and approved by the best military and civilian lawyers, up and down the chain of command,\" he wrote.",
      "Hegseth received backlash on social media after he posted on his personal X account what appeared to be an AI-generated image of the children's book character Franklin, with the title, \"Franklin targets Narco Terrorists.\" It shows Franklin, a turtle, standing on the edge of a helicopter aiming a machine gun at boats allegedly carrying drugs.",
      "The strikes in the Caribbean are part of an escalating pressure campaign the Trump administration is waging against Venezuela. Trump declared in a Truth Social post Saturday that Venezuela's airspace should be considered \"closed,\" which came as the U.S. is considering military action against the South American nation."

      "Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff was set to travel to Moscow to meet with Putin on Tuesday, the Kremlin said, after what the United States described as \u201cvery productive\u201d talks Sunday with Ukraine.",
      "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was rallying European support in Paris, though he cautioned that some \u201ctough issues\u201d still have to be worked out with Washington.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin signaled last week that he was ready to have a \u201cserious\u201d conversation after Kyiv and its allies demanded changes to the peace plan but has shown little sign of stepping away from his hard-line demands that formed the basis of the original 28-point proposal backed by Trump.",
      "Before that, Witkoff, Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Secretary of State Marco Rubio met in Florida with a delegation from Ukraine, which has been damaged by the removal of its top negotiator in a corruption scandal.",
      "\u201cSo much work remains,\u201d Rubio told reporters after meeting with Kyiv\u2019s team, now led by Rustem Umerov, a senior official and former defense minister. \u201cBut today was again a very productive and useful session where I think additional progress was made,\u201d Rubio said.",

      "Neither Rubio nor Umerov gave specifics of what was discussed.",
      "Speaking to reporters on board Air Force One late Sunday, Trump said Ukraine's \"corruption situation\" amid the peace negotiations was \"not helpful.\" Asked if it was impeding talks, he said there was a \"good chance we could make a deal.\"",
      "Zelenskyy called the talks \u201cvery constructive\u201d in a post on X on Monday but added: \u201cThere are some tough issues that still have to be worked through.\u201d",
      "He was on a diplomatic offensive in Europe, meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron.",
      "\"The main focus was on negotiations to end the war and on security guarantees,\" Zelenskyy said after the meeting. \"Peace must become truly durable.\"",
      "He later said that he spoke with Witkoff, alongside Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, adding that it was an \"important briefing, and we agreed to discuss more details in person.\" He then spoke with a host of European leaders to discuss the U.S. talks and security guarantees, he said.",
      "It could be a pivotal week for diplomacy, said Kaja Kallas, the European Union\u2019s foreign affairs chief.",
      "\"It is clear that Russia does not want peace, and therefore we need to make Ukraine as strong as possible in order then to be ready to stand up for themselves in this very, very difficult time,\" Kallas told reporters Monday.",
      "The talks in Florida follow last weekend\u2019s agreements in Geneva, where Trump's original 28-point peace plan to end the war was modified to make it more palatable to Ukraine and its backers in Europe.",
      "It was initially widely seen as catering to Moscow's demands, without forcing it make any substantial concessions.",
      "Putin said last week he had received this version and it could serve as a framework for a final peace deal. However, he also indicated that he was not keen to negotiate with the current \u201cillegitimate\u201d Ukrainian government.",
      "He said fighting would only stop when Ukrainian troops withdraw from the territories they hold, showing little sign of compromise on the core issue of Ukrainian territorial concessions centered on the eastern Donbas region.",
      "\u201cIf they don\u2019t withdraw, we will achieve this by force,\u201d Putin said."

      "Hong Kong\u2019s Secretary for Security Chris Tang told reporters Friday that preliminary findings suggested the fire started in netting surrounding the lower floors of Wang Cheong House, one of the seven affected towers in the Wang Fuk Court complex.",
      "Styrofoam on the windows, which was \u201chighly flammable,\u201d fueled the blaze and caused it to spread rapidly upward, extending to six more buildings. The flames shattered glass and penetrated interiors, burning both inside and outside the structures simultaneously, he said.",

      "Netanyahu is facing charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases. Prosecutors have alleged that he exchanged regulatory favors with media owners in Israel seeking positive press coverage.",
      "He has also been accused of accepting gifts \u2014 including cigars and champagne \u2014 in exchange for advancing the personal interests of Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan and Australian billionaire James Packer.

      "Under Israel\u2019s Basic Law, the country\u2019s president has the power to pardon criminals or reduce their sentence.

      "Andriy Yermak, an ever-present figure at President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s side throughout the war with Russia, resigned as chief of staff on Friday after an anti-corruption raid at his home, injecting fresh uncertainty for Ukraine\u2019s leadership.",
      "The exit leaves a vacuum around Zelenskyy as talks accelerate, isolating the Ukrainian president at a critical moment and creating an opening Moscow may try to exploit, analysts say.",
      "The development capped a dramatic week, which began with Kyiv under intense pressure from President Donald Trump to endorse a plan that aligned with Moscow\u2019s hard-line demands. An initial deadline of Thursday, imposed by the White House, passed without any announcement as Ukraine and its allies pushed back against calls for the country to cede territory.",

      "Yermak\u2019s resignation comes at a \u201cvery bad time, because we\u2019re really at a possible tipping point where you know what Ukraine is demanding may not be granted or taken into consideration,\u201d Michael Bociurkiw, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center, told NBC News by phone on Saturday.",
      "\u201cNone of us really know what Zelenskyy is like operating solo, because he never has,\u201d he said, adding that Yermak has \u201cbasically stood in\u201d for Zelenskyy at times.",

      "Bociurkiw added that Yermak\u2019s departure would be unlikely to change Ukraine\u2019s firm stance on territorial concessions, but that Russia \u201cwill try to manipulate and take advantage of this vacuum.\u201d",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Witkoff and the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, were due to attend Sunday\u2019s talks, a U.S. official told NBC News.",
      "Michael A. Horowitz, a Jerusalem-based geopolitical consultant, echoed Bociurkiw\u2019s concerns, saying that Yermak\u2019s resignation, just days before major U.S.-Ukraine-Russia talks and a potential Trump-Putin summit, \u201cdisrupts Kyiv\u2019s preparations and invites counterparts to probe whether Ukraine\u2019s red lines on territory and NATO can be eased during the transition.\u201d",
      "But in the long term, Horowitz told NBC News on Saturday, Yermak\u2019s departure could even be a positive.",
      "Critics have said for years that Yermak had accumulated too much power and wielded excessive influence over Zelenskyy. A constant presence by the president\u2019s side through the ups and downs of the war, Yermak had emerged as one of the few men that the Ukrainian leader appeared to really trust.",
      "Zelenskyy has previously railed against corrupt officials, but signs that a corruption scandal may have stretched into his inner circle may provide more ammunition to critics of further support for Ukraine. Trump-aligned figures, including Vice President JD Vance, have previously criticized Ukraine for its issues with corruption.",
      "Yermak\u2019s departure may \u201creinforce skepticism within the Trump administration\u201d about Zelenskyy\u2019s inner circle, giving them further reasons to push for concessions, said Natia Seskuria, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank.",
      "But Horowitz said the resignation \u201cremoves a lightning rod for controversy and gives Kyiv a cleaner, more collective mandate to say no to an unfair and unsustainable peace,\u201d adding: \u201cZelenskyy is getting his house in order.\u201d",
      "When it comes to how the rule of law is being enforced in Ukraine, \u201cgenerally this is a good sign,\u201d said Moritz Brake, a senior fellow at the Center for Advanced Security, Strategic and Integration Studies.",
      "\u201cOf course, it\u2019s bad enough that these accusations existed in the first place,\u201d he added, but \u201ceven those in the highest places are prosecuted when suspicions arise.\u201d",

      "The shocking development capped a dramatic week, which began with Kyiv under intense pressure from President Donald Trump to endorse a plan that initially offered Moscow its core hard-line demands.",
      "Ukrainian negotiators, led by Yermak, secured changes, and Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff will now head to Russia for talks next week."

      "President Donald Trump said Thursday that he will \u201cpermanently pause\u201d all immigration from what he called \u201cthird world countries\u201d and demanded a program of \u201creverse migration\u201d as he intensified his rhetoric after the National Guard shooting in Washington, D.C.",
      "Trump offered few details as he disparaged and vowed to remove millions of migrants in the U.S. in a lengthy social media post late on Thanksgiving that came hours after he confirmed the death of National Guard soldier Sarah Beckstrom, 20, in the shooting.",
      "Officials have said that Wednesday\u2019s attack on two troops was  carried out by an Afghan national who worked with a CIA-backed group during the long war in Afghanistan. The incident has served as a catalyst for Trump to escalate his anti-immigrant rhetoric into pledges that would likely face court challenges if enacted and further undermine America\u2019s global standing as a nation welcoming to immigrants.",
      "\u201cI will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover, terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions, including those signed by Sleepy Joe Biden\u2019s Autopen, and remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "On Friday, the State Department took the first step: stopping issuance of U.S. visas for all Afghan nationals.",
      "\"The Department of State has IMMEDIATELY paused visa issuance for individuals traveling on Afghan passports,\" the State Department said in a post on X. \"The Department is taking all necessary steps to protect U.S. national security and public safety.\"",
      "Additionally, Joseph Edlow, the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said on X that \"USCIS has halted all asylum decisions until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.\"",
      "It was not clear exactly which other countries Trump was referring to, with the phrasing used in the past to refer to poorer nations. The Department of Homeland Security referred a reporter from the Reuters news agency to the 19 countries listed in a travel ban in June, mainly in Africa and the Middle East.",
      "The comments drew swift criticism from two U.N. agencies, which on Friday urged the U.S. to continue to accept asylum-seekers.",
      "The president also threatened to \u201cend all federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens of our country\u201d and to \u201cdenaturalize migrants who undermine domestic security.\u201d",
      "In remarks that will cause alarm among migrant advocacy and civil liberties groups, Trump said the government would deport any foreign national who was \u201cnon-compatible with Western Civilization.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cOnly REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration also said Thursday that the government would re-examine the status of green card holders from 19 countries \u201cof concern,\u201d including Afghanistan.",
      "In a subsequent post, Trump said that \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of Somali migrants were \u201ccompletely taking over the once great state of Minnesota.\u201d",
      "Trump has previously threatened action against Somalis and last week said he would end temporary protected status \u2014 which prevents deportations to dangerous countries \u2014 for Somali migrants in Minnesota, many of whom have fled a brutal civil war in the East African country.",
      "It\u2019s unclear how many people this would affect, but a report made for Congress in August put the number of people covered by the program nationally at 705. The president also attacked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as \u201cretarded\u201d and said Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., who was born in Somalia, \u201cprobably came into the U.S.A. illegally\u201d and is from a \u201cdecadent, backward, and crime ridden nation.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s threats, if enacted by legislation or executive orders, are likely to be challenged in the courts. In his first term, Trump banned people from several majority-Muslim countries in the Middle East and Africa from entering the U.S. This was challenged, but eventually the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in favor of the ban\u2019s legality.",
      "Migrant advocacy groups have called for calm and warned against using the D.C. attack to call for a wider crackdown on immigration or to remove the rights of Afghan residents.",
      "\u201cUsing this horrific attack as an excuse to smear and punish every Afghan, every refugee, or every immigrant rips at something very basic in our Constitution and many faiths: the idea that guilt is personal, not inherited or collective,\u201d the Council on American-Islamic Relations said in a statement early Friday.",
      "U.N. human rights office spokesperson Jeremy Laurence said at a Geneva press briefing: \u201cThey are entitled to protection under international law, and that should be given due process.\u201d",
      "U.N. refugee agency spokesperson Eujin Byun said: \u201cWhen people who need protection arrive in their territory, they have to have a due process of asylum. And then they have to have access to territory,\u201d she said, adding that the overwhelming majority of refugees are law-abiding members of the host community.",
      "The term \u201cthird world\u201d originated in the Cold War era to describe a country that wasn\u2019t aligned with the western NATO alliance or the USSR and the Warsaw Pact. This later evolved into shorthand for describing economically underdeveloped nations, particularly ones with high levels of poverty.",
      "The term has been used to describe several African nations, but until the late 20th century was also attached to descriptions of China.",
      "Economists and health experts have for years said the phrase is inaccurate, derogatory and outdated. The World Bank and other global institutions no longer use the phrase and some have suggested also avoiding its successor, \u201cdeveloping countries.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The rolling plains of Kenya\u2019s Maasai Mara and the millions of animals that live there face a shiny new intrusion: a gleaming Ritz-Carlton safari camp.",
      "With private plunge pools, butler service and panoramic views commanding more than $5,000 a night, the 20-hectare lodge has become a luxury lightning rod for controversy.",
      "Leaders of the Maasai \u2014 an ethnic group of traditionally nomadic herders with ancestral ties to the area \u2014 and conservationists warn the new tourist destination threatens a migration corridor vital to the movement of vast numbers of animals and have filed a lawsuit to halt its operations.",
      "What's at stake, they argue, is not just a new lodge, but the accelerating pressures of tourism on wildlife, biodiversity and the very spectacle that draws these tourists in the first place.",
      "The camp opened on Aug. 15 during the height of the Great Migration, where millions of wildebeest, zebras and other grazing animals move back and forth between the Serengeti plains in Tanzania and the Maasai Mara National Reserve (MMNR) in Kenya, a process that researchers say allows animals to find food and water and maintain genetic diversity among herds.",
      "Tourists have long flocked to the savannah by the hundreds of thousands, hoping to witness one of the largest movements of mammals in the world, as herds cross rivers and plains teeming with predators.",
      "But the new camp, which boasts \u201cfront-row seats to one of the world's greatest natural wonders\u201d on its website, may threaten the migration that visitors come to witness, conservations and Maasai leaders say.",
      "The Ritz-Carlton camp, on a bend in the Sand River, sits on \u201cone of the most favored corridors for these animals,\u201d Maasai elder Meitamei Olol Dapash told NBC News in an interview Sunday.",
      "\u201cAny guide will tell you, that is the crossing they use,\u201d said Dapash, who filed a lawsuit in August in a Kenyan court against Ritz-Carlton's owner, Marriott International, the world\u2019s largest hotel chain, as well as the project\u2019s local owner and operator, Lazizi Mara Limited, and Kenyan authorities.",
      "Dapash, executive director of the Institute for Maasai Education, Research and Conservation (MERC), who has a PhD in Sustainability Education from Prescott College in Arizona, alleges in the lawsuit that the 20-suite camp obstructs the crucial migration corridor and is asking the court to restore the land to its original condition.",
      "He told NBC News in an interview there had been instances of wildebeest turning back to avoid the camp and that an elephant was seen struggling to find a path across the river after using the location for more than a decade.",
      "\u201cAttachment to the land and to the wildlife exists up to this very day,\u201d Dapash said, adding that the Maasai had seen populations dwindling. The new camp, he added, \u201cwas the last straw for us, we just didn\u2019t want to let this happen.\u201d",
      "The Kenya Wildlife Service government agency pushed back at claims the lodge has impacted wildebeest migration, citing monitoring data that it says shows it does not \u201cfall within, obstruct, or interfere with any wildebeest migration corridors\u201d and adding that migrating wildebeest \u201care using the entire breadth of the Kenya-Tanzania border.\u201d",
      "It said that \"all ecological, environmental and regulatory requirements were thoroughly met and validated.\"",
      "Marriott International told NBC News that the development underwent an environmental impact assessment (EIA) \u201cin full compliance with\u201d Kenya's environmental protections.",
      "The company said it is committed to \u201cthe principles of responsible tourism\u201d but declined to comment on Dapash's claims that the Ritz-Carlton blocked a key route for local wildlife or its own steps to mitigate the construction's impact, saying these were matters for Narok County, which manages the reserve on the Maasai\u2019s behalf.",
      "Narok County did not respond to NBC News' request for comment. In court documents seen by NBC News, the county claims that the safari camp complies with the Maasai Mara Management Plan, which imposes a moratorium on new developments amid concerns that poorly regulated tourism was stifling wildlife migration and threatening the reserve\u2019s ecosystem.",
      "Lazizi Mara Limited said the moratorium is part of the case before the court, adding: \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t\u202fwant to comment on\u202fissues\u202fthat are pending determination.\u201d",
      "Dapash told NBC News that he had \"no issue with business, but this is not just about hotel, it is about the long-term survival of the game reserve.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe feel like we are losing the land, we are losing the wildlife,\u201d he said.",
      "The lawsuit comes amid mounting concerns about the health of the 580-square-mile reserve, where tourist numbers have nearly tripled in recent decades. The Maasai Mara National Reserve reported over 300,000 tourists in 2023. In 1980, total visitor entry was 114,000.",
      "Tourism in the Mara generates an estimated $20 million annually and thousands more indirectly, according to the reserve. In 2023, tourism across the country contributed around 7% of Kenya's gross domestic product, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council.",
      "But the rapid growth in lodges and camps has sometimes clashed with conservation efforts.",
      "\u201cA hotel is never just a hotel,\u201d Dr. Chloe Buiting, a vet and wildlife researcher working in the Maasai Mara, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s infrastructure, it\u2019s roads, it\u2019s changes to the water and the resources and the use of land.\u201d",
      "Seasonal variation in the availability and quality of food forces animals to move around, said Joseph Ogutu, a Kenyan researcher at the University of Hohenheim in Germany. But he said developments like the Ritz-Carlton are having \u201ca negative effect on migration, because most of these facilities are close to rivers where animals either drink water or breed or seek refuge.\u201d",
      "Dapash's cause has also found support among experts and tourism groups.",
      "Grant Hopcraft, a professor of conservation ecology at the University of Glasgow, who has been collaring migratory wildebeest in the Serengeti-Mara since 1999, presented maps and data to the court in October showing \u201cregular cross-border movement of wildebeest\u201d at the location of the lodge, according to his affidavit.",
      "RIDE International, a U.S.-based nonprofit providing cultural exchanges and immersive tours in East Africa, has also thrown its support behind Dapash's lawsuit.",
      "The Mara has been suffering for a long time, said Riley Jon Blackwell, the company's executive director, with \u201clarge hotel chains coming in and trying to service the luxury guests who command to see the best of the best for wildlife.\u201d",
      "The Ritz-Carlton safari camp was \u201cnot surprising,\u201d he added in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s just kind of a culmination of a long time, of a direction of things leading this way.\u201d",
      "The camp holds a 2.2-star rating on Google Reviews, with many posters criticizing its environmental impact. Others have praised their stay at the park.",
      "A court is scheduled to hear the case in December.",
      "If Dapash is successful with his lawsuit, Buiting said it could \u201cset a very interesting precedent\u201d for future developments in the reserve.",
      "\u201cFrom a legal perspective, this could actually be groundbreaking, a turning point,\u201d she added."
