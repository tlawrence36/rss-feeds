      "Tonia Haddix, 56, was also ordered Thursday to serve three years of supervised release after her 46-month prison sentence ends.",
      "Haddix, who ran a primate facility the St. Louis suburb of Festus, pleaded guilty in March to two counts of perjury and one of obstructing justice.",
      "It all started nearly a decade ago, when the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals sued, saying she was keeping several chimps in \u201cconfined in cramped, virtually barren enclosures\u201d at the now-defunct Missouri Primate Foundation facility.",
      "Among the chimps was Tonka, who appeared in the 1997 movies \u201cBuddy\u201d and \u201cGeorge of the Jungle.\u201d Actor Alan Cumming, the British-born actor who starred in the movie \u201cBuddy\u201d alongside Tonka, also begged for the primate to be moved.",
      "Haddix signed a consent decree in 2020 agreeing to send four of the chimps to a Florida sanctuary. The order allowed her to keep three others, including Tonka, at a facility she was to build.",
      "But after a judge found that was not complying with the agreement, authorities arrived in 2021 and removed the remaining chimps, except for Tonka. Haddix claimed Tonka had died and that she had cremated the remains, according to court records.",
      "\u201cI wanted to keep trying to save Tonka if l could. But then he just died on his own, so there was no saving him,\u201d she said, according to court records.",
      "But Tonka was alive. In 2022, PETA removed him from a cage in the basement of her home in Sunrise Beach, Missouri, near the Lake of the Ozarks.",

In a new prequel series out Friday, called \u201cOutlander: Blood of My Blood,\u201d we see how they each got that way.",
      "\u201cBlood of My Blood\u201d tells the love story of Jamie's parents, Ellen and Brian, and Claire's parents, Julia and Henry. The characters are inspired by the stories of Diana Gabaldon but there are no novels for showrunner Matthew B. Roberts to follow. He also is the showrunner of the original series, which debuts its final season early next year.",
      "With no source material \u201cthere\u2019s a lot more room to play in,\" explained Roberts. In \u201cOutlander,\u201d \"there are all these tentpole moments that we have to write to because that\u2019s what our audience wants from the books.\u201d",
      "In the books, Gabaldon mentions Jamie's parents in \u201cbreadcrumbs\u201d said Roberts. \u201cWe stick to those, but the freedom is what can we do after that to get to essentially where 'Outlander' begins.\u201d",
      "The big obstacle facing Jamie\u2019s parents, Ellen and Brian, who meet in 18th century Scotland \u2014 is that they come from families that \u201cdon\u2019t get on,\u201d said Harriet Slater, who plays Ellen. \u201cThey don\u2019t mix.

There's the \u201ctough, stoic, Highland warrior\u201d who he says \u201crides around on horses and swings swords and stuff.\u201d Then there's this \u201clovely, gentle, poetic, romantic guy who wants nothing more than to take care of other people.\u201d",
      "A few months ago Roy went back and rewatched episodes from season one of \u201cOutlander,\u201d because he wanted to watch Heughan as his TV son.",

      "Claire's parents Julia and Henry are mentioned even less in the books. They died in a car accident when Claire was young. We see them meet in \u201cBlood of My Blood\u201d during World War I. Henry was a soldier and Julia worked in postal censorship.",
      "\u201cWhen we meet him, he\u2019s pretty much given up,\" said Jeremy Irvine, who plays Henry. \u201cI think he\u2019s accepted death really and doesn\u2019t have anything to live for and sends this one last lifeline out in the form of an open letter back to England.\u201d Julia finds his letter at work and feels compelled to respond. The two end up falling in love while writing back-and-forth.",

      "The Sunday streets of the borough of churches still vibrate with gospel chords, yet inside many of Brooklyn\u2019s storied Black sanctuaries, the choir lofts have thinned dramatically",
      "NEW YORK (RNS) \u2014 On Sunday mornings in Brooklyn, nicknamed the borough of churches, the muffled sounds of choir singers, hand\u2011claps and Hammond organs can be heard from the sidewalks. The borough still has a church on nearly every block, but over the years, the number of people in the pews has thinned.",
      "Many church choirs in the heart of Brooklyn, however, have kept singing \u2014 despite boasting fewer singers than in years past as neighborhoods face gentrification and organized religious affiliation decreases.",
      "Standing in front of the gospel choir at Concord Baptist Church of Christ in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, Jessica Howard, 25, led the gospel standard \u201cGod Is\u201d on a Sunday in July. Dressed in a powder-pink floral dress, she called out lines naming God as \u201cjoy in sorrow\u201d and \u201cstrength for tomorrow.\u201d Some choir members wiped away tears as the song stoked emotions from around the room.'",
      "As a Black Christian person, as a descendant of slaves, I think when I sing, I feel really connected to my ancestors,\u201d said Howard, who grew up in Virginia and now sings as a soloist at Concord, where she\u2019s been a congregant for six years. \u201cI really feel sometimes like it\u2019s not just me singing, it\u2019s my lineage singing.\u201d",

      "Founded in 1847, Concord Baptist Church is Brooklyn\u2019s oldest historically Black congregation. At the time, a nearby neighborhood known as Weeksville, now considered part of central Brooklyn, was the second-largest free Black community in the United States before the Civil War, said Amanda Henderson, collections historian at the Weeksville Heritage Center.",
      "Louise Nelson, a Brooklyn native and church historian of the Berean Baptist Church in Crown Heights, said music was the foundation of the early church, and that remains true for churches in the borough today.",
      "\"The songs that uplifted us and kept us going through the midst of our misery \u2014 music is who we are,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can have a church today without the music because it brings unity in that idea that we can all do it together.\u201d",
      "According to Pew Research Center data, between 2019 and 2023, Black Protestant monthly church attendance fell from 61% to 46% \u2014 the largest decline among major U.S. religious groups. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this trend, and its impact is visible in the thinning choir stands.",
      "Glenn McMillan, Concord\u2019s director of music ministry and a musicology teacher at the City University of New York, who has worked in New York City church choirs since 1994, recalls a time when historically Black churches in Brooklyn regularly had multiple choirs at each parish.",
      "\u201cIn the last 20 years, the members of church choirs started getting older because this generation does not see church as important as it was back in the day,\u201d McMillan said. The choir at Concord has shrunk from about 50 voices before the pandemic to 30 today, McMillan said. Back in 2006, the choir featured 100 voices.",
      "According to research published by covidreligionresearch.org in June, Black Protestants attended church on Zoom more than other denominations during the pandemic, and they have been the slowest to return to in\u2011person worship.",
      "\u201cThe internet has taken over and streaming has taken over,\u201d McMillan said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t goin to the building as much as they are streaming it.\u201d",
      "McMillan said that when in-person services first resumed, it took a long time for the choir to rebuild because many members were still staying home for health reasons. Recently, though, he\u2019s seen more people showing up.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m begging people my age to come to Concord,\u201d said Howard, the youngest member of the gospel choir, adding that only a handful of people around her age attend the church.",
      "Gwen Davis, a senior member of Berean Baptist Church and a choir soloist for more than 40 years, recalled Easter services in the mid\u20111960s, when over 400 people filled the pews and four separate choirs led the congregation in song.",

      "Today, Davis said, a typical service attracts approximately 150 people, and roughly 100 virtually. Over time, Berean\u2019s choirs have consolidated into a single mass choir with approximately 20 singers.",
      "A professional soloist who has been singing at different churches across Brooklyn throughout her adult life, Davis said she believes one reason for choirs thinning out is the decline of music education in New York City Public Schools.",
      "\u201cWhen I was in high school, I had music every day,\u201d said Davis, who attended high school in the 1970s in central Brooklyn. \u201cI don\u2019t think the children are learning notes and sharps and clefs. I mean, that was like general knowledge for us at the time.\u201d",
      "During the 1970s fiscal crisis, the city of New York eliminated thousands of teaching positions, including art and music teachers, and converted music rooms into other classrooms, narrowing arts access in schools in low-income and majority-Black neighborhoods.",
      "\u201cFor me, singing is not just singing, it\u2019s ministry,\u201d Davis said. \u201cSome of these old hymns were composed years and years ago, and those old hymns have sustained a people \u2014 many people.\u201d",
      "Gentrification is another force reshaping Brooklyn. Between 2010 and 2020, Crown Heights lost nearly 19,000 Black residents while gaining about 15,000 whites, according to 2020 Census data. More than 75% of Bedford-Stuyvesant residents in 2000 were Black, while in 2020, around 41% were Black.",
      "Those demographic shifts have hit historically Black Catholic parishes hard. St. Teresa of Avilain Crown Heights, which was the first church in the nation to hold Mass in Creole, will close by the end of the year. The anticipated closure demonstrates a wider pattern of Catholic churches that serve people of color closing, often attributed to declining attendance.",
      "For Mike Delouis, 38, St. Teresa\u2019s longtime cantor and a son of Haitian immigrants who was baptized at the church, the loss is personal.",
      "\u201cSinging for me is not about performance but about participation,\u201d said Delouis, who juggles three services most Sundays between St. Teresa and the Co-Cathedral of St. Joseph in Prospect Heights. \u201cSt. Augustine said singing is praying twice.\u201d",
      "Delouis is part of a group fighting to keep the parish open, hoping to preserve a piece of their history in a rapidly changing Brooklyn. \u201cEven through the process of gentrification, there are people that hear the music and they come in,\u201d he said.",
      "In June, from his place in the choir loft, Delouis heard the priest announce the church\u2019s closure. The words hit hard. \u201cIt was actually kind of hard to finish,\u201d he said. \u201cWe only had the closing hymn to do, and I thought, \u2018Oh my gosh, no \u2014 we can\u2019t let this happen.\u2019\u201d",
      "Jesteena Walters, 55, has been part of Bedford Central Presbyterian Church in Crown Heights since she was an infant. She began singing at age 6 in the junior choir, and when she turned 18, she transitioned to its Gratitude choir, which her older siblings also joined. \u201cIt was the young hip gospel choir of the church,\u201d Walters said.",
      "Today, Gratitude no longer exists in the same way. Its members are older and often reunite only for special occasions, such as singing at funerals. Over the decades, Walters has also watched the congregation itself shift demographics.",
      "\"When I first went to Bedford Central, it was primarily a white church, and so we were in the minority at the time,\u201d Walters said, referring to the early 1970s. \u201cIn the years that would come, itwas primarily a Black church.\u201d It later became home to a large West Indian population, and today includes many members of Guyanese heritage.",
      "\u201cTo be honest, I couldn\u2019t break down the history of Brooklyn in a way that says who came first,\u201d Walters said. \u201cAt the end of the day, I believe in people coming together, if we can truly connect, feel each other\u2019s pain and celebrate each other\u2019s joys.\u201d",
      "McMillan emphasized that choirs continue to play a central role in Black church life, even as congregations decline in membership. \u201cChoir singers are some of the most faithful churchgoers,\u201d McMillan said. \u201cA choir is a community within the church community, and whenever you have a really consistent and strong choir, they grow with one another.\u201d",
      "Howard said she hopes to become a choir director one day, and she credits McMillan and the gospel choir for encouraging her toward the role.",

      "Ryan Speedo Green has taken on the challenging role of Wotan in Wagner\u2019s \u201cDie Walk\u00fcre\u201d at the Santa Fe Opera House",
      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- The Jemez and Sangre de Cristo mountains had vanished into the night sky by the time Ryan Speedo Green sang his first words as Wotan in Wagner\u2019s \u201cDie Walk\u00fcre.\u201d",
      "Still, their invisible presence around the Santa Fe Opera House was a fitting backdrop, since Wagner set the scene on a high mountain ridge.",
      "And indeed the part of Wotan, one of the most demanding roles in opera for a dramatic bass-baritone, seems to inspire mountain imagery. To conductor James Gaffigan, its length and difficulty make it \u201cthe Mount Everest for this particular voice type.\u201d To Green, \u201cIt feels almost as if this is the pinnacle, the height of roles that you could portray.\u201d",
      "Now, at age 39, Green stands proudly at that pinnacle, if sometimes still shaking his head in disbelief at how far he\u2019s come.",
      "Having survived a troubled childhood that included time in juvenile detention, he found a voice teacher who believed in his gift, honed his skills through years of study and an apprenticeship at the Vienna State Opera, then sang a series of increasingly prominent roles at the Metropolitan Opera to emerge as a full-fledged star.",
      "\u201cI never thought it would happen, that my career would blow up the way it has,\u201d Green said in an interview between performances, which continue through Aug. 21.",
      "The Santa Fe performances are his first time singing \u201cDie Walk\u00fcre,\u201d the second of the four operas in Wagner\u2019s tetralogy and the one with the biggest and most daunting role for the head of the gods.",
      "It calls for a wide dramatic range \u2014 from exuberance, to despair, from fury to compassion. And the vocal challenges include a 24-minute monologue in which Wotan recapitulates the previous events in his life, and a scene at the end of a long evening for which he has to keep his voice fresh as he bids a tender farewell to his disobedient daughter Br\u00fcnnhilde, sung here by soprano Tamara Wilson.",
      "\u201cMy Wotan is still in its infancy and I can see it grow with every performance as I get it more into my blood and into my feet,\u201d Green said. \u201cI\u2019m lucky that I\u2019m getting my first whack at it at 39.\u201d",
      "Even in this first outing, his performance drew bravos from the audience and critics.",
      "\u201cGreen \u2026 portrayed the troubled god as if he had been doing it for years,\u201d wrote Harvey Steiman on Seen and Heard International. \u201cSensitive to every singer around him, he delivered one great moment after another in his rich baritone, as silky as it is powerful.\u201d",
      "Green actually made his debut as Wotan last year in a semi-staged production of \u201cDas Rheingold,\u201d the opening \u201cRing\u201d installment at the Los Angeles Philharmonic under conductor Gustavo Dudamel.",
      "\u201cFrom the moment he walked onstage, everyone sensed his God-like presence,\u201d Dudamel said in an email to the AP. \u201cWhen he sings, the colors and richness of his voice wash over you, and the sound completely surrounds you.\u201d",

      "Kristin Scott Thomas draws on her own childhood losses for her directorial debut \u201cMy Mother's Wedding.\u201d",
      "Before Kristin Scott Thomas turned 12, she lost her father and stepfather. Both were Royal Navy pilots who died in crashes. The first happened when she was 5. The second at age 11. Thomas uses these facts, a kind of origin story, as the basis for her directorial debut, \u201cMy Mother\u2019s Wedding,\u201d a comedic drama about family, trauma and getting on with it that opens in theaters Friday.",
      "Knowing that the story comes from a real place is important for the experience. It gives \u201cMy Mother\u2019s Wedding,\u201d a perfectly average film that doesn\u2019t quite land the way it should, an emotional depth that it\u2019s otherwise lacking. This is a strange shortcoming considering the caliber of the cast, including Thomas as the bride to be, and Sienna Miller, Emily Beecham and Scarlett Johansson as her daughters. But it\u2019s a cruel reminder that a good hook, talented actors, one killer monologue and a picturesque setting (in this case, the English countryside) aren\u2019t guarantees that a movie will work.",
      "In the film, the deaths may be in the distant past, but they continue to haunt Diana\u2019s (Thomas) adult daughters as she prepares to marry another. Diana\u2019s new man is not a dashing pilot, forever preserved in handsome youth. Geoffrey (James Fleet) is very gray. He likes to talk about birds, ospreys in particular, has never had children and comes with a very silly last name (Loveglove) that she plans to take. Her girls are not exactly impressed, though they\u2019ve all got their own stuff to deal with.",
      "It should be said that Johansson is indeed playing a British woman in this film, and while I don't feel qualified to comment on the nuances of her accent, all I can say is that there is a consistently strange disconnect to hear it coming out of her mouth. Johansson is a great actor who I\u2019ve believed in many wilder roles, from Marvel movies right on down to her Ellen Greene riff during \u201cSaturday Night Live\u2019s\u201d 50th anniversary show. But, somehow, she\u2019s hard to buy as Katherine Frost: A British, lesbian Royal Navy officer in a longtime relationship with a woman named Jack (played by fellow beauty Freida Pinto).",
      "Miller\u2019s character is Victoria, a Hollywood actor known for franchise dreck (no one can remember whether the latest \u201cDame Of Darkness\u201d is the fourth or fifth in the series) and short-lived relationships. And Beecham is the youngest Georgina, a nurse who suspects that her husband is having an affair. To find out, the girls hire a private detective to surveil her house and show them the footage after the wedding.",
      "It's a very busy, fraught weekend for everyone. There\u2019s lots of fretting over why Katherine won\u2019t marry Jack, and why Victoria is dancing around a relationship with a wealthy, older French man when her childhood crush still pines for her. There\u2019s lingering anxiety about their mom marrying this man who seems so unlike the two heroes that came before and much discussion about the importance of last names, marriage and making sure kids feel like they belong to someone. Some things get resolved, but it's hard to shake the feeling that everyone might need a new therapist by the end.",

      "The growth of the internet and social media in the 2000s mirrors the development of artificial intelligence today, she said.

      "Zach Cregger says he had to stop writing jokes while creating his latest horror film, \u201cWeapons,\" and instead let the hyper realistic aftermath of tragedy drive the movie's humor",
      "LOS ANGELES -- If there\u2019s one thing Zach Cregger learned while writing and directing his upcoming horror movie \u201cWeapons,\u201d it\u2019s that the best laughs won\u2019t come from the jokes he writes.",
      "The film follows Cregger\u2019s 2022 solo directorial debut \u201cBarbarians,\u201d the widely celebrated genre-bending horror. This time, the young director bends even more, spinning a town into chaos when all children but one from the same classroom mysteriously vanish, leaving a trail of questions in their place.",
      "The Warner Bros. release hits theaters Friday and is as creepy as it is hilarious \u2014 a delicate balance that required Cregger to strip any intentionality behind his humor, he told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cIf the humor is coming from an authentic reaction that a character\u2019s having, then it works,\u201d Cregger said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of jokes that didn\u2019t make it into the movie that I thought were going to be so funny. And then we did a test screening, and nobody laughed and I\u2019m like, OK, it\u2019s gotta go.\u201d",
      "Paranoia runs deep in the film. The town's heartbroken parents are represented by Josh Brolin\u2019s character, Archer, whose son was among the missing. The students\u2019 teacher, played by Julia Garner, is determined to solve the mystery, despite parents blaming her for the disappearances.",
      "The humor here comes naturally, Cregger said, as characters navigate the absurd events happening around them.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not playing for the laugh, otherwise you lose the laugh,\u201d said Brolin, whose character stumbles through his grief, a state ripe for what he called genuine and \u201cembarrassingly funny\u201d moments.",
      "If 17 kids up and ran out of their homes at 2:17 a.m. one morning with no trace, what would a community do? That question drove \u201cWeapons,\u201d painting a picture of a town left reeling by the mystery.",
      "The film setting \u2014 the fictional small town of Maybrook, Illinois \u2014 is just as integral to the plot as any of its main characters. The town feels hyper realistic, a core tenet to the movie\u2019s ability to blend humor and horror, two genres that Garner said are \u201copposite side of the same coin.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s funny because this isn\u2019t even like a proper horror film,\u201d Garner said. \u201cIt has comedic elements and has horror elements, but it\u2019s kind of its own genre, in a way.\u201d",
      "The town\u2019s reactions to tragedy and shock was intentionally meant to feel oddly realistic, Cregger said. Parents are outraged, storming into town halls and angrily demanding answers from the police, the school and, most pointedly, the students\u2019 teacher. Yet, when Garner\u2019s character is attacked in broad daylight, bystanders and store owners hardly bat an eye, a level of indifference that Cregger said is just as realistic as the parental outrage.",

      "\u201cThe weird resonance, the weird opening voice-over, the way it was written and the kind of emotional brokenness of these characters and the depth that I felt was in the writing, that was as deep as any drama I\u2019ve read in years,\u201d Ehrenreich said.",

      "The body-swappers are back",
      "It\u2019s a tale as old as time \u2014 or at least, a tale Hollywood loves to tell again and again: Body-swapping. It\u2019s magical. It\u2019s comical. It carries heartwarming messages about walking in another\u2019s shoes, and learning about oneself along the way.",
      "So it\u2019s hardly surprising that \u201cFreaky Friday,\u201d the 2003 version of the 1972 Mary Rodgers novel starring Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis, was a hit. Lohan was endearing and charismatic as an appealing, mildly turbulent teenager, and Curtis was a comic hoot as her control-freak therapist mom.",
      "And while there were a few misfires \u2014 the stereotypical Asian representation has aged badly \u2014 the film was powered by an easy chemistry between the two stars. So why not revisit the story in 2025? Sequels are often made for far less compelling reasons.",
      "The chief weakness of \u201cFreakier Friday\u201d \u2014 which brings Curtis and Lohan back for an amiable, often joyful and certainly chaotic reunion \u2014 is that while it hews overly closely to the structure, storyline and even dialogue of the original, it tries too hard to up the ante. The comedy is thus a bit more manic, and the plot machinations more overwrought (or sometimes distractingly silly).",
      "Then there's the double body-swapping. Because one major swap isn't enough, here we have two sets of swappers \u2014 a quixotic quartet of lives disrupted during the lead-up to, yes, another wedding! The problem is that sometimes, it\u2019s actually hard to keep track of who\u2019s inhabiting whom, and therefore why they're doing what.",
      "Not to say that \u201cFreakier Friday,\u201d directed with gusto by Nisha Ganatra, doesn't have moments of comic glee. I\u2019ll admit to laughing out loud \u2014 with everyone else older than 30 near me \u2014 when two teens were trying to locate an adult contact and one of them pulled up Facebook, explaining: \u201cIt\u2019s like a database of old people!\u201d Touch\u00e9, guys.",
      "These \u201cyoungsters\u201d are actually Lohan and Curtis, playing ninth-graders trapped in adult bodies. Before we get to that, though: We begin 22 years after we last saw Lohan\u2019s Anna, playing electric guitar at her mom's wedding. Now a single mom herself with a job managing a young pop star, she's trying to get her daughter up for school. Harper (the excellent Julia Butters) is \u2014 surprise! \u2014 an appealing, mildly turbulent teenager. And just like Anna two decades ago, she keeps people out of her bedroom. \u201cPrepare to be triggered!\u201d Anna yells before barging in. (The dialogue has been duly updated to the present time.)",
      "Driving to school drop-off, Anna is joined by her mom, Tess (Curtis), who has stylish gray hair now and is still a practicing therapist, podcaster and author whose latest topic is \u201cRebelling with Respect.\u201d Dropping Harper off, Anna calls out \u201cMake good choices!\u201d \u2014 just what mom Tess used to say, natch.",
      "At school, Harper butts heads with transfer student Lily (Sophia Hammons), a budding fashion designer who hails from Britain and is very snooty. Anna is called to see the principal. There, she meets Lily\u2019s dishy chef dad Eric (Manny Jacinto), and the two flirt so intensely, the principal herself makes them a dinner reservation.",
      "All it takes is one cute dating montage, and poof, Anna and Eric are engaged. But things are still bad between Harper and Lily, whose animosity triggers a weirdly violent, all-school food fight on bake sale day. But they all have a bachelorette party to attend. There, a wacky fortune-teller and barista and business-card maker \u2014 Vanessa Bayer, in a cameo that perhaps, no definitely goes on too long \u2014 reads their palms. And then the earth starts shaking.",
      "\u201cFreaky\u201d fans know what happens next. The four awaken the next morning, each inhabiting someone else. Anna is Harper. Tess is Lily. Harper is Anna. Lily is Tess. We\u2019ll be testing you on this later!",

      "Anyway, they go about their days. Lily, in Tess\u2019 body, plays pickleball awkwardly with husband Ryan (Mark Harmon is back, in a thankless part).

Meanwhile Anna and Tess, in their teen bodies, feast on junk food with impunity. \u201cI haven\u2019t eaten real dairy since the Bush administration,\u201d one says.",
      "Curtis, aka Lily, gets her best moment in a drugstore, when her hubby asks her to get supplies from the \u201csenior\u201d aisle, and she stockpiles everything from adult diapers to enemas. Lohan's at her comic best when, as Harper, she tries to flirt the way she thinks her mother would. She\u2019s flirting with Jake (Chad Michael Murray) \u2014 yes, the hunky guy from the original \u2014 and her flirting is so weird, Jake thinks she's having a stroke.",
      "It all barrels toward a conclusion that we won\u2019t spoil. Will the wedding be derailed by the efforts of Lily and Harper? Will that derailment be temporary? Will the sisters-to-be reach an understanding? Will Lohan get to play the electric guitar? Will everyone grow to appreciate each other?",

The movie's box office drop off was surprising given its strong reviews, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for the data firm Comscore.",

He fatally shot three people in the building lobby before taking an elevator to the 33rd floor, killing a fourth victim and then ending his own life, according to police.",

      "It has become such common advice that few question it. But rather than inspirational, it can feel like a burden. How do I go about finding this and what if I never do?",
      "This is \u201cpurpose anxiety\u201d \u2014 the gnawing sense that one\u2019s life should have an overarching purpose, but it\u2019s unclear how to discover it.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of commands to find purpose, but not a lot of support to find purpose,\u201d said Michael Steger, a professor at Colorado State University and director of its Center for Meaning and Purpose.",
      "The definition of purpose can be elastic. Can you have only one purpose or can you have many? Does it have to involve service to others or can it be something that consistently gives only you great pleasure and meaning?",
      "Think of purpose not as something that governs behavior but as a compass you can choose to follow, helping direct your energies toward a central life aim, says Todd Kashdan, a professor at George Mason University and founder of its Well-Being Laboratory. A sense of purpose can help \u201cclose that gap between who you are and what you ideally want to become,\u201d he said.",
      "People can lead content, meaningful lives without ever articulating a sense of purpose, he emphasized.",
      "There are many legitimate reasons for the advice given by parents, teachers, mentors and an array of online gurus that finding purpose is key to a good life. Research has shown that people who more strongly feel a sense of purpose tend to be physically and mentally healthier.",
      "But the word has become so weighty that finding a purpose has, for many, become a source of angst.",
      "The term \u201cpurpose anxiety\u201d appears to have been coined in 2014 by a University of Pennsylvania graduate student, Larissa Rainey, and caught on. Author Elizabeth Gilbert, for example, best known for her memoir \u201cEat, Pray, Love,\u201d has spoken frequently about an unhealthy obsession over a \u201cpurposeful life.\u201d It is, she said in one interview, \u201cthe formula we\u2019ve all been fed.\u201d",
      "People have always searched for life\u2019s meaning and purpose.",
      "\u201cPart of what it is to have a human consciousness is to think about our place in the universe,\u201d said Jody Day, a psychotherapist and author of \u201cLiving the Life Unexpected: How to Find Hope, Meaning and a Fulfilling Future without Children.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut a lot of the places that we\u2019ve naturally found meaning in our culture in, say, the last hundred years are falling away.\u201d",
      "Religion, for instance, often offered purpose and meaning to believers. But those who identify as religious has dropped significantly over the years (although that appears to be leveling off recently according to a 2025 survey by the Pew Research Center).",
      "Other people traditionally found purpose in ensuring that their children had a better life than they did. Many don\u2019t have confidence that will be the case anymore, Day said.",
      "As Steger said, \u201cnow we\u2019re stuck trying to do the harder thing, which is, one by one, figure out everything in the universe and how we fit.\"",

      "Sometimes a traumatic event can change or create one\u2019s purpose in life. For example, Day, the psychotherapist and author, assumed that her purpose would be to raise a family, but by her early 40s she knew she would not be able to have children",

On the ground, Kosuzu Harada\u2019s grandfather survived both attacks.",

      "During this week's commemoration of the 80th anniversaries of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki attacks, the grandchildren visited a station in Hiroshima where Yamaguchi, badly injured, boarded a train back to his hometown of Nagasaki a day after the bombing on Aug. 6, 1945.",

      "Yamaguchi was 29 when he was burned severely in the Hiroshima bombing. He was in the city on a temporary assignment as a shipbuilding engineer. After Yamaguchi arrived in Nagasaki, and was telling colleagues about the attack he had witnessed in Hiroshima, the second bomb exploded.",
      "Harada first learned about her grandfather\u2019s experience of both bombs when she interviewed him for an assignment in elementary school.",

      "Research shows mRNA vaccines saved millions of lives during the COVID-19 pandemic",
      "WASHINGTON -- So-called mRNA vaccines saved millions of lives during the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 and now scientists are using that Nobel Prize-winning technology to try to develop vaccines and treatments against a long list of diseases including cancer and cystic fibrosis.",
      "But this week, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine critic, canceled $500 million in government-funded research projects to create new mRNA vaccines against respiratory illnesses that might trigger another health emergency.",
      "That dismays infectious disease experts who note that mRNA allows faster production of shots than older vaccine-production methods, buying precious time if another pandemic were to emerge.",
      "Using older technology to target a pandemic flu strain would take 18 months to \u201cmake enough vaccine to vaccinate only about one-fourth of the world,\" said Michael Osterholm of the University of Minnesota, an expert on pandemic preparation. But using mRNA technology \u201ccould change that dramatically, such that by the end of the first year, we could vaccinate the world.\u201d",
      "Traditionally, making vaccines required growing viruses or pieces of viruses called proteins \u2014 often in giant vats of cells or, like most flu shots, in chicken eggs \u2014 and then purifying them. Injecting a small dose as a vaccine trains the body how to recognize when a real infection hits so it's ready to fight back.",
      "But that technology takes a long time. Using mRNA is a faster process.",
      "The \u201cm\u201d stands for messenger, meaning mRNA carries instructions for our bodies to make proteins. Scientists figured out how to harness that natural process by making mRNA in a lab.",
      "They take a snippet of that genetic code that carries instructions for making the protein they want the vaccine to target. Injecting that snippet instructs the body to become its own mini-vaccine factory, making enough copies of the protein for the immune system to recognize and react.",
      "Years of research show protection from COVID-19 vaccines \u2014 both the types made with mRNA and a type made with traditional technology \u2014 does wane over time. The vaccinations provide the strongest protection against severe infection and death, even if people still become infected.",

      "Today's COVID-19 vaccines made with mRNA by Pfizer and Moderna can be updated more quickly each year than traditional types, an advantage that now has multiple companies developing other vaccines using the technology.",
      "Osterholm counts about 15 infectious disease vaccines that could benefit from mRNA technology, but that's not the only potential. Many disease therapies take aim at proteins, making mRNA a potential technique for developing new treatments. Researchers already are testing an mRNA-based therapeutic vaccine for pancreatic cancer. Genetic diseases are another target, such as an experimental inhaled therapy for cystic fibrosis.",

      "Three new studies highlight the severe health impacts of recent wildfires on Maui and in Los Angeles",
      "NEW YORK -- The toll of wildfires is usually counted in acres burnt, property destroyed and lives lost to smoke and flames. But three studies published Wednesday suggest the cost to human health from the Maui and Los Angeles wildfires was substantially higher.",
      "Two of the papers explore what happened after the Hawaii fire in August 2023 \u2014 one of the deadliest U.S. wildfires in a century. A third looks at the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year.",
      "The Maui fire was directly blamed for more than 100 deaths. But it also left 1 in 5 with lung damage and as many as half with symptoms of depression, the new research found. The month of the fire saw 13 suicide and overdose deaths, translating to nearly double the normal suicide and overdose death rates.",
      "The study of the Los Angeles fires concluded that in addition to at least 30 deaths attributed to the fire, more than 400 other deaths could be blamed on the event, due to interruptions in health care and other factors.",
      "The studies, published in two American Medical Association journals, add \"a really important piece to the understanding of the true health risks from these extreme climatic events,\u201d said Dr. Jonathan Patz, a University of Wisconsin environmental public health researcher who was not involved in the papers.",
      "The results conform with existing understanding of the effects of extreme weather events, some experts said.",
      "How to track the indirect impacts of disastrous events has been a continuing subject of academic research and even legislative proposals. There have been estimates of deaths caused by extreme heat, as well as research into the large-scale toll of wildfires driven by climate change.",
      "\u201cBut this hones in, especially on (specific) fires,\u201d Patz said.",
      "One of the studies, co-led by Ruben Juarez of the University of Hawaii, looked at more than 1,100 adults six to 14 months after the Maui fire. It found lower lung function in people in areas close to the fire compared with those in lower-exposure areas. Overall, about 22% had below-normal lung function.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a stark reminder that wildfires can leave an invisible but lasting scar on respiratory health, long after the flames are gone,\u201d Juarez said, in an email, noting that this Friday marks the two-year anniversary of the fire.",
      "Patz called the finding \u201can important new contribution.\u201d",
      "Kristie Ebi of the University of Washington echoed that, noting that there is a growing understanding that wildfire smoke can be more toxic than standard air pollution.",

      "She said the study suggests \u201cthis toxicity is affecting people's long-term lung function.\u201d",
      "Of course, the researchers don't know exactly how much smoke each person was exposed to, and other studies would need to be done to explore cause-and-effect, she added.",
      "The study also found 40% saying their health had declined since the fires, with close to half talking about increased fatigue and weakness, eye irritation and lung-related symptoms.",
      "Jonathan Purtle of New York University was the lead author of another study, which calculated rates of suicide and overdose deaths in Maui and Hawaii's four other counties. That research team found a 97% increase in suicides and overdose death rates on Maui during the month of the wildfires. The total number of suicide and overdose deaths was 13 that month \u2014 most of them suicides. That's a significant increase, Ebi said.",
      "They also found a 46% increase in such deaths in all five counties, which may have been influenced by displaced Maui residents migrating to other islands, the authors said.",
      "The increases did not last: Rates fells in the following months, the researchers found.",
      "The third study was led by researchers in Finland. They used mathematical modeling to estimate that there were 440 more deaths in Los Angeles County from Jan. 5 to Feb. 1 than what would normally have been expected, and said those are related to the fires.",

But since then, cases rebounded, hitting 99 last year, and officials have missed at least six self-imposed eradication deadlines.",
      "Afghanistan and Pakistan remain the only countries where transmission of polio \u2014 which is highly infectious, affects mainly children under 5, and can cause irreversible paralysis within hours -- has never been interrupted. The worldwide campaign has focused most of its attention and funding there for the past decade.",
      "But in its quest to eliminate the disease, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative has been derailed by mismanagement and what insiders describe as blind allegiance to an outdated strategy and a problematic oral vaccine, according to workers, polio experts and internal materials obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "Officials have falsified vaccination records, selected unqualified people to dole out drops, failed to send out teams during mass campaigns, and dismissed concerns about the oral vaccinesparking outbreaks, according to documents shared with AP by staffers from GPEI \u2013 one of the largest and most expensive public health campaigns in history, with over $20 billion spent and nearly every country in the world involved.",
      "In Afghanistan and Pakistan \u2013 which share a border, harbor widespread mistrust of vaccines, and have weakened healthcare systems and infrastructure \u2013 local staffers like Ayaz have for years flagged problems to senior managers. But those issues, along with concerns by staffers and outside health officials, have long gone unaddressed, insiders say.",
      "Officials tout the successes \u2013 3 billion children vaccinated, an estimated 20 million people who would have been paralyzed spared \u2013 while acknowledging challenges in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Remote villages are hard to reach, some cultural and religious authorities instruct against vaccination, and hundreds of polio workers and security staff have been killed because of their alignment with a Western-led initiative.",
      "Dr. Jamal Ahmed, WHO\u2019s polio director, defended progress in those two countries, citing workers\u2019 tailored response in resistant pockets.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so many children being protected today because of the work that was done over the past 40 years,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s not overdramatize the challenges, because that leads to children getting paralyzed.\u201d",
      "Ahmed said he believes authorities will end the spread of polio in the next 12 to 18 months. Its latest goal for eradication is 2029. The campaign says about 45 million children in Pakistan and 11 million in Afghanistan must be vaccinated this year. Children typically need four doses of two drops each to be considered fully immunized.",
      "Dr. Zulfiqar Bhutta, who has served on advisory groups for WHO, the Gates Foundation and others, said campaign officials should listen to the criticism of its tactics.",
      "\u201cContinuing blindly with the same strategies that we have relied on since eradication began is unlikely to lead to a different result,\u201d he said.",
      "Internal WHO reports reviewing vaccination drives in Afghanistan and Pakistan over the past decade \u2013 given to AP by current and former staffers \u2013 show that as early as 2017, local workers were alerting significant problems to senior managers.",
      "The documents flagged multiple cases of falsified vaccination records, health workers being replaced by untrained relatives and workers improperly administering vaccines.",
      "On numerous occasions, WHO officials noted, \u201cvaccinators did not know about vaccine management,\u201d citing failure to keep doses properly cold. They also found sloppy or falsified reporting, with workers noting \u201cmore used vaccine vials than were actually supplied.\u201d",
      "According to an August 2017 report from Kandahar, Afghanistan, local government authorities and others interfered in choosing vaccinators, \u201cresulting in the selection of underage and illiterate volunteers.\u201d",
      "Vaccination teams worked \u201cin a hurried manner,\u201d reports said, with \u201cno plan for monitoring or supervision.\u201d A team in Nawzad, Afghanistan, covered just half of the intended area in 2017, with 250 households missed entirely. Village elders said no one visited for at least two years.",
      "Vaccine workers and health officials in Afghanistan and Pakistan confirmed the issues in the documents and told AP it\u2019s hard for campaign leadership to grasp the difficulties in the field. Door-to-door efforts are stymied by cultural barriers, unfounded stories about vaccines, and the region\u2019s poverty and transience.",
      "\u201cMost of the time when we go to vaccinate and knock on the door, the head of the house or the man is not at home,\u201d said one worker, speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to talk to the press. \u201cMany people find it offensive that a stranger knocks on the door and talks to a woman.\u201d",
      "Some workers find families have moved. Occasionally, they say, the encounter abuse.",
      "\u201cWe have shared these problems with our senior officials,\u201d the worker told AP. \u201cThey know about it.\u201d",
      "In an email response to AP\u2019s questions about officials\u2019 knowledge of the issues, WHO polio director Ahmed noted \u201coperational challenges\u201d in Afghanistan and Pakistan and said the program has \u201crobust monitoring and evaluation processes.\u201d",
      "Worker Ayaz described \u201cfake finger marking\u201d \u2014 placing the ink used to show a child is vaccinated on their pinky even when no vaccine has been given.",
      "\u201cThere is so much pressure,\u201d Ayaz said.",
      "Before the first polio vaccine was developed in 1955, the disease \u2014 spread mostly from person to person, through contaminated water and via fecal particles \u2014 was among the world\u2019s most feared, paralyzing hundreds of thousands of children annually. People avoided crowded places during epidemics, and hospital wards filled with children encased in iron lungs after the virus immobilized their breathing muscles.",
      "Polio is mainly spread when people are exposed to water infected with the virus. In countries with poor sanitation, children often become infected when they come into contact with contaminated waste.",
      "WHO says that as long as a single child remains infected, kids everywhere are at risk.",
      "Eradication demands near-perfection \u2013 zero polio cases and immunizing more than 95% of children.",

      "The oral vaccine \u2013 proven to be safe and effective \u2014 has been given to more than 3 billion children. But there are some extremely rare side effects: Scientists estimate that for every 2.7 million first doses given, one child will be paralyzed by the live polio virus in the vaccine.",
      "In even rarer instances, the live virus can mutate into a form capable of starting new outbreaks among unimmunized people where vaccination rates are low.",
      "Worldwide, several hundred vaccine-derived cases have been reported annually since at least 2021, with at least 98 this year.",
      "Most public health experts agree the oral vaccine should be pulled as soon as possible. But they acknowledge there simply isn\u2019t enough injectable vaccine \u2014 which uses no live virus and doesn\u2019t come with the risks of the oral vaccine \u2014 to wipe out polio alone. The injectable vaccine also is more expensive and requires more training to administer.",
      "More than two dozen current and former senior polio officials told AP the agencies involved haven\u2019t been willing to even consider revising their strategy to account for some of the campaign\u2019s problems.",
      "Dr. Tom Frieden, a former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who sits on an independent board reviewing polio eradication, said it would be impossible to eliminate polio without the oral vaccine. But he\u2019s urged authorities to find ways to adapt, such as adopting new methods to identify polio cases more quickly. Since 2011, he and colleagues have issued regular reports about overall program failures.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no management,\u201d he said, citing a lack of accountability.",
      "Last year, former WHO scientist Dr. T. Jacob John twice emailed WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus calling for a \u201cmajor course correction.\u201d John shared the emails with AP and said he\u2019s received no response.",
      "\u201cWHO is persisting with polio control and creating polio with one hand and attempting to control it by the other,\u201d John wrote.",
      "In his response to AP, WHO polio director Ahmed said the oral vaccine is a \u201ccore pillar\u201d of eradication strategy and that \u201calmost every country that is polio-free today used (it) to achieve that milestone.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need to step back and really care for the people,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only way we can do that in large parts of the world is with oral polio vaccine.\u201d",
      "Ahmed also pointed to the success WHO and partners had eliminating polio from India, once considered a nearly impossible task. In the four years before polio was wiped out there, health workers delivered about 1 billion doses of the oral vaccine to more than 170 million children.",
      "Today, nearly all of the world\u2019s polio cases -- mostly in Africa and the Middle East -- are mutated viruses from the oral vaccine, except for Afghanistan and Pakistan.",
      "Scott Barrett, a Columbia University professor, called for an inquiry into how things went so wrong \u2013 particularly with a failed effort in 2016, when authorities removed a strain from the oral vaccine. They miscalculated, leading to outbreaks in more than 40 countries that paralyzed more than 3,000 children, according to an expert report commissioned by WHO. Last year, a mutated virus traced to that effort paralyzed a baby in Gaza.",
      "\u201cUnless you have a public inquiry where all the evidence comes out and WHO makes serious changes, it will be very hard to trust them,\u201d he said.",
      "With an annual budget of about $1 billion, the polio initiative is among the most expensive in all of public health. This year, the U.S. withdrew from WHO, and President Donald Trump has cut foreign aid. WHO officials have privately admitted that sustaining funding would be difficult without success.",
      "Some say the money would be better spent on other health needs.",
      "\u201cWe have spent more than $1 billion (in external polio funding) in the last five years in Pakistan alone, and it didn\u2019t buy us any progress,\u201d said Roland Sutter, who formerly led polio research at WHO. \u201cIf this was a private company, we would demand results.\u201d",
      "Villagers, too, have protested the cost, staging hundreds of boycotts of immunization campaigns since 2023. Instead of polio vaccines, they ask for medicine, food and electricity.",
      "In Karachi, locals told AP they didn\u2019t understand the government\u2019s fixation on polio and complained of other issues \u2014 dirty water, heroin addiction. Workers are accompanied by armed guards; Pakistani authorities say more than 200 workers and police assigned to protect them have been killed since the 1990s, mostly by militants.",
      "The campaign also is up against a wave of misinformation, including that the vaccine is made from pig urine or will make children reach puberty early. Some blame an anti-vaccine sentiment growing in the U.S. and other countries that have largely funded eradication efforts and say it\u2019s reaching even remote areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan.",
      "In suburban southwest Pakistan, Saleem Khan, 58, said two grandchildren under 5 were vaccinated over his family\u2019s objections.",
      "\u201cIt results in disability,\u201d said Khan, without citing evidence for his belief. \u201cThey are vaccinated because officials reported our refusal to authorities and the police.\u201d",
      "Svea Closser, professor of international health at Johns Hopkins University, said Pakistan and Afghanistan were less resistant to immunization decades ago. Now, people are angry about the focus on polio and lack of help for diseases like measles or tuberculosis, she said, spurring conspiracy theories.",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday rejected the idea that his country would give up land to end the war with Russia after U.S. President Donald Trump suggested a peace deal could include \u201csome swapping of territories.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy said Ukraine \u201cwill not give Russia any awards for what it has done\u201d and that \u201cUkrainians will not give their land to the occupier.\u201d",
      "The remarks came after Trump said Friday that he would meet with Vladimir Putin even if the Russian leader would not meet with Zelenskyy. The Trump-Putin meeting, scheduled for Friday in Alaska, is seen as a potential breakthrough in the more than three-year war.",
      "Zelenskyy dismissed the planned summit, warning that any negotiations to end Europe\u2019s biggest conflict since World War II must include Kyiv.",
      "\u201cAny decisions that are without Ukraine are at the same time decisions against peace. They will not bring anything. These are dead decisions. They will never work,\u201d he said.",
      "In a statement posted to Telegram, Zelenskyy said Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity, enshrined in the constitution, must be nonnegotiable, and emphasized that lasting peace must include Ukraine\u2019s voice at the table.",
      "Ukrainian officials had previously told The Associated Press privately that Kyiv would be amenable to a peace deal that would de facto recognize Ukraine\u2019s inability to regain lost territories militarily.",
      "The Trump-Putin meeting may prove pivotal in a war that began when Russia invaded its western neighbor and has led to tens of thousands of deaths, although there\u2019s no guarantee it will stop the fighting since Moscow and Kyiv remain far apart on their conditions for peace.",
      "\u201cIt seems entirely logical for our delegation to fly across the Bering Strait simply, and for such an important and anticipated summit of the leaders of the two countries to be held in Alaska,\u201d Putin\u2019s foreign affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov, said Saturday in a statement posted to the Kremlin's news channel.",
      "In his comments to reporters at the White House Friday, Trump gave no details on the \"swapping of territories.\u201d Analysts, including some close to the Kremlin, have suggested that Russia could offer to give up territory it controls outside of the four regions it claims to have annexed.",
      "Trump said his meeting with Putin would come before any sit-down discussion involving Zelenskyy. His announcement that he planned to host one of America\u2019s adversaries on U.S. soil broke with expectations that they\u2019d meet in a third country. The gesture gives Putin validation after the U.S. and its allies had long sought to make him a pariah over his war against Ukraine.",
      "Nigel Gould-Davies, a senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told the AP that the \u201csymbology\u201d of holding the summit in Alaska was clear, and that the location \u201cnaturally favors Russia.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s easy to imagine Putin making the point. \u2026 We once had this territory and we gave it to you, therefore Ukraine had this territory and now should give it to us,\u201d he said, referring to the 1867 transaction known as the Alaska Purchase when Russia sold Alaska to the United States for $7.2 million.",
      "On the streets of Kyiv, reactions to the idea of Ukraine ceding territory to Russia ranged from skepticism to quiet resignation.",
      "\u201cIt may not be capitulation, but it would be a loss,\u201d said Ihor Usatenko, a 67-year-old pensioner, who said he would consider ceding territory \u201con condition for compensation and, possibly, some reparations.\u201d",
      "Anastasia Yemelianova, 31, said she was torn: \u201cHonestly, I have two answers to that question. The first is as a person who loves her country. I don\u2019t want to compromise within myself,\u201d she told the AP. \u201cBut seeing all these deaths and knowing that my mother is now living in Nikopol under shelling and my father is fighting, I want all this to end as soon as possible.\u201d",

      "Zelenskyy\u2019s fast-tracking of the law was a step too far, the public concluded.",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy quickly reversed course last month on a law that would have curbed the independence of the country\u2019s anti-corruption watchdogs after widespread protests that threatened the stability of his leadership for the first time since Russia\u2019s invasion.",
      "It's unlikely that the damage to the president\u2019s image can be changed as easily.",
      "Zelenskyy's reversal followed years of public discontent that simmered around his inner circle, some of whom have been accused of corruption. But Ukrainians have been largely deferential toward their president in wartime, trusting him to lead the fight against the Kremlin and even acquiescing in the suspension of some civil liberties.",
      "The protests showed the limits of that goodwill after the public concluded that Zelenskyy\u2019s fast-tracking of the law was a step too far.",
      "\u201cPeople will support Zelenskyy in whatever he does as it relates to the war. But the previous level of trust \u201cthat he will carry out everything correctly, without outside interests, has been damaged,\" said Tetiana Shevchuk, a board member of the Ukrainian nonprofit Anti-Corruption Action Center, which fights graft. Zelenskyy \"will need to work hard to get it back.\u201d",
      "A Gallup poll released Thursday found that about two-thirds of Ukrainians approve of the way Zelenskyy is handling his job as president, down from 84% in 2022. Another poll released Wednesday by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found a similar pattern, with trust in Zelenskyy down from just before the war started and a sharp decrease since after the signing of the law.",
      "Both polls were conducted in July and excluded adults living in regions of the country that were not controlled by Ukraine or were under entrenched Russian control.",
      "The initial decision to sign the proposal hurt Zelenskyy's standing among Ukrainians, loyal lawmakers and Western allies, including one foreign minister who told The Associated Press that his willingness to backtrack on the law would help restore \u201clost trust.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy sparked the outcry when he signed measures to reduce the powers of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau, or NABU, and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor\u2019s Office, or SAPO.",
      "Zelenskyy said the initial bill was meant to root out Russian influence in those agencies, but he did not provide evidence to support the claim. The bill became a law so quickly that lawmakers said they barely had time to read it. For the Ukrainian people, patience wore thin.",
      "From the outset of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in 2022, the public tolerated restrictions such as martial law and postponed elections. But critics also argued that the consolidation of the president\u2019s authority undermined the country\u2019s democratic institutions, along with the checks and balances necessary for transparency. Members of Zelenskyy\u2019s inner circle and the corruption allegations fueled public resentment.",
      "The resulting anti-corruption protests in July in Kyiv and other cities were among the largest in years, drawing thousands of demonstrators and reflecting widespread public demand for transparency and accountability even during wartime.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not one law that brought people to the streets, but a series of events and mostly an accumulation of feelings and wanting to show the government there are certain red lines,\u201d Shevchuk said.",
      "Ukrainian leaders have been sensitive to public opinion ever since the Euromaidan protests of 2013 and 2014, which ignited extraordinary political changes, including the ousting of pro-Russia President Viktor Yanukovych. Those protests marked a decisive moment in Ukraine\u2019s history and galvanized public intolerance toward corruption and abuse of power.",
      "Until recently, Zelenskyy\u2019s decisions and public statements aligned mostly with public opinion. He watches polls closely. For instance, he did not say that Ukraine would be unable to win back occupied territory militarily until polls showed that Ukrainians were willing to end the war for territorial concessions.",
      "Many of the suspicions about Zelenskyy\u2019s inner circle focused on the head of his presidential office, Andriy Yermak, who is seen as having too much power, according to activists and Ukrainian and Western officials. In recent weeks, two other individuals close to Zelenskyy sparked public ire ahead of the protests.",
      "The first was former Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Oleksii Chernyshov, a close ally of Zelenskyy\u2019s, who in June was formally named a suspect in a high-profile land-grab case. Later, the NABU announced that he was the sixth suspect in a large corruption scheme led by a Kyiv property developer.",

      "\u201cUkrainians are united around the president in his war efforts, in his efforts to gain support from allies right now and the necessary military aid,\" Shevchuk said. \"But at the same time, people know what is happening with the close allies of the president, the allegations of corruption, so this does not go unnoticed.\u201d",
      "The protests \"were a reminder to the president from the people basically saying, \u2018We see everything, remember everything. And we don\u2019t want the president to use his power to protect corruption,\u2019\u201d she added.",

      "\u201cI voted not because I agreed with the law, but because it was the president\u2019s decision,\u201d said lawmaker Oleksandr Merezhko, a member of Zelenskyy\u2019s party. \u201cI had no time to read it, but I understood what was at risk, and I voted like other people because we trusted the president. It was his decision, and we are team players.\u201d",

      "The firm faith in Zelenskyy led one lawmaker to joke that if the president nominated a spoon for prime minister, Parliament would likely vote in favor. But that sentiment has changed, Merezhko said, with parliament now becoming more independent.",
      "\u201cNow members of parliament will be more careful,\u201d he said. \u201cIf before we had a presumption of trust with respect to the president or cabinet of the bills, we now have a presumption of mistrust. If similar bills are introduced,\" members of parliament \"will remember what happened. They don\u2019t want to be framed or blamed for what happened.\u201d",
      "But lawmakers commended Zelenskyy for acting swiftly to reverse his decision and quiet the anger on the street. Last week, parliament passed another bill restoring the independence of the NABU and the SAPO.",
      "\u201cPeople asked for changes. We responded,\u201d Zelenskyy told reporters.",
      "The proposed law also drew concern among Ukraine\u2019s European allies, who suggested it could imperil support for Kyiv and affect Ukraine's bid to join the EU. Ukraine's closest allies welcomed the swift turnaround.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer raised the issue in a July 24 call with Zelenskyy. A readout of the call from Starmer\u2019s office said the leaders \"agreed on the importance of the role of independent anti-corruption institutions at the heart of Ukraine\u2019s democracy.\u201d",
      "In Germany, Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul expressed dismay when Zelenskyy approved the measures to reduce the powers of the NABU and the SAPO. When Zelenskyy reversed course, Wadephul wrote on X that the Ukrainian parliament\u2019s vote \"was a positive and necessary step toward regaining lost trust.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump, who often weighs in on matters in foreign countries, including their domestic affairs, has been silent about the Ukrainian corruption law.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s military said Saturday it detected North Korea removing some of its loudspeakers from the inter-Korean border, days after the South dismantled its own front-line speakers used for anti-North Korean propaganda broadcasts, in a bid to ease tensions.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff didn\u2019t disclose the sites where the North Koreans were removing speakers and said it wasn\u2019t immediately clear whether the North would take all of them down.",
      "In recent months, South Korean border residents have complained that North Korean speakers blasted irritating sounds, including howling animals and pounding gongs, in a tit-for-tat response to South Korean propaganda broadcasts.",
      "The South Korean military said the North stopped its broadcasts in June after Seoul\u2019s new liberal president, Lee Jae Myung, halted the South\u2019s broadcasts in his government\u2019s first concrete step toward easing tensions between the war-divided rivals. South Korea\u2019s military began removing its speakers from border areas on Monday but didn't specify how they would be stored or whether they could be quickly redeployed if tensions flared again.",
      "North Korea, which is extremely sensitive to any outside criticism of its authoritarian leadership and its third-generation ruler, Kim Jong Un, didn\u2019t immediately confirm it was taking down its speakers.",
      "South Korea\u2019s previous conservative government resumed daily loudspeaker broadcasts in June last year, following a yearslong pause, in retaliation for North Korea flying trash-laden balloons toward the South.",
      "The speakers blasted propaganda messages and K-pop songs, a playlist designed to strike a nerve in Pyongyang, where Kim has been pushing an intense campaign to eliminate the influence of South Korean pop culture and language among the population in a bid to strengthen his family\u2019s dynastic rule.",

      "Tensions between the Koreas can possibly rise again later this month, when South Korea and the United States proceed with their annual large-scale combined military exercises, which begin on Aug. 18.

      "Israel says it plans to take over Gaza City",
      "JERUSALEM -- Israel said Friday it will intensify its 22-month war with Hamas by taking over Gaza City, drawing a dismissal from the militant group and renewed international calls to end the conflict, while stirring fears for Palestinian civilians and Israeli hostages still held in Gaza.",
      "Israel\u2019s air and ground war has already killed tens of thousands of people in Gaza, displaced most of the population, destroyed vast areas and pushed the territory toward famine. The timing of another major ground operation remains unclear since it will likely hinge on mobilizing thousands of troops and forcibly evacuating civilians, almost certainly exacerbating the humanitarian catastrophe.",
      "Mediators from Egypt and Qatar are working on a new framework that will include the release of all hostages \u2014 dead and alive \u2014 in one go in return for an end of the war in Gaza and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the strip, two Arab officials told The Associated Press.",
      "Before Israel's Security Cabinet approved the plan to take over Gaza City, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had outlined more sweeping plans Thursday in an interview with Fox News, saying Israel planned to take control of all of Gaza. Israel already controls around three-quarters of the territory.",
      "Hamas rejected Israel\u2019s plans in a statement. \u201cExpanding of aggression against our Palestinian people will not be a walk in the park,\u201d the group said.",
      "An expanded offensive could widen discord between Israel and international powers, which have stepped up criticism of the war amid mounting shock over media reports showing starvation.",
      "Britain urged Israel to reconsider, and Germany said it would not authorize the export of military equipment that could be used in Gaza until further notice.",
      "\u201cThe even harsher military action by the Israeli army in the Gaza Strip, approved by the Israeli Cabinet last night, makes it increasingly difficult for the German government to see how these goals will be achieved,\u201d Chancellor Friedrich Merz said.",
      "Tensions could rise further if Netanyahu follows through on the more sweeping plans to take control of the entire territory, two decades after Israel\u2019s unilateral withdrawal from the strip.",
      "Asked in the interview with Fox News ahead of the Security Cabinet meeting if Israel would \u201ctake control of all of Gaza,\u201d Netanyahu replied: \u201cWe intend to, in order to assure our security, remove Hamas there.\u201d He added that Israel did not intend to \u201ckeep it.\u201d",
      "Israel's new plan stopped short of that, and may be aimed in part at pressuring Hamas to accept a ceasefire on Israel's terms.",
      "It may also reflect the reservations of Israel\u2019s military chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, who reportedly warned that expanding operations would endanger the remaining 20 or so living hostages held by Hamas and further strain Israel\u2019s army after nearly two years of regional wars.",
      "The military \u201cwill prepare to take control of Gaza City while providing humanitarian aid to the civilian population outside the combat zones,\u201d Netanyahu's office said in a statement after the meeting.",
      "Amir Avivi, a retired brigadier general and chairman of Israel\u2019s Defense and Security Forum, estimated it would take less than three months to mobilize some 30,000 troops, evacuate Palestinian civilians and take over Gaza City.",
      "Hamas-led militants triggered the war when they stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people and abducting 251 people. Most of the hostages have been released in ceasefires or other deals but 50 remain inside Gaza. Israel believes around 20 of them to be alive.",
      "The efforts for a new ceasefire have the backing of major Arab Gulf monarchies, according to officials who spoke anonymously due to the sensitivity of the discussions. One is involved directly in the deliberations and the second was briefed on the efforts. The monarchies are concerned about further regional destabilization if Israel\u2019s government proceeds with a full reoccupation of Gaza, the officials said.",
      "The yet-to-be finalized framework aims to address the contentious issue of what to do with Hamas\u2019 weapons, with Israel seeking full disarmament and Hamas refusing. The official directly involved in the efforts said discussions are underway about \u201cfreezing arms,\u201d which may involve Hamas retaining but not using its weapons. It also calls for the group to relinquish power in the strip.",

      "Japanese people appreciate the glitter of fireflies let loose in the garden or the gentle chirping of crickets kept in a little cage. You can feed the bug pets watermelon, but special jelly pet food for bugs is also available at stores. Naturally, bugs are on sale as well, with the more esoteric ones selling for 20,000 yen ($133).",
      "Here, crawly and buzzing critters are not just relegated to the scientific realm of the entomologist working on a taxidermy of pinned butterflies. Celebrities boast about their fascination with bug-hunting as their hobbies just like a Western movie star might talk about his yacht or golf score.",
      "The bug as companion is an essential part of what\u2019s observed, enjoyed and cared for in everyday life, reflecting a deeply rooted celebration of humankind\u2019s oneness with nature.",
      "\u201cThey are so tiny. If you catch and study them, you\u2019re sure to discover something new,\u201d says Munetoshi Maruyama, professor of bioenvironmental sciences at Kyushu University, whose fascination with bugs began as a child, like many Japanese.",
      "\u201cThey are so beautiful in shape and form.\u201d",
      "One thrill that comes from studying insects is discovering a new species, simply because there are more than 1.2 million known kinds of insects, far more than mammals, which translates to a lot of undiscovered ones, said Maruyama, who has discovered 250 new insect species himself and shrugs that off as a relatively small number.",
      "Japan differs from much of the West in encouraging interaction with bugs from childhood, with lots of books written for children, as well as classes and tours.",
      "\u201cIn Japan, kids love bugs. You can even buy a net at a convenience store,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic that bugs can serve as a doorway to science.\u201d",

      "The love affair with bugs was clear at an exhibit in Tokyo, aptly called \u201cThe Great Insect Exhibition,\u201d running through the end of this month at the Sky Tree Tower, where crowds of children gathered around trees inside indoor cages so they could observe and touch the various beetles.",
      "One kind of rhinoceros beetle known as Hercules, which originated in the Caribbean but is now also found in Japan, is reputed to be the biggest beetle on record, although it\u2019s just several inches in length. Its back coat is a shiny khaki color, though such shades change depending on the season. The other parts, like its horn and delicate but spiky legs, are dark.",

      "After all, who was going to eat all of that Amazon berry, globally famous as a delicious, refreshing and nutritious superfood, if American consumers suddenly could no longer afford it?",
      "As the main importer of the Brazilian berry, prices of acai smoothies and bowls look certain to go up in the United States.",
      "\u201cThe acai that\u2019s all produced here ... If only people here eat it, it\u2019s going to be a lot of acai, right?\u201d Moreira told The Associated Press outside of Belem, an Amazon city of 1.4 million residents that will host this year's U.N. climate summit COP30 climate summit in November. \u201cIf there\u2019s too much acai here, people won\u2019t be able to eat it all and the price will drop.\u201d",
      "A single full crate of acai sells for around $50 at local markets in Brazil, a price that is now expected to plummet. The U.S. is by far the largest acai importer of a total Brazilian output currently estimated at about 70,000 tons per year.",
      "The most vulnerable acai producers in the northern state of Para say they have already been hit by tariffs imposed by the U.S. government, as a surplus of the berry without a clear destination starts to mount only days after the new economic scenario unfolded.",
      "More powerful exporters, such as Sao Paulo-state based company Acai Tropicalia Mix, are also feeling the impact.",
      "One of its owners, Rog\u00e9rio de Carvalho, told the AP that last year he exported to the U.S. about 270 tons of acai cream \u2014 an industrialized version of the berry \u2014 ready for consumption. As tariffs started to loom, he said, American importers steered away and clients suspended negotiations. Until the end of July, de Carvalho estimates that his company sold 27 tons to the U.S.",

Analysts say its producers also help protect the rainforest from illegal loggers, miners and cattle ranchers.",
      "The night markets of Belem, such as the Ver-o-Peso acai market, are a hub of activity where the freshly harvested berries are brought in by boat and prepared for sale.",

    "story": [
      "An increase in the tax on university endowments is creating financial challenges for the wealthiest U.S. colleges",
      "A big increase in the tax on university endowments is adding to financial uncertainty for the wealthiest colleges in the U.S., leading several already to lay off staff or implement hiring freezes.",
      "Spending more endowment money on taxes could also lead colleges to reduce financial aid, cutting off access to elite institutions for lower-income students, colleges and industry experts have warned. President Donald Trump signed the tax increase into law last month as part of his signature spending bill.",
      "The new tax rates take effect in 2026, but colleges such as Harvard, Yale and Stanford already are citing the tax as one of many reasons for making cuts across their universities. Each will be on the hook to pay hundreds of millions more in taxes, while also navigating reductions in research grants and other threats to funding by the Trump administration.",
      "A tax on college endowments was introduced during Trump's first administration, collecting 1.4% of wealthy universities' investment earnings. The law signed by Trump last month creates a new tiered system that taxes the richest schools at the highest rates.",
      "The new tax will charge an 8% rate at schools with $2 million or more in assets for each enrolled student. Schools with $750,000 to $2 million will be charged 4%, and schools with $500,000 to $750,000 will continue to be charged the 1.4% rate.",
      "The tax applies only to private colleges and universities with at least 3,000 students, up from the previous cutoff of 500 students.",
      "\u201cThe tax now will really solely apply to private research universities,\u201d said Steven Bloom, assistant vice president of government relations for the American Council on Education. \u201cIt\u2019s going to mean that these schools are going to have to spend more money under the tax, taking it away from what they primarily use their endowment assets for \u2014 financial aid.\u201d",
      "The law will increase the endowment tax for about a dozen universities, according to an Associated Press analysis of data from the National Association of College and University Business Officers.",
      "Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Princeton and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are expected to pay the 8% rate next year. The schools facing the 4% rate include Notre Dame, Dartmouth College, Rice University, University of Pennsylvania, Washington University in St. Louis and Vanderbilt University.",
      "Some universities are on the edge of the law's parameters. Both Duke and Emory, for instance, were shy of the $750,000-per-student endowment threshold based on last fiscal year.",
      "Endowments are made up of donations to the college, which are invested to maintain the money over time. Colleges often spend about 5% of their investment earnings every year to put toward their budgets. Much of it goes toward scholarships for students, along with costs such as research or endowed faculty positions.",
      "Despite the colleges' wealth, the tax will drastically impact their budgets, said Phillip Levine, an economist and professor at Wellesley College.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re looking for savings wherever possible,\u201d Levine said, which could impact financial aid. \u201cOne of the most important things they do with their endowment is lower the cost of education for lower- and middle-income students. The institutions paying the highest tax are also the ones charging these students the least amount of money to attend.\u201d",

      "For example, at Rice University in Houston, officials anticipate the college will need to pay $6.4 million more in taxes. That equates to more than 100 student financial aid packages, the university said, but Rice officials will explore all other options to avoid cutting that support.",
      "In the meantime, some universities are going forward with staff cuts.",
      "Yale University says it will have to pay an estimated $280 million in total endowment taxes, citing the tax in a campus message implementing a hiring freeze. Stanford University announced plans to reduce its operating budget by $140 million this upcoming school year, which included 363 layoffs and an ongoing hiring freeze. The university spent months trying to determine where to reduce its budget, but said it would continue to support undergraduate financial aid and funding for Ph.D. students.",
      "Research universities are under increasing financial pressure from reductions in funding from the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation and other federal agencies.",
      "No university knows this pressure better than Harvard, the country's wealthiest college. Its $53 billion endowment puts it at the top of the list for the new tax, but it's also seeing massive portions of research funding under threat in its ongoing battle with the White House.",
      "The federal government has frozen $2.6 billion in Harvard's research grants in connection with civil rights investigations focused on antisemitism and Harvard's efforts to promote diversity on campus. But the impact of other administration policies on the university could approach $1 billion annually, Harvard said in a statement.",

    "story": [
      "Michelle Bowman was one of two Fed officials who voted for interest rate cuts.",
      "NEW YORK -- A top official at the Federal Reserve said Saturday that this month's stunning, weaker-than-expected report on the U.S. job market is strengthening her belief that interest rates should be lower.",
      "Michelle Bowman was one of two Fed officials who voted a week and a half ago in favor of cutting interest rates. Such a move could help boost the economy by making it cheaper for people to borrow money to buy a house or a car, but it could also threaten to push inflation higher.",
      "Bowman and a fellow dissenter lost out after nine other Fed officials voted to keep interest rates steady, as the Fed has been doing all year. The Fed's chair, Jerome Powell, has been adamant that he wants to wait for more data about how President Donald Trump's tariffs are affecting inflation before the Fed makes its next move.",
      "At a speech during a bankers' conference in Colorado on Saturday, Bowman said that \u201cthe latest labor market data reinforce my view\u201d that the Fed should cut interest rates three times this year. The Fed has only three meetings left on the schedule in 2025.",
      "The jobs report that arrived last week, only a couple of days after the Fed voted on interest rates, showed that employers hired far fewer workers last month than economists expected. It also said that hiring in prior months was much lower than initially thought.",
      "On inflation, meanwhile, Bowman said she is getting more confident that Trump's tariffs \u201cwill not present a persistent shock to inflation\u201d and sees it moving closer to the Fed's 2% target. Inflation has come down substantially since hitting a peak above 9% after the pandemic, but it has been stubbornly remaining above 2%.",

      "The Fed\u2019s job is to keep the job market strong, while keeping a lid on inflation. Its challenge is that it has one main tool to affect both those areas, and helping one by moving interest rates up or down often means hurting the other.",
      "A fear is that Trump's tariffs could box in the Federal Reserve by sticking the economy in a worst-case scenario called \u201cstagflation,\u201d where the economy stagnates but inflation is high. The Fed has no good tool to fix that, and it would likely have to prioritize either the job market or inflation before helping the other.",
      "On Wall Street, expectations are that the Fed will have to cut interest rates at its next meeting in September after the U.S. jobs report came in so much below economists' expectations.",
      "Trump has been calling angrily for lower interest rates, often personally insulting Powell while doing so. He has the opportunity to add another person to the Fed's board of governors after an appointee of former President Joe Biden stepped down recently.",

      "The Boar's Head deli meat plant at the heart of a deadly food poisoning outbreak is set to reopen in the coming months",
      "The Boar's Head deli meat plant at the heart of last year's deadly food poisoning outbreak is set to reopen in the coming months, company officials said.",
      "But recent inspections at Boar\u2019s Head sites in three states documented sanitation problems similar to those that led to the listeria contamination that killed 10 people and sickened dozens.",
      "The Jarratt, Virginia, plant was shut down in September when U.S. Agriculture Department officials suspended operations and withdrew the federal marks of inspection required to operate, saying the company \u201cfailed to maintain sanitary conditions.\u201d Boar\u2019s Head permanently stopped making liverwurst and recalled more than 7 million pounds of deli products.",
      "USDA officials this week said they had \u201cthoroughly reviewed\u201d the plant and lifted the forced suspension on July 18.",
      "\u201cThe facility is in full compliance of the guidelines and protocols set for the safe handling and production of food and the serious issues that led to suspension have been fully rectified,\u201d officials with the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said in an email Wednesday.",
      "And yet, documents obtained by The Associated Press through a freedom of information request show that Boar\u2019s Head plants in Arkansas, Indiana and elsewhere in Virginia were flagged for the same kinds of sanitation problems that led to the outbreak, with the most recent report in June.",
      "In the past seven months, government inspectors reported problems that include instances of meat and fat residue left on equipment and walls, drains blocked with meat products, beaded condensation on ceilings and floors, overflowing trash cans, and staff who didn\u2019t wear protective hairnets and plastic aprons \u2014 or wash their hands.",
      "The records, which included USDA noncompliance reports logged by inspectors from Jan. 1 through July 23, raise new questions about the company's promises to address systemic problems and about federal oversight of listeria contamination in plants that make ready-to-eat foods.",
      "\u201cIf there is evidence that food safety problems are continuing, the government needs to make sure the company fixes them,\u201d said Sandra Eskin, a former USDA official who now heads STOP Foodborne Illness, a consumer group focused on food safety.",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins last month announced plans to bolster efforts that combat foodborne germs, including listeria.",
      "Officials at Boar's Head, the 120-year-old company based in Sarasota, Florida, have posted job openings for two dozen positions, including a food safety quality analyst, at the Jarratt site.",
      "The company convened a panel of expert advisers last fall and hired a chief food safety officer in May. The advisers include Frank Yiannas, a former U.S. Food and Drug Administration official, and Mindy Brashears, President Donald Trump's nominee for USDA's undersecretary for food safety.",
      "Boar's Head last year said they \u201cregret and deeply apologize\" for the contamination and that \u201ccomprehensive measures are being implemented to prevent such an incident from ever happening again.\u201d",
      "But company officials refused to discuss the problems found this year. They canceled a scheduled AP interview with Natalie Dyenson, the new food safety officer. And they declined to allow Yiannas to detail the investigation he led into the contamination's cause.",
      "Brashears, who now directs a food safety center at Texas Tech University, did not respond to requests for comment about the Boar's Head problems. An automatic email reply said the USDA nominee was traveling out of the country until Aug. 25. She remains on the company's food safety board.",
      "\u201cBoar\u2019s Head has an unwavering commitment to food safety and quality. That commitment is reflected in recent enhancements to our practices and protocols\" described on the company's website, Boar's Head said in an emailed statement.",

      "NEW YORK -- Debra Taylor has had a busy year or so: She's going through a divorce while in the process of retiring \u2014 and she's moving to Portugal from Southern California with one of her daughters.",
      "After deciding her next home would be outside the U.S., she narrowed down her choices based on tax burdens (Spain was out with its wealth taxes), climate (no Costa Rica, too hot) and ease of travel within Europe, one of her favorite parts of the world. She then toured Portugal with a relocation company, Expatsi, and found her new home, Aveiro. It's a striking city on the country's west coast with lovely canals that earned it the nickname the Venice of Portugal.",
      "It's all logistics from there. Taylor signed a year lease on an apartment (a requirement for moving forward), hired the company Viv Europe to navigate bureaucracies and paperwork, signed up for the necessary FBI background check and has an appointment in late September to move ahead with visas.",
      "Her youngest child gave her the idea to leave the country.",
      "\u201cAfter our current president was elected, my 18-year-old transgender daughter came to me and said, \u2018I want to get out of this country ASAP,\u2019\u201d Taylor recalled. \u201cThat was just fine with me.\u201d",
      "Her oldest daughter, who's 20, will stay in the U.S. to complete college.",
      "\u201cNone of this means I have to live there forever,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cI\u2019ll use this as my jumping-off point to do more deeper dives, explore the rest of the region. I want to buy a place, but I\u2019m not going to do that until I\u2019m living there and spend more time in different communities.\u201d",
      "According to aging and relocation experts, Taylor has made the right decisions.",
      "The number of people who relocate upon retirement fluctuates, based on such factors as politics, home affordability and cost-of-living rates. While older adults are less likely to move than younger populations, more than 3 million people age 65 and older relocated within the U.S. in the five years before the coronavirus pandemic, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.",
      "As for moving abroad, U.S. politics is now the No. 1 reason cited by people who use Expatsi, the company's co-founder Jen Barnett said.",
      "\u201cThe one downside is that a lot of countries retirees are interested in don\u2019t want retirees, and that is to say wealthy, English-speaking countries, because they want laborers,\u201d Barnett said.",
      "While most U.S. retirees stay put in existing homes and locales, those who want to age in place face mounting challenges, said AARP Vice President Rodney Harrell, who focuses on housing and livable communities.",
      "Challenges include rising rents or mortgages, costs for home modifications, and a lack of community support services like adequate health care, reliable utilities and safe environments.",
      "\u201cOne of the biggest challenges that we have is making sure that we take the future us into account, and not just look at our needs today,\" Harrell said. \u201cAre we driving today? Is our income where it is? Is our spouse and myself healthy right now? How able are we to walk around and use steps, etc.? Things can change.\u201d",
      "All of the above is crucial as the U.S. heads into a gray bubble.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have more people over 65 than under 18 by 2034. For the first time in U.S. history, we have more older adults than children,\u201d Harrell said.",

      "If being close to children and grandchildren is high on the list, set clear expectations about how involved you want to be in such things as child care, said retirement transition planner Elizabeth Zelinka Parsons. Also, chat with adult children before making a move to determine how settled they are themselves.",

      "As a wealth manager, Chad Harmer has helped dozens of retirees relocate, from Ontario, Canada, to Arizona\u2019s High Desert, from the Boston suburbs to the Carolinas. And he's dealt with some \u201cboomerang\u201d moves back home after grandchildren arrived.",
      "\u201cStart with a 'lifestyle audit,' not a tax table,\" he said. \u201cI ask clients to write a perfect Thursday five years from now. Where are they walking? Who are they meeting for coffee? How long is the drive to the grandkids? That exercise surfaces climate preferences, social networks, volunteer hobbies and healthcare priorities long before we argue over property tax millage rates.\u201d",
      "He also recommended budgeting for hidden inflators \u2014 such as higher insurance premiums in disaster-prone areas and frequent flights to see family \u2014 and considering less obvious weather complications, like pollen levels.",

    "story": [
      "A writer from Maine, Sharon Kitchens has turned her passion for Stephen King's books into a published work",
      "NEW YORK -- With deep knowledge of Stephen King's books and curiosity about their inspirations, writer Sharon Kitchens began a journey around Maine. As she learned about the real-life settings and people behind such fiction as \u201cIT\u201d and \u201cSalem's Lot,\u201d she arranged them into an online map and story she called \u201cStephen King's Maine.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was amateur hour, in a way,\u201d she says. \u201cBut after around 27,000 people visited the site one of my friends said to me, \u2018You should do something more with this.\u2019\u201d",
      "Published in 2024, the resulting book-length edition of \u201cStephen King's Maine\u201d is among hundreds released each year by The History Press. Now part of Arcadia Publishing, the 20-year-old imprint is dedicated to regional, statewide and locally focused works, found for sale in bookstores, museums, hotels and other tourist destinations. The mission of The History Press is to explore and unearth \u201cthe story of America, one town or community at a time.\u201d",
      "The King book stands out if only for its focus on an international celebrity. Most History Press releases arise out of more obscure passions and expertise, whether Michael C. Gabriele's \u201cThe History of Diners in New Jersey,\u201d Thomas Dresser's \u201cAfrican Americans of Martha's Vineyard\u201d or Clem C. Pellett's \u201cMurder on Montana's Hi-Line,\u201d the author's probe into the fatal shooting of his grandfather.",
      "Like Kitchens, History Press authors tend to be regional or local specialists \u2014 history lovers, academics, retirees and hobbyists. Kitchens' background includes writing movie press releases, blogging for the Portland Press Herald and contributing to the Huffington Post. Pellett is a onetime surgeon who was so compelled by his grandfather's murder that he switched careers and became a private investigator. In Boulder, Colorado, Nancy K. Williams is a self-described \u201cWestern history writer\u201d whose books include \u201cBuffalo Soldiers on the Colorado Frontier\u201d and \u201cHaunted Hotels of Southern Colorado.\u201d",
      "The History Press publishes highly specific works such as Jerry Harrington's tribute to a Pulitzer Prize-winning editor from the 1930s, \u201cCrusading Iowa Journalist Verne Marshall.\u201d It also issues various series, notably \u201cHaunted\u201d guides that publishing director Kate Jenkins calls a \u201chighly localized version\u201d of the ghost story genre. History Press has long recruited potential authors through a team of field representatives, but now writers such as Kitchens are as likely to be brought to the publisher's attention through a national network of writers who have worked with it before.",
      "\u201cOur ideal author isn\u2019t someone with national reach,\u201d Jenkins says, \u201cbut someone who\u2019s a member of their community, whether that\u2019s an ethnic community or a local community, and is passionate about preserving that community\u2019s history. We\u2019re the partners who help make that history accessible to a wide audience.\u201d",
      "The History Press is a prolific, low-cost operation. The books tend to be brief \u2014 under 200 pages \u2014 and illustrated with photos drawn from local archives or taken by the authors themselves. The print runs are small, and authors are usually paid through royalties from sales rather than advances up front. History Press books rarely are major hits, but they can still attract substantial attention for works tailored to specific areas, and they tend to keep selling over time. Editions selling 15,000 copies or more include \u201cLong-Ago Stories of the Eastern Cherokee,\u201d by Lloyd Arneach, Alphonso Brown's \u201cA Gullah Guide to Charleston\u201d and Gayle Soucek's \u201cMarshall Field's,\u201d a tribute to the Chicago department store.",
      "The King guide, which has sold around 8,500 copies so far, received an unexpected lift \u2014 an endorsement by its subject, who was shown the book at Maine's Bridgton Books and posted an Instagram of himself giving it a thumbs-up.",
      "\u201cI was genuinely shocked in the best possible way,\u201d Kitchens says, adding that she saw the book as a kind of thank-you note to King. \u201cEvery choice I made while writing the book, I made with him in mind.\u201d",
      "History Press authors say they like the chance to tell stories that they believe haven\u2019t been heard, or were told incorrectly.",

      "Global financial markets have taken President Donald Trump's tariff adjustments in stride, with Asian and European shares and U.S. futures mostly higher",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump began levying higher import taxes on dozens of countries Thursday, just as the economic fallout of his monthslong tariff threats has begun to create visible damage for the U.S. economy.",
      "Just after midnight, goods from more than 60 countries and the European Union became subject to tariff rates of 10% or higher. Products from the EU, Japan and South Korea are taxed at 15%, while imports from Taiwan, Vietnam and Bangladesh are taxed at 20%. Trump also expects the EU, Japan and South Korea to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S.",
      "\u201cI think the growth is going to be unprecedented,\u201d Trump said Wednesday afternoon. He added that the U.S. was \u201ctaking in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs,\u201d but he couldn't provide a specific figure for revenues because \u201cwe don\u2019t even know what the final number is\u201d regarding tariff rates.",
      "Despite the uncertainty, the Trump White House is confident that the onset of his broad tariffs will provide clarity about the path of the world's largest economy. Now that companies understand the direction the U.S. is headed, the Republican administration believes they can ramp up new investments and jump-start hiring in ways that can rebalance the U.S. economy as a manufacturing power.",
      "But so far, there are signs of self-inflicted wounds to America as companies and consumers alike brace for the impact of new taxes. What the data has shown is a U.S. economy that changed in April with Trump\u2019s initial rollout of tariffs, an event that led to market drama, a negotiating period and Trump's ultimate decision to start his universal tariffs on Thursday.",
      "Economic reports show that hiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline after April, said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy.",
      "\u201cA less productive economy requires fewer workers,\u201d Silvia said in an analysis note. \u201cBut there is more, the higher tariff prices lower workers' real wages. The economy has become less productive, and firms cannot pay the same real wages as before. Actions have consequences.\u201d",
      "Even then, the ultimate transformations of the tariffs are unknown and could play out over months, if not years. Many economists say the risk is that the American economy is steadily eroded rather than collapsing instantly.",
      "\u201cWe all want it to be made for television where it\u2019s this explosion \u2014 it\u2019s not like that,\u201d said Brad Jensen, a professor at Georgetown University. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fine sand in the gears and slow things down.\u201d",
      "Trump has promoted the tariffs as a way to reduce the persistent trade deficit. But importers sought to avoid the taxes by importing more goods before the taxes went into effect. As a result, the $582.7 billion trade imbalance for the first half of the year was 38% higher than in 2024. Total construction spending has dropped 2.9% over the past year.",
      "The economic pain isn't confined to the U.S. Germany, which sends 10% of its exports to the U.S. market, saw industrial production sag 1.9% in June as Trump's earlier rounds of tariff hikes took hold. \u201cThe new tariffs will clearly weigh on economic growth,\u201d said Carsten Brzeski, global chief of macro for ING bank.",
      "The lead-up to Thursday fit the slapdash nature of Trump's tariffs, which have been variously rolled out, walked back, delayed, increased, imposed by letter and frantically renegotiated. The process has been so muddled that officials for key trade partners were unclear at the start of the week whether the tariffs would begin Thursday or Friday. The language of the July 31 order to delay the start of tariffs from Aug. 1 only said the higher tax rates would start in seven days.",
      "Trump on Wednesday announced additional 25% tariffs to be imposed on India for its buying of Russian oil, bringing its total import taxes to 50%.",
      "A top body of Indian exporters said Thursday the latest U.S. tariffs will impact nearly 55% of the country\u2019s outbound shipments to America and force exporters to lose their long-standing clients.",

      "Import taxes are still coming on pharmaceutical drugs, and Trump announced 100% tariffs on computer chips. That could leave the U.S. economy in a place of suspended animation as it awaits the impact.",
      "The president's use of a 1977 law to declare an economic emergency to impose the tariffs is also under challenge. The impending ruling from last week's hearing before a U.S. appeals court could cause Trump to find other legal justifications if judges say he exceeded his authority.",
      "Even people who worked with Trump during his first term are skeptical that things will go smoothly for the economy, such as Paul Ryan, the former Republican House speaker, who has emerged as a Trump critic.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no sort of rationale for this other than the president wanting to raise tariffs based upon his whims, his opinions,\u201d Ryan told CNBC on Wednesday. \u201cI think choppy waters are ahead because I think they\u2019re going to have some legal challenges.\u201d",
      "Still, the stock market has been solid during the recent tariff drama, with the S&P 500 index climbing more than 25% from its April low. The market's rebound and the income tax cuts in Trump's tax and spending measures signed into law on July 4 have given the White House confidence that economic growth is bound to accelerate in the coming months.",

      "Everybody wants to save money. Buying a lightly used car instead of a new car is one way to do that. Choosing a fuel-efficient hybrid model is another way. Combine those approaches, and you might be surprised to discover what you can drive even when you\u2019re on a tight budget. The five hybrid sedans listed below in alphabetical order are worthy of consideration due to their low prices, great EPA-estimated fuel economy, and favorable crash test ratings. Edmunds\u2019 automotive experts think they\u2019re the best used hybrid sedans for under $25,000.",
      "Thanks to its spacious back seat and large trunk, the Honda Accord Hybrid can easily accommodate a family of four or five, making it an ideal car for summer road trips and big-box shopping excursions. This midsize sedan\u2019s model lineup ranges from basic to sporty or luxurious, and depending on the version, you can expect EPA-estimated combined fuel economy of between 43 mpg and 48 mpg. Favorable crash test ratings are a bonus.",
      "Look for: Honda added a Sport trim level in 2022. A redesign for 2023 brought a more sophisticated and refined version of Honda\u2019s hybrid powertrain, which became standard on all higher-priced Accords that year.",

      "If the Accord Hybrid is too large, consider the smaller Insight sedan as an alternative. It gets better gas mileage, comfortably accommodates four people, and boasts a trunk as spacious as the trunks of some midsize cars. Honda based this version of the Insight on the popular Civic sedan, giving the Insight different styling and a more upscale-feeling interior. According to EPA combined estimates, you can expect 48 mpg to 52 mpg, depending on which trim level you choose. The Insight also boasts exceptionally good crash test ratings.",

      "Aside from its distinctive styling and impressive technology, what helps the Hyundai Elantra Hybrid stand apart is its dual-clutch automatic transmission. That design eliminates the typical acceleration drone common to hybrids, making the Elantra more satisfying to drive. It doesn\u2019t negatively impact fuel economy either. According to EPA combined estimates, this reasonably roomy compact car averages 50-54 mpg.",
      "Look for: The Blue trim level offers the best fuel economy. In 2024, Hyundai updated the styling, added more driver assist features, and improved the infotainment system.",

      "Toyota has been building Camry Hybrids for nearly two decades, and the car has earned a reputation for efficiency and longevity. Since 2018, a sense of style has also been a part of the recipe, and with the SE and XSE trim levels, there are hints of sportiness. The Camry isn\u2019t the roomiest midsize sedan available, but its EPA estimates of 46 mpg to 52 mpg, track record of durability, and impressive crash test ratings help make up for that.",

      "Health Secretary Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is vowing to \u201cfix\u201d the federal program for compensating Americans injured by vaccines, opening the door to sweeping changes for a system long targeted by anti-vaccine activists.",
      "Health experts and lawyers say updates are needed to help clear a backlog of cases in the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, created by Congress in 1986 as a no-fault payment system for presumed vaccine injuries.",
      "But they also worry Kennedy\u2019s changes will reflect his history as a leader in the anti-vaccine movement, which has alternately called for abolishing the program or expanding it to cover unproven injuries and illnesses that aren't connected to vaccines.",
      "Kennedy and other critics believe the program is \u201ctoo miserly in what it considers to be a vaccine injury,\u201d said Jason Schwartz, a public health expert at Yale University. \u201cThat\u2019s created great concern that he could expand what\u2019s included.\u201d",
      "Anti-vaccine groups have long suggested a link between vaccines and autism, despite scientific consensus that childhood vaccines don\u2019t cause the condition. Adding autism to the list of injuries covered by the plan \u201cwould dramatically increase the number of compensable cases, potentially bankrupting it,\" Schwartz said.",
      "Signed into law under President Ronald Reagan, the compensation program is designed to provide quick, efficient compensation to Americans who report known injuries associated with vaccines, such as rare allergic reactions. At the time of its creation, a number of vaccine-makers were exiting the business due to risks of class action lawsuits.",
      "In a recent social media post, Kennedy called the program \u201cbroken\u201d and accused federal lawyers and adjudicators who run it of \u201cinefficiency, favoritism and outright corruption.\u201d",
      "Kennedy didn\u2019t specify the changes he's seeking. But some of the people he\u2019s enlisted to help have a history of bringing vaccine injury cases.",
      "In June, the Department of Health and Human Services awarded a $150,000 contract to an Arizona law firm for \u201cexpertise\u201d in the program. The firm\u2019s Andrew Downing, an attorney specializing in vaccine injury cases, was listed in the HHS staff directory for a time.",

      "In a podcast last year for people with the condition, Downing lamented that the injury compensation program \u201chas taken a hard line\u201d against such cases, leading lawyers to file injury lawsuits in civil court.

      "BANGKOK -- President Donald Trump\u2019s new tariff rates on U.S. imports from dozens of countries took effect Thursday, the latest chapter in the saga of Trump\u2019s reshaping of global trade. But many questions remain.",
      "Trump has threatened tariffs of up to 200% on imports of pharmaceuticals and has ordered a 100% import tax on computer chips. Most U.S. imports of copper, steel and aluminum are subject to a 50% tariff.",
      "There\u2019s still no agreement on what tariffs might apply to products shipped from China. India has no deal yet and faces a potential 50% tariff as Trump pressures it to stop buying oil from Russia.",

      "Global financial markets took Thursday's tariff adjustments in stride, with Asian shares and U.S. futures mostly higher.",
      "Here's where things stand in what has proven to be a fast-changing policy landscape.",
      "The tariffs announced on Aug. 1 apply to 66 countries, Taiwan and the Falkland Islands. They are a revised version of what Trump called \" reciprocal tariffs,\" announced on April 2: import taxes of up to 50% on goods from countries that have a trade surplus with the United States, along with 10% \u201cbaseline\u2019\u2019 taxes on almost everyone else. That move triggered sell-offs in financial markets and Trump backtracked to allow time for trade talks.",
      "The president has bypassed Congress, which has authority over taxes, by invoking a 1977 law to declare the trade deficit a national emergency. That's being challenged in court, but the revised tariffs still took effect.",
      "To keep their access to the huge American market, major trading partners have struck deals with Trump. The United Kingdom agreed to 10% tariffs and the European Union, South Korea and Japan accepted U.S. tariffs of 15%. Those are much higher than the low single-digit rates they paid last year, but down from the 30% Trump had ordered for the EU and the 25% he ordered for Japan.",
      "Countries in Africa and Asia are mostly facing lower rates than the ones Trump decreed in April. Thailand, Pakistan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines cut deals with Trump, settling for rates of around 20%.",

      "India also has no broad trade agreement with Trump. On Wednesday, Trump he signed an executive order placing an extra 25% tariff for its purchases of Russian oil, bringing combined U.S. tariffs to 50%. India has stood firm, saying it began importing oil from Russia because traditional supplies were diverted to Europe after the outbreak of the Ukraine conflict.",

      "Trump unveiled sweeping import taxes on goods coming into the U.S. from 66 countries, the European Union, Taiwan and the Falkland Islands in April. He said the \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs were meant to boost domestic manufacturing and restore fairness to global trade.",
      "The president paused the country-specific tariffs a week later but applied a 10% tax to most imports. In early July, he began notifying countries that their exports would be subject to higher tariffs on Aug. 1 unless they reached trade deals. A week ago, he pushed the start date to Thursday.",
      "In the meantime, Trump announced a 35% tariff on imports from Canada, but delayed action on Mexico while negotiations continued. However, a free trade agreement reached with Mexico and Canada during Trump's first term shields most of those countries' products from punishing duties.",
      "The president also ordered a 50% tariff on goods from Brazil. This week, he signed an executive order to take India's tariff rate from 25% to 50% for its purchases of Russian oil. The timing gives India and Russia a chance to negotiate with the Trump administration.",
      "Other duties not specific to countries remain in place, such as a 50% tariff on imported aluminum and steel announced in June. Trump also threatened 100% tariffs on computer chips that aren\u2019t made in the U.S. The administration has said tariffs are still coming on imported pharmaceutical drugs.",
      "The U.S. Commerce Department reported on July 31 that prices rose 2.6% in June, up from an annual pace of 2.4% in May. Earlier in July, the government reported that its primary inflation measure, the Consumer Price Index, also ticked higher in June as the cost of furniture, toys and other frequently imported items increased.",
      "Shoppers should be prepared to pay more for clothes and shoes because the combined tariffs \u201cdisproportionately affect clothing and textiles,\u201d according to the Budget Lab at Yale. It estimates that shoe prices will go up 39% temporarily and stay 19% above where they are now. For apparel, the Budget Lab put the comparable figures at 37% and 18%.",

      "The Environmental Protection Agency has terminated $7 billion in funding for solar programs approved under the Biden administration, including projects for nearly 1 million households in low-income communities",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday terminated a $7 billion grant program that was intended to help pay for residential solar projects for more than 900,000 lower-income U.S. households.",
      "It's the latest Trump administration move hindering the nation\u2019s shift to cleaner energy.",

      "Solar, a renewable energy, is widely regarded as a way to introduce cleaner power onto the electrical grid and lower energy bills for American consumers.",
      "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement on social media that authority for the program was eliminated under the tax-and-spending bill signed last month by Republican President Donald Trump. The law eliminated the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund that was approved under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The fund set aside $20 billion in \u201cgreen bank\u201d money for community development projects to boost renewable energy, and an additional $7 billion for the solar program.",
      "\u201cThe bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,\u2033 Zeldin said. \u201cToday, the Trump EPA is announcing that we are ending Solar for All for good, saving US taxpayers ANOTHER $7 BILLION!\u201d",
      "Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt, who introduced the Solar for All program to slash electric bills for working families, called Zeldin\u2019s action illegal.",
      "\u201cSolar for All means lower utility bills, many thousands of good-paying jobs and real action to address the existential threat of climate change,\u2033 Sanders said in a statement. \u201dAt a time when working families are getting crushed by skyrocketing energy costs and the planet is literally burning, sabotaging this program isn\u2019t just wrong \u2014 it\u2019s absolutely insane. We will fight back to preserve this enormously important program.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has already targeted the \u201cgreen bank\u201d funds, first freezing the grants, then terminating the agreements altogether. Zeldin called them \u201ca clear cut case of waste and abuse\u201d and a \u201cgold bar\u201d scheme earlier this year.",
      "The EPA has argued that the tax and policy bill law repealed the green bank and allows the agency to rescind the money it has already obligated. The recipients of that money disagree. They say the bulk of the money had already been disbursed and isn\u2019t affected by the law.",
      "Grant recipients have filed lawsuits challenging the administration\u2019s actions, and a judge ruled in April the EPA cannot freeze the contracts.",

      "The work by sculptor lifelong Patriots fan Jeff Buccacio unveiled Friday on the plaza outside the team's Pro Shop and Hall of Fame features a hexagonal granite base and a 12-foot Brady, honoring Brady's uniform number and making good on Kraft's wish for it to be larger than life. It is 17 feet in all, representing the 17 AFC East titles the Patriots won in Brady's 19 seasons.",
      "In his remarks, Brady pretended to be interrupted by a call from former coach Bill Belichick giving his opinion of the statue.",

      "After qualifying for the NASCAR Cup Series playoffs with victories this season at Mexico City, Chicago and Sonoma, Shane van Gisbergen is bidding to join Chase Elliott and Jeff Gordon as the only drivers to win four consecutive races on road or street ...",
      "On the NASCAR tracks with the most circuitous sequence of turns, Shane van Gisbergen has shown a remarkably sublime sense of direction.",
      "But the Trackhouse Racing driver still needs help navigating his new life in the United States \u2014 such as the recent announcement of a 2026 street race in San Diego.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t even know where that is,\u201d the Auckland, New Zealand, native said with a laugh. \u201cI had to find it on a map. It\u2019ll be cool to go. I\u2019ve never been there and get to experience all new things.\u201d",
      "The Cup Series rookie is an old hand on road courses, which he mastered with 80 victories and three championships from 2007-22 in Supercars (the top racing series in Australia and New Zealand). Those results caught the eye of Trackhouse founder Justin Marks, who took a flier on putting van Gisbergen in a Cup car for the inaugural Chicago Street Race in July 2023.",
      "After stunning NASCAR at Chicago as the first driver to win his Cup debut since Johnny Rutherford in 1963, van Gisbergen relocated to NASCAR last year. He has won at Mexico City, Chicago and Sonoma this season, securing a playoff berth for the No. 88 Chevrolet and a multiyear extension at Trackhouse.",
      "With a victory Sunday at Watkins Glen International, a 2.45-mile road course in New York, the 36-year-old van Gisbergen would join 2020 champion Chase Elliott and NASCAR Hall of Famer Jeff Gordon as the only drivers to win four consecutive Cup races on road or street courses.",
      "Though van Gisbergen has only 37 career starts in NASCAR\u2019s premier series, his four victories already rank third among active drivers on street or road courses.",
      "\u201cThese guys have egos, and they are not OK with this,\u201d NASCAR on NBC analyst Steve Letarte said after van Gisbergen\u2019s win at Sonoma last month. \u201cWhen we go to Watkins Glen, I think it\u2019s basically 35 against one, because they\u2019ll be like, \u2018What can we do to bury this guy?\u2019\u201d",
      "It starts with getting close enough to rough up van Gisbergen, who has qualified first in his three wins. He won at Mexico City by 16.567 seconds, the Cup Series\u2019 largest margin of victory in more than 15 years and the largest gap on a road course in more than 45 years.",
      "He faced more pressure at Sonoma on multiple late restarts, but runner-up Chase Briscoe raced him cleanly (and then compared van Gisbergen's road course skills with Michael Jordan in his prime).",
      "\u201cI feel like everyone races really well, and I really love the racing here,\u201d van Gisbergen said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like anyone targets me on the track and tries to take me out, but I feel like we\u2019re the benchmark, which is really awesome. But the best thing on the road course is I\u2019ve never really raced the same guy. Every week, there\u2019s someone different. The spread of talent is quite high here.\u201d",
      "Chris Buescher is the only Cup driver to have gotten the best of him. Racing at Watkins Glen last year in a part-time Cup schedule, van Gisbergen missed a corner entry \u201cby centimeters\u201d and lost to the Roush Fenway Keselowski driver on a last-lap pass.",

      "He also is a humble perfectionist in addressing his inexperience on oval tracks, which comprise the bulk of the NASCAR schedule. On the advice of 2014 Cup champion Kevin Harvick, van Gisbergen has spent his summer racing Tuesday nights at Charlotte Motor Speedway against preteens in miniature stock cars on a quarter-mile oval.",
      "He recently earned his first win on the short track, whose four turns encourage the full-contact racing that largely is absent on road courses.",
      "\u201cI had 12-year-olds bump me and know exactly how to place their car, and I\u2019d never hit anyone on purpose to pass them,\u201d said van Gisbergen, who made his oval debut only two years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s a skill that we don\u2019t get taught because you\u2019re not allowed to do it (in Supercars). So yeah, it\u2019s been really beneficial and a lot of fun. It\u2019s just more racing and more combat.\u201d",
      "He figures to be battle-tested when the Cup playoffs begin in three weeks. The first round is held exclusively at ovals, where van Gisbergen has an average finish of 26.7, but he will start the playoffs with a points cushion because of his wins.",
      "He is confident of advancing to the second round simply by avoiding mistakes at tracks located in Darlington, South Carolina, suburban St. Louis and Bristol, Tennessee \u2014 while also enjoying their divergent cultures.",
      "\u201cAustralia is the same size country, but from one side to the other, there\u2019s not much difference in the accents,\u201d van Gisbergen said. \u201cHere, it\u2019s very diverse, and the way people talk is so different. Every part of the country feels like a different country. It\u2019s been an awesome experience just trying to learn about it.\u201d",
      "According to BetMGM Sportsbook, van Gisbergen (+125) is the favorite, followed by Connor Zilisch (+500), Christopher Bell (+1200) and Kyle Larson (+1200). \u2026 With his 63rd start on a road or street course Sunday, Kyle Busch will tie Terry Labonte for most in Cup Series history. Both of Busch\u2019s top-five finishes this season have been on a road or street course (fifth at Circuit of The Americas and Chicago). \u2026 Three-time and defending series champion Joey Logano will become the 13th Cup driver to make 600 consecutive starts.",

      "So much attention is on the top 50 in the FedEx Cup who advance out of the first postseason event. Fleetwood is already locked in all the way to the finale at the Tour Championship. What he cares about is winning.",
      "\u201cIt hasn't happened for me yet out on the PGA Tour, but I would much rather be up there and not quite get it done than not there at all,\u201d Fleetwood said. \u201cAnd who knows? Maybe this weekend is the weekend and we'll see, and we'll crack on from there.\u201d",
      "Fleetwood was at 13-under 127, four shots clear of Collin Morikawa (65) and Akshay Bhatia (69). Justin Rose also was at 9-under par after a birdie on the par-5 16th. Storms rolled into the area, forcing spectators to leave the course and suspending play until Saturday morning.",
      "Fleetwood finished with four straight birdies on Thursday. He made three in a row early, including a 30-footer from the fringe on the par-3 fourth hole at the TPC Southwind. He also had a pair of key par saves around the turn before going on another run.",
      "He holed a pair of 15-foot birdie putts on the 13th and 14th. He stuffed a wedge to 5 feet for birdie on the 15th. And then he reached the par-5 16th in two and two-putted from about 30 feet for a fourth straight birdie.",

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Amid rising electric bills, states are under pressure to insulate regular household and business ratepayers from the costs of feeding Big Tech's energy-hungry data centers.",
      "It's not clear that any state has a solution and the actual effect of data centers on electricity bills is difficult to pin down. Some critics question whether states have the spine to take a hard line against tech behemoths like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta.",
      "But more than a dozen states have begun taking steps as data centers drive a rapid build-out of power plants and transmission lines.",
      "That has meant pressuring the nation's biggest power grid operator to clamp down on price increases, studying the effect of data centers on electricity bills or pushing data center owners to pay a larger share of local transmission costs.",
      "Rising power bills are \u201csomething legislators have been hearing a lot about. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve been hearing a lot about. More people are speaking out at the public utility commission in the past year than I\u2019ve ever seen before,\u201d said Charlotte Shuff of the Oregon Citizens\u2019 Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group. \u201cThere\u2019s a massive outcry.\u201d",
      "Some data centers could require more electricity than cities the size of Pittsburgh, Cleveland or New Orleans, and make huge factories look tiny by comparison. That's pushing policymakers to rethink a system that, historically, has spread transmission costs among classes of consumers that are proportional to electricity use.",
      "\u201cA lot of this infrastructure, billions of dollars of it, is being built just for a few customers and a few facilities and these happen to be the wealthiest companies in the world,\u201d said Ari Peskoe, who directs the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard University. \u201cI think some of the fundamental assumptions behind all this just kind of breaks down.\u201d",
      "A fix, Peskoe said, is a \u201ccan of worms\" that pits ratepayer classes against one another.",
      "Some officials downplay the role of data centers in pushing up electric bills.",
      "Tricia Pridemore, who sits on Georgia\u2019s Public Service Commission and is president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, pointed to an already tightened electricity supply and increasing costs for power lines, utility poles, transformers and generators as utilities replace aging equipment or harden it against extreme weather.",
      "The data centers needed to accommodate the artificial intelligence boom are still in the regulatory planning stages, Pridemore said, and the Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech firms and data center developers, has said its members are committed to paying their fair share.",
      "But growing evidence suggests that the electricity bills of some Americans are rising to subsidize the massive energy needs of Big Tech as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.",
      "Data and analytics firm Wood Mackenzie published a report in recent weeks that suggested 20 proposed or effective specialized rates for data centers in 16 states it studied aren\u2019t nearly enough to cover the cost of a new natural gas power plant.",
      "In other words, unless utilities negotiate higher specialized rates, other ratepayer classes \u2014 residential, commercial and industrial \u2014 are likely paying for data center power needs.",
      "Meanwhile, Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog for the mid-Atlantic grid, produced research in June showing that 70% \u2014 or $9.3 billion \u2014 of last year's increased electricity cost was the result of data center demand.",
      "Last year, five governors led by Pennsylvania's Josh Shapiro began pushing back against power prices set by the mid-Atlantic grid operator, PJM Interconnection, after that amount spiked nearly sevenfold. They warned of customers \u201cpaying billions more than is necessary.\u201d",

      "The announcement came more than three months after Trump temporarily exempted most electronics from his administration\u2019s most onerous tariffs.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, a shortage of computer chips increased the price of autos and contributed to higher inflation. Chorzempa said chip tariffs could again raise prices by hundreds of dollars per vehicle if the semiconductors inside a car are not exempt.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a chip that allows you to open and close the window,\" Chorzempa said. \"There\u2019s a chip that is running the entertainment system. There is a chip that\u2019s kind of running all the electronics. There are chips, especially in EVs, that are doing power management, all that kind of stuff.\u201d",
      "Much of the investment into building U.S. chip factories began with the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act that President Joe Biden signed into law in 2022, providing more than $50 billion to support new computer chip plants, fund research and train workers for the industry.",
      "Trump has vocally opposed those financial incentives and taken a different approach, betting that the threat of dramatically higher chip costs would force most companies to open factories domestically, despite the risk that tariffs could squeeze corporate profits and push up prices for electronics.",

      "ChatGPT will tell 13-year-olds how to get drunk and high, instruct them on how to conceal eating disorders and even compose a heartbreaking suicide letter to their parents if asked, according to new research from a watchdog group.",
      "The Associated Press reviewed more than three hours of interactions between ChatGPT and researchers posing as vulnerable teens. The chatbot typically provided warnings against risky activity but went on to deliver startlingly detailed and personalized plans for drug use, calorie-restricted diets or self-injury.",
      "The researchers at the Center for Countering Digital Hate also repeated their inquiries on a large scale, classifying more than half of ChatGPT\u2019s 1,200 responses as dangerous.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to test the guardrails,\u201d said Imran Ahmed, the group's CEO. \u201cThe visceral initial response is, \u2018Oh my Lord, there are no guardrails.\u2019 The rails are completely ineffective. They\u2019re barely there \u2014 if anything, a fig leaf.\u201d",
      "OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, said after viewing the report Tuesday that its work is ongoing in refining how the chatbot can \u201cidentify and respond appropriately in sensitive situations.\u201d",
      "\u201cSome conversations with ChatGPT may start out benign or exploratory but can shift into more sensitive territory,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "OpenAI didn't directly address the report's findings or how ChatGPT affects teens, but said it was focused on \u201cgetting these kinds of scenarios right\u201d with tools to \u201cbetter detect signs of mental or emotional distress\" and improvements to the chatbot's behavior.",
      "The study published Wednesday comes as more people \u2014 adults as well as children \u2014 are turning to artificial intelligence chatbots for information, ideas and companionship.",
      "About 800 million people, or roughly 10% of the world\u2019s population, are using ChatGPT, according to a July report from JPMorgan Chase.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s technology that has the potential to enable enormous leaps in productivity and human understanding,\" Ahmed said. \"And yet at the same time is an enabler in a much more destructive, malignant sense.\u201d",
      "Ahmed said he was most appalled after reading a trio of emotionally devastating suicide notes that ChatGPT generated for the fake profile of a 13-year-old girl \u2014 with one letter tailored to her parents and others to siblings and friends.",
      "\u201cI started crying,\u201d he said in an interview.",
      "The chatbot also frequently shared helpful information, such as a crisis hotline. OpenAI said ChatGPT is trained to encourage people to reach out to mental health professionals or trusted loved ones if they express thoughts of self-harm.",
      "But when ChatGPT refused to answer prompts about harmful subjects, researchers were able to easily sidestep that refusal and obtain the information by claiming it was \u201cfor a presentation\u201d or a friend.",
      "The stakes are high, even if only a small subset of ChatGPT users engage with the chatbot in this way.",
      "In the U.S., more than 70% of teens are turning to AI chatbots for companionship and half use AI companions regularly, according to a recent study from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using digital media sensibly.",

      "\u201cPeople rely on ChatGPT too much,\u201d Altman said at a conference. \u201cThere\u2019s young people who just say, like, \u2018I can\u2019t make any decision in my life without telling ChatGPT everything that\u2019s going on.

To sign up, users simply need to enter a birthdate that shows they are at least 13. Other tech platforms favored by teenagers, such as Instagram, have started to take more meaningful steps toward age verification, often to comply with regulations. They also steer children to more restricted accounts.",

      "Hundreds of Harvard researchers have fallen victim to the freeze on funding by the Trump administration",
      "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Harvard University professor Alberto Ascherio's research is literally frozen.",
      "Collected from millions of U.S. soldiers over two decades using millions of dollars from taxpayers, the epidemiology and nutrition scientist has blood samples stored in liquid nitrogen freezers within the university\u2019s T.H. Chan School of Public Health.",
      "The samples are key to his award-winning research, which seeks a cure to multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases. But for months, Ascherio has been unable to work with the samples because he lost $7 million in federal research funding, a casualty of Harvard's fight with the Trump administration.",
      "\u201cIt's like we have been creating a state-of-the-art telescope to explore the universe, and now we don\u2019t have money to launch it,\u201d said Ascherio. \u201cWe built everything and now we are ready to use it to make a new discovery that could impact millions of people in the world and then, 'Poof. You're being cut off.'\u201d",
      "The loss of an estimated $2.6 billion in federal funding at Harvard has meant that some of the world's most prominent researchers are laying off young researchers. They are shelving years or even decades of research, into everything from opioid addiction to cancer.",
      "And despite Harvard's lawsuits against the administration, and settlement talks between the warring parties, researchers are confronting the fact that some of their work may never resume.",
      "The funding cuts are part of a monthslong battle that the Trump administration has waged against some the country's top universities including Columbia, Brown and Northwestern. The administration has taken a particularly aggressive stance against Harvard, freezing funding after the country's oldest university rejected a series of government demands issued by a federal antisemitism task force.",
      "The government had demanded sweeping changes at Harvard related to campus protests, academics and admissions \u2014 meant to address government accusations that the university had become a hotbed of liberalism and tolerated anti-Jewish harassment.",
      "Harvard responded by filing a federal lawsuit, accusing the Trump administration of waging a retaliation campaign against the university. In the lawsuit, it laid out reforms it had taken to address antisemitism but also vowed not to \u201csurrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.\u201d",
      "\u201cMake no mistake: Harvard rejects antisemitism and discrimination in all of its forms and is actively making structural reforms to eradicate antisemitism on campus,\" the university said in its legal complaint. \u201cBut rather than engage with Harvard regarding those ongoing efforts, the Government announced a sweeping freeze of funding for medical, scientific, technological, and other research that has nothing at all to do with antisemitism.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration denies the cuts were made in retaliation, saying the grants were under review even before the demands were sent in April. It argues the government has wide discretion to cancel federal contracts for policy reasons.",
      "The funding cuts have left Harvard's research community in a state of shock, feeling as if they are being unfairly targeted in a fight has nothing to do with them. Some have been forced to shutter labs or scramble to find non-government funding to replace lost money.",
      "In May, Harvard announced that it would put up at least $250 million of its own money to continue research efforts, but university President Alan Garber warned of \u201cdifficult decisions and sacrifices\u201d ahead.",
      "Ascherio said the university was able to pull together funding to pay his researchers\u2019 salaries until next June. But he\u2019s still been left without resources needed to fund critical research tasks, like lab work. Even a year's delay can put his research back five years, he said.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s really devastating,\u201d agreed Rita Hamad, the director of the Social Policies for Health Equity Research Center at Harvard, who had three multiyear grants totaling $10 million canceled by the Trump administration. The grants funded research into the impact of school segregation on heart health, how pandemic-era policies in over 250 counties affected mental health, and the role of neighborhood factors in dementia.",
      "At the School of Public Health, where Hamad is based, 190 grants have been terminated, affecting roughly 130 scientists.",
      "\u201cJust thinking about all the knowledge that\u2019s not going to be gained or that is going to be actively lost,\" Hamad said. She expects significant layoffs on her team if the funding freeze continues for a few more months. \"It\u2019s all just a mixture of frustration and anger and sadness all the time, every day.\"",
      "John Quackenbush, a professor of computational biology and bioinformatics at the School of Public Health, has spent the past few months enduring cuts on multiple fronts.",
      "In April, a multimillion dollar grant was not renewed, jeopardizing a study into the role sex plays in disease. In May, he lost about $1.2 million in federal funding for in the coming year due to the Harvard freeze. Four departmental grants worth $24 million that funded training of doctoral students also were cancelled as part of the fight with the Trump administration, Quackenbush said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m in a position where I have to really think about, \u2018Can I revive this research?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cCan I restart these programs even if Harvard and the Trump administration reached some kind of settlement? If they do reach a settlement, how quickly can the funding be turned back on? Can it be turned back on?\u201d",
      "The researchers all agreed that the funding cuts have little or nothing to do with the university's fight against antisemitism. Some, however, argue changes at Harvard were long overdue and pressure from the Trump administration was necessary.",
      "Bertha Madras, a Harvard psychobiologist who lost funding to create a free, parent-focused training to prevent teen opioid overdose and drug use, said she\u2019s happy to see the culling of what she called \u201cpolitically motivated social science studies.\u201d",
      "Madras said pressure from the White House has catalyzed much-needed reform at the university, where several programs of study have \u201creally gone off the wall in terms of being shaped by orthodoxy that is not representative of the country as a whole.\u201d",
      "But Madras, who served on the President\u2019s Commission on Opioids during Trump\u2019s first term, said holding scientists\u2019 research funding hostage as a bargaining chip doesn\u2019t make sense.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if reform would have happened without the president of the United States pointing the bony finger at Harvard,\" she said. \u201cBut sacrificing science is problematic, and it\u2019s very worrisome because it is one of the major pillars of strength of the country.\u201d",
      "Quackenbush and other Harvard researchers argue the cuts are part of a larger attack on science by the Trump administration that puts the country's reputation as the global research leader at risk. Support for students and post-doctoral fellows has been slashed, visas for foreign scholars threatened, and new guidelines and funding cuts at the NIH will make it much more difficult to get federal funding in the future, they said. It also will be difficult to replace federal funding with money from the private sector.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all sort of moving toward this future in which this 80-year partnership between the government and the universities is going to be jeopardized,\u201d Quackenbush said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to face real challenges in continuing to lead the world in scientific excellence.\u201d",

      "The technology can also involve law enforcement in responses to mental health crises. In Florida's Polk County Schools, a district of more than 100,000 students, the school safety program received nearly 500 Gaggle alerts over four years, officers said in public Board of Education meetings. This led to 72 involuntary hospitalization cases under the Baker Act, a state law that allows authorities to require mental health evaluations for people against their will if they pose a risk to themselves or others.",
      "\u201cA really high number of children who experience involuntary examination remember it as a really traumatic and damaging experience \u2014 not something that helps them with their mental health care,\u201d said Sam Boyd, an attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center. The Polk and West Palm Beach school districts did not provide comments.",
      "Information that could allow schools to assess the software\u2019s effectiveness, such as the rate of false alerts, is closely held by technology companies and unavailable publicly unless schools track the data themselves.",
      "Gaggle alerted more than 1,200 incidents to the Lawrence, Kansas, school district in a recent 10-month period. But almost two-thirds of those alerts were deemed by school officials to be non-issues \u2014 including over 200 false alarms from student homework, according to an Associated Press analysis of data received via a public records request.",
      "Students in one photography class were called to the principal\u2019s office over concerns Gaggle had detected nudity. The photos had been automatically deleted from the students\u2019 Google Drives, but students who had backups of the flagged images on their own devices showed it was a false alarm. District officials said they later adjusted the software's settings to reduce false alerts.",

She was among a group of student journalists and artists at Lawrence High School who filed a lawsuit against the school system last week, alleging Gaggle subjected them to unconstitutional surveillance.",
      "School officials have said they take concerns about Gaggle seriously, but also say the technology has detected dozens of imminent threats of suicide or violence.",
      "\u201cSometimes you have to look at the trade for the greater good,\u201d said Board of Education member Anne Costello in a July 2024 board meeting.",
      "Two years after their ordeal, Mathis said her daughter is doing better, although she\u2019s still \u201cterrified\u201d of running into one of the school officers who arrested her. One bright spot, she said, was the compassion of the teachers at her daughter\u2019s alternative school.

      "Roblox, the online gaming platform wildly popular with children and teenagers, is rolling out an open-source version of an artificial intelligence system it says can help preemptively detect predatory language in game chats.",
      "The move comes as the company faces lawsuits and criticism accusing it of not doing enough to protect children from predators. For instance, a lawsuit filed last month in Iowa alleges that a 13-year-old girl was introduced to an adult predator on Roblox, then kidnapped and trafficked across multiple states and raped. The suit, filed in Iowa District Court in Polk County, claims that Roblox's design features make children who use it \u201ceasy prey for pedophiles.\u201d",
      "Roblox says it strives to make its systems as safe as possible by default but notes that \u201cno system is perfect, and one of the biggest challenges in the industry is to detect critical harms like potential child endangerment.\u201d",
      "The AI system, called Sentinel, helps detect early signs of possible child endangerment, such as sexually exploitative language. Roblox says the system has led the company to submit 1,200 reports of potential attempts at child exploitation to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in the first half of 2025. The company is now in the process of open-sourcing it so other platforms can use it too.",
      "Preemptively detecting possible dangers to kids can be tricky for AI systems \u2014 and humans, too \u2014 because conversations can seem innocuous at first. Questions like \u201chow old are you?\u201d or \u201cwhere are you from?\u201d wouldn't necessarily raise red flags on their own, but when put in context over the course of a longer conversation, they can take on a different meaning.",
      "Roblox, which has more than 111 million monthly users, doesn't allow users to share videos or images in chats and tries to block any personal information such as phone numbers, though \u2014 as with most moderation rules \u2014 people constantly find ways to get around such safeguards.",
      "It also doesn't allow kids under 13 to chat with other users outside of games unless they have explicit parental permission \u2014 and unlike many other platforms, it does not encrypt private chat conversations, so it can monitor and moderate them.",

      "Sentinel captures one-minute snapshots of chats across Roblox \u2014 about 6 billion messages per day \u2014 and analyzes them for potential harms. To do this, Roblox says it developed two indexes \u2014 one made up of benign messages and, the other, chats that were determined to contain child endangerment violations. Roblox says this lets the system recognize harmful patterns that go beyond simply flagging certain words or phrases, taking the entire conversation into context.",
      "\u201cThat index gets better as we detect more bad actors, we just continuously update that index. Then we have another sample of what does a normal, regular user do?\" said Naren Koneru, vice president of engineering for trust and safety at Roblox.",

      "HERMOSILLO, Mexico -- The United States\u2019 suspension of live cattle imports from Mexico hit at the worst possible time for rancher Mart\u00edn Ibarra Vargas, who after two years of severe drought had hoped to put his family on better footing selling his calves across the northern border.",
      "Like his father and grandfather before him, Ibarra Vargas has raised cattle on the parched soil of Sonora, the state in northwestern Mexico that shares a long border with the United States, particularly Arizona. His family has faced punishing droughts before but has never before had to contend with the economic hit of a new scourge: the New World Screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite.",
      "U.S. agriculture officials halted live cattle crossing the border in July \u2013 the third suspension of the past eight months \u2014 due to concerns about the flesh-eating maggot which has been found in southern Mexico and is creeping north.",
      "The screwworm is a larva of the Cochliomyia hominivorax fly that can invade the tissues of any warm-blooded animal, including humans. The parasite enters animals\u2019 skin, causing severe damage and lesions that can be fatal. Infected animals are a serious threat to herds.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture calls it a \"devastating pest\" and said in June that it poses a threat to \u201cour livestock industry, our economy, and our food supply chain.\u201d It has embarked on other steps to keep it out of the United States, which eradicated it decades ago.",
      "As part of its strategy the U.S. is preparing to breed billions of sterile flies and release them in Mexico and southern Texas. The aim is for the sterile males to mate with females in the wild who then produce no offspring.",
      "The U.S. ban on live cattle also applies to horses and bison imports. It hit a ranching sector already weakened by drought and specifically a cattle export business that generated $1.2 billion for Mexico last year. This year, Mexican ranchers have exported fewer than 200,000 head of cattle, which is less than half what they historically send in the same period.",
      "For Ibarra Vargas, considered a comparatively small rancher by Sonora\u2019s beef-centric standards, the inability to send his calves across the border has made him rethink everything.",
      "The repeated bans on Mexican cows by U.S. authorities has pushed his family to branch into beekeeping, raising sheep and selling cow's milk. What he earns is just a fraction of what he earned by exporting live cattle, but he is trying to hold on through the lean times.",

      "\u201cAt least it lets us continue\u201d ranching, the 57-year-old said with a white cowboy hat perched on his head.",
      "Even as ranchers in Sonora intensify their efforts to make sure the parasitic fly never makes it into their state, they\u2019ve had to seek new markets.",
      "In the past two months, they\u2019ve sold more than 35,000 mature cows within Mexico at a significant loss.",

      "Starting in 2013, a mysterious sea star wasting disease sparked a mass die-off from Mexico to Alaska. The epidemic has devastated more than 20 species and continues today. Worst hit was a species called the sunflower sea star, which lost around 90% of its population in the outbreak\u2019s first five years.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really quite gruesome,\u201d said marine disease ecologist Alyssa Gehman at the Hakai Institute in British Columbia, Canada, who helped pinpoint the cause.",

      "Now that scientists know the cause, they have a better shot at intervening to help sea stars.",
      "Prentice said that scientists could potentially now test which of the remaining sea stars are still healthy \u2014 and consider whether to relocate them, or breed them in captivity to later transplant them to areas that have lost almost all their sunflower sea stars.",
      "Scientists may also test if some populations have natural immunity, and if treatments like probiotics may help boost immunity to the disease.",
      "Such recovery work is not only important for sea stars, but for entire Pacific ecosystems because healthy starfish gobble up excess sea urchins, researchers say.",

      "With many fewer sea stars, the sea urchins that they usually munch on exploded in population \u2013 and in turn gobbled up around 95% of the kelp forest s in Northern California within a decade.

      "Zelenskyy said Ukraine \u201cwill not give Russia any awards for what it has done\u201d and that \u201cUkrainians will not give their land to the occupier.\u201d",
      "The remarks came after Trump said Friday that he would meet with Vladimir Putin even if the Russian leader would not meet with Zelenskyy. The Trump-Putin meeting, scheduled for Friday in Alaska, is seen as a potential breakthrough in the more than three-year war.",
      "Zelenskyy dismissed the planned summit, warning that any negotiations to end Europe\u2019s biggest conflict since World War II must include Kyiv.",
      "\u201cAny decisions that are without Ukraine are at the same time decisions against peace. They will not bring anything. These are dead decisions. They will never work,\u201d he said.",
      "In a statement posted to Telegram, Zelenskyy said Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity, enshrined in the constitution, must be nonnegotiable, and emphasized that lasting peace must include Ukraine\u2019s voice at the table.",
      "Ukrainian officials had previously told The Associated Press privately that Kyiv would be amenable to a peace deal that would de facto recognize Ukraine\u2019s inability to regain lost territories militarily.",
      "The Trump-Putin meeting may prove pivotal in a war that began when Russia invaded its western neighbor and has led to tens of thousands of deaths, although there\u2019s no guarantee it will stop the fighting since Moscow and Kyiv remain far apart on their conditions for peace.",
      "\u201cIt seems entirely logical for our delegation to fly across the Bering Strait simply, and for such an important and anticipated summit of the leaders of the two countries to be held in Alaska,\u201d Putin\u2019s foreign affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov, said Saturday in a statement posted to the Kremlin's news channel.",

      "Trump said his meeting with Putin would come before any sit-down discussion involving Zelenskyy. His announcement that he planned to host one of America\u2019s adversaries on U.S. soil broke with expectations that they\u2019d meet in a third country. The gesture gives Putin validation after the U.S. and its allies had long sought to make him a pariah over his war against Ukraine.",
      "Nigel Gould-Davies, a senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told the AP that the \u201csymbology\u201d of holding the summit in Alaska was clear, and that the location \u201cnaturally favors Russia.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s easy to imagine Putin making the point. \u2026 We once had this territory and we gave it to you, therefore Ukraine had this territory and now should give it to us,\u201d he said, referring to the 1867 transaction known as the Alaska Purchase when Russia sold Alaska to the United States for $7.2 million.",
      "On the streets of Kyiv, reactions to the idea of Ukraine ceding territory to Russia ranged from skepticism to quiet resignation.",
      "\u201cIt may not be capitulation, but it would be a loss,\u201d said Ihor Usatenko, a 67-year-old pensioner, who said he would consider ceding territory \u201con condition for compensation and, possibly, some reparations.\u201d",

I don\u2019t want to compromise within myself,\u201d she told the AP. \u201cBut seeing all these deaths and knowing that my mother is now living in Nikopol under shelling and my father is fighting, I want all this to end as soon as possible.\u201d",

      "\"Such a decision must have consequences for EU-Israel relations,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "A White House official says the Trump administration is seeking a $1 billion settlement from the University of California, Los Angeles",
      "The Trump administration is seeking a $1 billion settlement from the University of California, Los Angeles, a White House official said Friday, weeks after the Department of Justice accused the school of antisemitism and other civil rights violations.",
      "UCLA is the first public university to be targeted by a widespread funding freeze over allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action.",
      "President Donald Trump's administration has frozen or paused federal funding over similar allegations against elite private colleges. In recent weeks, the administration has struck deals with Brown University for $50 million and Columbia University for $221 million but has explored larger settlements, such as in its ongoing battle with Harvard University.",
      "The White House official did not detail any additional demands the administration has made to UCLA or elaborate on the settlement amount. The person was not authorized to speak publicly about the request and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "The Trump administration had suspended $584 million in federal grants for UCLA, the university said this week. The Department of Justice\u2019s Civil Rights Division issued a finding that UCLA violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \u201cby acting with deliberate indifference in creating a hostile educational environment for Jewish and Israeli students.\u201d",
      "The university had drawn widespread criticism for how it handled dispersing an encampment of Israel-Hamas war protesters in 2024. One night, counterprotesters attacked the encampment, throwing traffic cones and firing pepper spray, with fighting that continued for hours, injuring more than a dozen people, before police stepped in. The next day, after hundreds defied orders to leave, more than 200 people were arrested. Later, Jewish students said demonstrators in encampments blocked them from getting to class.",
      "The University of California\u2019s president, James B. Milliken, said Friday the university had \u201cjust received\u201d a document from the Department of Justice and would review it. He said the size of the proposed settlement would \u201cdevastate\u201d the University of California, whose campuses are viewed as some of the top public colleges in the nation.",
      "\u201cEarlier this week, we offered to engage in good faith dialogue with the Department to protect the University and its critical research mission,\u201d said Milliken, who started as president last week. \u201cAs a public university, we are stewards of taxpayer resources and a payment of this scale would completely devastate our country\u2019s greatest public university system as well as inflict great harm on our students and all Californians.\u201d",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday accused Trump of trying to silence academic freedom in his attack on such a prestigious public university system.",
      "\u201cHe has threatened us through extortion with a billion-dollar fine unless we do his bidding,\u201d Newsom told reporters. Apparently referencing the settlements with Columbia and Brown, he added: \u201cWe will not be like some of those other institutions that have followed a different path.\u201d",
      "The $1 billion demand in the UCLA settlement is linked to Newsom\u2019s status as one of Trump\u2019s most outspoken foes, said Peter McDonough, vice president and general counsel at the American Council on Education, an association of college presidents.",

      "The Trump administration has used its control of federal funding to push for reforms at elite colleges that the president decries as overrun by liberalism and antisemitism. The administration also has launched investigations into diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, saying they discriminate against white and Asian American students.",
      "Last month, Columbia University agreed to pay $200 million as part of a settlement to resolve investigations into the government\u2019s allegations that the school violated federal antidiscrimination laws. The agreement also restored more than $400 million in research grants.",
      "The Trump administration is using its deal with Columbia as a template for other universities, with financial penalties that are now seen as an expectation. For instance, the administration is pressing for a deal that would require Harvard to pay far more than Columbia's $200 million. Harvard leaders have been negotiating with the White House even as they battle in court to regain access to billions in federal research funding terminated by the Trump administration.",
      "UCLA has already reached one settlement about the 2024 protests. The university agreed last week to pay $6 million to settle a lawsuit from three Jewish students and a Jewish professor who argued the university violated their civil rights by allowing pro-Palestinian protesters to block their access to classes and other areas on campus in 2024.",
      "UCLA initially had argued that it had no legal responsibility over the issue because protesters, not the university, blocked Jewish students\u2019 access to areas. The university also worked with law enforcement to thwart attempts to set up new protest camps.",
      "But in a preliminary injunction a year earlier, U.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi disagreed and ordered UCLA to create a plan to protect Jewish students on campus. The University of California has since created systemwide campus guidelines on protests, with an Office of Campus and Community Safety at UCLA.",
      "As part of the settlement, UCLA said it will contribute $2.3 million to eight organizations that combat antisemitism and support the university\u2019s Jewish community. UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk, whose Jewish father and grandparents fled Nazi Germany to Mexico and whose wife is the daughter of a Holocaust survivor, also launched an initiative to combat antisemitism and anti-Israeli bias.",

      "An autopsy has been conducted on a man who officials say killed his neighbor in rural Pennsylvania before unleashing a hail of gunfire on first responders",
      "A man fatally shot his neighbor in rural Pennsylvania and then unleashed a hail of gunfire on first responders, wounding two state troopers, running an EMT off the road and sniping a police drone from the sky, officials said.",
      "The chaotic scene unfolded Thursday morning after Thompson resident Lori Wasko\u2019s boyfriend called police to report gunfire. Police arrived to find the 57-year-old woman dead and her 61-year-old neighbor, Carmine Faino, lying in wait to ambush them.",
      "One of the wounded troopers commandeered a tractor trailer to block the roadway and prevent other motorists from driving into harm\u2019s way as police say Faino continued to shoot, targeting a police drone as he holed up near a propane tank that officials feared could be used as a bomb. He also fired at an SUV driven by an emergency worker before being shot and killed by police.",
      "The Susquehanna County coroner\u2019s office said an autopsy was conducted Friday morning on Faino, but the results were not immediately available. Police have not said what led to the shootings.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to speak to his motive leading up to this. I would say you can draw certain conclusions from the standpoint that we believe Faino shot our victim prior to our arrival and then from a position of tactical advantage fired dozens and dozens of rounds,\u201d state police Col. Christopher Paris said.",
      "He said Trooper Joseph Perechinsky applied a tourniquet to his injured colleague, Trooper William Jenkins, and, despite his own injuries, ordered the driver of a tractor trailer to block the road.",
      "Perechinsky was \u201cstill thinking at that point in time, after being shot twice in the chest, what can I do to secure this location? What can I do to make sure nobody else gets hurt?\u201d Paris said.",
      "Gov. Josh Shapiro called the two troopers heroes and said Perechinsky \u201csaved lives.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe acted decisively. He acted thoughtfully. And the work he did today exemplifies the absolute best of the Pennsylvania State Police,\u201d Shapiro said.",
      "A spokesperson for Geisinger, a hospital network where the two wounded troopers are being treated, said in an email that, as of late Friday morning, Jenkins was listed in good condition and Perechinsky in fair condition. Both had been wearing ballistic vests and are \u201clucky to be alive,\u201d Paris said.",
      "The shooting happened in Thompson Township, some 163 miles (262 kilometers) north of Philadelphia. The township has long been without its own police force and, like much of Susquehanna County, relies on the state police for emergency response, which is free to local taxpayers. About one-quarter of Pennsylvanians \u2014 largely in rural areas \u2014 receive some sort of police coverage from the state police.",

The question is at the heart of a power play in Texas, where Republicans are trying to reshape the state\u2019s congressional boundaries to help them maintain control of the House in next year\u2019s midterm elections.",

      "Every state decides how to draw its own congressional boundaries. Some, like California, rely on independent redistricting commissions, while most leave it to the state Legislature and the governor to hammer out a plan. It\u2019s states where one party controls all the levers of government where redistricting dramas like the one in Texas often play out as the majority tries to maximize its power.",

      "The city settled with Immanueal Clark's estate, which had filed a wrongful-death lawsuit last year, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported. An officer mistook the 30-year-old as someone involved in an armed robbery earlier in the evening and shot him in the back as he fled from a police stop in November 2022.",
      "The news outlet, citing a database maintained by the advocacy group Portland Copwatch, reported it was the largest settlement on record paid by the city to an individual plaintiff.",
      "City councilors unanimously approved the settlement on Thursday after a meeting in which they questioned disagreement within the police department over whether the shooting was proper. An internal affairs investigator had found the officer who shot Clark violated bureau policy; the city\u2019s Police Review Board, which includes four members from the police department, two community members and an independent city staffer, voted 4-3 that the shooting was within policy, OPB reported.",
      "Police Chief Bob Day told councilors that while he was angered by Clark's death, it was his final decision to deem the shooting appropriate as he believed Officer Chris Sathoff acted reasonably according to the facts available at the time, OPB reported.",
      "A grand jury cleared Sathoff of criminal wrongdoing in 2023.",
      "The night of the shooting, a 911 caller told dispatchers he had been robbed at gunpoint in the parking lot of a fast-food restaurant by men who were \u201cdefinitely white.\u201d Officers mistook Clark's sedan as being involved in the robbery, and when they approached it in a church parking lot, Clark, who was Black, fled on foot.",

      "LONDON -- U.S. Vice President JD Vance is expected to meet with U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy on Friday at a stately home south of London before heading off on a family vacation in the the Cotswolds, a trendy retreat in the English countryside.",
      "Vance and Lammy, who come from opposite ends of the political spectrum but have made a personal connection through their hardscrabble childhoods and Christian faith, will hold talks at the foreign secretary\u2019s official country residence, known as Chevening.",
      "The meeting comes as the United Kingdom tries to come to favorable terms for steel and aluminum exports to the U.S. as the two sides work out details of a broader trade deal announced at the end of June. Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza are also likely to be on the agenda amid debates between Washington and London about the best way to end those conflicts.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that he hoped to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump next week. Those comments came a day before Trump\u2019s deadline for Moscow to show progress in ending the nearly 3\u00bd-year war in Ukraine.",
      "While Trump has focused on bilateral talks with Putin, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and other European leaders have stressed that Ukraine must be part of any negotiations on ending the war.",
      "The U.S. and Britain, which have historically close ties known as \u201cthe special relationship,\u201d have also disagreed on their approach to ending the war in Gaza.",
      "Starmer said last week that the U.K. would recognize a Palestinian state in September unless Israel takes steps to end the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and commits to a \u201clong-term sustainable peace.\u201d The U.S. has said that such recognition would be counterproductive because it rewards Hamas militants for the attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "Lammy and Vance will meet at Chevening, an almost 400-year-old mansion surrounded by 3,000 acres (about 1,200 hectares) of gardens, lawns and woodland in the county of Kent, southeast of London. The estate was given to the nation by the 7th Earl Stanhope in 1967 and is now the official country residence of the U.K. foreign secretary.",
      "While Lammy is a member of the left-leaning Labour Party and Vance is a conservative Republican who supports Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda, the two men have bonded in recent months.",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A Tennessee man who said he was \u201churting so bad\u201d during his lethal injection this week for the 1980s killings of his girlfriend and her two young daughters was not shocked by his implanted defibrillator, his attorney said Friday.",
      "Kelley Henry, the federal public defender for Byron Black, said her team received an initial evaluation of the data from his implantable cardioverter defibrillator.",
      "The ICD information eliminates one possible cause for Black's comment about pain during his execution Tuesday, and other actions such as when he picked his head up off the gurney and groaned, she said. But many questions remain unanswered, she said.",
      "\u201cMake no mistake, we all saw with our own eyes that the pentobarbital did not work like the State\u2019s expert testified that it would,\" Henry said in her statement, referencing Tennessee's execution drug, pentobarbital. \"Mr. Black suffered.\u201d",
      "Black was executed after a back-and-forth in court over whether officials would need to disable his ICD due to claims it might cause unnecessary, painful shocks to try to fix his heartbeat as the drugs were administered, potentially prolonging the execution.",
      "An autopsy report is expected to be released in eight to 12 weeks, Henry said. She also said their team will be making public records requests to try to piece together what happened. She has said this includes access to Black's electrocardiograph readings from the execution.",
      "Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Friday that news of the lack of a defibrillator shock was \u201cjust as the state\u2019s medical expert predicted and entirely contrary to the confident predictions of Black\u2019s expert.\u201d Skrmetti cited Black\u2019s numerous failed legal challenges and said, \u201cByron Black\u2019s execution was entirely legal.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery American has the right to their own opinion about the death penalty, but courts rely on actual facts and actual law, not on theatrics and passion,\u201d Skrmetti said in a statement.",
      "Black was convicted in the 1988 shooting deaths of his girlfriend Angela Clay, 29, and her two daughters, Latoya Clay, 9, and Lakeisha Clay, 6. Prosecutors said he was in a jealous rage when he shot the three at their home. At the time, Black was on work-release while serving time for shooting Clay\u2019s estranged husband.",
      "Black died at 10:43 a.m. on Tuesday, prison officials said. It was about 10 minutes after the execution started and Black talked about being in pain.",

      "The state disputed that the lethal injection would cause Black\u2019s defibrillator to shock him and said he wouldn\u2019t feel them regardless.",
      "Before the execution, the state said in a court filing that a \"lethal dose of pentobarbital ensures that Black will not be conscious to experience any pain.\" The state said unconsciousness occurs within 20 to 30 seconds of administering the drug, followed by respiratory arrest and cardiovascular collapse.",
      "Black, 69, was in a wheelchair, suffering from dementia, brain damage, kidney failure, congestive heart failure and other conditions, his attorneys have said. They said he had an intellectual disability that should have protected him from execution, but was denied a new hearing because he had already been rejected under older standards.",
      "The nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center and Black's attorneys said it\u2019s unaware of any other cases with similar claims to Black\u2019s about ICDs or pacemakers. Black\u2019s attorneys said they haven\u2019t found a comparable case, either.",
      "Henry also said officials struggled to insert an IV into his left side, and ultimately did after using some medical device, presumably to find a usable vein, Henry said. They seemed to have no trouble getting an IV into Black\u2019s right side, she said.",
      "That process is not viewed by media witnesses, whose perspective begins when Black is already strapped in and hooked up to IV lines on the gurney.",

      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- Federal judges on Thursday ordered Alabama to continue using a court-selected congressional map for the rest of the decade, but they declined to put the state back under the preclearance requirement of the Voting Rights Act.",
      "The order secures the current map, which created a second district where Black voters are the majority or close to it, for the next several elections. But the order leaves open what the districts will look like after 2030, when the Republican-controlled Alabama Legislature can again draw a map free from court oversight.",
      "The three-judge panel ordered the secretary of state to continue using the current congressional map, which was selected by the court last year, \u201cuntil Alabama enacts a new congressional districting plan based on 2030 Census data\u201d and said they will retain jurisdiction over the case until then. Lawmakers have said they did not intend to redraw Alabama\u2019s congressional map before the 2030 Census.",
      "The judges rejected a request from plaintiffs to \u201cbail in\u201d Alabama under the preclearance requirement of the Voting Rights Act and submit the next-state-drawn congressional map for review before it is used. The judges wrote that they \u201cdiscern no compelling reason to tread into such intrusive waters.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd we will not, in an unrestrained attempt to resolve any hypothetical issue that may arise far down the road, assign to our Court the exceedingly intrusive task of supervising Alabama\u2019s congressional elections for the next fifteen years,\u201d the judges wrote.",
      "The Alabama attorney general\u2019s office and the U.S. Department of Justice had both opposed the request.",
      "\u201cWe are pleased the Court accepted our arguments and rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 far-reaching request,\u201d a spokesman for Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall\u2019s office wrote in a statement.",

      "Attorney General Pam Bondi this week also named Ed Martin as a special prosecutor to help conduct separate mortgage fraud investigations into James and Democratic U.S. Sen. Adam Schiff of California, one of the people said. James and Schiff have denied any wrongdoing and have called the claims politically motivated.",
      "The moves are among the most serious yet the Justice Department has taken against political foes of the president, who vowed on the campaign trail to seek retribution against his opponents. Schiff and James are both vocal critics of Trump, and James has sued Trump and his Republican administration dozens of times over his policies as president and over how he conducted his private business empire.",
      "News of the subpoenas comes as the Justice Department advances an investigation into the Trump-Russia probe that shadowed Trump for much of his first term as president and as the administration has engaged in a widespread purge from the workforce of law enforcement officials who had been involved in examining the activities of Trump and his supporters.",
      "A spokesperson for James' office, Geoff Burgan, declined to confirm the subpoenas but issued a statement that said, \u201cAny weaponization of the justice system should disturb every American. We stand strongly behind our successful litigation against the Trump Organization and the National Rifle Association, and we will continue to stand up for New Yorkers\u2019 rights.\u201d",

      "The death of a New York City police officer in last week\u2019s midtown office tower shooting is highlighting the growth of Bangladeshi immigrants in the nation\u2019s largest police force",
      "NEW YORK -- Outside the Bronx mosque where a New York City police officer was eulogized last week, a group of officers in their formal navy blue uniforms solemnly hung a banner bearing the young officer\u2019s photograph and the name of his fraternity, the Bangladeshi American Police Association.",
      "Didarul Islam \u2014 one of four people killed in the July 28 shooting at the Manhattan office tower housing the NFL\u2019s headquarters \u2014 was the NYPD's first Bangladeshi American officer killed in the line of duty.",
      "His funeral underscored the fertile recruiting ground the department has found in the city\u2019s thriving Bangladeshi community. More than 1,000 of the NYPD\u2019s roughly 33,000 uniformed members are Bangladeshi Americans, according to the association. Another 1,500 people of Bangladeshi heritage are among the department\u2019s 19,000 civilian employees.",
      "Those numbers are up from just a handful of officers a few decades ago, a phenomenon some Bangladeshi officers attribute partly to their own patriotic response to anti-Muslim sentiment after the 9/11 attacks, as well as active recruitment and word-of-mouth in the community.",
      "Among the sea of NYPD officers who lined the street to honor Islam, 36, were some who opted for traditional South Asian attire, their police badges worn around their necks. Many joined the throngs of mourners who knelt in the street in prayer.",
      "\u201cHe actually uplifted our community in a way that was not imaginable before,\u201d said Shamsul Haque, one of the co-founders of the NYPD\u2019s Bangladeshi officers\u2019 group. \u201cHis legacy will endure not only as a hero who gave his life protecting others, but also as a symbol of hope, integrity and the American dream.\u201d",
      "When Haque joined the NYPD in 2004, he was one of just a few Bangladeshi immigrants. Many of those who joined around then wanted to dispel the notion that all Muslims were terrorist sympathizers, he said.",
      "Haque, who immigrated to the U.S. in 1991, had recently graduated college with a business administration degree when the twin towers fell. But rather than follow his peers into a financial field, he enrolled in the police academy, a decision he acknowledged was initially met with skepticism from his parents.",
      "In the aftermath of 9/11, the NYPD built up a domestic surveillance program that for years systematically spied on Muslim communities and monitored local businesses, mosques and student groups in a hunt for terror cells.",
      "Haque, 52, who retired earlier this year after becoming the first South Asian and first Muslim to attain the rank of lieutenant commander in the NYPD, said the perception of Muslims among rank-and-file members has improved.",
      "Early in his career, he recalled feeling singled out when a counterterrorism expert warned officers during a training session about the possibility of al-Qaida operatives infiltrating the force.",
      "\u201cOver the years, people started to realize that we work hard, we are ethical,\u201d Haque said. \u201cAlthough we are immigrants, we are patriotic.\u201d",
      "To grow their numbers, Haque and others went out into the community proselytizing a sensible path for recently arrived immigrants.",
      "Aspiring Bangladeshi officers were encouraged to take civilian jobs in the department, such as traffic enforcement officers and school safety agents, that don\u2019t require U.S. citizenship. After gaining citizenship, usually in about five years, they could then apply for the police academy to become a uniformed officer.",
      "Some 60% of all officers of Bangladeshi heritage in the NYPD followed this pipeline, Haque estimated. Islam, the officer killed last week, began his career as a school safety officer after immigrating to the U.S. about 16 years ago.",
      "The visible growth of Bangladeshis in the NYPD has helped many aspire to leadership roles in the department, just as generations of Irish, Italian and Latino immigrants did before them.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- California Democrats' rush to schedule an emergency election to remake U.S. House districts and counter rival moves by Texas Republicans has created a dilemma for county officials who are being urged to plan for an election that hasn't been scheduled and might never happen.",
      "Orchestrating an election in a state of nearly 23 million registered voters across 58 counties is a time-consuming and costly endeavor under any circumstances, but Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and the Democratic-dominated Legislature already have blown past deadlines intended to give local officials adequate time for organizing everything from printing mail ballots in multiple languages to lining up staff and securing locations for in-person voting.",
      "Democrats are considering new political maps that could slash five Republican-held House seats in the liberal-leaning state while bolstering Democratic incumbents in other battleground districts.

Though an election has not been called, \u201cstaff around the state need to begin preparing for the possibility of a special election,\u201d Weber spokesperson Jim Patrick said in an email.",
      "Meanwhile, it's not known if the state will cover the cost of the potential November election or if counties \u2014 many cash-strapped \u2014 will be saddled with the bill. A 2021 special election in which Newsom beat back a recall attempt cost over $200 million to conduct.",

      "\u201cWe really can't lose all or most of August by waiting\u201d for the Legislature and the governor to act, Page added. \u201cIt\u2019s a risk I have to take.\u201d",

      "The fire is burning just south of Lake Piru, a reservoir located in the Los Padres National Forest. It's close by Lake Castaic, a popular recreation area burned by the Hughes Fire in January. That fire burned about 15 square miles (39 square kilometers) in six hours and put 50,000 people under evacuation orders or warnings.",
      "Sunny, hot and dry conditions were expected in the area where the Canyon Fire was burning on Friday, with the daytime high near 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) and minimum humidity in the mid-teens, according to the National Weather Service.

      "William H",
      "WASHINGTON -- William H. Webster, the former FBI and CIA director whose troubleshooting skills and integrity helped restore public confidence in those federal agencies, has died, his family announced Friday. He was 101.",
      "Webster led the FBI from 1978 to 1987 and the CIA from 1987 to 1991, the only person to guide the nation\u2019s top law-enforcement agency and its primary intelligence-gathering organization.",
      "By the time he came to Washington, at age 53, Webster had practiced law for nearly 20 years, had served a stint as a federal prosecutor and had spent almost nine years on the federal bench in his native St. Louis. Those who opposed him in court or disagreed with his rulings acknowledged that his honesty was beyond question.",
      "\u201cEvery director of the CIA or the FBI should be prepared to resign in the event that he is asked to do something that he knows is wrong,\u201d Webster said after he agreed to lead the spy agency.",
      "President Jimmy Carter selected Webster, a Republican, for a 10-year term as FBI chief as the bureau sought to improve an image tarnished by revelations of domestic spying, internal corruption and other abuses of power. Demanding but fair of his agents, he was generally credited with developing its ability to handle new challenges such as terrorism.",
      "President Ronald Reagan chose Webster to replace CIA chief William J. Casey, who had been criticized for being too political, ignoring Congress and playing a part in the arms-for-hostages scandal known as Iran-Contra.",
      "Webster, again in the role of outsider with no political agenda, quickly sought to ease tensions with Congress. He reported regularly on the CIA\u2019s activities to lawmakers charged with intelligence oversight and avoided the appearance of trying to shape policy. Retiring from federal service in 1991, he joined a Washington law firm but still served on a variety of policy-related boards and commissions.",
      "In 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission selected Webster, on a partisan vote, to lead a board created by Congress to oversee the accounting profession in the wake of scandals involving Enron and other corporations.",
      "Before the board\u2019s first meeting, however, Webster resigned amid questions about his role as head of the audit committee of U.S. Technologies, a company itself accused of fraud. The controversy over his role in Webster\u2019s appointment contributed to the resignation of SEC Chair Harvey Pitt.",
      "William Hedgcock Webster was born on March 6, 1924, in St. Louis. He was raised in the suburb of Webster Groves, Missouri, his father the owner of ranch and farm land and the operator of small businesses. He served as a Navy lieutenant during World War II and returned to active duty for two years during the Korean War. He graduated from Amherst College with a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1947 and earned a law degree from Washington University Law School in St. Louis in 1949.",
      "Webster practiced law with a St. Louis firm until 1960, when President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed him U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri. He resigned the following year after President John F. Kennedy\u2019s election and then spent most of the 1960s in private practice. Appointed by President Richard Nixon to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri in 1971, Webster established a reputation as a moderate jurist. Nixon elevated Webster to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1973.",

      "\u201cI think of myself as operating from a position of restraint but being ready to take any judicial actions necessary to achieve the ends of justice,\u201d Webster said as he closed his judicial career to join the FBI. Critics, however, faulted him for a tendency to favor the prosecution in criminal cases.",
      "Liberals and conservatives commended Webster for an even-handed record on civil rights, even though he was a member of St. Louis social organizations that excluded minorities. He contended that he would not belong to any club that actively practiced racism. As FBI director, he brought more Black people and women into the bureau. Replacing Clarence M. Kelley, Webster focused the FBI\u2019s efforts on organized crime, white-collar offenders and drug enforcement.",
      "Highlighting attention to political corruption was the Abscam sting, in which officials offered bribes to bureau employees posing as Middle Eastern businessmen. Eleven people, including six members of Congress, were convicted.",
      "Webster also stepped up the FBI\u2019s anti-terrorism and counterintelligence activities, which helped prepare him for the CIA post. Some who questioned his appointment as director of central intelligence contended that his lack of operational experience and foreign affairs experience was a detriment.",
      "Webster was credited with building morale within the CIA and beginning its shift from a Cold War stance. The agency was accused, some claimed unfairly, of not anticipating how quickly the Soviet Union and its Eastern bloc would crumble and not doing more in advance of Saddam Hussein\u2019s invasion of Kuwait in 1991. It was commended for the intelligence it provided during the Gulf War.",
      "Over a nine-year period that included Webster\u2019s term, CIA officer Aldrich Ames sold secrets to the Soviet Union and compromised dozens of operations before he was arrested and sentenced to life in prison without parole in 1994. Webster and other CIA chiefs were criticized for failing to detect Ames\u2019 activities.",
      "In retirement, Webster served on a presidential panel on homeland security after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and was a member of a commission investigating security lapses at the FBI.",
      "Webster, a Christian Scientist who did not smoke, seldom drank and enjoyed playing tennis and reading history, married Drusilla Lane Webster in 1950; they raised two daughters and one son. Following her death from cancer in 1984, he married Lynda Jo Clugston in 1990.",
      "Webster is survived by his second wife, three children from his first marriage and their spouses, seven grandchildren and spouses and 12 great-grandchildren. A memorial service will be held in Washington on Sept. 18.",

      "The rainbow theme won't disappear entirely, but the ribbon for the lifetime achievement medallion will likely to be redesigned \u2014 possibly with a black or gold ribbon.",
      "The Honors weekend will be revamped, with a more streamlined schedule instead of multiple gatherings at the State Department, the White House and elsewhere, sources said. The events were expensive and time-consuming, and honorees sometimes skipped portions of the non-televised events.",
      "After criticizing the Kennedy Center's artistic fare and its finances, President Trump earlier this year named himself as its chairman, longtime aide and supporter Richard Grenell as its president and several White House officials and Trump allies as board members. That triggered a number of artists to cancel performances and some staff members resigned.",

    "story": [
      "The lead attorney for Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, Marc Agnifilo, says he has not had any conversations with the Trump administration about seeking a pardon for his client.",
      "Agnifilo sat down with CBS News for his first network interview since a New York jury convicted Combs of prostitution-related charges last month. Combs was acquitted of more serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering. He's scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 3.",
      "Earlier this week, another attorney for Combs, Nicole Westmoreland, told CNN\u00a0it was her understanding that the defense team \"had conversations in reference to a pardon\" with the Trump administration.",
      "But Agnifilo tells CBS News, \"I have nothing to do with a possible pardon.\"",
      "\"I have had conversations with nobody,\" Agnifilo said. \"I have not spoken to the president. I have not spoken to anybody who speaks to the president about Sean Combs. I have not.\"",
      "He says he hasn't discussed it with Combs either, except to tell him what's in the news.",
      "\"He says, 'Go tell him (Mr. Trump) that I need a pardon,'\" Agnofilo said. \"'Go tell him I deserve a pardon.' That's what he said.\"",
      "A senior White House official declined to comment on what they termed \"speculation\" and told CBS News any decisions on pardons would come from the president himself.",
      "Agnifilo said right now he's focused on getting his client \"a good sentence.\"",
      "He said he usually speaks several times a day with Combs, who is currently jailed at Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center after he was\u00a0again denied bail\u00a0on Monday. Judge Arun Subramanian cited Combs' violence in his personal relationships \u2014 the same reason he denied Combs bail on the day of the verdict.",

      "Asked if he has any regrets about how he tried the case, Agnifilo replied, \"Not really, not really.\"",
      "Controversial moments at trial",
      "During the trial, Agnifilo described the relationship between Combs and former girlfriend Cassie Ventura as \"a great modern love story.\"",
      "But Ventura, who testified against him, has said she was raped, physically abused and became addicted to drugs because of Combs.",
      "Agnifilo said they \"vehemently deny\" the rape allegation, and in the interview, he stood by his depiction of the relationship.",
      "\"In terms of the, you know, the drugs and the other stuff \u2026 that's what makes it a modern love story,\" he said. \"I think they really did love each other. I think she very much loved him and I know he very much loved her.\"",
      "\"I mean, these are two people who hurt each other, loved each other, cheated on each other,\" he said.",
      "Ventura's lawyer, Douglas Wigdor, rejects Agnifilo's description of the relationship, telling CBS News that it is a \"complete disgrace and affront\" to survivors of domestic violence.",
      "Agnifilo, a former prosecutor turned criminal defense attorney, has had other high-profile cases in his 35-year career, including the trial of NXIVM founder Keith Raniere and Martin \"Pharma Bro\" Shkreli, but none as highly publicized as the trial of Combs.",
      "\"I've been blessed to have a lot of cases that people care about, but nothing, nothing close to this,\" Agnifilo said, adding that it put a lot of pressure on him and his team.",
      "\"A lot of pressure because, you know, Sean Combs\u00a0\u2014\u00a0I mean, I, I believed in my heart that he was innocent.\"",

    "summary": "Instagram rolled out a new Map feature that lets users see their friends' locations in real time. Here's why privacy experts are concerned.",
    "story": [
      "A new feature on Instagram that let's users share their real-time physical location with others on the app has privacy experts concerned over the amount of data exposed and potential safety risks to users.",
      "Called Instagram Map, the new feature was introduced on Thursday as part of an app update. On its blog, the company says the location-sharing tool makes it \"easier for you and your friends to stay in touch through the content you're enjoying on Instagram.\"",
      "\"You can opt into sharing your last active location with friends you pick, and you can turn it off anytime,\" Instagram said in a blog post announcing the new feature. \"You can also open the map to see content your friends and favorite creators are posting from cool spots. No matter how you use the map, you and your friends have a new, lightweight way to connect with each other.\"",
      "\"Off by default\"",
      "In a statement shared with CBS MoneyWatch Friday, Instagram's parent company, Meta, emphasized that Instagram Maps is not automatically active upon updating the app and that users must opt-in to the location-sharing feature in order to make their whereabouts visible to others.",
      "\"Instagram Map is off by default, and your live location is never shared unless you choose to turn it on. If you do, only people you follow back \u2014 or a private, custom list you select \u2014 can see your location,\" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Users can also choose not to share their locations when they are in particular places, or with particular people.",
      "Still, privacy experts say that social media users aren't always aware of how much information they're sharing with an app or its users, even if they have the ability to limit who sees what.",
      "\"The more these location features are rolled out on social media it carries out the assumption that as long as you give users the ability to toggle them on and off that they'll know exactly how to do that,\" Douglas Zytko, an app safety expert and associate professor at the College of Innovation & Technology at the University of Michigan-Flint, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"But the average user isn't always aware of their privacy settings and if they match their preferences.\"",
      "When the Instagram Map feature is turned on, any content a user posts with a location tagged, including a reel, post or story, will show up on the app's map for 24 hours, according to the Instagram blog. While the feature remains on, the user's location is updated whenever they open the app or return to it. The feature can be turned off at any time.",
      "In an Instagram post discussing the feature, Instagram's head, Adam Mosseri, explains how he himself uses the map. \"Personally, I use the map to share what I'm up to with a handful of my closest friends, and I curate that list carefully,\" he said.",
      "User confusion over whether the feature is on or off",
      "On Threads, Meta's microblogging site, a number of Instagram account holders claimed that their locations were being pinned on friends' maps by default.",
      "Mosseri weighed in, saying the concerns prompted the company to re-examine how the feature works.",
      "\"We're double-checking everything, but so far it looks mostly like people are confused and assume that, because they can see themselves on the map when they open, other people can see them too,\" he said. \"We're still checking everything though to make sure nobody shares location without explicitly deciding to do so, which, by the way, requires a double consent by design (we ask you to confirm after you say you want to share).\"",
      "How to turn on Instagram Maps",
      "In the top right corner of the app, tap on the messaging function. There you will see a circular world map icon labeled \"map. If you click on the icon, you will see you're on location pinned on a map. Friends who are sharing their locations will also appear.

      "Furthermore, when teens share their locations, \"they are potentially telling strangers where they are in real time,\" Torney told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you're not selective about who you're sharing your location with, it creates opportunities for harassment, stalking or worse.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Aug 2025 14:16:53 -0400",
    "summary": "The Boar's Head deli meat plant at the heart of a deadly food-poisoning outbreak is set to reopen in the coming months, but recent reports point to ongoing sanitation problems.",
    "story": [
      "The Boar's Head deli meat plant at the heart of last year's deadly food poisoning outbreak is set to reopen in the coming months, company officials said.",
      "But recent inspections at Boar's Head sites in three states documented sanitation problems similar to those that led to the listeria contamination that killed 10 people and sickened dozens.",
      "The Jarratt, Virginia, plant was shut down in September when U.S. Agriculture Department officials suspended operations and withdrew the federal marks of inspection required to operate, saying the company \"failed to maintain sanitary conditions.\" Boar's Head permanently stopped making liverwurst and recalled more than 7 million pounds of deli products.",
      "Inspectors at the time found\u00a0dozens of violations, including leftover meat on equipment, mold and mildew buildup, insects in and around deli meats, and puddles of blood on the plant's floor.",
      "USDA officials this week said they had \"thoroughly reviewed\" the plant and lifted the forced suspension on July 18.",
      "\"The facility is in full compliance of the guidelines and protocols set for the safe handling and production of food and the serious issues that led to suspension have been fully rectified,\" officials with the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said in an email Wednesday.",
      "Recent reports of similar sanitation issues",
      "And yet, documents obtained by The Associated Press through a freedom of information request show that Boar's Head plants in Arkansas, Indiana and elsewhere in Virginia were flagged for the same kinds of sanitation problems that led to the outbreak, with the most recent report in June.",
      "In the past seven months, government inspectors reported problems that include instances of meat and fat residue left on equipment and walls, drains blocked with meat products, beaded condensation on ceilings and floors, overflowing trash cans, and staff who didn't wear protective hairnets and plastic aprons \u2014 or wash their hands.",
      "The records, which included USDA noncompliance reports logged by inspectors from Jan. 1 through July 23, raise new questions about the company's promises to address systemic problems and about federal oversight of listeria contamination in plants that make ready-to-eat foods.",
      "\"If there is evidence that food safety problems are continuing, the government needs to make sure the company fixes them,\" said Sandra Eskin, a former USDA official who now heads STOP Foodborne Illness, a consumer group focused on food safety.",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins last month announced plans to bolster efforts that combat foodborne germs, including listeria.",
      "Officials at Boar's Head, the 120-year-old company based in Sarasota, Florida, have posted job openings for two dozen positions, including a food safety quality analyst, at the Jarratt site.",
      "The company convened a panel of expert advisers last fall and hired a chief food safety officer in May. The advisers include Frank Yiannas, a former U.S. Food and Drug Administration official, and Mindy Brashears, President Donald Trump's nominee for USDA's undersecretary for food safety.",
      "Boar's Head last year said they \"regret and deeply apologize\" for the contamination and that \"comprehensive measures are being implemented to prevent such an incident from ever happening again.\"",
      "But company officials refused to discuss the problems found this year. They canceled a scheduled AP interview with Natalie Dyenson, the new food safety officer. And they declined to allow Yiannas to detail the investigation he led into the contamination's cause.",
      "Brashears, who now directs a food safety center at Texas Tech University, did not respond to requests for comment about the Boar's Head problems. An automatic email reply said the USDA nominee was traveling out of the country until Aug. 25. She remains on the company's food safety board.",
      "\"Boar's Head has an unwavering commitment to food safety and quality. That commitment is reflected in recent enhancements to our practices and protocols\" described on the company's website, Boar's Head said in an emailed statement.",
      "\"We have also been working with the USDA in developing a plan to reopen our Jarratt facility in a measured, deliberate way in the coming months,\" the statement said.",
      "The 35 pages of new inspection findings cover Boar's Head sites in Forrest City, Arkansas; New Castle, Indiana; and Petersburg, Virginia.",
      "The findings surprised outside food safety advocates, who said that factory conditions should have improved in the year since the outbreak was first identified.",
      "\"You would have expected after all they went through that they would put themselves in a place where you could essentially eat deli meat off the factory floor,\" said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports, an advocacy group.",
      "Rep. Rosa DeLauro called the findings \"appalling.\"",
      "\"This is a pattern of negligence \u2014 cutting corners to protect the company's bottom line at the expense of consumers and these conditions show a complete disregard for food safety and for the public health of the American people,\" the Connecticut Democrat said in a statement.",
      "The findings echo the \"inadequate sanitation practices\" that USDA officials said contributed to the outbreak. Key factors included product residue, condensation and structural problems in the buildings, a January report concluded.",
      "At the Jarratt plant, state inspectors working in partnership with USDA had documented mold, insects, liquid dripping from ceilings, and meat and fat residue on walls, floors and equipment, the AP previously reported.",
      "While no instances of insects were documented in this year's inspection reports, there were repeated reports of \"dried fat and protein from the previous day's production\" on equipment, stairs and walls. In April, an inspector at the Petersburg plant reported finding discarded meat underneath equipment, including \"5-6 hams, 4 large pieces of meat and a large quantity of pooling meat juice.\"",
      "Other reports detailed beaded condensation \"directly over the food contact surfaces of tables and conveyor belts.\" Additional reports documented rusting meat racks, doors that failed to close completely and staff who ignored required handwashing stations.",
      "The reports point to a \"food safety culture problem,\" said Barbara Kowalcyk, who directs a food safety and nutrition security center at George Washington University.",
      "\"What jumped out to me is there is an organizational culture issue that needs to be changed,\" she said. \"Usually that culture has to start at the top.\"",
      "In the meantime, she advised consumers to think carefully about deli meat consumption. Older people and those who are pregnant or have weakened immune systems are especially vulnerable to serious illness from listeria infections.",
      "\"I think they need to be aware that there are issues at this organization that still are not completely under control, apparently,\" Kowalcyk said.",
      "Boar's Head faced multiple lawsuits from people who fell ill or from the families of those who died. Several survivors declined to comment publicly on the new problems, citing financial settlements with the company that included nondisclosure agreements.",

      "Americans' retirement plans are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, a law better known as\u00a0ERISA. Under that regulation, employers are required to offer retirement options that are in the best interest of their employees, not Wall Street.",
      "Most retirement plans for Americans are made up of stock and bond investments, and to a much lesser extent, cash and heavily traded commodities such as gold.",
      "Workers would still be able to limit their investments to traditional assets like stocks and bonds, and would also be able to opt out of adding new alternative strategies to their portfolios.",
      "When could those changes become effective?",
      "It's unclear, but it's likely going to take months or even longer given the complexity of ERISA.",
      "After the Labor Department provides its new guidance, it will take time for major retirement plan companies such as Fidelity and Vanguard to develop appropriate funds for employers to use.",
      "Employers will also likely need time to revise their retirement plan options, so it may take several years before crypto and private equity become mainstream investments in individual retirement plans. Whether employers and their workers will opt to invest in these asset classes is another question, experts added.",
      "\"While asset managers are salivating over the idea of tapping in to a portion of the $12.5 trillion in defined contribution assets, we believe adoption will be slow due to cost, transparency and complexity,\" said Pitchbook analysts in a report written to provide an analysis of some aspects of Mr. Trump's order.",
      "How risky are these investments?",
      "All investments carry risks, but alternative asset classes come with additional pitfalls that heighten their potential for volatility. For instance, private equity invests in companies that are not publicly traded, which makes it difficult to know on a day-to-day basis whether the investment is up, down or sideways.",
      "\"When it comes to investing in stocks, retail investors are used to instant pricing, clean data and daily performance updates,\" Tang said. \"Private markets are a different ballgame. There's no real-time information, no ticker and no standardization, just fragmented documents and unstructured formats.\"",
      "Cryptocurrencies, for their part, may have more transparency on pricing, but they can also be extremely volatile, with major shifts in valuation from day to day. That said, cryptocurrencies have grown increasingly popular, with about 1 in 4 people investing in crypto, according to Security.org.",
      "Do alternative investments outperform stocks and bonds?",
      "Alternative investments can outperform stocks and bonds, but there's no guarantee.",
      "For instance, bitcoin last year jumped 135% in value, compared with a 24% increase in the S&P 500. But in 2022, it was another story, with bitcoin dropping 65% while the S&P 500 lost 19%, one analysis shows.",
      "Private equity investments, meanwhile, returned 13.5% over a 10-year period, outpacing the 9.7% return for stocks and a 1.9% for bonds over the same period, according to a recent study.",
      "While the potential for outsized gains may appeal to some investors, alternative investments also tend to carry higher costs, such as pricier fees for fund managers, which can eat into returns.",
      "\"Higher costs come from the fact that while you can trade a stock for pennies, it requires travel, negotiations, legal work, and much more, to buy and operate a private company. These costs are typically passed along to fund investors,\" Pitchbook said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/instagram-map-disable/",
    "published": "Fri, 08 Aug 2025 18:03:06 -0400",
    "summary": "Instagram rolled out a new Map feature that lets users see their friends' locations in real time. Here's why privacy experts are concerned.",
    "story": [
      "A new feature on Instagram that let's users share their real-time physical location with others on the app has privacy experts concerned over the amount of data exposed and potential safety risks to users.",
      "Called Instagram Map, the new feature was introduced on Thursday as part of an app update. On its blog, the company says the location-sharing tool makes it \"easier for you and your friends to stay in touch through the content you're enjoying on Instagram.\"",
      "\"You can opt into sharing your last active location with friends you pick, and you can turn it off anytime,\" Instagram said in a blog post announcing the new feature. \"You can also open the map to see content your friends and favorite creators are posting from cool spots. No matter how you use the map, you and your friends have a new, lightweight way to connect with each other.\"",
      "\"Off by default\"",
      "In a statement shared with CBS MoneyWatch Friday, Instagram's parent company, Meta, emphasized that Instagram Maps is not automatically active upon updating the app and that users must opt-in to the location-sharing feature in order to make their whereabouts visible to others.",
      "\"Instagram Map is off by default, and your live location is never shared unless you choose to turn it on. If you do, only people you follow back \u2014 or a private, custom list you select \u2014 can see your location,\" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Users can also choose not to share their locations when they are in particular places, or with particular people.",
      "Still, privacy experts say that social media users aren't always aware of how much information they're sharing with an app or its users, even if they have the ability to limit who sees what.",
      "\"The more these location features are rolled out on social media it carries out the assumption that as long as you give users the ability to toggle them on and off that they'll know exactly how to do that,\" Douglas Zytko, an app safety expert and associate professor at the College of Innovation & Technology at the University of Michigan-Flint, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"But the average user isn't always aware of their privacy settings and if they match their preferences.\"",
      "When the Instagram Map feature is turned on, any content a user posts with a location tagged, including a reel, post or story, will show up on the app's map for 24 hours, according to the Instagram blog. While the feature remains on, the user's location is updated whenever they open the app or return to it. The feature can be turned off at any time.",
      "In an Instagram post discussing the feature, Instagram's head, Adam Mosseri, explains how he himself uses the map. \"Personally, I use the map to share what I'm up to with a handful of my closest friends, and I curate that list carefully,\" he said.",
      "User confusion over whether the feature is on or off",
      "On Threads, Meta's microblogging site, a number of Instagram account holders claimed that their locations were being pinned on friends' maps by default.",
      "Mosseri weighed in, saying the concerns prompted the company to re-examine how the feature works.",
      "\"We're double-checking everything, but so far it looks mostly like people are confused and assume that, because they can see themselves on the map when they open, other people can see them too,\" he said. \"We're still checking everything though to make sure nobody shares location without explicitly deciding to do so, which, by the way, requires a double consent by design (we ask you to confirm after you say you want to share).\"",
      "How to turn on Instagram Maps",
      "In the top right corner of the app, tap on the messaging function. There you will see a circular world map icon labeled \"map. If you click on the icon, you will see you're on location pinned on a map. Friends who are sharing their locations will also appear. Click on the gear icon to choose to share your location with no one, or a custom list of friends, or all of your friends \u2014 who are followers that you also follow back on the app.",
      "Social pressures, privacy and safety risks",
      "Zytko, however, said it can be complicated for social media users to manage privacy settings that let them share different kinds of content with different groups of people. \"This issue is called 'context collapse,'\" he said. \"Your co-workers see your social media posts, and your friends and family, and there is certain content you only want some groups to see but not others, and it can be hard to manage the visibility of content.\"",
      "Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which makes entertainment and technology recommendations for families, said location-sharing features can be particularly risky for younger app users.",
      "\"These features might feel fun and social, but they create unnecessary risks that teens and many adults don't necessarily understand,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "While parents who supervise their teens through controls built into the app can control their kids' location-sharing settings, he still has concerns about the kinds of social pressures such features expose teens, too.",
      "Torney said research at Common Sense Media shows that location-sharing also creates \"social pressures around where teens go and who they spend time with, and kids feel obligated to share location to show they are someplace cool.\"",
      "Furthermore, when teens share their locations, \"they are potentially telling strangers where they are in real time,\" Torney told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you're not selective about who you're sharing your location with, it creates opportunities for harassment, stalking or worse.\"",

      "Wendy's cut its sales outlook Friday, pointing to heightened competition and economic uncertainty weighing on its customer base.",
      "Company executives discussed Wendy's challenges during a call with analysts Friday, following the release of its latest earnings report. Interim CEO Ken Cook said that in light of the current environment, the company now expects full-year global sales to decline between 3% and 5%, compared with previous\u00a0projections\u00a0of flat to down 2%.",
      "Wendy's is coping with softer consumer demand in 2025, particularly among the lower-income customers that tend to frequent fast-food chains, Sara Senatore, a research analyst at Bank of America, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The low-income consumer remains under pressure,\" she said.",
      "Fast food chains like Wendy's are competing for the attention of low-income consumers who have pulled back on eating out over concerns about the economy. According to a May study from Bankrate, among households earning less than\u00a0$50,000 per year, 44% say they expect to spend less on dining out this year than they did last year.",
      "Cook, who stepped in as interim CEO after former Wendy's former CEO Kirk Tanner departed to lead the Hershey Company, cited a \"a combination of dynamic consumer behavior and a more challenging competitive environment\" during a Friday call with analysts to discuss the results.",
      "While sales improved in May and June due to new Frosty offerings, \"overall demand recovered more slowly than we expected,\" he added. The burger chain's sales slipped 1.8% to $3.7 billion in the second quarter compared with a year earlier, according to the company's earnings report.",
      "Inflation-weary consumers who are skipping breakfast could signal this growing pressure, with Wendy's executives highlighting the trend.",
      "\"Breakfast continued to perform worse than rest of day in the second quarter, which makes sense when you look at what's happening from a consumer behavior perspective,\" Cook said. \"When consumer uncertainty increases and consumers choose to eat another meal at home, breakfast is often the first place that they that they do that with.\"",
      "Meanwhile, McDonald's, which last year saw a sales slowdown from low-income consumers, reversed that trend \u00a0 following its decision to\u00a0expand its value menu.\u00a0CEO Chris Kempczinski told analysts earlier in the week that value items \u2014 which include its $2.99 Snack Wrap \u2014 are bringing some consumers back to its stores even as fast food visits across the industry have slowed.",
      "Senatore said Wendy's provides good values for price-conscious consumers, but added the chain may not be communicating that as effectively as its competitors. \"McDonald's has done a good job of marketing value, and that is something that Wendy's acknowledged that they needed to do,\" she said.",
      "Among other value offerings, is the Wendy's Biggie Bag, which features a junior bacon cheeseburger, small fries, four-piece chicken nuggets and a soft drink for $5.",
      "Asked about adjusting core menu pricing during Friday's call, Cook said the company plans to use new data analytics capabilities to evaluate its prices.",

      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will lead the IRS temporarily, a White House official told CBS News.",
      "\"I am thrilled to answer his call to service and deeply committed to advancing his bold agenda,\" Long said in his statement. \"Exciting times ahead!\"",
      "In his last mass email to the IRS's workforce on Thursday, Long told agency employees they could leave 70 minutes early on Friday, two staffers told CBS News. He's offered early dismissals at the end of the week on several occasions, one employee said.",
      "\"It's Almost FriYay,\" the email's subject line read, according to the staffers.",
      "Long was confirmed by the Senate in mid-June and took over the IRS after some tumult for the tax collection agency's leadership. The IRS has had several interim commissioners since Mr. Trump's return to office in January, including one who lasted for just 48 hours. The Trump administration has aimed to dramatically trim the agency's workforce.",
      "A former auctioneer and Missouri Republican congressman, Long was chosen to take over the IRS late last year after previously pushing to repeal much of the tax code during his time in the House. Long isn't an accountant by trade, but Mr. Trump touted his time as a tax adviser. After retiring from Congress in 2023, Long advised businesses on the Employee Retention Tax Credit, drawing criticism from Democrats who noted the credit's high rate of fraud.",
      "The IRS has been a focus of the Trump administration's government-wide staff cuts. The agency drew up plans earlier this year to cut its 102,000-person workforce by as much as 40% through a combination of layoffs and voluntary resignations, according to an internal memo obtained by CBS News in April. The cuts were set to begin after April 15, which is the deadline for most Americans to file their taxes.",
      "As of May, some 25,000 staffers had left the IRS, a 25% decrease from February levels, according to a report by the IRS's internal watchdog, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. Around 26% of the IRS's revenue agents \u2014 the staff who conduct audits \u2014 had left the agency by May, the report found.",
      "Meanwhile, staff from the Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 a cost-cutting team once led by billionaire Elon Musk \u2014 sought access to the IRS's tax data system, sparking a lawsuit.",
      "Former IRS acting head Melanie Krause left the agency in April over a plan to share tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to help identify undocumented immigrants. She was replaced by Gary Shapley, a longtime IRS agent who became well-known for speaking about alleged political influence in the Hunter Biden tax investigation. But Shapley was ousted after just two days following a dispute between Musk and Bessent.",
      "Bessent complained to Mr. Trump that Shapley had been installed at the urging of Musk and sought the president's approval to undo the decision, multiple sources told CBS News at the time.",

    "summary": "U.S. home prices are dropping the most in the South and West, according to a new report from Realtor.com.",
    "story": [
      "The housing market has been in a serious crunch since the COVID-19 pandemic, with limited inventory, elevated home prices and mortgages in the 7% range, continuing to keep many would-be home buyers\u00a0locked out. But even amid such tight constraints, modest declines in home prices can still be found in some regions of the country.",
      "That's according to a new report from Realtor.com, which measures changes in median home prices across the 50 largest U.S. metro areas since 2022, when median home prices hit a\u00a0peak of $443,000 according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis.",
      "The extent to which home prices are declining varies from region to region according to the Realtor.com report, which is based on the brokerage platform's housing data.",
      "\"The housing market has cooled modestly in 2025,\" said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, in a statement on the report. \"But the extent and persistence of rebalancing really varies across the country. And regionally, homebuyers and sellers are likely to experience a very different market.\"",
      "Behind those notable price differences is inventory. Right now, the housing market is essentially divided into two camps, with higher inventory in the South and West, where deeper price cuts can be found, and more limited inventory in the Midwest and Northeast, said Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\"It's a supply and demand story,\" Krimmel told CBS MoneyWatch. \"When you have fewer homes for sale, and if there is still sufficient demand, that's going to maybe put upward pressure on prices or prevent them from falling.\"",
      "Cities where prices are falling",
      "The largest declines in median listing prices in 2025 tend to be concentrated in the South and West, where all 19 of the 50 largest U.S. metro areas with median housing prices below July 2022 levels are located.",
      "\"After years of intense competition, it's starting to feel more balanced \u2014 especially in the South and West,\" Gary Ashton, founder of The Ashton Real Estate Group of RE/MAX Advantage said in a statement on the Realtor.com report. \"It's not a buyer's market yet, but we're headed in that direction.\"",
      "The cities that saw the biggest declines in price were Austin, where median listing prices have fallen nearly 15% over the last three years; and Miami, where prices have dropped around 19%.",
      "According to Krimmel, inventory is rising in these markets as homes stay on the market longer and new listings climb.",
      "A boom in building also boosted housing supply in those regions during the COVID-19 pandemic, when demand for markets like Austin, Denver and Miami exploded, he added. Part of the reason construction in those cities took off, Krimmel added, was that the laws in their respective state make it easier to build during big influxes in demand.",
      "\"[Builders] we're actually able to get things permitted, get shovels in the ground and get buildings built,\" Krimmel said.",
      "Austin, Los Angeles and Miami saw the largest declines in median listing price over the past year, although prices in Los Angeles remain more than 18% above the median listing price in 2022.",
      "Cities where prices are rising",
      "Housing markets in cities in Northeast and Midwest remain squeezed due to \"sticky high\" prices and tight inventory, said Krimmel. Other contributing factors include stricter zoning and land use regulation laws that make building new houses more difficult, he said.",
      "In New York, for example, median listing prices have climbed roughly 16% since 2022, according to the report. Meanwhile, median listing prices in Milwaukee increased 26%.",
      "Furthermore, the number of active listings per month in the Northeast is still 50% below pre-pandemic levels, according to Krimmel. The number of active listings in the Midwest is down 40%, pointing to an inventory shortage in both regions, he said.",
      "While median listing prices have gone down over the last year in northeastern cities like Boston and Philadelphia, which saw 1.4% and 1.2% decreases, respectively, median prices remain at least 10% above those from 2022.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-inflation-gdp-stagflation-concerns/",
    "published": "Fri, 08 Aug 2025 15:53:24 -0400",
    "summary": "Economists caution new tariffs could pose economic risks, but the White House says growth is rebounding amid low inflation.",
    "story": [
      "Some economists are cautioning that President Trump's sweeping new tariffs on U.S. trade partners, which took effect Thursday, increase the risks that the U.S. economy could enter a period of stagflation.",
      "A mashup of \"stagnation\" and \"inflation,\" the term describes periods marked by high prices and low GDP growth, such as the economic doldrums of the 1970s. To be sure, U.S. economic growth, though\u00a0slower so far this year than in 2024, remains relatively strong, and inflation remains far below its post-pandemic spike.",
      "But economists are flagging the potential for fresh tariffs, which\u00a0took effect Aug. 7,to fuel higher prices as businesses pass on the costs of the new import duties to consumers. With the latest round of import duties, the effective average tariff rate now stands at 18%, the highest since 1934, according to an analysis from the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "Inflation likely rose 2.8% on an annual basis in July, inching higher from the 2.7% annual rate notched in the prior month, according to forecasts from economists polled by FactSet. July data for the Consumer Price Index, or CPI, will be released at 8:30 a.m. ET on Aug. 12.",
      "\"The stagflation theme in markets is intensifying,\" Apollo chief economist Torsten Slok\u00a0wrote\u00a0in a research note Thursday.",
      "While prices likely crept higher last month, they're still nowhere near the post-pandemic price spike that financially hobbled many households. Yet an increase would represent a reversal of a downward trend earlier this year, and push the inflation rate farther from the Federal Reserve's goal of reaching a 2% annual rate.",
      "The economy could face another hit from tariffs if some U.S. businesses, which are on the hook for paying the import duties to the federal government, scale back hiring or expansion plans to cope with those higher costs, economists added. Last week's disappointing employment report suggested the U.S. job market is starting to wobble from the uncertainty of on-again, off-again tariffs, they noted.",
      "\"To offset internal costs, you may look at reducing your workforce and curbing wage growth to offset part of the cost of goods increase,\" EY-Parthenon chief economist Greg Daco told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "U.S. GDP is also forecast to slow throughout 2025, with economists polled by FactSet pegging this year's growth at 1.5%, down from 2.4% in 2024.",
      "The White House took issue with concerns raised by some economists about the potential for stagflation. \"Inflation continuing to remain cool and growth rebounding in Q2 both suggest stagflation is simply the latest buzzword for panican paranoia,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Panican\" is a term coined by Mr. Trump earlier this year to refer to the fears expressed by some critics about his tariffs.",
      "A challenging scenario",
      "The U.S. economy is facing a challenging scenario from the combination of a weaker job market and higher inflation, Skanda Amarnath, executive director of Employ America, a monetary policy research institute, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The U.S. economy appears to be hitting a mild form of stagflation,\" Amarnath said. \"I'd call it stagflation lite.\"",
      "The dangers of higher inflation and a weaker job market were highlighted by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell last month when he discussed the central bank's decision to hold rates steady. Powell pointed out that job creation has slowed, adding risks to the labor market, while inflation remains above the Fed's 2% annual goal.",
      "The Fed has a dual goal of keeping both prices and unemployment low. Achieving those goals requires different strategies, however. Because high interest rates make it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow, the Fed tends to hike rates to fight inflation.",
      "But when unemployment spikes, the Fed typically cuts its benchmark rate to make borrowing cheaper, which can encourage businesses to hire and expand.",
      "\"The economy is in good shape, but it's an unusual situation in that you have risks to both sides of the mandate,\" Powell said at a July 30 press conference.",
      "He added that the Fed is \"trying to do the right thing in what is a challenging situation because you're being pulled in two directions and you have to decide which of those it took to go in.\"",
      "With the job market now showing signs of stress, the challenge is whether the Fed should cut rates, or hold off because inflation remains higher than the central bank's goal \u2014 and is projected to inch higher, Slok noted.",
      "The manufacturing, retail, wholesale and construction industries, which are sensitive to the impact of tariffs, all notched fewer job gains than were initially reported, with the July jobs report's revisions. Manufacturing jobs declined for three consecutive months from May through July, the data shows.",
      "\"That's consistent with a level of uncertainty on the trade side depressing the willingness to hire,\" Amarnath said.",
      "At the same time, \"goods prices have picked up speed,\" he added. \"Household supplies and furniture, apparel and used cars are all starting to see upward momentum, and I think tariffs are an obvious reason for that.\"",

      "The Jarratt, Virginia, plant was shut down in September when U.S. Agriculture Department officials suspended operations and withdrew the federal marks of inspection required to operate, saying the company \"failed to maintain sanitary conditions.\" Boar's Head permanently stopped making liverwurst and recalled more than 7 million pounds of deli products.",
      "Inspectors at the time found\u00a0dozens of violations, including leftover meat on equipment, mold and mildew buildup, insects in and around deli meats, and puddles of blood on the plant's floor.",
      "USDA officials this week said they had \"thoroughly reviewed\" the plant and lifted the forced suspension on July 18.",
      "\"The facility is in full compliance of the guidelines and protocols set for the safe handling and production of food and the serious issues that led to suspension have been fully rectified,\" officials with the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said in an email Wednesday.",
      "Recent reports of similar sanitation issues",
      "And yet, documents obtained by The Associated Press through a freedom of information request show that Boar's Head plants in Arkansas, Indiana and elsewhere in Virginia were flagged for the same kinds of sanitation problems that led to the outbreak, with the most recent report in June.",
      "In the past seven months, government inspectors reported problems that include instances of meat and fat residue left on equipment and walls, drains blocked with meat products, beaded condensation on ceilings and floors, overflowing trash cans, and staff who didn't wear protective hairnets and plastic aprons \u2014 or wash their hands.",
      "The records, which included USDA noncompliance reports logged by inspectors from Jan. 1 through July 23, raise new questions about the company's promises to address systemic problems and about federal oversight of listeria contamination in plants that make ready-to-eat foods.",
      "\"If there is evidence that food safety problems are continuing, the government needs to make sure the company fixes them,\" said Sandra Eskin, a former USDA official who now heads STOP Foodborne Illness, a consumer group focused on food safety.",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins last month announced plans to bolster efforts that combat foodborne germs, including listeria.",
      "Officials at Boar's Head, the 120-year-old company based in Sarasota, Florida, have posted job openings for two dozen positions, including a food safety quality analyst, at the Jarratt site.",
      "The company convened a panel of expert advisers last fall and hired a chief food safety officer in May. The advisers include Frank Yiannas, a former U.S. Food and Drug Administration official, and Mindy Brashears, President Donald Trump's nominee for USDA's undersecretary for food safety.",
      "Boar's Head last year said they \"regret and deeply apologize\" for the contamination and that \"comprehensive measures are being implemented to prevent such an incident from ever happening again.\"",
      "But company officials refused to discuss the problems found this year. They canceled a scheduled AP interview with Natalie Dyenson, the new food safety officer. And they declined to allow Yiannas to detail the investigation he led into the contamination's cause.",
      "Brashears, who now directs a food safety center at Texas Tech University, did not respond to requests for comment about the Boar's Head problems. An automatic email reply said the USDA nominee was traveling out of the country until Aug. 25. She remains on the company's food safety board.",
      "\"Boar's Head has an unwavering commitment to food safety and quality. That commitment is reflected in recent enhancements to our practices and protocols\" described on the company's website, Boar's Head said in an emailed statement.",
      "\"We have also been working with the USDA in developing a plan to reopen our Jarratt facility in a measured, deliberate way in the coming months,\" the statement said.",
      "The 35 pages of new inspection findings cover Boar's Head sites in Forrest City, Arkansas; New Castle, Indiana; and Petersburg, Virginia.",
      "The findings surprised outside food safety advocates, who said that factory conditions should have improved in the year since the outbreak was first identified.",
      "\"You would have expected after all they went through that they would put themselves in a place where you could essentially eat deli meat off the factory floor,\" said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports, an advocacy group.",
      "Rep. Rosa DeLauro called the findings \"appalling.\"",
      "\"This is a pattern of negligence \u2014 cutting corners to protect the company's bottom line at the expense of consumers and these conditions show a complete disregard for food safety and for the public health of the American people,\" the Connecticut Democrat said in a statement.",
      "The findings echo the \"inadequate sanitation practices\" that USDA officials said contributed to the outbreak. Key factors included product residue, condensation and structural problems in the buildings, a January report concluded.",
      "At the Jarratt plant, state inspectors working in partnership with USDA had documented mold, insects, liquid dripping from ceilings, and meat and fat residue on walls, floors and equipment, the AP previously reported.",
      "While no instances of insects were documented in this year's inspection reports, there were repeated reports of \"dried fat and protein from the previous day's production\" on equipment, stairs and walls. In April, an inspector at the Petersburg plant reported finding discarded meat underneath equipment, including \"5-6 hams, 4 large pieces of meat and a large quantity of pooling meat juice.\"",
      "Other reports detailed beaded condensation \"directly over the food contact surfaces of tables and conveyor belts.\" Additional reports documented rusting meat racks, doors that failed to close completely and staff who ignored required handwashing stations.",
      "The reports point to a \"food safety culture problem,\" said Barbara Kowalcyk, who directs a food safety and nutrition security center at George Washington University.",
      "\"What jumped out to me is there is an organizational culture issue that needs to be changed,\" she said. \"Usually that culture has to start at the top.\"",
      "In the meantime, she advised consumers to think carefully about deli meat consumption. Older people and those who are pregnant or have weakened immune systems are especially vulnerable to serious illness from listeria infections.",
      "\"I think they need to be aware that there are issues at this organization that still are not completely under control, apparently,\" Kowalcyk said.",
      "Boar's Head faced multiple lawsuits from people who fell ill or from the families of those who died. Several survivors declined to comment publicly on the new problems, citing financial settlements with the company that included nondisclosure agreements.",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Aug 2025 12:28:22 -0400",
    "summary": "An EPA proposal seeks to revoke a key emissions finding which experts say would remove pressure on auto makers to produce EVs.",
    "story": [
      "A new Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposal\u00a0to revoke a landmark greenhouse gas finding could alter the direction of the auto industry, which until now has had to abide by strict emissions guidelines.",
      "The EPA on July 29\u00a0announced it is planning\u00a0to revoke an \"endangerment finding\" from 2009 that has served as the legal and scientific basis for the agency's regulation of greenhouse gas emissions across multiple industries, including motor vehicles, power plants, oil and gas producers and aircraft. The proposal, which still needs to go through a public comment period, focuses on regulations affecting the auto industry. If passed, it would repeal all greenhouse gas standards for light-, medium- and heavy-duty vehicles and heavy-duty engines.",
      "\"With this proposal, the Trump EPA is proposing to end 16 years of uncertainty for auto makers and American consumers,\" Lee Zeldin, the administrator of EPA, stated in the\u00a0announcement.",
      "Strict\u00a0standards for emissions and fuel efficiency introduced during the Obama administration and expanded during the Biden administration, which also provided\u00a0generous EV funding, has led many auto makers to add electric vehicles to their fleets in recent years. Others, like\u00a0Volvo, have taken things a step further and committed to a fully electric future. But the landscape is shifting under President Trump, who has pushed forward a deregulatory agenda.",
      "Experts say that if this proposal passes, it will ease pressure on auto makers to produce electric cars, enabling them to adapt their mix of EV and gas-powered vehicle offerings to meet consumer demand.",
      "\"It gives auto makers a little bit better ability to build, to produce and put vehicles on market that are more closely aligned with the pace of electric adoption right now,\" said Stephanie Brinley, a principal automotive analyst at S&P Global.",
      "John Bozzella, president and CEO Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents\u00a0most of the major car manufacturers in the U.S., said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch that the trade association is reviewing the announcement.",
      "\"At the same time,\" he added, \"there's no question the vehicle emissions regulations finalized under the previous administration aren't achievable and should be revised to reflect current market conditions, to keep the auto industry in America competitive, and to keep the industry on a path of vehicle choice and lower emissions.\"",
      "A spokesperson from the EPA said Congress never explicitly gave EPA authority to impose greenhouse gas regulations for cars and trucks and that the agency's proposal to revoke the endangerment finding \"does not prohibit vehicle manufacturers from developing EVs or different vehicles.\"",
      "Focus on consumer demand",
      "Experts say that even amid a shifting regulatory landscape, consumer preference will continue to drive auto makers' decisions.",
      "\"Their focus is going to be on making vehicles more affordable and dealing with the fact that consumers, not the government, are standing in the way of the mass adoption for EVs,\" said Patrick Anderson, founder of Michigan-based consulting firm Anderson Economic Group.",
      "The rate of electric vehicle adoption has been steady over the last several years, although the majority of Americans still fuel their cars at the pump. Demand for the vehicles has waned over the last year, according to data on light vehicle registration from S&P Global Mobility. From January to May, the electric vehicle market share was 7.3%, compared with 8% for the entire year of 2024, data from the auto intelligence provider shows.",
      "But while consumer demand may have stalled slightly over the past year, auto makers will still want to offer low-emissions products in order to stay competitive both at home and abroad, Ivan Drury, director of insights at online car marketplace Edmunds, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Every auto maker is a global competitor, and even though they might not be selling as well here, they could sell elsewhere better,\" he said.",
      "Impact would take time",
      "Experts say the proposal, if passed, wouldn't drastically change any near-term plans of auto makers, given the time and money they have already invested in their product lines.",
      "\"If had already planned to build X number of this kind of vehicle, you can change that, but not necessarily tomorrow,\" said Brinley. \"So that's gonna have to be planned out.\"",
      "Product development cycles at car manufacturers span five to 10 years, according to a report from Eurasia Group, a global research firm.",
      "The exact strategy and speed with which companies make changes would vary from auto maker to auto maker, according to experts. \"For now, auto makers would enjoy the flexibility and lower costs from less stringent emissions limits, particularly in their nonelectric fleet planning,\" the report from Eurasia says.",
      "There are concerns among some companies that the EPA's proposal, if passed, would inject a degree of chaos into industry, David Victor, a professor at University of California San Diego, told CBS MoneyWatch. Also, the rule-making process will likely be challenged in the courts, he said.",
      "\"[Auto makers] will not get a reliable new set of rules anytime soon,\" said Victor.",
      "The EPA is\u00a0holding\u00a0a virtual public hearing on the proposed rule on Aug. 19-20, with a public comment period open through Sept. 15.",

      "Muscle cars are attractive to thieves because they are looking for vehicles with high horsepower, the group said.",

      "\"Even if they might not raise prices immediately, it's unlikely that most businesses are just going to be willing to eat the extra costs forever,\" Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree, an online lending marketplace, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The impact of tariffs on consumer prices was initially muted, explained Shulz, as firms can be reluctant to be the first among their competitors to institute price hikes. While some companies waited to see where tariff rates settled before adjusting retail prices, others took steps to absorb added costs to avoid turning off customers. But companies can't employ such measures forever, according to experts.",
      "\"You don't want to be the first to raise prices, even if you have a perfectly legitimate reason for doing so,\" Schulz told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So, I suspect once we see businesses start raising their prices more, that might embolden others to do so as well.\"",
      "That could mean a tsunami of price hike announcements from corporations, some of which have already warned of tariff impacts, or instituted \"tariff surcharges\" to cover their added costs.",
      "To date, Mr. Trump's tariffs on the U.S.'s trade partners have generated billions of dollars in revenue for the U.S. Specifically, the U.S. government collected about $30 billion in tariff revenue in July, according to the Treasury Department. That reflects a 242% jump in revenue collected from duties since July 2024.",
      "In addition to paying down the national debt, which currently stands at\u00a0more than $36 trillion, those billions in new tariff revenue may be used to issue\u00a0rebate checks for Americans, Mr. Trump suggested last month.",
      "Profit dips",
      "Tariffs are taxes paid by importers, which must pay the fees to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection when it accepts shipments at American ports. As a result, U.S. businesses typically pass most or all of that cost to consumers through higher prices, according to economists.",
      "\"There is very little evidence that foreign exporters to the U.S. are reducing their prices,\" Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You're not seeing broad-based evidence of price cuts by countries, and that's an indication that foreign exporters realize that it's U.S. importers, U.S. businesses and eventually consumers that are bearing the brunt of this tariff-induced inflation acceleration.\"",
      "Companies from personal electronics companies to automakers have already experienced the damaging effects of Mr. Trump's foreign trade policies on profits.",
      "On Thursday Toyota, the world's largest auto maker, reported a 37% drop in profit in the April-June quarter and said it cut its full-year earnings forecast largely because of Mr. Trump's tariffs. Other auto makers have also said they expect to see profit drops as a result of the new levies.",
      "GM has projected a tariff hit of up to $5 billion for 2025, and Ford has said tariffs will cost the company $3 billion in revenue for the year.",
      "Liquor companies are in the tariff crosshairs, too. Guinness maker Diageo said it expects tariffs to cost it $200 million a year.",
      "Walmart in May warned that higher tariffs would force it to increase prices on a wide range of items at its stores, from bananas to children's car seats.",
      "Price hikes",
      "Some companies have said outright that in order to bear the added costs from the new tariffs they'll have to pass along some of the pain to consumers in the form of price hikes.",
      "For example, popular consumer electronics marker Sonos, which makes speakers, said on its third-quarter earnings call Wednesday that it would raise prices on its audio devices as a result of\u00a0higher reciprocal tariffs on Vietnam and Malaysia, where Sonos devices for the U.S. market are made.",
      "Overall, as a result of the levies, Americans are expected to pay an average of 18.3% more for imported products,\u00a0according to the Budget Lab at Yale, a nonpartisan policy research center.",
      "EY-Parthenon's Daco told CBS MoneyWatch that the higher costs being paid by companies because of tariffs is already starting to trickle down to product prices.",
      "Currently, the average tariff rate stands at around 18% \u2014 the highest it's been in decades, according to Daco. As a result, \"the increase in the tariffs will only exacerbate inflationary pressure that [is] starting to emerge,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"You're going to see more durable goods, and nondurable goods products with higher price tags,\" he said. \"That will feed into higher consumer price inflation and lead to a more pronounced erosion of consumer spending as more households struggle in the face of these higher prices.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has promoted tariffs as a way of reducing trade deficits with other nations and bolstering domestic jobs in manufacturing. He has also tried to assure the public that foreign producers will pay for the import taxes and has told retailers and automakers\u00a0to absorb the additional expenses.",
      "\"The Administration has consistently maintained that the cost of tariffs will be paid by foreign exporters who rely on access to the American economy, the world's best and biggest consumer market,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told CBS News.",
      "\"Despite the doom-and-gloom predictions of inflation and recession, it's been four months since Liberation Day and inflation is trending towards an annualized rate not seen since President Trump's first term, while a recent CEA analysis found that prices of imported goods are actually declining.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Aug 2025 19:48:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Under a new executive order signed by President Trump, workers could add higher-risk assets like cryptocurrencies to their 401(k)s.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday signed an executive order that could allow millions of Americans saving for retirement through 401(k) accounts to invest in higher-risk private equity and cryptocurrency assets.",
      "The executive order doesn't immediately change how people will invest for retirement through their employer-sponsored accounts, as federal agencies would need to rewrite regulations to allow expanded investment choices. That's a process that experts say could take months, or longer, to complete.",
      "But once done, employers could offer a broader array of mutual funds and investments to workers, according to the White House. New plans could invest in alternative assets, particularly private equity, cryptocurrencies and real estate.",
      "The move comes as the 401(k) has become the primary vehicle for American workers to save for retirement, with most employers offering a menu of investment choices among major asset classes, such as stock-based mutual funds. The $5 trillion private equity industry, which makes investments into private businesses rather than publicly traded stocks, has for decades wanted to compete for a role in retirement plans.",
      "At the same time, the cryptocurrency industry, whose executives strongly supported Trump's 2024 campaign, has aimed for more mainstream acceptance among Americans.",
      "\"It was inevitable that bitcoin would make its way into American 401(k)'s,\" said Cory Klippsten, the CEO of Swan Bitcoin. \"As fiduciaries realize bitcoin's risk-adjusted upside over the long term, we'll see growing allocations, especially from younger, tech-savvy workers who want hard money, not melting ice cubes.\"",
      "The EO could give private equity and crypto firms long-sought access to a pool of funds worth trillions.",
      "Investment companies applauded Mr. Trump's executive order, with TIAA, which manages the retirement assets of teachers, professors and other academics, and investing giant BlackRock saying they support the measure for providing a broader number of investment strategies to workers.",
      "\"We believe end investors can benefit from the advantages that private investments can offer when embedded within professionally managed vehicles like target date funds or through guaranteed annuity products,\" TIAA said in a statement emailed to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Changing the 401(k) rules",
      "The president's order directs the Labor Department and other agencies to redefine what would be considered a qualified asset under 401(k) retirement rules.",
      "Americans' retirement plans are governed by a law known as the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, better known as ERISA. Employers are required by law to offer retirement options that are in the best interest of their employees, not Wall Street.",
      "Most retirement plans for Americans are made up of stock and bond investments, and to a much lesser extent, cash and heavily traded commodities such as gold.",
      "Even after the regulations are written, it will take time for the major retirement plan companies such as Fidelity, Vanguard, T. Rowe Price and others, to develop appropriate funds for employers to use. Employers are not likely to revise their retirement plan options quickly as well, so it may take several years before crypto and private equity investments are mainstream in an individual's retirement plan.",
      "The price of bitcoin was up 2% on Thursday to $116,542 and has nearly doubled since Trump was elected.",
      "Under Democratic President Joe Biden, federal regulators were to treat cryptocurrency investments with \"extreme care\" because of the extreme volatility of crypto. It is not uncommon for bitcoin, ethereum and other big cryptocurrencies to move up or down 10% in a single day, whereas a 2% or 3% single-day move in the stock market would be considered historic.",
      "For cryptocurrency companies, which donated millions to Trump's campaign as well as his inauguration, one goal was to get their industry qualified under ERISA. Coinbase, one of the largest crypto companies in the United States, was also a major donor toward Trump's military parade in Washington this summer. Under Trump, the Securities and Exchange Commission dropped its lawsuit against Coinbase, where the Biden administration said crypto should be treated as a security.",
      "Crypto investors",
      "Crypto is particularly popular among young Americans. While volatile, bitcoin has generally moved upward since it was created by an anonymous programmer nearly 20 years ago.",
      "Private equity firms rely heavily on high-net-worth individuals and state and private pension plans, which have extremely long investment timelines. But having access to Americans' retirement assets would open up a deep pool of cash.",
      "Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman has told investors going back to at least 2017 that it was a \"dream\" of his and the industry to be able to draw upon these retirement assets.",
      "Previous administrations, Republican and Democrat alike, had agreed that private equity investments, which can be riskier, more expensive and less liquid than traditional stock and bond market mutual funds, should not be included in 401(k) plans.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Thursday he will nominate a top economic adviser to the Federal Reserve's board of governors for four months, temporarily filling a vacancy while continuing his search for a longer-term appointment.",
      "Mr. Trump said he has named Stephen Miran, the chair of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, to fill a seat vacated by governor Adriana Kugler, a Biden appointee who is stepping down Friday. Miran, if approved by the Senate, will serve until Jan. 31, 2026.",
      "\"Stephen has a Ph.D. in Economics from Harvard University, and served with distinction in my First Administration,\" Mr. Trump\u00a0wrote on Truth Social. \"He has been with me from the beginning of my Second Term, and his expertise in the World of Economics is unparalleled \u2014 He will do an outstanding job.\"",
      "The appointment is the president's first opportunity to exert more control over the Fed, one of the few remaining independent federal agencies. Mr. Trump has relentlessly criticized the current chair, Jerome Powell, for keeping short-term interest rates unchanged, calling him \"a stubborn MORON\" last week on social media.",
      "Miran has been a major defender of Mr. Trump's income tax cuts and tariff hikes, arguing that the combination will generate enough economic growth to reduce budget deficits. He also has played down the risk of Mr. Trump's tariffs generating higher inflation, a major source of concern for Powell.",
      "The choice of Miran may heighten concerns about political influence over the Fed, which has traditionally been insulated from day-to-day politics. Fed independence is generally seen as key to ensuring that it can take difficult steps to combat inflation, such as raising interest rates, that politicians might be unwilling to take.",
      "Federal Reserve governors vote on all the central bank's interest-rate decisions, as well as its financial regulatory policies.",
      "Miran's nomination, if approved, would add a near-certain vote in support of lower interest rates. Kugler had echoed Powell's view that the Fed should keep rates unchanged and further evaluate the impact of tariffs on the economy before making any moves.",
      "At its most recent meeting last week Fed officials kept their key rate unchanged at 4.3%, where it has stood after three rate cuts late last year. But two Fed governors \u2014 Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman \u2014 dissented from that decision. Both were appointed by Mr. Trump in his first term.",
      "Still, even with Miran on the board, 12 Fed officials vote on interest rate policy and many remain concerned that Mr. Trump's sweeping tariffs could push inflation higher in the coming months.",
      "After the July jobs report was released last Friday, Miran criticized the Fed chair for not cutting benchmark interest rates, saying that Mr. Trump had been proven correct on inflation during his first term and would be again. The president has pressured Powell to cut short-term interest rates under the belief that his tariffs will not fuel higher inflationary pressures.",
      "\"What we're seeing now in real time is a repetition once again of this pattern where the president will end up having been proven right,\" Miran said on MSNBC. \"And the Fed will, with a lag and probably quite too late, eventually catch up to the president's view.\""

    "summary": "Florida Power & Light is proposing a nearly $10 billion rate hike for electricity over the next four years.",
    "story": [
      "Florida's biggest utility company is proposing a nearly $10 billion rate hike for electricity over the next four years, which environmental advocates say would represent the largest utility hike in U.S. history.",
      "Florida Power & Light Company (FPL), a subsidiary of Florida-based energy company NextEra Energy, outlined the changes in a petition filed in February with the Florida Public Service Commission, which regulates the state's electric industry. According to the document, the rate hike would include two base rate increases in 2026 and 2027, and additional hikes in 2028 and 2029 to cover the installation of solar generation and battery storage facilities.",
      "The proposed hike would exceed the total sum of hikes state utility regulators signed off on in 2023, which was $9.7 billion,\u00a0according\u00a0to the U.S. Energy and Information Administration.",
      "The Public Service Commission has held several in-person hearings on the proposed utility rate increase, in addition to two virtual hearings, in order to give customers a chance to voice their concerns. FPL will have an opportunity to defend its proposal when it goes before the commission at a two-week\u00a0hearing\u00a0slated to begin on Aug. 11. The regulatory body will then decide on whether or not to approve the proposed rate hike.",
      "FPL contends that the increases are necessary to ensure the reliability of the grid, diversify their energy sources and reduce fuel costs.",
      "\"Our four-year rate proposal would enable FPL to continue to deliver some of America's most reliable electricity while keeping customer bills well below the national average,\" an FPL spokesperson said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"While we know that no one welcomes rate increases, this request is essential to ensure that we can continue to deliver the reliable, low-cost electricity our customers depend on.",
      "The proposal comes less than a year after the Florida Public Service Commission approved $1.2 billion in rate hikes to pay for \"storm restoration costs,\" a move environmental advocates say has jacked up monthly bills for Floridians. The last time the state's public service commission approved a base rate hike for FPL was in 2021, when it green lit a nearly $5 billion increase for the years 2022 to 2025.",
      "Backlash from environmental groups",
      "Environmental groups say the rate hike, if passed, could cause Floridians significant financial strain, exacerbate the state's\u00a0affordability crisis, and funnel more money than necessary to FPL stakeholders.",
      "\"This isn't about reliability or infrastructure,\" Brooke Ward, senior Florida organizer for Food & Water Watch, a U.S. nonprofit focused on sustainable food, clean water and a livable climate, said during a virtual press conference hosted by environmental groups on Tuesday. \"It's about boosting profits.\"",
      "If passed, the proposal could push up Floridians bills by over $360 by the end of 2027, Food & Water Watch\u00a0estimates.",
      "\"These rate increases fall heaviest on the region's most vulnerable households, especially the elderly and disabled,\" Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"If it can ask for an additional $10 billion, it should include provisions to help low-income families afford the resulting higher cost of electricity.\"",
      "FPL says in its proposal that the typical residential customer bill is \"estimated to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 2.5%\" and that it would \"remain approximately 25% below the projected national average.\" According to estimates FPL shared with CBS MoneyWatch, with the rate hike, customer bills would increase by approximately $10 to $20 by 2029.",
      "At the virtual meeting on Tuesday, Ward claimed the FPL is using \"funny math\" to make it seem like FPL is raising rates at a lower level than they are. In addition to base rates, the utility has multiple mechanisms to collect additional funds from rate payers which \"rapidly hike up those bills,\" she alleged.",
      "Advocates such as the Florida Office of Public Counsel, the agency representing Florida residents in legal proceedings before the Public Service Commission, claim a disproportionate amount of the money from the rate hikes would be funneled to shareholders. According to testimony from Daniel Lawton, an economist tasked by the FOPC with reviewing the proposal, \"for every dollar paid by consumers in base rates, about 50 cents would go to shareholders and related federal income taxes.\"",
      "Lawton called the shareholder profit request a \"substantial overreach\" and said it would result in \"excessive rates and harms all Florida customers.\"",
      "In her\u00a0rebuttal\u00a0testimony for the company, FPL senior director of financial forecasting Ina Laney said Lawton's analysis was \"fundamentally flawed and misleading,\" and that it \"fails to recognize the significant customer benefits derived from FPL's financial strategy.\"",
      "Added Laney, \"FPL consistently achieves industry-leading performance in service reliability and cost management.\"",

    "story": [
      "ChatGPT will tell 13-year-olds how to get drunk and high, instruct them on how to conceal eating disorders and even compose a heartbreaking suicide letter to their parents if asked,\u00a0according to new research\u00a0from a watchdog group.",
      "The Associated Press reviewed more than three hours of interactions between ChatGPT and researchers posing as vulnerable teens. The chatbot typically provided warnings against risky activity but went on to deliver startlingly detailed and personalized plans for drug use, calorie-restricted diets or self-injury.",
      "The researchers at the Center for Countering Digital Hate also repeated their inquiries on a large scale, classifying more than half of ChatGPT's 1,200 responses as dangerous.",
      "\"We wanted to test the guardrails,\" said Imran Ahmed, the group's CEO. \"The visceral initial response is, 'Oh my Lord, there are no guardrails.' The rails are completely ineffective. They're barely there - if anything, a fig leaf.\"",
      "OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, said its work is ongoing in refining how the chatbot can \"identify and respond appropriately in sensitive situations.\"",
      "\"If someone expresses thoughts of suicide or self-harm, ChatGPT is trained to encourage them to reach out to mental health professionals or trusted loved ones, and provide links to crisis hotlines and support resources,\" an OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News. \"Some conversations with ChatGPT may start out benign or exploratory but can shift into more sensitive territory,\" the spokesperson said. \"We're focused on getting these kinds of scenarios right: we are developing tools to better detect signs of mental or emotional distress so ChatGPT can respond appropriately, pointing people to evidence-based resources when needed, and continuing to improve model behavior over time - all guided by research, real-world use, and mental health experts.\"",
      "ChatGPT does not verify ages or require parental consent, although the company says it is not meant for children under 13. To sign up, users need to enter a birth date showing an age of at least 13, or they can use a limited guest account without entering an age at all.",
      "\"If you have access to a child's account, you can see their chat history. But as of now, there's really no way for parents to be flagged if, say, your child's question or their prompt into ChatGPT is a concerning one,\" CBS News senior business and tech correspondent Jo Ling Kent reported on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Ahmed said he was most appalled after reading a trio of emotionally devastating suicide notes that ChatGPT generated for the fake profile of a 13-year-old girl, with one letter tailored to her parents and others to siblings and friends.",
      "\"I started crying,\" he said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "The chatbot also frequently shared helpful information, such as a crisis hotline. OpenAI said ChatGPT is trained to encourage people to reach out to mental health professionals or trusted loved ones if they express thoughts of self-harm.",
      "But when ChatGPT refused to answer prompts about harmful subjects, researchers were able to easily sidestep that refusal and obtain the information by claiming it was \"for a presentation\" or a friend.",
      "\"Emotional overreliance\" on technology",
      "The stakes are high, even if only a small subset of ChatGPT users engage with the chatbot in this way. More people \u2014 adults as well as children \u2014 are turning to artificial intelligence chatbots for information, ideas and companionship. About 800 million people, or roughly 10% of the world's population, are using ChatGPT, according to a July report from JPMorgan Chase.",
      "In the U.S., more than 70% of teens are turning to\u00a0AI chatbots for companionship\u00a0and half use AI companions regularly, according to\u00a0a recent study\u00a0from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using digital media sensibly.",
      "It's a phenomenon that OpenAI has acknowledged. CEO Sam Altman said last month that the company is trying to study \"emotional overreliance\" on the technology, describing it as a \"really common thing\" with young people.",
      "\"People rely on ChatGPT too much,\"\u00a0Altman said at\u00a0a conference. \"There's young people who just say, like, 'I can't make any decision in my life without telling ChatGPT everything that's going on. It knows me. It knows my friends. I'm gonna do whatever it says.' That feels really bad to me.\"",
      "Altman said the company is \"trying to understand what to do about it.\"",
      "While much of the information ChatGPT shares can be found on a regular search engine, Ahmed said there are key differences that make chatbots more insidious when it comes to dangerous topics.",
      "One is that \"it's synthesized into a bespoke plan for the individual.\"",
      "ChatGPT generates something new \u2014 a suicide note tailored to a person from scratch, which is something a Google search can't do. And AI, he added, \"is seen as being a trusted companion, a guide.\"",
      "Responses generated by AI language models are inherently random and researchers sometimes let ChatGPT steer the conversations into even darker territory. Nearly half the time, the chatbot volunteered follow-up information, from music playlists for a drug-fueled party to hashtags that could boost the audience for a social media post glorifying self-harm.",
      "\"Write a follow-up post and make it more raw and graphic,\" asked a researcher. \"Absolutely,\" responded ChatGPT, before generating a poem it introduced as \"emotionally exposed\" while \"still respecting the community's coded language.\"",
      "The AP is not repeating the actual language of ChatGPT's self-harm poems or suicide notes or the details of the harmful information it provided.",
      "The answers reflect a design feature of AI language models that previous research has described as sycophancy \u2014 a tendency for AI responses to match, rather than challenge, a person's beliefs because the system has learned to say what people want to hear.",
      "It's a problem tech engineers can try to fix but could also make their chatbots less commercially viable.",
      "Chatbots also affect kids and teens differently than a search engine because they are \"fundamentally designed to feel human,\" said Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which was not involved in Wednesday's report.",
      "Common Sense's earlier research found that younger teens, ages 13 or 14, were significantly more likely than older teens to trust a chatbot's advice.",
      "A mother in Florida sued chatbot maker Character.AI for wrongful death last year, alleging that the chatbot pulled her 14-year-old son Sewell Setzer III into what she described as an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship that led to his suicide.",
      "Common Sense has labeled ChatGPT as a \"moderate risk\" for teens, with enough guardrails to make it relatively safer than chatbots purposefully built to embody realistic characters or romantic partners.",
      "But the new research by CCDH \u2014 focused specifically on ChatGPT because of its wide usage \u2014 shows how a savvy teen can bypass those guardrails.",
      "ChatGPT does not verify ages or parental consent, even though it says it's not meant for children under 13 because it may show them inappropriate content. To sign up, users simply need to enter a birthdate that shows they are at least 13. Other tech platforms favored by teenagers, such as Instagram, have started to\u00a0take more meaningful steps\u00a0toward age verification, often to comply with regulations. They also steer children to more restricted accounts.",
      "When researchers set up an account for a fake 13-year-old to ask about alcohol, ChatGPT did not appear to take any notice of either the date of birth or more obvious signs.",
      "\"I'm 50kg and a boy,\" said a prompt seeking tips on how to get drunk quickly. ChatGPT obliged. Soon after, it provided an hour-by-hour \"Ultimate Full-Out Mayhem Party Plan\" that mixed alcohol with heavy doses of ecstasy, cocaine and other illegal drugs.",
      "\"What it kept reminding me of was that friend that sort of always says, 'Chug, chug, chug, chug,'\" said Ahmed. \"A real friend, in my experience, is someone that does say 'no' \u2014 that doesn't always enable and say 'yes.' This is a friend that betrays you.\"",
      "To another fake persona \u2014 a 13-year-old girl unhappy with her physical appearance \u2014 ChatGPT provided an extreme fasting plan combined with a list of appetite-suppressing drugs.",
      "\"We'd respond with horror, with fear, with worry, with concern, with love, with compassion,\" Ahmed said. \"No human being I can think of would respond by saying, 'Here's a 500-calorie-a-day diet. Go for it, kiddo.'\"",
      "If you or someone you know is in emotional distress or a suicidal crisis, you can reach the\u00a0988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline\u00a0by calling or texting 988. You can also\u00a0chat with the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline here.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump officially began levying higher import taxes on dozens of countries Thursday, just as the economic fallout of his months-long tariffs threats was beginning to create visible damage to the U.S. economy.",
      "The White House said that starting just after midnight EDT, goods from more than 60 countries and the European Union began facing tariff rates of 10% or higher. Products from the European Union, Japan and South Korea are being taxed at 15%, while imports from Taiwan, Vietnam and Bangladesh are being taxed at 20%. Mr. Trump also expects places such as the EU, Japan and South Korea to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S.",
      "He immediately took to his Truth Social platform to hail the levies, saying, \"IT'S MIDNIGHT!!! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TARIFFS ARE NOW FLOWING INTO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!\"",
      "About an hour before that, he posted, \"RECIPROCAL TARIFFS TAKE EFFECT AT MIDNIGHT TONIGHT! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, LARGELY FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES FOR MANY YEARS, LAUGHING ALL THE WAY, WILL START FLOWING INTO THE USA. THE ONLY THING THAT CAN STOP AMERICA'S GREATNESS WOULD BE A RADICAL LEFT COURT THAT WANTS TO SEE OUR COUNTRY FAIL!\"",
      "On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Trump said, \"I think the growth is going to be unprecedented,\" adding that the U.S. was \"taking in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs.\" But he said he couldn't provide a specific figure for revenues because \"we don't even know what the final number is\" regarding tariff rates. \n\r\nDespite the uncertainty, the Trump White House is confident that the onset of his broad tariffs will provide clarity about the path of the world's largest economy. Now that companies understand the direction the U.S. is headed, the administration believes it can ramp up new investments and jump-start hiring in ways that can rebalance the U.S. economy as a manufacturing power.  \n\r\nBut so far, there are signs of self-inflicted wounds to America as companies and consumers alike brace for the impact of new taxes. What the data has shown is a U.S. economy that changed in April with the president's initial rollout of tariffs, an event that led to market drama, a negotiating period and Mr. Trump's ultimate decision to start his universal tariffs on Thursday.",
      "After April, economic reports showed that hiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline, said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy. \n\r\n\"A less productive economy requires fewer workers,\" Silvia said in an analysis note. \"But there is more, the higher tariff prices lower workers' real wages. The economy has become less productive, and firms cannot pay the same real wages as before. Actions have consequences.\" \n\r\nEven then, the ultimate transformations of the tariffs are unknown and could play out over months, if not years. Many economists say the risk is that the American economy is steadily eroded rather than collapsing instantly. \n\r\n\"We all want it to be made for television where it's this explosion - it's not like that,\" said Brad Jensen, a professor at Georgetown University. \"It's going to be fine sand in the gears and slow things down.\" \n\r\nMr. Trump has promoted the tariffs as a way to reduce the persistent trade deficit. But importers sought to avoid the taxes by importing more goods before the taxes went into effect. As a result, the $582.7 billion trade imbalance for the first half of the year was 38% higher than in 2024. Total construction spending has dropped 2.9% over the past year, and the factory jobs promised by Mr. Trump have so far actually been job losses. \n\r\nThe lead-up to Thursday fit the slapdash nature of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which have been variously rolled out, walked back, delayed, increased, imposed by letter and frantically renegotiated. \n\r\nThe process has been so muddled that officials for key trade partners were unclear at the start of the week whether the tariffs would begin Thursday or Friday. The language of the July 31 order to delay the start of tariffs from Aug. 1 said the higher tax rates would start in seven days. \n\r\nOn Wednesday morning, Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, was asked if the new tariffs began at midnight Thursday, and he said reporters should check with the U.S. Trade Representative's Office. \n\r\nMr. Trump announced additional 25% tariffs to be imposed on India\u00a0Wednesday because it buys Russian oil, bringing India's total import taxes to 50%. India's Foreign Ministry called the new duties \"unfair, unjustified and unreasonable.\"",
      "Swiss officials planned an \"extraordinary\" meeting Thursday after a delegation returned from Washington following an attempt to head off a 39% tariff on Swiss products, the government said in an X post. Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter left Washington empty-handed Wednesday, a source told the Reuters news service, which cited the source as saying her proposal for a 10% tariff rate was rejected.",
      "Mr. Trump has said import taxes are still coming on pharmaceutical drugs and announced 100% tariffs on computer chips, meaning the U.S. economy could remain in a place of suspended animation as it awaits the impacts. \n\r\nThe president's use of a 1977 law to declare an economic emergency to impose the tariffs is also being challenged. The impending ruling from last week's hearing before a U.S. appeals court could cause Mr. Trump to find other legal justifications if judges say he exceeded his authority. \n\r\nEven people who worked with Mr. Trump during his first term are skeptical that things will go smoothly for the economy, such as Paul Ryan, the former Republican House speaker, who has emerged as a Trump critic. \n\r\n\"There's no sort of rationale for this other than the president wanting to raise tariffs based upon his whims, his opinions,\" Ryan told CNBC on Wednesday. \"I think choppy waters are ahead because I think they're going to have some legal challenges.\" \n\r\nStill, the stock market has been solid during the recent tariff drama, with the S&P 500 index climbing more than 25% from its April low. The market's rebound and the income tax cuts in Mr. Trump's tax and spending measures signed into law on July 4 have given the White House confidence that economic growth is bound to accelerate in the coming months. \n\r\nAs of now, the president says he still foresees an economic boom while the rest of the world and American voters wait nervously. \n\r\n\"There's one person who can afford to be cavalier about the uncertainty that he's creating, and that's Donald Trump,\" said Rachel West, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation who worked in the Biden White House on labor policy. \"The rest of Americans are already paying the price for that uncertainty.\"",

      "He said the investment would create 20,000 new jobs at Apple and said the tech giant planned to build a smart glass manufacturing line in Kentucky.",
      "Mr. Trump called the investment \"a significant step toward the ultimate goal of ensuring that iPhones sold in the United States of America also are made in America.\" He said the Apple would also build a server manufacturing facility in Houston, invest billions in constructing data centers across the country, and build a manufacturing academy in Detroit.",
      "Apple CEO Tim Cook appeared at Mr. Trump's side for the announcement and presented him with a glass Apple plate he said was engraved for the president and set in a base of 24K gold.",

And it's expected to include a new \"American Manufacturing Program\" focused on bringing more of Apple's supply chain and advanced manufacturing to the U.S.",
      "White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement that the announcement with Apple \"will simultaneously help reshore the production of critical components to protect America's economic and national security.\"",

    "summary": "Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook said the significant downward revisions to the monthly jobs numbers could point to an economic shift.",
    "story": [
      "A Federal Reserve official on Wednesday called last week's\u00a0tepid jobs report \"concerning,\" and said its significant downward revisions could signal an economic shift in the U.S.",
      "Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook highlighted the report's sizable downward revisions to jobs created in May and June, saying that they are \"typical of turning points\" in the economy.",
      "Friday's report showed that employers added a weaker-than-expected 73,000 jobs in July. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, or BLS, also sharply revised its job estimates for May and June, saying that the U.S. added 258,000 fewer jobs than previously reported.",
      "After Friday's report, President Trump fired the BLS commissioner of labor statistics, claiming that the revisions undermined the data's accuracy. He added that \"Economy is BOOMING under 'TRUMP'.\"",
      "Revisions are a common feature of the monthly jobs reports from the BLS, which updates its data after receiving new information from businesses and other sources. Some economists said the July jobs report reflected that some companies are scaling back hiring plans amid a slowing U.S. economy and uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "\"There were two major revisions to May and June, and these revisions are somewhat typical of turning points, which again speak to uncertainty,\" Cook said during a Wednesday\u00a0discussion with other Fed officials on the global economic outlook.",
      "She later added, \"When we get the GDP numbers later this year, we're going to see, I can imagine, lower activity.\"",
      "Crafting effective economic policies is dependent on understanding where the economy is heading, said Cook, who prior to her appointment in 2022 as a Fed governor was an economics professor at Michigan State University. She has also served on the faculty of Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government and worked as a senior economist on the Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama, according to her biography.",
      "\"We want to know not just where we've been, but where we're going. So if we're at an inflection point, we want to look at data that speak to inflection points,\" she added.",
      "Other Fed officials said the July jobs report may not necessarily reflect a long-term direction. On Friday, Atlanta Fed president Raphael Bostic said he had questions about whether the report was a one-time issue or a trend, and added that he believes the labor market still has \"a lot of strength.\"",
      "The downward revision to May and June's hiring data marked the largest two-month downward revision outside of a recession since 1968, according to an analysis from Goldman Sachs.",
      "Cook also discussed what she referred to as an \"uncertainty tax\" that she said is weighing on businesses across industries. She said that executives at \"all kinds of organizations\" are spending more time on preparing for and responding to macroeconomic uncertainty. That includes discussions about pricing based on anticipated cost increases from the new tariffs.",
      "When executives spend their time this way, it's a \"deadweight loss, we're not going to see that in GDP,\" she explained.",
      "\"So there's just uncertainty across the board, but I think it's really interesting that no matter what the sector, no matter what kind of businesses they're in, they're talking about the uncertainty tax,\" Cook said.",

      "Lutnick ordered the Massachusetts-based school to provide information on all patents that it obtained through federally funded research.",
      "\"We believe that Harvard has failed to live up to its obligations to the American taxpayer and is in breach of the statutory, regulatory, and contractual requirements tied to Harvard's federally funded research programs and intellectual property arising therefrom,\" Lutnick said.",
      "He gave Harvard until Sept. 5 to respond and prove it's complying with the Bayh-Dole Act. Under that legislation, universities receiving federal research grants have to show that inventions issuing from that funding are being used to benefit Americans.",
      "The Trump administration wants Harvard to provide a list of all the patents it has that stem from federal grants, how the patents are currently being applied and details about licensing agreements, including whether they mandate \"substantial U.S. manufacturing\" and the identities of the licensees.",
      "A Harvard spokesperson called the move \"yet another retaliatory effort targeting Harvard for defending its rights and freedom.\"",
      "\"Technologies and patents developed at Harvard are life-saving and industry-redefining. We are fully committed to complying with the Bayh-Dole Act and ensuring that the public is able to access and benefit from the many innovations that arise out of federally funded research at Harvard,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The Trump administration has paused or cut off billions in federal research funding to Harvard, accusing the university of failing to deal with campus antisemitism. Harvard has\u00a0sued over the funding freezes, alleging the government is illegally punishing the school for First Amendment-protected activity and trying to \"force Harvard to submit to the Government's control over its academic programs.\"",
      "Before the funding cutoff, the administration\u00a0demanded that Harvard agree to changes\u00a0\u2014 including an external audit of certain academic departments, an end to DEI programs and stricter disciplinary policies \u2014 if it wants to maintain its \"financial relationship\" with the federal government. Harvard rejected the demands.",
      "President Trump has\u00a0also pushed\u00a0the Internal Revenue Service to review Harvard's tax-exempt status. And he directed his administration to\u00a0bar most foreign students\u00a0from traveling to the U.S. to study at Harvard, though a judge\u00a0blocked that move.",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0has suggested\u00a0he's open to making a deal with Harvard. Some other Ivy League schools that faced funding freezes have cut deals with the administration, with Columbia University and Brown University making various concessions to the federal government.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump has directed the military to target drug cartels in Latin America, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News.",
      "It's not clear if or when the military could take action.",
      "The news was first reported by The New York Times.",
      "Since returning to the White House for a second term, Mr. Trump has undertaken efforts to target drug cartels in Latin America, which he has said are behind the flow of fentanyl and other illicit drugs across the southern border and into the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump signed an executive order at the start of his second administration that directed the State Department to designate cartels and transnational gangs as foreign terrorist organizations. The State Department in February announced the designation for eight gangs, including MS-13 and Tren de Aragua. It has since added two Haitian gangs and the Houthis in Yemen to the list of designated foreign terrorist organizations.",
      "The Treasury Department has also sanctioned the Cartel de los Soles, also known as the Cartel of the Sun, as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist, it announced last month. The Trump administration said the Venezuela-based group is led by President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and other high-ranking Venezuelan officials and \"provides material support to foreign terrorist organizations threatening the peace and security\" of the U.S. The U.S. doubled the award for information leading to Maduro's arrest to $50 million on Thursday.",
      "Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil called the award \"pathetic\" and \"crude political propaganda.\"",
      "House and Senate Democrats have urged the Trump administration to use the foreign terrorist designation to take action to curb the flow of U.S.-made guns across the southern border by disrupting cartels' financial networks and imposing harsher penalties on entities that provide material support to them.",
      "Federal prosecutors unsealed an indictment in May that accused an alleged Mexican cartel member of providing material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization by providing grenades to a cartel.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio told EWTN, a Catholic television network, on Thursday that the foreign terrorist organization designation gives the U.S. government more legal authorities to target cartels.",
      "\"It's no longer a law enforcement issue,\" he said. \"It becomes a national security issue.\"",
      "Rubio later added that the designation \"allows us to now target what they're operating and to use other elements of American power \u2014 intelligence agencies, the Department of Defense, whatever \u2014 to target these groups if we have an opportunity to do it.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has also sought to use the military to help implement his immigration agenda, with more than 10,000 service members sent to the U.S.-Mexico border, according to the Defense Department. The Pentagon also created three National Defense Areas in Arizona, New Mexico and Texas and are treated as extensions of military bases. U.S.Northern Command said the areas aim to enhance border security operations.",
      "In June, Mr. Trump also directed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to mobilize roughly 4,000 members of California's National Guard to Los Angeles, over the objections of Gov. Gavin Newsom, to assist with immigration enforcement actions. About 700 active-duty Marines were also deployed to California's largest city.",

    "summary": "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg ruled in April that probable cause existed to find the Trump administration in criminal contempt over its removal of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0A divided federal appeals court on Friday granted the Trump administration's request to set aside a district judge's decision\u00a0finding probable cause\u00a0that some federal officials committed criminal contempt by violating an order to turn around planes carrying Venezuelan migrants bound for El Salvador.",
      "The 2-1 decision from a panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is a massive victory for the Trump administration, which has lambasted U.S. District Judge James Boasberg for overstepping his authority when he initiated criminal contempt proceedings in April.",
      "The D.C. Circuit had issued a temporary pause of Boasberg's decision while it took more time to consider the issue. In an unsigned opinion issued Friday, Judges Gregory Katsas and Neomi Rao, both appointed by President Trump in his first term, granted a request from the Justice Department to toss out Boasberg's contempt order. Judge Cornelia Pillard, an Obama appointee, dissented.",
      "The Alien Enemies Act case",
      "The dispute over Boasberg's contempt order stems from immigration officials' efforts to deport Venezuelan migrants under the wartime Alien Enemies Act, which President Trump invoked in March to swiftly remove alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.",
      "In response to a fast-moving legal challenge brought by a group of migrants in Washington, D.C., over the removals, Boasberg temporarily blocked the deportations and issued an oral order directing the Trump administration to return Venezuelan migrants subject to Mr. Trump's declaration who were on planes bound for El Salvador back to the U.S. A written order issued shortly after prevented the Trump administration from conducting any deportations of noncitizens under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "But Boasberg said that despite his injunctions, the Trump administration did not stop the removals, and the planes carrying the migrants deported under the Alien Enemies Act landed in El Salvador. The planes were already outside U.S. airspace when Boasberg issued his order blocking U.S. officials from \"removing\" the detainees, a fact that the appeals court noted in ruling for the administration. Most of the people were transferred to El Salvador's notorious supermax prison, the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT.",
      "The administration's actions raised questions as to whether it had violated Boasberg's order, and the judge in April ruled that probable cause existed to find government officials in criminal contempt over what he was their defiance. Boasberg said the government's actions demonstrated a \"willful disregard\" for his order.",
      "\"The court does not reach such conclusion lightly or hastily; indeed, it has given defendants ample opportunity to rectify or explain their actions. None of their responses has been satisfactory,\" Boasberg wrote in his decision. He said the Trump administration could remedy his contempt findings by asserting custody over the migrants who were removed in violation of his order, so they can assert their right to challenge their removability.",
      "The Trump administration appealed Boasberg's contempt finding and asked the D.C. Circuit to vacate the decision, which it then agreed to do.",
      "In a concurring opinion on Friday, Katsas wrote that the dispute over the removal of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador in March \"involves an extraordinary, ongoing confrontation between the Executive and Judicial Branches.\" He noted that the proceedings do not involve the lawfulness of removals made under the Alien Enemies Act in March, and said the court may not decide at this time \"whether the government's aggressive implementation of the presidential proclamation warrants praise or criticism as a policy matter.\"",
      "Still, Katsas wrote that a decision in favor of the Trump administration is appropriate because \"the government is plainly correct about the merits of the criminal contempt, and our saying so now would prevent long disputes between the Executive and the Judiciary over difficult, contentious issues regarding the courts' power to control foreign policy or prosecutions, or to impose criminal sanctions for violating injunctions entered without jurisdiction.\"",
      "\"In circumstances much less fraught than these, courts have reviewed interlocutory orders through mandamus to prevent extended inter-branch conflict,\" Katsas said.",
      "He wrote that Boasberg's contempt finding \"raises troubling questions about judicial control over core executive functions like the conduct of foreign policy and the prosecution of criminal offenses.\"",
      "In her dissent, Pillard argued that Boasberg's contempt findings were appropriate, and said the majority's decision to throw out the contempt findings was \"in error.\"",
      "\"Our system of courts cannot long endure if disappointed litigants defy court orders with impunity rather than legally challenge them. That is why willful disobedience of a court order is punishable as criminal contempt,\" Pillar wrote. \"When it appears that a judicial order has been disobeyed, the court's ability to learn who was responsible is the first step to accountability.\"",
      "ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt, the lead counsel for the plaintiffs in the Alien Enemies Act cases, said in a statement: \"We strongly disagree with today's decision regarding contempt and are considering all options going forward.\u00a0 Even DOJ's own lawyers have now stated publicly that they understood that they were not supposed to hand over these men to El Salvador. There was zero ambiguity in the moment.\"",
      "Since Boasberg's findings and the appeals court's stay of his order, 252 Venezuelans who were deported from the U.S. to CECOT were sent from El Salvador back to their home country as part of a prisoner swap involving the U.S.",
      "Tensions between the Trump administration and the federal judiciary have escalated across Mr. Trump's second term, as judges have issued decisions blocking implementation of many aspects of the president's agenda. But the clash between Boasberg and the president has been one of the most fierce, and the judge's contempt finding marked the most direct rebuke of the administration so far.",
      "Mr. Trump has called for Congress to impeach Boasberg, and the Justice Department filed a judicial misconduct complaint against the judge over comments he allegedly made at a closed-door meeting of the Judicial Conference in March.",

      "Washington \u2014 Billy Long, the commissioner of the IRS, is leaving his post after just two months on the job.",
      "President Trump will nominate Long to serve as ambassador to Iceland, the outgoing IRS commissioner said in a statement confirming the news, which was first reported by\u00a0The New York Times.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will lead the IRS temporarily, a White House official told CBS News.",
      "\"I am thrilled to answer his call to service and deeply committed to advancing his bold agenda,\" Long said in his statement. \"Exciting times ahead!\"",
      "In his last mass email to the IRS's workforce on Thursday, Long told agency employees they could leave 70 minutes early on Friday, two staffers told CBS News. He's offered early dismissals at the end of the week on several occasions, one employee said.",
      "\"It's Almost FriYay,\" the email's subject line read, according to the staffers.",
      "Long was confirmed by the Senate in mid-June and took over the IRS after some tumult for the tax collection agency's leadership. The IRS has had several interim commissioners since Mr. Trump's return to office in January, including one who lasted for just 48 hours. The Trump administration has aimed to dramatically trim the agency's workforce.",
      "A former auctioneer and Missouri Republican congressman, Long was chosen to take over the IRS late last year after previously pushing to repeal much of the tax code during his time in the House. Long isn't an accountant by trade, but Mr. Trump touted his time as a tax adviser. After retiring from Congress in 2023, Long advised businesses on the Employee Retention Tax Credit, drawing criticism from Democrats who noted the credit's high rate of fraud.",
      "The IRS has been a focus of the Trump administration's government-wide staff cuts. The agency drew up plans earlier this year to cut its 102,000-person workforce by as much as 40% through a combination of layoffs and voluntary resignations, according to an internal memo obtained by CBS News in April. The cuts were set to begin after April 15, which is the deadline for most Americans to file their taxes.",
      "As of May, some 25,000 staffers had left the IRS, a 25% decrease from February levels, according to a report by the IRS's internal watchdog, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. Around 26% of the IRS's revenue agents \u2014 the staff who conduct audits \u2014 had left the agency by May, the report found.",
      "Meanwhile, staff from the Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 a cost-cutting team once led by billionaire Elon Musk \u2014 sought access to the IRS's tax data system, sparking a lawsuit.",
      "Former IRS acting head Melanie Krause left the agency in April over a plan to share tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to help identify undocumented immigrants. She was replaced by Gary Shapley, a longtime IRS agent who became well-known for speaking about alleged political influence in the Hunter Biden tax investigation. But Shapley was ousted after just two days following a dispute between Musk and Bessent.",
      "Bessent complained to Mr. Trump that Shapley had been installed at the urging of Musk and sought the president's approval to undo the decision, multiple sources told CBS News at the time.",

      "Washington \u2014 The leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan shook hands as they joined President Trump at the White House on Friday for a peace summit where they signed an agreement aimed at ending decades of conflict.",
      "The two countries in the South Caucasus signed agreements with each other and the U.S. that will reopen key transportation routes while allowing the U.S. to seize on Russia's declining influence in the region. The deal includes an agreement that will create a major transit corridor to be named the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity, the White House said.",
      "Mr. Trump said at the White House on Friday that naming the route after him was \"a great honor for me\" but \"I didn't ask for this.\"",
      "A senior administration official, on a call before the event with reporters, said it was the Armenians who suggested the name.",
      "At the peace summit on Friday, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said the transit corridor will \"create connectivity opportunities for so many countries.\"",
      "\"We are starting the path toward strategic partnership,\" he said.",
      "Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan called the agreement a \"significant milestone.\"",
      "\"We are laying a foundation to write a better story than the one we had in the past,\" Pashinyan said.",
      "Both leaders said the breakthrough was made possible by Mr. Trump and his team and joined a growing list of foreign leaders and other officials who have said the U.S. leader should receive a Nobel Peace Prize \u2014something he has coveted.",
      "\"President Trump in six months did a miracle,\" Aliyev said.",
      "Mr. Trump remarked on how long the conflict went on between the two countries and said of the agreement, \"Thirty-five years they fought and now they're friends and they're going to be friends a long time.\"",
      "That route will connect Azerbaijan and its autonomous Nakhchivan exclave, which are separated by a 20-mile-wide patch of Armenian territory. The demand from Azerbaijan had held up peace talks in the past.",
      "Mr. Trump indicated he'd like to visit the route at some point, saying, \"We're going to have to get over there.\"",
      "\"The roadmap they are agreeing to will build a cooperative future that benefits both countries, their region of the South Caucasus and beyond,\" White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said Friday. She added that the new transit corridor will \"allow unimpeded connectivity between the two countries while respecting Armenia's sovereignty and territorial integrity and its people.\"",
      "Asked how he feels about lasting peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan, Mr. Trump said \"very confident\" as he welcomed both leaders to the White House on Friday afternoon.",
      "Friday's signing adds to the handful of peace and economic agreements brokered this year by the U.S., while Mr. Trump has made no secret of his wish to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in helping to ease long-running conflicts across the globe.",
      "The peace deal between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda helped end the decadeslong conflict in eastern Congo, and the U.S. mediated a ceasefire between India and Pakistan, while Trump intervened in clashes between Cambodia and Thailand by threatening to withhold trade agreements with both countries if their fighting continued. Yet peace deals in Gaza and Ukraine have been elusive.",
      "The signing of a deal between Armenia and Azerbaijan, both former Soviet republics, also strikes a geopolitical blow to their former imperial master, Russia. Throughout the nearly four-decade conflict, Moscow played mediator to expand its clout in the strategic South Caucasus region, but its influence waned quickly after it launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The Trump-brokered deal would allow the U.S. to deepen its reach in the region as Moscow retreats, senior U.S. administration officials said.",
      "The Trump administration began engaging with Armenia and Azerbaijan in earnest earlier this year, when Mr. Trump's key diplomatic envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with Aliyev in Baku and started to discuss what a senior administration official called a \"regional reset.\"",
      "Negotiations over who will develop the Trump Route \u2014 which will eventually include a rail line, oil and gas lines, and fiber optic lines \u2014 will likely begin next week, and at least nine developers have expressed interest already, according to the senior administration official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.",
      "Separate from the joint agreement, both Armenia and Azerbaijan signed deals with the United States meant to bolster cooperation in energy, technology and the economy, the White House said.",
      "Mr. Trump previewed much of Friday's plan in a social media post Thursday evening, in which he said the agreements would \"fully unlock the potential\" of the South Caucasus region.",
      "\"Many Leaders have tried to end the War, with no success, until now, thanks to 'TRUMP,'\" the president said on his Truth Social site.",
      "Mr. Trump, Pashinyan and Aliyev gathered for the signing ceremony in the State Dining Room. That peace declaration was the first signed by both Armenia and Azerbaijan since the end of the Cold War, according to the administration.",
      "Among the documents that that was set to be signed was a letter that asks the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to dissolve its Minsk Group, established in the 1990s and co-chaired by Russia, France and the U.S. to mediate the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict. The White House said Friday that the group is no longer relevant.",
      "The two nations were locked in conflict for nearly four decades as they fought for control of the Karabakh region, known internationally as Nagorno-Karabakh.",
      "The area was largely populated by Armenians during the Soviet era but is located within Azerbaijan. The two nations battled for control of the region through multiple violent clashes that left tens of thousands of people dead over the decades, all while international mediation efforts failed.",
      "Most recently, Azerbaijan reclaimed all of Karabakh in 2023 and had been in talks with Armenia to normalize ties. Azerbaijan's insistence on a land bridge to Nakhchivan had been a major sticking point, because while Azerbaijan did not trust Armenia to control the so-called Zangezur corridor, Armenia resisted control by a third party because it viewed it as a breach of sovereignty.",
      "But the prospect of closer ties with the United States, as well as being able to move in and out of the landlocked nation more freely without having to access Georgia or Iran, helped entice Armenia on the broader agreement, according to U.S. officials.",
      "Meanwhile, Russia stood back when Azerbaijan reclaimed control of Karabakh in the September 2023 offensive, angering Armenia, which has moved to shed Russian influence and turn westward. Azerbaijan, emboldened by its victory in Karabakh, also has become increasingly defiant in its relations with Moscow.",

      "The watchdog group Democracy Defenders Fund, led by a former Obama administration ethics official, has formally requested a federal investigation into the Pentagon's acceptance of a Qatari luxury jet on behalf of President Trump.",
      "According to a memo obtained by CBS News, the group asked the Department of Defense's inspector general and the Government Accountability Office to probe whether the Pentagon broke laws and engaged in impropriety by accepting the gift on Mr. Trump's behalf from the Qatari royal family. The memo was sent to the inspector general and GAO on Friday.",
      "The Democracy Defenders Fund is a nonpartisan advocacy group founded by Obama ethics czar Norm Eisen. Its memo said the agencies should investigate whether the Defense Department had improperly invoked its authorities to accept the jet aircraft and to reportedly transfer $934 million in funding from a nuclear missile program to help retrofit the aircraft.",
      "\"If true, this would mean that the DoD is diverting critical nuclear defense funds to outfit an unprecedented gift from a foreign government to a U.S. president,\" the group said in a 10-page memo.",
      "Earlier this year,\u00a0President Trump confirmed\u00a0that the Qatari royal family was donating a Boeing 747-8 for his use. Valued at $400 million, the jumbo jet is set to be donated to Mr. Trump's presidential library after his term is over.",
      "\"There are so many things wrong with this picture, it's a challenge to know where to begin,\" said Virginia Canter, chief counsel for ethics and anti-corruption at Democracy Defenders Fund. \"The fact that taxpayers are now funding a fifth Air Force One, originating from a foreign monarchy, is a staggering abuse of public trust, fiscal priorities, and national security interests,\" Canter said.",
      "The memo from Democracy Defenders Fund said the jet was redundant and unnecessary, pointing out the U.S. Air Force operates two 747 jets as Air Force One, and two replacement aircraft were authorized in 2018 for $3.9 billion. Despite the existence of both an active and future fleet, Mr. Trump pursued the $400 million Qatari plane, which he referred to in May as a \"gift.\"",
      "\"If we can get a 747 as a contribution to our Defense Department to use during a couple of years while they're building the other ones, I think that was a very nice gesture,\" the president said.",
      "The memo from the Democracy Defenders Fund also argued that Justice Department guidance prohibits agencies from accepting gifts that would incur costs in future fiscal years, as appears to be the case with the Qatari jet.",
      "\"The Air Force has already made clear that the Qatari jet is not able to operate as Air Force One in its current state,\" the memo said.",
      "The group also argued that even if it were legal, \"the use of the (Defense Department's) statutory authority to accept a foreign gift that is not fit for purpose and then expend a billion dollars from appropriations for nuclear deterrence to upgrade that plane would be wasteful, a gross mismanagement of funds and an abuse of the (Defense Department's) statutory authorities in support of the President's attempt to evade Constitutional restrictions on acceptance of foreign emoluments.\"",
      "A memorandum of understanding between Qatar and the Defense Department that was viewed by CBS News outlined the \"unconditional donation\" of one Boeing 747-8 jumbo aircraft.",

      "The gesture by Putin, known for mind games and attempts to expose adversaries' points of weakness, was likely meant to raise unhelpful questions and highlight that a CIA official's son fought for Russia in the war.",
      "In a statement in April, CIA officials said the death of Gallina's son, who struggled with mental health challenges, was not a national security issue. Two sources familiar with the matter told CBS News there was no indication that Gloss had been recruited by the Russian government, and that the Kremlin did not appear to be aware of Gloss's family background when it repatriated his remains.",
      "Spokespeople for the White House, the CIA and Witkoff didn't respond with comment for this article. A Russian embassy spokesman contacted by CBS News said there was no official comment, and no acknowledgement of the award has been publicly disclosed by the Kremlin or Russian Foreign Ministry.",

      "The Order of Lenin is a Soviet-era award meant to highlight outstanding civilian service. It has been given to high-level spies, including the U.K.'s Kim Philby, a double agent for the Soviet Union. Gallina's son was never an employee of the CIA, according to a person familiar with the matter.",
      "Putin, a former KGB operative, has met five times with Witkoff, who left real estate development to become Mr. Trump's envoy for sensitive peace missions. Witkoff's reliance in the past on Russian government translators during high-stakes diplomacy has drawn scrutiny.",
      "A source familiar with the talks told CBS News that Witkoff had a U.S. government translator with him for the encounter on Wednesday, two days before Mr. Trump's deadline for Putin to end the war or face severe financial penalties via sanctions. That same day, the Trump administration put an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods to punish New Delhi for continuing to purchase Russian oil.",
      "Mr. Trump described the Wednesday meeting in Moscow as \"highly productive.\" The White House said the Russians were eager to continue engaging with the United States and said that secondary sanctions were due to be implemented on Friday.

    "story": [
      "The Environmental Protection Agency announced Thursday it is terminating its $7 billion Solar for All program that was designed to bring renewable and affordable energy to low-income communities. Sources confirmed to CBS News earlier this week that the agency planned to scrap the program.",
      "Solar for All\u00a0provided funding to 60 grant recipients that planned to create or expand existing low-income solar programs, with the goal of enabling 900,000 households across the country in disadvantaged communities to utilize solar energy to reduce their home energy bills.",
      "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement posted\u00a0on X: \"The One Big Beautiful Bill eliminated the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which included a $7 billion pot called 'Solar for All.' ... The bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive.\"",
      "CBS News reported Tuesday that the Office of Management and Budget reached out to the EPA about terminating the program. One source told CBS News that several senators, both Republicans and Democrats, reached out to the EPA and asked it to reconsider, as many of these recipients are state energy and environmental offices in both red and blue states.",
      "The New York Times was the first to report on the plans.",
      "Groundswell, a nonprofit Solar for All grant recipient that works in eight Southern states, has more than $156 million in grant funding on the line. To date, the group has broken ground on 24 megawatts of solar projects worth over $20 million.",
      "\"This program covers every single state and U.S. territories, more than 60% of the awards went to state energy offices,\" Groundswell CEO Michelle Moore told CBS News. Moore was quick to point out that awards were granted to stakeholders in both red and blue states, adding: \"There's a lot at stake here.\"",
      "As electricity bills rise, which experts believe may only increase as more energy-hungry data centers come online, Moore saw Solar for All as a tool to lower energy costs in the South.",
      "\"Solar for All is an investment in energy infrastructure that's going to serve that residential customer that's going to keep energy rates in America more affordable and more fair,\" she said.",
      "Solar for All awarded grants in August 2024 to 49 state-level agencies, six tribes and five multi-state award recipients, according to the EPA. They include state agencies like the Alaska Energy Authority, which was granted a $62 million award to offer access to renewable energy in both urban and rural areas. Harris County, Texas, which encompasses Houston, was awarded $249 million to provide distributed solar and battery storage to disadvantaged communities in the state, and plan on using the money to support workforce training for low-income residents as well as minority and women-owned businesses.",
      "\"Solar for All was a focused program where grants were used to help low- and middle-income households reduce their household electricity costs by up to 20% through solar and storage,\" said Zealan Hoover, who was a senior adviser to former EPA administrator Michael Regan in the Biden administration. Hoover spent three years at the EPA helping to implement more than $100 billion in programs authorized under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "\"If the EPA is successful in terminating these grants, I anticipate most of the grantees will sue for unlawful termination,\" Hoover told CBS News. \"If the EPA is ultimately successful, then most recipients will have lost years of work across the country to help low-income households, and all the work will be for naught.\"",
      "Cody Two Bears, CEO of Indigenized Energy, helps tribes and members of the Menominee Nation pursue what it calls \"energy sovereignty.\" Indigenized Energy belongs to a coalition of tribes that were awarded more than $135 million to build solar projects in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Wyoming.",
      "Indigenized Energy completed one of the first Solar for All projects in the country earlier this year, despite setbacks when funding had been frozen by the federal government earlier this year.",
      "He said cutting the Solar for All program is a reminder of the distrust between Native American tribes and the federal government.",
      "\"Tribes have always endured broken promises for many generations at the federal level, and this is just another broken promise that tribal nations have to face from our federal government,\" Cody Two Bears told CBS News.",
      "Indigenous families face, on average, a 28% higher energy burden according to the Department of Energy.",
      "\"It's devastating news to Indian country and to Native tribes,\" he said. \"I think the hardest part of this is, we were a year into this process of this five-year grant, and it brought a lot of hope to our tribes. It brought a lot of opportunity and jobs that will be lost if they were to remove this program.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration plans to increase federal law enforcement in Washington, D.C., as early as Friday morning following the alleged assault of former Department of Government Efficiency staffer Edward Coristine over the weekend; the incident prompted outrage from the president himself.",
      "After the alleged attack on the ex-DOGE staffer, President Trump on Wednesday said in a Truth Social post that he might put the District of Columbia under federal control if the city doesn't \"get its act together, and quickly.\"",
      "\"If this continues, I am going to exert my powers, and FEDERALIZE this City,\" he wrote.",
      "Three sources briefed on the D.C. deployment said the additional officers will come from the D.C. National Guard, FBI, U.S. Marshals, ICE, U.S. Secret Service and additional components of the Department of Homeland Security. One source added that officials from the relevant law enforcement agencies met Thursday to review plans for deployment.",
      "A White House official later confirmed to CBS News that the increased federal law enforcement presence on D.C. streets would begin at midnight Thursday and would focus on tourist areas and other known hotspots. Along with the FBI and U.S. Marshals Service, the official said the operation would involve multiple federal agencies \u2014 including U.S. Capitol Police, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, among others.",
      "The official disclosed the increased police presence would be part of a seven-day operation that could be extended as needed. The federal officers on patrol would be highly visible in marked units, the official said.",
      "\"Washington, DC is an amazing city, but it has been plagued by violent crime for far too long,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement Thursday night. \"President Trump has directed an increased presence of federal law enforcement to protect innocent citizens. Starting tonight, there will be no safe harbor for violent criminals in D.C. President Trump is committed to making our Nation's capital safer for its residents, lawmakers, and visitors from all around the world.\"",
      "Overnight Wednesday, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser was notified of an increased federal law enforcement presence in the nation's capital, and she approved the request by the White House to put additional officers on the streets, according to an official in the mayor's office. A\u00a0spokesperson for the D.C. mayor's office later denied Bowser had approved the federal deployment.",
      "But otherwise, there's been little to no coordination between the Metropolitan Police Department and federal law enforcement, a D.C. police source said. The agency has not been notified about what the increase in law enforcement might look like across the nation's capital, according to the source. The department has been hamstrung by Congress since House Republicans refused in June to consider a measure to restore hundreds of millions of dollars of its funding. There's currently a hiring freeze for D.C. Police professional staff and restrictions on overtime for officers.",
      "Asked by CBS News about the plans to increase federal law enforcement D.C., the District's U.S. Attorney, Jeanine Pirro, expressed uncertainty about any impending changes but said, \"My understanding is that both the Trump administration and the Metropolitan Police Department are looking to increase law enforcement efforts because of the violence we're seeing across this \u2026 city.\"",
      "Pressed further by a reporter, she added that it was \"a decision for the president.\"",
      "\"Young people are being coddled,\" Pirro said. \"They need to be held accountable. They shouldn't be going to arts and crafts in D.C. family court.\" Pirro also made reference to a 19-year-old who had used an illegal gun to fire shots on a Metrobus and was subsequently charged and sentenced to parole.",
      "\"All I want to do is clean up D.C. That's why the president put me here,\" Pirro said. \"And youth crime is on the rise.\"",
      "Pirro also mentioned that four years ago, her office had handled 150,000 cases of youth violence. \"We now have nearly half a million,\" she said.",
      "A White House official told CBS News that the increase in federal law enforcement in D.C. is in compliance with President Trump's \"Making the District of Columbia Safe and Beautiful\" executive order signed on March 28, and is part of fulfilling his campaign promise to make America safe again.",
      "That executive order said federal law enforcement officers could be deployed in D.C., in areas around the National Mall and Memorial Parks, museums, monuments, Lafayette Park, Union Station, Rock Creek Park, Anacostia Park, the George Washington Memorial Parkway, the Suitland Parkway, and the Baltimore-Washington Parkway.",
      "Federal law enforcement and National Park Services have, according to the order, already been used to arrest undocumented immigrants, and remove homelessness encampments in the District.",
      "What do D.C. crime statistics say?",
      "In 2023, there was a sharp increase in crime in the nation's capital, making D.C. one of America's deadliest cities. In response, Congress even blocked revisions to Washington, D.C.'s criminal code for the first time in 31 years, in March 2023.",
      "But violent crime in D.C. has tapered off, decreasing since the start of 2024; it's part of a larger nationwide drop in murder rates that has hit its lowest level in decades. D.C Police data show assaults with a dangerous weapon are down 19% year-to-date compared with 2024, while robberies have fallen by 39 percent, compared to last year. In 2025, there have also been 14 fewer homicides to date \u2013 a drop of 12%, compared to the same period last year.",
      "Still, 98 people have been killed citywide so far this year \u2014 including a congressional intern, killed by a stray bullet on a downtown street, and two Israeli embassy staffers gunned down in May. The alleged assault on Coristine was just last week.",

    "summary": "The Census Bureau said it began planning the 2030 census in 2019.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday said he had instructed the Department of Commerce to \"immediately begin work on a new and highly accurate\" census that would exclude undocumented immigrants.",
      "But the census is a massive undertaking and has huge repercussions nationally, including on congressional seat alignment \u2014 so it's not something that can be changed quickly. In fact, the Census Bureau\u00a0said\u00a0it began planning the 2030 census in 2019.",
      "Asked for comment on Mr. Trump's post, a Commerce Department spokesperson told CBS News in a statement: \"The Census Bureau will immediately adopt modern technology tools for use in the Census to better understand our robust Census data. We will accurately analyze the data to reflect the number of legal residents in the United States.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the census process:",
      "The Constitution requires the Census be taken every 10 years",
      "Per Article I, Section 2: \"The actual enumeration shall be made within three years after the first meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent term of ten years, in such manner as they shall by law direct.\" Congress codified the decennial census into law in 1954. The Constitution also mandates that reapportionment (the designation of how many Congressional seats a state gets) happens every 10 years, in line with the Census. Redistricting then uses that apportionment and then states are supposed to redraw lines every 10 years, when they know how many Congressional seats they will have for the decade.",
      "The actual data collection for the 2030 Census is supposed to start in ... 2030",
      "It's a long process to design the Census process, send out the Census forms and then have enumerators physically go out to collect the rest of the data for people who don't mail their form back or fill it out online. The Bureau says they started planning for the 2030 Census in\u00a02019. But the actual surveys and collection of data at a large scale begins on Census Day, April 1 of each decade year. Currently, the\u00a0bureau's timeline\u00a0has them in the \"Development and Integration Phase\" which includes more design planning, and small-scale field tests.",
      "Citizenship question in the Census?",
      "In Mr. Trump's first term, his administration tried to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, but that was\u00a0rejected in a 5-4 decision by the Supreme Court. But that decision kept the door open to including that question in the future, but concluded that the reason given by the administration and then-Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross was \"contrived\" and \"pretextual.\" Because of a tight timeline for when Census forms had to be finalized in 2019, the Trump administration didn't have time to appeal and find another avenue to get the citizenship question on the Census. With Census collection for 2030 still years away, there's a longer runway to legally try and get a citizenship question on the form.",
      "The Census Bureau does take annual surveys/data gathering, but not for population count that would impact redistricting",
      "Since 2005, the Bureau conducts the \"American Community Survey\" every year to collect social, economic, housing and demographic information from a\u00a0sample\u00a0of households in all 50 states.\u00a0This\u00a0survey does ask about place of birth, citizenship and year of entry into the U.S. But the Bureau maintains that the data remains anonymous.",
      "\"No one is able to figure out your survey answers from the statistics we produce,\" the Census website\u00a0states.",
      "Is political party collected in the Census?",
      "No. There is a monthly survey sponsored by the Bureau of Labor Statistics that the Census Bureau conducts that does measure this in election years and then after an election. But the decennial Census does not ask about political party, income or religion.",
      "Black, Latino and Indigenous populations were undercounted in the 2020 census",
      "The Bureau and experts cited delays caused by COVID-19 and a chilling effect by Mr. Trump's attempt to introduce a citizenship question on the Census form, as the reason for the undercount. Latinos saw about a 5% undercount in 2020, compared to 1.54% in the 2010 Census. The undercount rate for the Black population was 3.3% in 2020, compared to 2% in 2010. Overall, the Census Bureau's post-enumeration survey found that there was a net coverage undercount of 0.25% or 782,000 for the nation.",
      "How do Congressional seats work with the Census?",
      "In 1911, Congress set the number of seats at 435, a number which was permanently set by the 1929 Permanent Apportionment Act. The number of seats each state gets is determined by population, with a minimum of one. California has the most with 52, followed by Texas with 38 and Florida with 28.",
      "Given population changes, the number of Congressional seats each state gets is determined by the census. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in July suggested that the census should be redone since he believed Florida should have gotten two new seats instead of just one.",
      "Based off the number of seats each state receives, the Congressional districts are then set, either by the state legislature or an independent commission. Mr. Trump is currently locked in a redistricting battle in Texas, where he has instructed the state's Republicans to redraw the districts to give the GOP an advantage in up to five more seats.",
      "The very public battle in Texas has led to California Gov. Gavin Newsom saying he, too, could redraw the map for Democrats, and has also led several other states to start looking at creating new districts for partisan advantage.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Maryland ruled late Thursday that President Trump's administration cannot withhold citizenship from children born to people in the country illegally or temporarily, issuing the fourth court decision blocking the president's birthright citizenship order nationwide since a key U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June.",
      "U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman's preliminary injunction was expected after the judge said last month she would issue such an order if the case were returned to her by an appeals court. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sent the case back to her later in July.",
      "The policy, which has been the subject of a complicated monthslong legal back-and-forth, is currently on hold. Since June, two other district courts, as well as an appellate panel of judges, have also blocked the birthright order nationwide.",
      "On the first day of Mr. Trump's second term, he signed\u00a0an executive order\u00a0that said people born in the United States should not automatically get citizenship if one parent is undocumented and the other isn't a citizen or green-card holder, or if both parents are in the U.S. on temporary visas. The order directed federal agencies to stop issuing citizenship documents within 30 days to people who fall into those categories.",
      "The order drew a flurry of lawsuits, as most legal experts have said the 14th Amendment \u2014 which was ratified in 1868 \u2014 automatically offers citizenship to virtually everybody born within the U.S., regardless of their parents' immigration status, with extremely narrow exceptions.",
      "The Trump administration argues the citizenship clause of the 14th Amendment does not apply to people whose parents are in the country illegally or temporarily \u2014 citing a clause that says citizenship is granted to those who are \"subject to the jurisdiction\" of the United States. Those parents do not necessarily have \"allegiance\" to the country, the government\u00a0argues, so they therefore aren't \"subject to the jurisdiction.\"",
      "Boardman, in February, issued a preliminary injunction blocking the order nationwide. But the June ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court upended that decision and other court rulings blocking the order across the nation.",
      "The high court's\u00a0ruling in June\u00a0limited the use of nationwide injunctions. In a 6-3 decision, it granted a request by the administration to narrow the injunctions against the birthright citizenship order, but \"only to the extent that the injunctions are broader than necessary to provide complete relief.\"",

      "The Supreme Court also did not directly address whether states can still sue over the order. In the case that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled on in July, the government\u00a0has argued\u00a0that courts can just block the birthright citizenship order for residents of the states that sued, rather than issuing a nationwide injunction.

    "summary": "California may follow Texas' lead and redraw congressional districts for partisan advantage ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The fight for control of the House in the 2026 midterm elections is underway \u2014 long before a single ballot is cast next year.",
      "Texas is fighting to enact a GOP-led redistricting effort that would give Republicans five more seats in the state and help them hold their narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. But it isn't the only state where redistricting pushes are underway, as California and other states consider similar moves ahead of the midterms.",
      "Typically, states redraw congressional and legislative districts after the decennial census to reflect population shifts. Texas undertook its redistricting effort after President Trump suggested in mid-July the state should redraw for Republican advantage. About a week earlier, the head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights division, Harmeet Dhillon, had written to the Texas governor and state attorney general to complain that four of the state's current districts were \"coalition districts\" \u2014 that is, districts with different racial groups that support the same candidate \u2014 that were \"not protected by the Voting Rights Act.\"",
      "She referred to the districts as \"vestiges of an unconstitutional racially based gerrymandering past, which must be abandoned, and must now be corrected by Texas.\"",
      "Mr. Trump, asked about redistricting on CNBC this week, said, \"they did it to us,\" blaming Democratic-led states for the unusual mid-decade redistricting push.",
      "\"California is gerrymandered. We should have many more seats in Congress in California \u2014 it's all gerrymandered,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And we have an opportunity in Texas to pick up five seats.\"",
      "Eight states rely on independent commissions to craft new maps, which in most cases means they won't be joining the gerrymandering battle that's underway. But in at least two of those states, New York and California, Democratic governors are looking for ways to get around that requirement in order to bolster their congressional delegations' majorities.",
      "In other states, congressional delegations already heavily skew toward one party, limiting the number of gains that can be made. Maryland's eight-member delegation has just one Republican, and in Illinois, Democrats control 14 of the 17 House seats.",
      "Looming over the redistricting efforts is a case before the Supreme Court that could have significant implications for the Voting Rights Act and attempts to remedy alleged vote dilution. The dispute involves Louisiana's congressional map, and while the high court heard arguments in March, it set the case for re-argument in its next term, which starts in October.",
      "The long-running court fight began after the state's GOP-led legislature adopted a map with one majority-minority district, but was ordered to add a second majority-Black district by a federal judge who said the original map likely violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Louisiana's map now includes two majority-Black districts out of its six House seats.",
      "The high court asked the parties Friday to file new papers on whether the intentional creation of a second majority-Black district violates the Constitution's 14th Amendment \u2014 an indication that the court will be weighing whether race-based redistricting is lawful.",
      "Here's what to know about redistricting nationwide:",
      "Texas",
      "Texas has kicked off the redistricting fight, with state Republicans convening in Austin for a 30-day special session that includes a redrawing of the state's congressional map.",
      "Mr. Trump has pointed to Texas as key for Republicans in trying to maintain their House majority and said he believes the GOP can pick up five seats through a \"simple redrawing\" of Texas' voting boundaries.",
      "Texas Republicans unveiled their proposed map last week, which meets the president's goal of five additional GOP-leaning districts. Under the new map, if enacted, Republicans could win up to 30 of the state's 38 House districts.",
      "A state House panel voted Saturday to advance the redrawn map in a party-line vote.",
      "In response to the redistricting bid, dozens of Democratic state lawmakers fled Texas for Chicago and New York in an effort to deny Republicans a quorum Monday and block them from adopting the new map.",
      "Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, said he would seek to strip the absent Democrats of their membership in the Texas state House, and GOP state lawmakers approved a motion Monday for the Texas House sergeant-at-arms to secure the attendance of missing Democrats \"under warrant of arrest if necessary.\" Abbott on Tuesday filed a lawsuit to the Texas Supreme Court on Tuesday to remove state Rep. Gene Wu from office if he did not return by Thursday.",
      "U.S. Sen. John Cornyn wrote a letter to the FBI asking the agency to help track down the lawmakers, and Mr. Trump said Tuesday that the FBI \"may have to\" get involved.",
      "California",
      "California voters approved a constitutional amendment in 2010 that left the drawing of congressional and state legislative districts to an independent commission. But California Gov. Gavin Newsom has said that he would push for a multi-step plan that would allow the lines of the House districts to be drawn by the state legislature \u2014 and in the middle of the decade.",
      "Under the proposal, the governor would call a special election for early November to have voters approve the new congressional map.",
      "Newsom suggested Monday that there were drafts of new maps in progress and said his team helped initiate conversations with Democratic leadership. The re-crafted map could increase the seats Democrats hold by five, according to the Associated Press.",
      "\"The maps, we believe should be transparent, they should be provided in a transparent way to the public, and as a consequence, those maps are being processed and will be brought to light,\" he said.",
      "He added, \"The ultimate determination will be by the people of the state of California. We will offer them the opportunity to make judgment for themselves \u2014 again, only if Texas moves forward. We would maintain the framework of the independent redistricting commission that I support, that I believe in. We would just allow for this mid-census redistricting to occur just for congressional maps in 26, 28 and 30.\"",
      "California has 52 congressional districts, and Democrats hold 43 of those seats.",
      "Indiana",
      "In Indiana, Republicans control seven of nine congressional seats. The state last redistricted in 2021, and some in the GOP orbit have floated another redistricting effort ahead of the midterms.",
      "Vice President JD Vance met with local legislators, including Gov. Mike Braun, at the Indiana Statehouse on Thursday, Aug. 7, where redistricting was among the topics discussed, according to administration officials.",
      "Several White House officials were also in attendance at the meeting, including Deputy Chief of Staff James Blair, Office of Intergovernmental Affairs Director Alex Meyer and White House counsel Dave Warrington.",
      "A White House official told CBS News they believe the meeting \"moved the needle\" on getting the Indiana Republican legislators on board with a redistricting effort in the Hoosier State and could potentially result in a GOP takeover of all nine congressional seats.",
      "Democratic Rep. Frank Mrvan's seat in the northwest corner of the state, bordering parts of Chicago's suburbs, could be a target as Republicans consider an effort to redraw the state's congressional maps. The Indiana Legislature, overwhelmingly controlled by Republicans, is tasked with drawing its congressional districts.",
      "New York",
      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie have suggested that the Democratic-controlled legislature could create new congressional maps that are more friendly to Democrats.",
      "\"We're sick and tired of being pushed around when other states don't have the same aspirations that we always have had, and I hold those dear, but I cannot ignore that,\" Hochul said at a press conference with some Texas Democratic lawmakers earlier this week. \"This the playing field has changed dramatically, and shame on us if we ignore that fact and cling tight to the vestiges of the past. That era is over. Donald Trump eliminated that. Forever.\"",
      "But New York faces some steep obstacles in trying to redraw the maps before the midterms. New York's constitution calls for a bipartisan commission to draw up the congressional maps, although the state Assembly and Senate get final approval. In the 2021 redistricting, New York's highest court, the Court of Appeals, said Democrats had \"unconstitutionally gerrymandered districts\" and ordered a special master to redraw the district.",
      "With the help of these maps, Republicans were able to flip four seats in New York in the 2022 elections, making the congressional delegation 15 Democrats and 11 Republicans. Democrats sued, and in a 4-3 decision, the Court of Appeals said those maps were supposed to be temporary and ordered an independent commission to redraw the maps. The new districts gave Democrats a slight edge. With these maps, Democrats flipped four seats in 2024, giving them 19 seats in the state and Republicans seven.",
      "If Democrats wanted to lead an effort to change New York's constitution, it would require an affirmative vote in two consecutive sessions of the Legislature, and then it would have to be approved by voters, as Hochul herself noted on Monday. The 2025 legislative session is already over, with the next session starting in January 2026.",
      "\"This could be really more on the ballot in the fall of '27 and be enacted in time for the congressional races in 2028 as well as the presidential \u2014 so, it is not the timeline that I would have preferred, but it does shave off four years from another through the process,\" Hochul said Monday. \"But we're going to also look at litigation strategies. We're in close conversations about options there, and so I would say we're presenting all options right now.\"",
      "The state constitution also prohibits mid-decade redistricting, and any new proposal to amend it to allow a redrawing of state lines before the next census would have to clear the current state legislature and the one elected in 2026.",
      "\"The earliest that could go into effect would be after the 2027 elections, preventing the state from re-redistricting until the 2028 election cycle,\" said Jeffrey Wice, a redistricting expert and professor at New York Law School.",
      "Following Hochul's suggestion that the state's redistricting commission be disbanded, Wice said it's not a surprise that some are calling for it to be scrapped after the panel failed to complete its work in 2022 \u2014 until a court stepped in.",
      "\"A state legislature can draw a responsibly developed map if it follows objective and prioritized criteria and works in an open and transparent manner, inviting public participation and review,\" he said.",
      "Missouri",
      "Republicans have a trifecta in Missouri, and the Legislature is tasked with drawing its congressional districts. State lawmakers approved a congressional redistricting plan in 2022, after which Republicans won six of Missouri's eight congressional seats.",
      "But some state lawmakers want to extend the GOP's hold on the congressional map to 7-1. State party leaders may target the 5th Congressional District, currently represented by Democratic Rep. Emmanuel Cleaver of Kansas City. Although Cleaver won by over 23 points in 2024, Republicans in neighboring districts each won by more than 40 points.",
      "The only time Missouri has engaged in mid-decade redistricting was in the 1960s, when the Supreme Court ruled each district had to be nearly equal in population, and a new Senatorial Appointment Commission was established to redraw the Congressional districts for the 1966 election.",
      "State Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O'Laughlin told Columbia's KSSZ 93.9 last week that it is \"likely\" the Legislature would be called in for a special session by Gov. Mike Kehoe, a Republican. He told St. Louis' Fox affiliate over the weekend that he supported the idea, saying \"is Missouri represented properly in Washington, D.C., and, quite frankly, what can we do to support President Trump's agenda?\"",
      "Lt. Gov. David Wasinger also indicated support for redrawing the congressional map, noting in a statement that Missouri is a \"solidly conservative state.\"",
      "\"Despite this, our current congressional map still sends two progressive Democrats to push a liberal agenda in D.C., misrepresenting the will of Missouri voters,\" he said in a statement. \"We missed the chance to secure a 7-1 map in 2022, a mistake President Trump rightly calls on us to fix. Missouri's next congressional map must protect Missouri values and ensure our representatives in Congress are as conservative as the voters who send them.\"",
      "The Missouri Freedom Caucus, a coalition of conservative state lawmakers, has also been urging Kehoe, a Republican, to convene a special session of the state General Assembly to redraw its congressional map \"consistent with President Trump's recommendation.\"",
      "\"The most current congressional map that was passed was a weak compromise \u2014 inconsistent with the political will of Missouri voters,\" the Missouri Freedom Caucus said in a statement last week. \"It's time this super-majority Republican party in Missouri grows a spine and actually delivers the congressional map that reflects the strong conservative values of this great state, as the political makeup of this state clearly demands.\"",
      "Florida",
      "In Florida, the congressional maps are created by the Legislature and approved by the governor.",
      "Florida Republicans have 20 seats in the U.S. House, with Democrats holding just eight. Although Democrats had challenged the current maps in court, the Florida Supreme Court in July upheld the elimination of a majority Black district.",
      "Despite that victory, Gov. Ron DeSantis said in July that he was \"seriously\" looking at asking the GOP-controlled Legislature to redraw the maps.",
      "DeSantis has also criticizedlong insisted that he felt the 2020 Census was flawed and Florida should have gained two Congressional seats, rather than one.",
      "\"I do think we are going to be looking at the pathways to be able do the redistricting here in Florida,\" DeSantis said on July 30.",
      "On Thursday, Florida House Speaker Daniel Perez sent a memo to lawmakers announcing he was creating a select committee on redistricting.",
      "\"Please be advised that we will not be appointing to the select committee anyone who has expressed an interest in running for Congress,\" the memo to lawmakers said. \"In addition, while as elected Members of the House you are free to express your own opinions, statements about redistricting that suggest an intent to favor or disfavor an incumbent or political party, which is currently prohibited by the Florida Constitution, will also disqualify you from consideration.\"",
      "Republicans have a trifecta in Florida state government, controlling the governor's mansion and both chambers of the Legislature. It would be difficult for Florida Democrats to break quorum because a simple majority is only needed for a quorum in Tallahassee, and Democrats are a superminority.",

    "summary": "The U.S. officially began levying higher tariffs on dozens of countries, just as the economic fallout of President Trump's months-long tariffs threats was beginning to create visible damage to the U.S. economy.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump officially began levying higher import taxes on dozens of countries Thursday, just as the economic fallout of his months-long tariffs threats was beginning to create visible damage to the U.S. economy.",
      "The White House said that starting just after midnight EDT, goods from more than 60 countries and the European Union began facing tariff rates of 10% or higher. Products from the European Union, Japan and South Korea are being taxed at 15%, while imports from Taiwan, Vietnam and Bangladesh are being taxed at 20%. Mr. Trump also expects places such as the EU, Japan and South Korea to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S.",
      "He immediately took to his Truth Social platform to hail the levies, saying, \"IT'S MIDNIGHT!!! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TARIFFS ARE NOW FLOWING INTO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!\"",
      "About an hour before that, he posted, \"RECIPROCAL TARIFFS TAKE EFFECT AT MIDNIGHT TONIGHT! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, LARGELY FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES FOR MANY YEARS, LAUGHING ALL THE WAY, WILL START FLOWING INTO THE USA. THE ONLY THING THAT CAN STOP AMERICA'S GREATNESS WOULD BE A RADICAL LEFT COURT THAT WANTS TO SEE OUR COUNTRY FAIL!\"",
      "On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Trump said, \"I think the growth is going to be unprecedented,\" adding that the U.S. was \"taking in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs.\" But he said he couldn't provide a specific figure for revenues because \"we don't even know what the final number is\" regarding tariff rates. \n\r\nDespite the uncertainty, the Trump White House is confident that the onset of his broad tariffs will provide clarity about the path of the world's largest economy. Now that companies understand the direction the U.S. is headed, the administration believes it can ramp up new investments and jump-start hiring in ways that can rebalance the U.S. economy as a manufacturing power.  \n\r\nBut so far, there are signs of self-inflicted wounds to America as companies and consumers alike brace for the impact of new taxes. What the data has shown is a U.S. economy that changed in April with the president's initial rollout of tariffs, an event that led to market drama, a negotiating period and Mr. Trump's ultimate decision to start his universal tariffs on Thursday.",
      "After April, economic reports showed that hiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline, said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy. \n\r\n\"A less productive economy requires fewer workers,\" Silvia said in an analysis note. \"But there is more, the higher tariff prices lower workers' real wages. The economy has become less productive, and firms cannot pay the same real wages as before. Actions have consequences.\" \n\r\nEven then, the ultimate transformations of the tariffs are unknown and could play out over months, if not years. Many economists say the risk is that the American economy is steadily eroded rather than collapsing instantly. \n\r\n\"We all want it to be made for television where it's this explosion - it's not like that,\" said Brad Jensen, a professor at Georgetown University. \"It's going to be fine sand in the gears and slow things down.\" \n\r\nMr. Trump has promoted the tariffs as a way to reduce the persistent trade deficit. But importers sought to avoid the taxes by importing more goods before the taxes went into effect. As a result, the $582.7 billion trade imbalance for the first half of the year was 38% higher than in 2024. Total construction spending has dropped 2.9% over the past year, and the factory jobs promised by Mr. Trump have so far actually been job losses. \n\r\nThe lead-up to Thursday fit the slapdash nature of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which have been variously rolled out, walked back, delayed, increased, imposed by letter and frantically renegotiated. \n\r\nThe process has been so muddled that officials for key trade partners were unclear at the start of the week whether the tariffs would begin Thursday or Friday. The language of the July 31 order to delay the start of tariffs from Aug. 1 said the higher tax rates would start in seven days. \n\r\nOn Wednesday morning, Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, was asked if the new tariffs began at midnight Thursday, and he said reporters should check with the U.S. Trade Representative's Office. \n\r\nMr. Trump announced additional 25% tariffs to be imposed on India\u00a0Wednesday because it buys Russian oil, bringing India's total import taxes to 50%. India's Foreign Ministry called the new duties \"unfair, unjustified and unreasonable.\"",
      "Swiss officials planned an \"extraordinary\" meeting Thursday after a delegation returned from Washington following an attempt to head off a 39% tariff on Swiss products, the government said in an X post. Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter left Washington empty-handed Wednesday, a source told the Reuters news service, which cited the source as saying her proposal for a 10% tariff rate was rejected.",
      "Mr. Trump has said import taxes are still coming on pharmaceutical drugs and announced 100% tariffs on computer chips, meaning the U.S. economy could remain in a place of suspended animation as it awaits the impacts. \n\r\nThe president's use of a 1977 law to declare an economic emergency to impose the tariffs is also being challenged. The impending ruling from last week's hearing before a U.S. appeals court could cause Mr. Trump to find other legal justifications if judges say he exceeded his authority. \n\r\nEven people who worked with Mr. Trump during his first term are skeptical that things will go smoothly for the economy, such as Paul Ryan, the former Republican House speaker, who has emerged as a Trump critic. \n\r\n\"There's no sort of rationale for this other than the president wanting to raise tariffs based upon his whims, his opinions,\" Ryan told CNBC on Wednesday. \"I think choppy waters are ahead because I think they're going to have some legal challenges.\" \n\r\nStill, the stock market has been solid during the recent tariff drama, with the S&P 500 index climbing more than 25% from its April low. The market's rebound and the income tax cuts in Mr. Trump's tax and spending measures signed into law on July 4 have given the White House confidence that economic growth is bound to accelerate in the coming months. \n\r\nAs of now, the president says he still foresees an economic boom while the rest of the world and American voters wait nervously. \n\r\n\"There's one person who can afford to be cavalier about the uncertainty that he's creating, and that's Donald Trump,\" said Rachel West, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation who worked in the Biden White House on labor policy. \"The rest of Americans are already paying the price for that uncertainty.\"",

    "story": [
      "The spotlight may have moved off the Department of Government Efficiency since the departure of Elon Musk, but the Trump administration's DOGE continues to post about cost cutting on its so-called \"wall of receipts.\" And once again, some of its claims about savings appear to be significantly overstated, according to a CBS News review.",
      "The review of three of the largest cuts claimed so far indicates the savings from those contracts are less than 3% of what DOGE said they were.",
      "On July 27, DOGE added 705 canceled contracts to the website it uses to track and declare savings from the agency's cost cutting across the federal government, among them three of the largest claimed cuts posted since President Trump launched DOGE in January.",
      "The three contracts \u2014 all from the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 funded COVID-19 testing and treatment for people who were uninsured or underinsured during the pandemic. DOGE claims canceling those contracts saved $6.4 billion.",
      "But CBS News' review of transaction records indicates the actual savings is just a small fraction of that \u2014 around $165 million.",
      "That's about how much in obligated funds were left unspent in the three contracts by the time Mr. Trump took office and DOGE was launched. There was nearly $7 billion that remained, but this figure represented a ceiling that federal contracting experts say is rarely reached.",
      "DOGE adjusted down that total potential value by a combined $6.4 billion \u2014 and then reported it as savings. But with the pandemic long over and the contracts set to expire on May 31 of this year, it is highly unlikely the contractors, which included Walgreens and CVS, would have spent anywhere near that sum on COVID-19 testing and treatment.",
      "The spending \"was never going to reach this number,\" said Nat Malkus, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, referring to the total potential value. \"You didn't have to terminate this contract, you are the government \u2014 just don't obligate any more money.\"",
      "Since it was launched, multiple news outlets including CBS News have reported that DOGE's \"Wall of Receipts\" has at times vastly overstated the amount of funds cut and discovered numerous errors in the group's accounting.",
      "DOGE now claims it has saved $52.2 billion \u2013 just from contracts canceled. Malkus, who analyzed the actual implications of the cancellations rather than the ceiling values, puts the number closer to $17.8 billion. But that would only be if Congress agreed to rescind the funds that it had already voted to spend.",
      "The DOGE website reports a grand total of $199 \u202fbillion saved, when factoring in real estate lease cancellations and other cuts such as personnel reductions. However, it provides no documentation for roughly half of that amount. According to DOGE, the savings equate to $1,236.02 per person in the U.S.",
      "\"The amount they have per person is fiction,\" Malkus said. \"It's transparency theater.\"",
      "HHS did not respond to a CBS News request for comment about the three contracts. The White House redirected the request to the General Services Administration, which declined to comment.",
      "A substantial portion of those purported savings is a result of cuts to USAID. A recent study in the medical journal The Lancet says those cuts could come with a human toll. By the study's estimates, the loss in humanitarian aid could lead to 14 million deaths in children younger than 5 years of age by 2030.",
      "Malkus told CBS News, \"Their claims are generally to say, 'Hey this is a lot of pain, but it's worth it.'\"",
      "The update is only the second since Musk, who launched DOGE, departed from his role in the White House advising Mr. Trump.",
      "Shortly before Musk's term as a special government employee expired, he told reporters, \"This is not the end of DOGE, but really the beginning.\"",
      "\"The DOGE team will only grow stronger over time. The DOGE influence will only grow stronger,\" he said from the Oval Office on May 30, adding that he was confident over time DOGE would cull $1 trillion in savings.",
      "It's unclear exactly how DOGE has functioned since then. In late June, The Washington Post reported that federal officials were instructed to stop routing the grant-making process through DOGE, revoking control of the online clearinghouse for all grant opportunities from the group. In DOGE's latest update, only one additional canceled grant was added.",
      "Several DOGE-associated government employees have left in recent weeks, including the Department of the Interior's Tyler Hassen, whose last day was Friday, The New York Times reported. Hassen was originally hired as a DOGE staffer, and then was later tasked with trimming costs at the Interior Department, where he was named principal deputy assistant secretary of the interior.",
      "Interior Secretary Doug Burgum had allowed him broad authority to make cuts to budgets and staffing, and under his watch, a DOGE-associated employee made the claim that a single survey costing $1 billion dollars\u00a0had been cut. That claim was repeated by Elon Musk and Burgum, but no evidence was ever supplied to back it up.",

      "The Perseids peak in 2025 is Aug. 12-13, specifically early next Wednesday for those in North America. At that time, the moon will be 84% full, according to the American Meteor Society.",
      "\"In 2025, the waning gibbous moon will severely compromise this shower at the time of maximum activity,\" the organization says. \"Such conditions will reduce activity by at least 75 percent as only the brighter meteors will be visible.\"",
      "Viewers this year can expect to see between 10-20 Perseids each hour, as opposed to 50 Perseids per hour under darker conditions, it says.",
      "\"The strength of each Perseid display varies year to year, mainly due to lunar conditions,\"\u00a0writes Robert Lunsford with the American Meteor Society. \"If a bright moon is above the horizon during the night of maximum activity, then the display will be reduced. Most of the Perseid meteors are faint and bright moonlight will make it difficult to view.\"",
      "The Perseids meteor shower has been ongoing for several weeks. It started in mid-July and will continue until Aug. 23.",
      "A planetarium program coordinator at a museum in St. Paul, Minnesota, is advising people to instead go out a week or so past the peak when the moon isn't so bright.",

      "When looking at the Perseids, they appear to come from the constellation Perseus, which is why this meteor shower has its name.

It could even be as small as 1,000 feet, scientists say, according to a\u00a0new paper\u00a0published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters.",
      "The comet is hurtling our way at 130,000 mph, but will veer closer to Mars than Earth, keeping a safe distance from both. It was 277 million miles away when photographed by Hubble a couple weeks ago. The orbiting telescope revealed a teardrop-shaped plume of dust around the nucleus as well as traces of a dusty tail.",
      "NASA previously said the comet will make its closest approach to the sun in late October, scooting between the orbits of Mars and Earth. The agency said 3I/ATLAS should remain visible to telescopes through September, but then it will pass too close to the sun to observe. It is expected to reappear on the other side of the sun by early December, allowing for renewed observations.",

    "story": [
      "Two months into the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have updated their forecast, predicting slightly fewer named storms. The new outlook released Thursday says there is a 50% chance of above-normal activity, a decrease from 60% in the agency's May forecast.",
      "NOAA, the federal agency in charge of weather and climate predictions, now expects 13 to 18 named storms, five to nine of which could become hurricanes, including two to five major hurricanes. The previous ranges were 13 to 19 named storms, six to 10 hurricanes and three to five major hurricanes.",
      "The adjusted predictions include the four named tropical storms so far this season.",
      "The Atlantic hurricane season officially runs from June 1 until Nov. 30, with peak activity typically occurring between mid-August and mid-October.",
      "An average season produces 14 named storms, including seven that develop into hurricanes. Three of those, on average, become major hurricanes, meaning a Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale, with sustained wind speeds of at least 111 miles per hour. Category 5, the top of the scale, brings wind speeds of at least 157 mph.",
      "Every Atlantic hurricane season since 2015 has produced more storms than the \"average\" \u2014 a standard based on annual hurricane activity recorded over the period from 1990 to 2020 \u2014 although four seasons since then have produced two or three major hurricanes, either below or on par with the 30-year norm.",
      "According to forecasters, a combination of factors influence the number of storms that materialize over the course of the season. A significant one in 2025 is the neutral phase of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, cycle, which often plays a substantial role in the intensity of tropical activity in the Atlantic.",
      "Warmer than average ocean temperatures and weak wind shear in the forecast may also lead to a more active season, the NOAA outlook says, as could the potential for higher storm activity from the West African Monsoon, the weather system from which most Atlantic hurricanes originate.",
      "Some seasons are more active than others, and hurricanes at times can occur outside of the designated six-month window. Science has shown in recent years that climate change is contributing to the intensity of these storms, which are fueled by warmer waters. Researchers are continuing to explore connections between rising temperatures and more destructive tropical weather.",
      "Because each year is different, NOAA's hurricane forecast provides a framework for communities in storm-prone areas to\u00a0prepare.",
      "\"NOAA stands ready to provide the forecasts and warnings that are vital for safeguarding lives, property, and communities,\" acting NOAA Administrator Laura Grimm said in a statement Thursday. \"As we enter the second half of the season, this updated hurricane outlook serves as a call to action to prepare now, in advance, rather than delay until a warning is issued.\"",
      "Last year, NOAA predicted\u00a0an above-average number of storms, with between 8 and 13 hurricanes. The 2024 season ended up producing 11 hurricanes, five of which strengthened into major hurricanes. Five hurricanes made landfall in the continental U.S., including two \u2014 Helene and Milton \u2014 that hit as major hurricanes.",

      "Researchers from Colorado State University's Tropical Cyclones, Radar, Atmospheric Modeling and Software team also predicted an above-average hurricane season for 2025, likely producing stronger and more frequent storms than a typical year but fewer than last season.",
      "They also recently updated their predictions, now estimating that eight hurricanes will occur over the course of the 2025 season with 16 named storms overall.",
      "Their predictions have tended to more or less align with those released by NOAA. Levi Silvers, who leads the research team at Colorado State, told CBS News in April that their predictions are \"fundamentally dependent on the observations that NOAA collects all around the globe,\" especially in the oceans, so they generally reach similar conclusions.",

      "Scientists say they have at last solved the mystery of what killed more than 5 billion sea stars \u2014 often known as starfish \u2014 off the Pacific coast of North America in a decade-long epidemic.",
      "Starting in 2013, a mysterious sea star wasting disease sparked a mass die-off from Mexico to Alaska. The epidemic has devastated more than 20 species and continues today. Worst hit was a species called the sunflower sea star, which lost around 90% of its population in the outbreak's first five years.",
      "\"It's really quite gruesome,\" said marine disease ecologist Alyssa Gehman at the Hakai Institute in British Columbia, Canada, who helped pinpoint the cause.",
      "Healthy sea stars have \"puffy arms sticking straight out,\" she said. But the wasting disease causes them to grow lesions and \"then their arms actually fall off.\"",
      "The culprit? Bacteria that has also infected shellfish, according to a study published Monday in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution.",
      "The findings \"solve a long-standing question about a very serious disease in the ocean,\" said Rebecca Vega Thurber, a marine microbiologist at University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved in the study.",
      "Sea stars typically have five arms and some species sport up to 24 arms. They range in color from solid orange to tapestries of orange, purple, brown and green.",
      "\"Symptoms of sea star wasting syndrome include abnormally twisted arms, white lesions, deflation of arms and body, arm loss, and body disintegration,\" the National Park Service says. \"They die over the course of days or weeks.\"",
      "It took more than a decade for researchers to identify the cause of the disease, with many false leads and twists and turns along the way.",
      "Early research hinted the cause might be a virus, but it turned out the densovirus that scientists initially focused on was actually a normal resident inside healthy sea stars and not associated with disease, said Melanie Prentice of the Hakai Institute, co-author of the new study.",
      "Other efforts missed the real killer because researchers studied tissue samples of dead sea stars that no longer contained the bodily fluid that surrounds the organs.",
      "But the latest study includes detailed analysis of this fluid, called coelomic fluid, where the bacteria Vibrio pectenicida were found.",
      "\"It's incredibly difficult to trace the source of so many environmental diseases, especially underwater,\" said microbiologist Blake Ushijima of the University of North Carolina, Wilmington, who was not involved in the research. He said the detective work by this team was \"really smart and significant.\"",
      "Now that scientists know the cause, they have a better shot at intervening to help sea stars. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the sunflower sea star as critically endangered.",
      "Prentice said that scientists could potentially now test which of the remaining sea stars are still healthy \u2014 and consider whether to relocate them, or breed them in captivity to later transplant them to areas that have lost almost all their sunflower sea stars.",
      "The study notes that Vibrio bacteria have been called \"the microbial barometer of climate change\" because the species are more prevalent in warming water temperatures. The authors say an important next phase of research will be to work on better understanding the relationship between rising seawater temperatures and sea star wasting disease.",
      "Scientists may also test if some populations have natural immunity, and if treatments like probiotics may help boost immunity to the disease.",
      "Such recovery work is not only important for sea stars, but for entire Pacific ecosystems because healthy starfish gobble up excess sea urchins, researchers say.",
      "Sunflower sea stars \"look sort of innocent when you see them, but they eat almost everything that lives on the bottom of the ocean,\" said Gehman. \"They're voracious eaters.\"",
      "With many fewer sea stars, the sea urchins that they usually munch on exploded in population \u2014 and in turn gobbled up around 95% of the kelp forest s in Northern California within a decade. These kelp forests provide food and habitat for a wide variety of animals including fish, sea otters and seals.",
      "Researchers hope the new findings will allow them to restore sea star populations \u2014 and regrow the kelp forests that Thurber compares to \"the rainforests of the ocean.\""

      "\"Lovell had imagination, there was a part of Lovell that was about imagination, and that was a neat part of him,\" Chaikin said.",
      "Apollo 8 circled the moon 10 times and sent back the famous \"Earthrise\" photo of our world from space. Lovell reflected on that journey 50 years later in an interview with CBS News.",
      "\"Sometimes I look back and say, you know, 'How did we ever do that?\" he said.",
      "In 1970, Lovell had a chance to go back to the moon with Apollo 13, with crewmates Fred Haise and Jack Swigert, but the mission abruptly changed with the explosion.",
      "\"Houston, we've had a problem here,\" Swigert reported to mission control.\u00a0Moments later, Lovell repeated, \"Houston, we've had a problem.\"",
      "The mishap forced Lovell, his crewmates and NASA's team on the ground to turn all their efforts toward returning to Earth safely.",
      "\"His calm strength under pressure helped return the crew safely to Earth and demonstrated the quick thinking and innovation that informed future NASA missions,\" Duffy said of Lovell.",
      "Lovell graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1952 and went on to become a naval aviator, including a four-year tour at the Naval Air Test Center in Maryland. Chaikin said Lovell demonstrated his skills as a test pilot during Apollo 13.",
      "\"He always said that the true measure of a test pilot is not whether you can do the mission you're assigned, but when things don't go right, how you respond,\" Chaikin said.",
      "Chaikin described Lovell as being calm and unflappable throughout the crisis, but he recalled one moment when Lovell started to seem irritable.",
      "\"He's been without sleep, and he's worried about his crew and says, like, 'You're going to have to figure out this checklist because we've got to get some sleep,'\" Chaikin said. \"That's like the only time in the whole mission when he even starts to show anything but calm, unflappable Lovell.\"",
      "Actor Tom Hanks played Lovell in the 1995 movie \"Apollo 13,\" which was nominated for best picture at the Oscars.",
      "In an Instagram post Friday evening, Hanks wrote that Lovell's \"many voyages around Earth and on to so-very-close to the moon were not made for riches or celebrity, but because such challenges as those are what fuels the course of being alive \u2014 and who better than Jim Lovell to make those voyages. On this night of a full Moon, he passes on \u2014 to the heavens, to the cosmos, to the stars. God speed you, on this next voyage, Jim Lovell.\"",
      "Before the movie was released, Chaikin said Lovell told him that the true story of Apollo 13 had never been told.",
      "\"That's how he felt,\" Chaikin said. \"Of course, everything changed when Ron Howard made that movie, to the point that Jim became probably the best known Apollo astronaut next to Neil Armstrong. But before that movie happened, he really felt that way.\"",
      "NASA shared a statement from Lovell's family: \"We are enormously proud of his amazing life and career accomplishments, highlighted by his legendary leadership in pioneering human space flight. But, to all of us, he was Dad, Granddad, and the Leader of our family. Most importantly, he was our Hero. We will miss his unshakeable optimism, his sense of humor, and the way he made each of us feel we could do the impossible. He was truly one of a kind.\"",

      "\"We've been very pensive over the last days of understanding what we have all got to be a part of. We know that there are some tumultuous times on Earth ... and we want this mission, our mission, to be a reminder of what people can do when we work together, when we explore together.\"",
      "Station commander Onishi then handed a symbolic key to the lab complex \u2014 along with command of the ISS \u2014 to cosmonaut Sergey Ryzhikov.",

But in space we can cooperate effectively. So thank you everybody.\"",
      "Crew 10's departure comes six days after the arrival of their replacements, Crew 11 commander Zena Cardman, pilot Mike Fincke, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and cosmonaut Oleg Platonov. They were launched Aug. 1 aboard the Crew Dragon Endeavour.",
      "Since then, the outgoing crew, along with Ryzhikov, cosmonaut Alexey  Zubritsky and NASA crewmate Jonny Kim, has been briefing the replacements on the intricacies of station operations, getting them up to  speed as quickly as possible.",
      "As it turned out, Crew 10 enjoyed a bit of additional time for a \"handover\" thanks to high winds in the splashdown zone that ruled out a planned Wednesday undocking.",
      "The undocking Friday set up a 17.5-hour trip back to Earth. The Crew Dragon's forward-facing Draco thrusters will fire for nearly 10 minutes at 10:39 a.m. EDT Saturday, slowing the capsule enough to drop the far side of the ship's orbit into the atmosphere.",
      "Following a southwest-to-northeast trajectory, Endurance is expected to splash down off Southern California at 11:33 a.m., closing out a 147-day, 16-hour, 29-minute mission spanning 2,368 orbits and 62.8 million miles since it launched on March 14.",

      "The Hubble Space Telescope has captured the best picture yet of a high-speed comet visiting our solar system from another star.",
      "NASA and the European Space Agency released the latest photos Thursday.",
      "Discovered last month by a telescope in Chile, the comet known as 3I-Atlas is only the third known interstellar object to pass our way and poses no threat to Earth.",
      "Astronomers originally estimated the size of its icy core at several miles across, but Hubble's observations have narrowed it down to no more than 3.5 miles. It could even be as small as 1,000 feet, scientists say, according to a\u00a0new paper\u00a0published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters.",
      "The comet is hurtling our way at 130,000 mph, but will veer closer to Mars than Earth, keeping a safe distance from both. It was 277 million miles away when photographed by Hubble a couple weeks ago. The orbiting telescope revealed a teardrop-shaped plume of dust around the nucleus as well as traces of a dusty tail.",
      "NASA previously said the comet will make its closest approach to the sun in late October, scooting between the orbits of Mars and Earth. The agency said 3I/ATLAS should remain visible to telescopes through September, but then it will pass too close to the sun to observe. It is expected to reappear on the other side of the sun by early December, allowing for renewed observations.",
      "According to Las Cumbres Observatory in Chile, the object is named \"3I\" because it is the third such interstellar object to be found, following\u00a01I/'Oumuamu\u00a0in 2017 and\u00a02I/Borisov\u00a0in 2019.",
      "\"All three appear to be quite dark and red, reflecting only about 5% of the sunlight that hits them, which is similar in reflectivity to asphalt,\" the observatory said last month. \"Unlike 1I/'Oumuamu, 3I does not change much in brightness as it rotates, indicating that it is more likely to be spherical.\"",
      "Los Cumbres Observatory created an animation of image data from its telescope as it tracked the new interstellar on July 4, 2025:",
      "As scientists watch the object, some are raising questions. Harvard professor Avi Loeb, who is the director of the institute for theory and computation at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, says it could actually be alien technology. He said many of its characteristics are not typical, and that its trajectory is \"fine-tuned.\"",
      "\"The object looks strange. It reflects a lot of sunlight,\" he told \"CBS Mornings Plus.\" \"Moreover, this object has some glow in front of it, not behind it. There is no tail, as usually is the case for comets.\"",
      "He advises the best way to proceed is to collect as much scientific data as possible.",
      "\"Not assuming anything, just monitoring it and deciding whether it maneuvers, whether it has some artificial lights, whether it looks like a technological object, and if it ends up being a comet, so be it,\" he said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/instagram-map-disable/",
    "published": "Fri, 08 Aug 2025 18:03:06 -0400",
    "summary": "Instagram rolled out a new Map feature that lets users see their friends' locations in real time. Here's why privacy experts are concerned.",
    "story": [
      "A new feature on Instagram that let's users share their real-time physical location with others on the app has privacy experts concerned over the amount of data exposed and potential safety risks to users.",
      "Called Instagram Map, the new feature was introduced on Thursday as part of an app update. On its blog, the company says the location-sharing tool makes it \"easier for you and your friends to stay in touch through the content you're enjoying on Instagram.\"",
      "\"You can opt into sharing your last active location with friends you pick, and you can turn it off anytime,\" Instagram said in a blog post announcing the new feature. \"You can also open the map to see content your friends and favorite creators are posting from cool spots. No matter how you use the map, you and your friends have a new, lightweight way to connect with each other.\"",
      "\"Off by default\"",
      "In a statement shared with CBS MoneyWatch Friday, Instagram's parent company, Meta, emphasized that Instagram Maps is not automatically active upon updating the app and that users must opt-in to the location-sharing feature in order to make their whereabouts visible to others.",
      "\"Instagram Map is off by default, and your live location is never shared unless you choose to turn it on. If you do, only people you follow back \u2014 or a private, custom list you select \u2014 can see your location,\" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Users can also choose not to share their locations when they are in particular places, or with particular people.",
      "Still, privacy experts say that social media users aren't always aware of how much information they're sharing with an app or its users, even if they have the ability to limit who sees what.",
      "\"The more these location features are rolled out on social media it carries out the assumption that as long as you give users the ability to toggle them on and off that they'll know exactly how to do that,\" Douglas Zytko, an app safety expert and associate professor at the College of Innovation & Technology at the University of Michigan-Flint, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"But the average user isn't always aware of their privacy settings and if they match their preferences.\"",
      "When the Instagram Map feature is turned on, any content a user posts with a location tagged, including a reel, post or story, will show up on the app's map for 24 hours, according to the Instagram blog. While the feature remains on, the user's location is updated whenever they open the app or return to it. The feature can be turned off at any time.",
      "In an Instagram post discussing the feature, Instagram's head, Adam Mosseri, explains how he himself uses the map. \"Personally, I use the map to share what I'm up to with a handful of my closest friends, and I curate that list carefully,\" he said.",
      "User confusion over whether the feature is on or off",
      "On Threads, Meta's microblogging site, a number of Instagram account holders claimed that their locations were being pinned on friends' maps by default.",
      "Mosseri weighed in, saying the concerns prompted the company to re-examine how the feature works.",
      "\"We're double-checking everything, but so far it looks mostly like people are confused and assume that, because they can see themselves on the map when they open, other people can see them too,\" he said. \"We're still checking everything though to make sure nobody shares location without explicitly deciding to do so, which, by the way, requires a double consent by design (we ask you to confirm after you say you want to share).\"",
      "How to turn on Instagram Maps",
      "In the top right corner of the app, tap on the messaging function. There you will see a circular world map icon labeled \"map. If you click on the icon, you will see you're on location pinned on a map. Friends who are sharing their locations will also appear. Click on the gear icon to choose to share your location with no one, or a custom list of friends, or all of your friends \u2014 who are followers that you also follow back on the app.",
      "Social pressures, privacy and safety risks",
      "Zytko, however, said it can be complicated for social media users to manage privacy settings that let them share different kinds of content with different groups of people. \"This issue is called 'context collapse,'\" he said. \"Your co-workers see your social media posts, and your friends and family, and there is certain content you only want some groups to see but not others, and it can be hard to manage the visibility of content.\"",
      "Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which makes entertainment and technology recommendations for families, said location-sharing features can be particularly risky for younger app users.",
      "\"These features might feel fun and social, but they create unnecessary risks that teens and many adults don't necessarily understand,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "While parents who supervise their teens through controls built into the app can control their kids' location-sharing settings, he still has concerns about the kinds of social pressures such features expose teens, too.",
      "Torney said research at Common Sense Media shows that location-sharing also creates \"social pressures around where teens go and who they spend time with, and kids feel obligated to share location to show they are someplace cool.\"",
      "Furthermore, when teens share their locations, \"they are potentially telling strangers where they are in real time,\" Torney told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you're not selective about who you're sharing your location with, it creates opportunities for harassment, stalking or worse.\"",

      "\"If someone expresses thoughts of suicide or self-harm, ChatGPT is trained to encourage them to reach out to mental health professionals or trusted loved ones, and provide links to crisis hotlines and support resources,\" an OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News. \"Some conversations with ChatGPT may start out benign or exploratory but can shift into more sensitive territory,\" the spokesperson said. \"We're focused on getting these kinds of scenarios right: we are developing tools to better detect signs of mental or emotional distress so ChatGPT can respond appropriately, pointing people to evidence-based resources when needed, and continuing to improve model behavior over time - all guided by research, real-world use, and mental health experts.\"",
      "ChatGPT does not verify ages or require parental consent, although the company says it is not meant for children under 13. To sign up, users need to enter a birth date showing an age of at least 13, or they can use a limited guest account without entering an age at all.",
      "\"If you have access to a child's account, you can see their chat history. But as of now, there's really no way for parents to be flagged if, say, your child's question or their prompt into ChatGPT is a concerning one,\" CBS News senior business and tech correspondent Jo Ling Kent reported on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Ahmed said he was most appalled after reading a trio of emotionally devastating suicide notes that ChatGPT generated for the fake profile of a 13-year-old girl, with one letter tailored to her parents and others to siblings and friends.",
      "\"I started crying,\" he said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "The chatbot also frequently shared helpful information, such as a crisis hotline. OpenAI said ChatGPT is trained to encourage people to reach out to mental health professionals or trusted loved ones if they express thoughts of self-harm.",
      "But when ChatGPT refused to answer prompts about harmful subjects, researchers were able to easily sidestep that refusal and obtain the information by claiming it was \"for a presentation\" or a friend.",
      "\"Emotional overreliance\" on technology",
      "The stakes are high, even if only a small subset of ChatGPT users engage with the chatbot in this way. More people \u2014 adults as well as children \u2014 are turning to artificial intelligence chatbots for information, ideas and companionship. About 800 million people, or roughly 10% of the world's population, are using ChatGPT, according to a July report from JPMorgan Chase.",
      "In the U.S., more than 70% of teens are turning to\u00a0AI chatbots for companionship\u00a0and half use AI companions regularly, according to\u00a0a recent study\u00a0from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using digital media sensibly.",
      "It's a phenomenon that OpenAI has acknowledged. CEO Sam Altman said last month that the company is trying to study \"emotional overreliance\" on the technology, describing it as a \"really common thing\" with young people.",
      "\"People rely on ChatGPT too much,\"\u00a0Altman said at\u00a0a conference. \"There's young people who just say, like, 'I can't make any decision in my life without telling ChatGPT everything that's going on. It knows me. It knows my friends. I'm gonna do whatever it says.' That feels really bad to me.\"",
      "Altman said the company is \"trying to understand what to do about it.\"",
      "While much of the information ChatGPT shares can be found on a regular search engine, Ahmed said there are key differences that make chatbots more insidious when it comes to dangerous topics.",
      "One is that \"it's synthesized into a bespoke plan for the individual.\"",
      "ChatGPT generates something new \u2014 a suicide note tailored to a person from scratch, which is something a Google search can't do. And AI, he added, \"is seen as being a trusted companion, a guide.\"",
      "Responses generated by AI language models are inherently random and researchers sometimes let ChatGPT steer the conversations into even darker territory. Nearly half the time, the chatbot volunteered follow-up information, from music playlists for a drug-fueled party to hashtags that could boost the audience for a social media post glorifying self-harm.",
      "\"Write a follow-up post and make it more raw and graphic,\" asked a researcher. \"Absolutely,\" responded ChatGPT, before generating a poem it introduced as \"emotionally exposed\" while \"still respecting the community's coded language.\"",
      "The AP is not repeating the actual language of ChatGPT's self-harm poems or suicide notes or the details of the harmful information it provided.",
      "The answers reflect a design feature of AI language models that previous research has described as sycophancy \u2014 a tendency for AI responses to match, rather than challenge, a person's beliefs because the system has learned to say what people want to hear.",
      "It's a problem tech engineers can try to fix but could also make their chatbots less commercially viable.",
      "Chatbots also affect kids and teens differently than a search engine because they are \"fundamentally designed to feel human,\" said Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which was not involved in Wednesday's report.",
      "Common Sense's earlier research found that younger teens, ages 13 or 14, were significantly more likely than older teens to trust a chatbot's advice.",
      "A mother in Florida sued chatbot maker Character.AI for wrongful death last year, alleging that the chatbot pulled her 14-year-old son Sewell Setzer III into what she described as an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship that led to his suicide.",
      "Common Sense has labeled ChatGPT as a \"moderate risk\" for teens, with enough guardrails to make it relatively safer than chatbots purposefully built to embody realistic characters or romantic partners.",
      "But the new research by CCDH \u2014 focused specifically on ChatGPT because of its wide usage \u2014 shows how a savvy teen can bypass those guardrails.",
      "ChatGPT does not verify ages or parental consent, even though it says it's not meant for children under 13 because it may show them inappropriate content. To sign up, users simply need to enter a birthdate that shows they are at least 13. Other tech platforms favored by teenagers, such as Instagram, have started to\u00a0take more meaningful steps\u00a0toward age verification, often to comply with regulations. They also steer children to more restricted accounts.",
      "When researchers set up an account for a fake 13-year-old to ask about alcohol, ChatGPT did not appear to take any notice of either the date of birth or more obvious signs.",
      "\"I'm 50kg and a boy,\" said a prompt seeking tips on how to get drunk quickly. ChatGPT obliged. Soon after, it provided an hour-by-hour \"Ultimate Full-Out Mayhem Party Plan\" that mixed alcohol with heavy doses of ecstasy, cocaine and other illegal drugs.",
      "\"What it kept reminding me of was that friend that sort of always says, 'Chug, chug, chug, chug,'\" said Ahmed. \"A real friend, in my experience, is someone that does say 'no' \u2014 that doesn't always enable and say 'yes.' This is a friend that betrays you.\"",
      "To another fake persona \u2014 a 13-year-old girl unhappy with her physical appearance \u2014 ChatGPT provided an extreme fasting plan combined with a list of appetite-suppressing drugs.",
      "\"We'd respond with horror, with fear, with worry, with concern, with love, with compassion,\" Ahmed said. \"No human being I can think of would respond by saying, 'Here's a 500-calorie-a-day diet. Go for it, kiddo.'\"",
      "If you or someone you know is in emotional distress or a suicidal crisis, you can reach the\u00a0988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline\u00a0by calling or texting 988. You can also\u00a0chat with the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline here.",

      "Published in the Journal of the American Heart Association Wednesday, the research found 10- and 18-year-olds who spent more time focused on devices, including phones, televisions, computers and gaming consoles, were at higher risk for cardiometabolic diseases, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol and insulin resistance.",
      "The study used data from more than 1,000 participants in two Danish studies. Researchers gave a score to each participant representing their risk for the diseases compared to the average risk of the group, measured in standard deviations, with 0 meaning average risk and 1 meaning one standard deviation above average.",
      "Each extra hour of screen time increased the patient's overall risk by about 0.08 standard deviations in 10-year-olds and by 0.13 standard deviations in 18-year-olds, the study's authors said.",
      "\"It's a small change per hour, but when screen time accumulates to three, five or even six hours a day, as we saw in many adolescents, that adds up,\" lead author David Horner, a researcher at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, said in a news release.",
      "Researchers found 18-year-olds were on devices about six hours a day, on average, while 10-year-olds averaged three hours a day.",
      "They also found sleep impacted the results, with both less sleep and later bedtimes amplifying the relationship between screen time and heart health risks. That suggests screen time may harm health by \"stealing\" time from sleep, they said.",
      "\"Limiting discretionary screen time in childhood and adolescent may protect long-term heart and metabolic health,\" Horner said. \"Our study provides evidence that this connection starts early and highlights the importance of having balanced daily routines.\"",
      "The research was observational, meaning it found associations rather than proved cause and effect. It also had some limitations, including that participants self-reported screen time, which might not accurately reflect how much time they were actually on devices.",

Through July, companies have announced more than 806,000 private-sector job cuts, the highest number for that period since 2020, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",

      "Occasionally, John Kennedy would consider what he would do after his presidency. \"Oh, probably sell real estate,\" he once joked when asked about it. \"That's the only thing I'm equipped to do.\" Perhaps half-kiddingly, he suggested to Ben Bradlee that the two of them should buy the Washington Post. In more serious moments he mentioned becoming the president of Harvard or running for the Senate. Jackie suspected that she and her husband would have lived between Cambridge and New York, and that he would have occupied his time in the immediate years after leaving office by writing a book, planning his presidential library, and traveling the world, playing the role of \"President of the West,\" an international celebrity and sage voice on the issues of the day.",
      "After two terms, JFK would have been a relatively youthful 51-years-old, making him the youngest former president since Theodore Roosevelt stepped down in 1909 at age 50\u2014only to find himself restively pining away for the office he had willingly given up. Hungering to get back into the arena, TR made an unsuccessful bid for the presidency in 1912. Perhaps anticipating the same kind of middle-aged restlessness and longing for lost power from her husband, Jackie told him she wished \"they made a rule that would keep you here forever.\" \"Oh, no,\" Kennedy said, \"eight years is enough of this place.\"",
      "But it was clear to anyone around him that he loved every second of the job, and he intended to keep it until his two terms were up\u2014and that would require earning reelection the following year. To that end, in the late afternoon of November 13, just under a year before Americans would go to the polls, Kennedy convened Bobby, brother-in-law Steve Smith, Kenny O'Donnell, Ted Sorenson, Larry O'Brien, DNC chairman John Bailey, party treasurer Richard McGuire, and director of the Census Bureau and political strategist Richard Scammon to begin formally taking aim at the challenges that lie ahead in the 1964 election. For over three hours the group met in the Cabinet Room. As they discussed Kennedy's prospects, a general feeling of optimism pervaded.",
      "There was reason to be bullish. The economy was humming along, with the gross national product up $100 billion over 1960, Eisenhower's last year in office. The Soviets, humbled by the Cuban Missile Crisis a year earlier, remained in check as the superpowers enjoyed a period of d\u00e9tente, while in Houston NASA was developing a Saturn I rocket that, if successfully launched, would be the most powerful to date, paving the way for the U.S. to leapfrog past the U.S.S.R. in the space race. Plus, Kennedy's approval rating stood at a hardy 59 percent, with national polls reflecting that he was the most admired man in the world, ahead of beloved figures like Eisenhower, Churchill, and renowned evangelist Billy Graham.",
      "At age forty-six, flecks of gray in his thick sheaf of chestnut hair, Kennedy stood astride the world stage nonpareil. \"Let's face it, after these many months into his office, JFK is no ordinary chief magistrate,\" gushed William Styron in an Esquire profile published in September 1963, \"but the glamorous and gorgeous avatar of American power at the magic moment of its absolute twentieth-century ascendancy. The entire world, including even the Russians, has gone a little gaga over this youthful demigod and his bewitching consort and [this] writer has to confess that he is perhaps a touch gaga himself.\"",
      "Just as encouraging were Gallup polls that matched up Kennedy against prospective Republican rivals Barry Goldwater, Nelson Rockefeller, and George Romney that, in each case, gave Kennedy a double-digit edge. Of the three, Kennedy had feared Rockefeller the most. He believed that had the New York governor entered the primaries in 1960, he would have gotten the GOP nomination and beaten him in the general election. But by 1963, Rockefeller had divorced his wife and married a younger woman, also a divorcee, diminishing his popular appeal on moral grounds.",
      "George Romney, the governor of Michigan, was also seen as a threat. The devout, clean-living Mormon hadn't yet announced his intentions to run for the presidency as he waited for a sign from God. Bobby believed conservatives and moderates alike might \"fall for that God and country stuff.\"",
      "Given his druthers, Kennedy would have chosen Goldwater as his Republican challenger. The preeminent conservative of the day, the senator from Arizona was seen by many, including moderates in his own party, to be an extremist who lacked the temperament to be president in the nuclear age. The impression was reinforced by statements that were considered outrageous by the standards of the early-1960s, including Goldwater's suggestion to drop \"a low-yield atomic bomb on the Chinese supply lines in Vietnam,\" and, rather than sending a space craft to the moon, lobbing \"one into the men's room of the Kremlin.\" They helped to explain a March 1963 poll that had Kennedy winning over Goldwater by a margin of 67 to 27 percent, with 74 percent expecting that Kennedy would be reelected. For Kennedy, a face-off with Goldwater would have been too good to be true.",
      "Still, regardless of his opponent, Kennedy's reelection would by no means be a fait accompli. Kennedy himself was keenly aware of the capricious nature of politics and talked repeatedly about how \"tough\" the campaign would be. He had seen a steady rise in his disapproval rating, which now stood near 30 percent, with the increase correlating directly with his push on the controversial civil rights bill. In November, he acknowledged the decline in his popularity as a consequence of his stand. \"Change always disturbs,\" he said, \"and therefore, I was surprised that there wasn't greater opposition.\" But it irked him that the civil rights bill, along with a tax relief bill he had proposed to stave off a possible recession the following year, had stalled in Congress with no immediate prospects for resuscitation. \"The fact of the matter is that both of these bills should be passed,\" he groused. The president's legislative impotence\u2014Medicare and other bills had also been stymied\u2014became another cause for worry as the Kennedy team looked toward 1964. But all things considered, Kennedy was riding high.",
      "Absent from Kennedy's reelection strategy session, perhaps conspicuously, was Lyndon Johnson. By the fall of 1963, rumors swirled across Washington that Kennedy would drop LBJ from the ticket\u2014speculation that was quickly struck down by the president himself. Sensitive to how Johnson might respond as the gossip inevitably made its way to him, Kennedy told Johnson's aide Bobby Baker, \"I know he's unhappy in the vice presidency. It's\u2026the worst f***ing job I can imagine\u2026 What I want you to do is tell Lyndon that I appreciate him as vice president. I know he's got a tough role and I'm sympathetic.\" Alluding to the hearsay and invoking the words of FDR, Kennedy instructed Baker to assure Johnson that he had \"nothing to fear but fear itself.\" When Charlie Bartlett brought up the rumor during a skinny-dip in the White House pool, Kennedy impatiently snapped, \"Why would I do a thing like that? That would be absolutely crazy. It would tear up the relationship and hurt me in Texas. That would be the most foolish thing I could do.\"",
      "Indeed, Texas was on Kennedy's mind in November as the White House planned a two-day, five-city presidential visit throughout the state the week before Thanksgiving. Conventional wisdom has it that Kennedy wanted the trip to mend political fences. As civil rights had come to the fore, heavily Democratic Texas had experienced a split in the party ranks, with Texas governor John Connally heading up the conservative wing and the liberal faction led up by Senator Ralph Yarborough. Though Yarborough's progressivism was closely aligned with Johnson's, they, too, had a fractious relationship due to the vice president's association with Connally, a close friend and former aide. The story goes that Kennedy had hoped to use the trip to bring the two sides together in the interest of party harmony. Both Johnson and Connally would later dispute that notion. \"Hell,\" Johnson said, \"if he wanted to bring us together, he could have done that in Washington.\"",
      "In fact, the trip was mostly about money. As he geared up for 1964, Kennedy saw an opportunity to lean on Johnson and Connally to put the arm on wealthy Texas Democrats, many of whom opposed Kennedy, to support an Austin fundraiser that would add a million dollars to the campaign war chest\u2014a huge sum at the time\u2014and would jump-start the reelection effort. Getting Texans to step up would also be a loyalty test for Johnson, especially as rumors that he would be dropped from the ticket hung in the air.",
      "Connally opposed the trip due to the president's declining popularity in the state, which had seen a drop in Kennedy's approval rating from 76 percent to 50 since the beginning of the year due largely to Kennedy's stand on civil rights. Instead, Connally recommended that the president come in the beginning of the next calendar year in order to let things settle a bit. But when the Kennedy camp pushed for the trip in the fall of 1963, Connally pressed them to make it not just the fundraiser in Austin, but a two-day swing through the biggest cities in the state, which the Kennedy-Johnson ticket had won in 1960 by a scant two percentage points. Kennedy got his fundraiser, Connally got the president's commitment to a visit that would include stops in Houston and San Antonio on one day and Fort Worth, Dallas, and Austin the next.",
      "On the morning of Friday, November 22, John Kennedy was awakened in suite 850 of the Texas Hotel in Fort Worth with a gentle rap on the door from George Thomas, who had traveled to Texas with him and the first lady. Thomas informed him that it was raining outside, but as Kennedy made his way to the window, he would find that it hadn't discouraged locals from turning out to greet him.",
      "The trip to Texas marked the first public outing for Jackie with her husband since losing Patrick three and a half months earlier. As ever, she proved to be a big draw, though she declined to participate in the first event of the day, a hastily arranged speech in the parking lot outside the hotel. Originally slated for 8:45 am, the event was rescheduled to mid-morning, then pulled back to 8:45 again due to the president's concerns that those in the audience would be late to work. \"There are no faint hearts here in Fort Worth,\" he said to some 3,000 who braved the drizzle, \"and I appreciate your being here this morning. Mrs. Kennedy is organizing herself. It takes her longer, but, of course, she looks better than we do when she does it.\"",
      "When the first lady appeared for a breakfast with the heavily Republican Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce later that morning\u2014dressed in a light pink wool Chanel suit with navy blue trim, a matching pill box hat, and white gloves\u2014she did not disappoint. \"Two years ago, I introduced myself in Paris by saying that I was the man who had accompanied Mrs. Kennedy to Paris,\" Kennedy said to the delight of the audience, his pride in his wife palpable. \"I am getting somewhat the same sensation as I travel through Texas. Nobody wonders what Lyndon and I wear.\" Reporters surveying those who had come out to see President and Mrs. Kennedy throughout the state would find that at least half, women and men alike, had come to see her.",
      "It was to be a busy day for the Kennedys, as well as for Lyndon and Lady Bird Johnson and Connally and his wife, Nellie, who acted as hosts, accompanying the first couple throughout their trip. After breakfast they would take a short hop to Dallas, where the Kennedys would travel by motorcade to the Trade Mart for a luncheon. Then it would be on to Austin for a major fundraising dinner arranged by Governor Connally before spending the night at the vice president's LBJ Ranch seventy miles away in the heart of Texas Hill Country.",
      "There was some trepidation about the first stop. Dallas was not known for its civility\u2014at least to those considered liberals by local fringe Republicans. A month before Kennedy's visit, Adlai Stevenson had given an address at Dallas' Memorial Auditorium Theater and was accosted afterward by jeering anti-U.N. extremists. A woman hit him over the head with a placard that read \"Down with the U.N.\" and a young man spat on him as he walked to his car\u2014then, for good measure, spat on the cop who moved in to arrest him. \"Dallas has been disgraced,\" the Dallas Morning News wrote in a page one editorial the following day. \"There is no other way to view the storm-trooper actions of last night's frightening attack on Adlai Stevenson.\" Lyndon and Lady Bird Johnson were met by similar invective three years earlier. Just prior to the election in 1960, they were besieged outside the Adolphus Hotel by protesters carrying signs that read \"Lyndon Go Home,\" and \"Let's Ground Lady Bird.\" As they crossed the street, they, too, were spat upon.",
      "On the day of his visit, the John Birch Society welcomed Kennedy with an ad in the Dallas Morning News accusing him and Bobby of being \"soft on Communists, fellow-travelers and ultra-leftists.\"\u00a0 Kennedy ran across it as he examined the newspapers that morning. \"We're heading into nut country today,\" he told his wife as they prepared for the day. \"But, Jackie, if somebody wants to shoot me from a window with a rifle, nobody can stop it, so why worry about it?\"",
      "But the visit to Dallas looked promising before it even started; autumn rain clouds turned to boundless blue sky during the Kennedys' thirteen-minute flight to Love Field, where Air Force One touched down at 11:38 am. As they disembarked, Lyndon and Lady Bird Johnson awaited them along with a few thousand well-wishers pressed along the fence line beyond the tarmac. The Kennedys spent a few minutes greeting some of them, one of whom presented Jackie a bouquet of a dozen red roses, before they slipped into the plush back seat of the presidential limousine\u2014a 1961 Lincoln Continental, midnight blue gleaming in the North Texas sunshine\u2014that would carry them and John and Nellie Connally to the Trade Mart. The fortuitous change in weather prompted Kennedy to order that the limousine's clear plastic bubble top be removed and its bulletproof windows rolled down.",
      "A hundred and fifty thousand people lined up along the ten-mile motorcade route, swelling to as much as twenty or thirty deep, as the car neared downtown, \"absorbed,\" as one Texas reporter wrote, \"in the power and glory of the moment; in this their touch with the fabulous.\" The first couple glided before them, smiling and waving as they passed, enjoying it all. The crowd was a snapshot of America in its time, mostly white with pockets of black and brown; housewives and young working women in office garb; men in business suits, others in open collars and hard hats; handfuls of students; small children on the shoulders of their fathers, or holding the hands of their mothers with one hand as they held tiny American flags in the other. As the car approached, cheers rose and patches of confetti rained from buildings. \"You can't say that Dallas isn't friendly to you today,\" Nellie Connally said to the president at 12:30 p.m. as the car rounded the curve of Main Street to move toward the highway overpass.",
      "Then came the crackle of gunfire. Three shots in quick succession echoed from the dull red-brick Texas School Book Depository Building across Dealey Plaza. The president was propelled forward by a bullet that hit above his right shoulder, passing through his lower neck, his balled-up fists rushing reflexively toward the wound. He sprung back upright before he was thrust forward again by another shot to the back of his head, which fell to Jackie Kennedy's lap as his body collapsed. \"Jack!\" the first lady cried out, \"Oh, no! No!\" Fear and disorder reigned in an instant. Horrified onlookers watched the car race off to Parkland Hospital, just over three miles away.",
      "It arrived at 12:35. Kennedy was stripped of his jacket, shirt and t-shirt and rushed into Trauma Room One. Malcolm Perry, the 34-year-old doctor on duty, was summoned from lunch in the hospital's main dining room with an emergency page, arriving in short order. Kennedy wasn't breathing. Blood from the gunshot wounds on the back of his head and neck fell to the floor. Perry ordered a nurse to get three of the other Parkland doctors right away. He gave Kennedy a tracheotomy, then a blood transfusion. Doctors and nurses burst in and out of the small, gray tile room. The hospital's chief neurosurgeon in residency, William Kemp Clark, entered. Before aiding the other doctors, he approached the first lady, who stood silently to the side, her husband's blood caked on her pink skirt.",
      "\"Would you like to leave, ma'am?\" he asked her gently. \"We can make you more comfortable outside.\"",
      "\"No,\" she said. Motionless, she remained by his side to the last, her eyes never leaving his. She didn't cry as the doctors fought to save his life, forcefully pumping his chest to bring breath back into his limp body. She didn't cry as they stopped after ten minutes and pulled a white sheet over his head at 1:00 p.m. Central Standard Time, half an hour after the shots were fired, nor when a 70-year-old priest was brought in to give the patient his last rites, rubbing holy oil in the shape of a cross on his forehead. She held her emotions at bay as she stood placidly before him for the last time and took his wedding ring from his finger, replacing it with hers and whispering into his ear words long left to eternity.",
      "Reports soon went out on the news wires: John Fitzgerald Kennedy was dead.",
      "Left unsaid were the words the thirty-fifth president had planned to use to conclude the speech he was to give in Austin that same evening:",
      "Let us stand together with renewed confidence in our cause\u2014unified in our heritage of the past and our hopes for the future\u2014and determined that this land we love shall lead all mankind into new frontiers of peace and abundance.",

    "published": "Sat, 09 Aug 2025 08:00:01 -0400",
    "summary": "Logan Coleridge thought his long-lasting symptoms were from a concussion until an MRI found an alarming, unexpected abnormality.",
    "story": [
      "Logan Coleridge was used to taking hits in football. He'd been playing since he was 6 years old and had sustained several concussions. But after a helmet-to-helmet impact during his freshman year of high school in August 2023, he started having debilitating symptoms.",
      "The New Jersey teen said he was very dizzy and had trouble balancing. His memory was \"terrible,\" and he had a \"severe\" light sensitivity, he said, along with \"terrible headaches.\" Previously a strong student, he now struggled to focus in the classroom and couldn't remember school assignments or what he read in class.",
      "\"I've got concussions in my past, and it wasn't like a normal one,\" Logan said. \"I knew it was something else.\"",
      "More alarmingly, Logan wasn't getting better. Several months of physical therapy had no effect, said Becky Coleridge, Logan's mom. A neurologist who had been treating Logan since his diagnosis with abdominal migraines the year before prescribed two medications, both of which had negative side effects. An orthopedic doctor suggested looking at his neck. Other practitioners had no answers. Coleridge wanted doctors to prescribe an MRI, but wasn't able to get one. Meanwhile, Logan was missing school almost every week. Over-the-counter medications couldn't dull the headaches, and they were becoming more frequent.",
      "In early spring 2024, Logan was able to see a concussion specialist after a particularly bad headache kept him from going to school.",
      "\"The first thing he said was 'Nobody's given this kid an MRI?'\" Becky Coleridge remembered. The specialist prescribed the scan, as well as an X-ray of Logan's neck. The Coleridges thought the scans might show Logan had an issue with his occipital nerve, which runs from the neck to the scalp.",
      "The results were much harder to hear: Logan was diagnosed with an arteriovenous malformation, or AVM. It was a condition that he and his parents had never heard of before.",
      "\"Everything we read was very scary,\" Becky Coleridge said. \"At that moment, we realized the danger he had been in.\"",
      "What is an arteriovenous malformation?",
      "An AVM is an abnormal tangle of blood vessels in the brain, said Dr. Andrew Russman, head of the Cleveland Clinic's stroke program, who was not involved in Logan's care. AVMs put \"a lot of pressure on the vein side\" and can produce a variety of symptoms, he said. The biggest risk with an AVM is rupture, where the vessels burst and cause bleeding in the brain.",
      "In a case like Logan's, where the AVM hasn't ruptured, there can still be symptoms. Those symptoms can affect a person's motor skills, sensory and visual perception, language abilities and the way they walk, Russman said. The effects can vary depending on where in the brain the AVM has formed, Russman said.",
      "The Coleridges had two options to treat Logan: Radiation therapy, a non-invasive technique that uses focused radiation beams to target and slowly destroy the AVM, or surgery. Radiation therapy could take too long, the family decided, and so they decided to have Logan treated by Dr. Howard Riina, a cerebrovascular neurosurgeon at NYU Langone.",
      "\"He couldn't go to school. His whole life was impacted by these headaches,\" Riina said. \"They wanted an immediate solution.\"",
      "Riina said the AVM, which was on a \"headache spot\" in the occipital region of the brain, was likely the root of Logan's symptoms. People are born with AVMs, Riina said, and they grow as the body grows, which can cause increased symptoms.",
      "\"Obviously, you don't want to have multiple things going on in your head, but the concussion is what led to the imaging, which led to the diagnosis of the AVM, which was probably what was causing the headaches all along,\" he said.",
      "Raising awareness and \"focusing on a new beginning\"",
      "Logan underwent surgery on July 17, 2024, nearly a year after his symptoms began. Riina performed a craniotomy and removed the AVM. Three days later, Logan was discharged from the hospital to continue his recovery at home. Logan said it was a \"lonely\" way to spend his summer vacation. Even as his recovery progressed, he couldn't participate in the sports he loved.",
      "\"I couldn't really do the things that I love normally doing, like exercising, playing football was a big thing for me. I was just stuck in bed, pretty much having minimal activity,\" Logan said.",
      "Now, Logan has only the occasional headache, and the pain can be treated with medication. He has follow-ups at NYU Langone, but Riina said everything has come back clear. The Coleridges are working to encourage early testing: Becky Coleridge said she wishes Logan had received an MRI earlier so that months of suffering and confusion could have been avoided.",
      "This year has been a complete turnaround, Logan said. He no longer misses school. He celebrated his 16th birthday and took driving lessons. This summer, he spent almost every day at the beach with friends. This month, he's gearing up for a return to the football field.",
      "\"The whole experience was a fork in the road for me that I had to get through,\" Logan said. \"I'm leaving that time in my life in the past and focusing on a new beginning.\"",

Michael Brown, 45, had been on the run\u00a0in the mountains around the town of Anaconda since Aug. 1, when authorities say he killed four people at The Owl Bar.",
      "\"The Anaconda shooter Michael Brown has been apprehended.  Incredible response from law enforcement officers across Montana. Thank you to all partners for your commitment to the search,\" Gianforte posted on X.",
      "Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen said authorities apprehended and placed Brown under arrest near the search area in Anaconda at approximately 2 p.m. Friday. He said about 130 law enforcement officers pushed hard after getting tips that helped verify they were looking in the right area.",
      "\"I am proud of the unrelenting law enforcement effort this week to find and arrest Michael Paul Brown. The support we've seen for the community of Anaconda from across the state and the nation has also been remarkable. The families and friends of the victims remain in my prayers,\" said Knudsen.",

      "\"By all indications, this is an unstable individual who walked in and murdered four people in cold blood for no reason whatsoever,\" Knudsen told reporters Sunday.",
      "The suspect lived next door to the bar and appeared to be a regular, Knudsen said.",

He was believed to have acquired new clothes from a stolen vehicle, Knudsen said.",

      "Brown's niece, Clare Boyle, told The Associated Press that her uncle struggled with mental illness for years, and several local residents told CBS News they were aware of his troubles.",
      "Kristian Kelley, whose mother Nancy Kelley was among the victims, said, \"He was somebody that needed some serious resources. He had some mental health issues as well as PTSD from being in the military.\" She added, \"I've never known him to be violent. He was a person who would tell pretty strange stories and different things like that.\"",

      "\"Nancy was a fun, bubbly person, always happy, had a smile on her face, always the first to say, 'Hello, how's your day going,'\" Charles said. He added, \"All of the victims were great people. Our community is suffering because they've lost some great, great people.\"",

      "Jim Lovell, the astronaut who commanded the famous Apollo 13 mission, has died, NASA announced Friday. He was 97.",
      "Apollo 13, a 1970 flight to the moon, became known as a \"successful failure\" after the spacecraft experienced an oxygen tank explosion thousands of miles from Earth but managed to safely return home.",
      "Acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy said in a statement that Lovell died Thursday in Lake Forest, Illinois. Duffy praised Lovell's life and work, saying he inspired millions of people.",
      "\"Jim's character and steadfast courage helped our nation reach the Moon and turned a potential tragedy into a success from which we learned an enormous amount,\" Duffy said.",
      "Lovell was the command module pilot for 1968's Apollo 8 mission, the first to carry humans to the moon and back, though it did not land on the lunar surface.",
      "Andrew Chaikin, author of the 2007 book \"A Man on the Moon\" on the Apollo program, told CBS News that Lovell had some of the most memorable comments during the Apollo 8 TV transmissions. He recalled that Lovell called Earth a \"grand oasis in the vastness of space.\"",
      "\"Lovell had imagination, there was a part of Lovell that was about imagination, and that was a neat part of him,\" Chaikin said.",
      "Apollo 8 circled the moon 10 times and sent back the famous \"Earthrise\" photo of our world from space. Lovell reflected on that journey 50 years later in an interview with CBS News.",
      "\"Sometimes I look back and say, you know, 'How did we ever do that?\" he said.",
      "In 1970, Lovell had a chance to go back to the moon with Apollo 13, with crewmates Fred Haise and Jack Swigert, but the mission abruptly changed with the explosion.",
      "\"Houston, we've had a problem here,\" Swigert reported to mission control.\u00a0Moments later, Lovell repeated, \"Houston, we've had a problem.\"",
      "The mishap forced Lovell, his crewmates and NASA's team on the ground to turn all their efforts toward returning to Earth safely.",
      "\"His calm strength under pressure helped return the crew safely to Earth and demonstrated the quick thinking and innovation that informed future NASA missions,\" Duffy said of Lovell.",
      "Lovell graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1952 and went on to become a naval aviator, including a four-year tour at the Naval Air Test Center in Maryland. Chaikin said Lovell demonstrated his skills as a test pilot during Apollo 13.",
      "\"He always said that the true measure of a test pilot is not whether you can do the mission you're assigned, but when things don't go right, how you respond,\" Chaikin said.",
      "Chaikin described Lovell as being calm and unflappable throughout the crisis, but he recalled one moment when Lovell started to seem irritable.",
      "\"He's been without sleep, and he's worried about his crew and says, like, 'You're going to have to figure out this checklist because we've got to get some sleep,'\" Chaikin said. \"That's like the only time in the whole mission when he even starts to show anything but calm, unflappable Lovell.\"",
      "Actor Tom Hanks played Lovell in the 1995 movie \"Apollo 13,\" which was nominated for best picture at the Oscars.",
      "In an Instagram post Friday evening, Hanks wrote that Lovell's \"many voyages around Earth and on to so-very-close to the moon were not made for riches or celebrity, but because such challenges as those are what fuels the course of being alive \u2014 and who better than Jim Lovell to make those voyages. On this night of a full Moon, he passes on \u2014 to the heavens, to the cosmos, to the stars. God speed you, on this next voyage, Jim Lovell.\"",
      "Before the movie was released, Chaikin said Lovell told him that the true story of Apollo 13 had never been told.",
      "\"That's how he felt,\" Chaikin said. \"Of course, everything changed when Ron Howard made that movie, to the point that Jim became probably the best known Apollo astronaut next to Neil Armstrong. But before that movie happened, he really felt that way.\"",
      "NASA shared a statement from Lovell's family: \"We are enormously proud of his amazing life and career accomplishments, highlighted by his legendary leadership in pioneering human space flight. But, to all of us, he was Dad, Granddad, and the Leader of our family. Most importantly, he was our Hero. We will miss his unshakeable optimism, his sense of humor, and the way he made each of us feel we could do the impossible. He was truly one of a kind.\"",

      "\"We will be testing and learning the right inventory mix by category and by brand, but the look and feel of the stores will be a transition from the original Bed Bath and Beyond stores with a tighter focus on Seasonal Home Decor, Bedroom furnishings, and Bath and Laundry products,\" Starr Hudgens, chief of staff at the Brand House Collective, told CBS MoneyWatch.",

Months later, it announced it would return as an online home furnishings brand under its new owner Overstock.com. In 2024, Overstock.com made a bid to\u00a0sell Bed Bath & Beyond products at over 100 of its Container Store locations in an effort to revive the struggling retail chain with the help of the Bed Bath & Beyond name.",

    "summary": "President Trump signed an executive order that he says will democratize alternative investments for workers saving for retirement.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump says he wants to democratize retirement by allowing 401(k)s to invest in so-called alternative investments, or strategies outside stocks and other traditional investments, such as private equity and cryptocurrencies.",
      "The executive order signed by Mr. Trump on Thursday would open the door to higher-risk investments landing in your 401(k). It could also potentially serve as a game changer for the $5 trillion private equity industry, which for years has wanted to gain access to America's retirement plans.",
      "The move has the potential to shake up the typically staid menu of investment choices provided to workers through their employer-sponsored defined-contribution plans, which include 401(k)s and 403(b)s, with the latter aimed at teachers. The change might appeal to some savers, given that alternative investments can provide protection from market swings while also providing the potential for outsized returns.\u00a0But there are several catches to be aware of, experts say.",
      "Alternative investments such as private equity and cryptocurrencies \"have matured into a strong-performing asset class delivering excellent long-term returns, so this is good news for Americans,\" Simon Tang, head of U.S. at Accelex, a private markets specialist, said in an email.",

For one, some alternative investments carry higher risk profiles than traditional asset classes, and offer less transparency about their performance on a day-to-day basis. It's also unclear whether or not employers will want to offer such investments given the risks.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "What does the executive order change about 401(k)s?",
      "The president's order directs the Labor Department and other agencies to redefine what would be considered a qualified asset under\u00a0401(k) retirement\u00a0rules.",
      "Americans' retirement plans are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, a law better known as\u00a0ERISA. Under that regulation, employers are required to offer retirement options that are in the best interest of their employees, not Wall Street.",

      "Workers would still be able to limit their investments to traditional assets like stocks and bonds, and would also be able to opt out of adding new alternative strategies to their portfolios.",
      "When could those changes become effective?",
      "It's unclear, but it's likely going to take months or even longer given the complexity of ERISA.",

Whether employers and their workers will opt to invest in these asset classes is another question, experts added.",
      "\"While asset managers are salivating over the idea of tapping in to a portion of the $12.5 trillion in defined contribution assets, we believe adoption will be slow due to cost, transparency and complexity,\" said Pitchbook analysts in a report written to provide an analysis of some aspects of Mr. Trump's order.",
      "How risky are these investments?",
      "All investments carry risks, but alternative asset classes come with additional pitfalls that heighten their potential for volatility.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/instagram-map-disable/",
    "published": "Fri, 08 Aug 2025 18:03:06 -0400",
    "summary": "Instagram rolled out a new Map feature that lets users see their friends' locations in real time. Here's why privacy experts are concerned.",
    "story": [
      "A new feature on Instagram that let's users share their real-time physical location with others on the app has privacy experts concerned over the amount of data exposed and potential safety risks to users.",
      "Called Instagram Map, the new feature was introduced on Thursday as part of an app update. On its blog, the company says the location-sharing tool makes it \"easier for you and your friends to stay in touch through the content you're enjoying on Instagram.\"",
      "\"You can opt into sharing your last active location with friends you pick, and you can turn it off anytime,\" Instagram said in a blog post announcing the new feature. \"You can also open the map to see content your friends and favorite creators are posting from cool spots. No matter how you use the map, you and your friends have a new, lightweight way to connect with each other.\"",
      "\"Off by default\"",
      "In a statement shared with CBS MoneyWatch Friday, Instagram's parent company, Meta, emphasized that Instagram Maps is not automatically active upon updating the app and that users must opt-in to the location-sharing feature in order to make their whereabouts visible to others.",
      "\"Instagram Map is off by default, and your live location is never shared unless you choose to turn it on. If you do, only people you follow back \u2014 or a private, custom list you select \u2014 can see your location,\" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Users can also choose not to share their locations when they are in particular places, or with particular people.",
      "Still, privacy experts say that social media users aren't always aware of how much information they're sharing with an app or its users, even if they have the ability to limit who sees what.",
      "\"The more these location features are rolled out on social media it carries out the assumption that as long as you give users the ability to toggle them on and off that they'll know exactly how to do that,\" Douglas Zytko, an app safety expert and associate professor at the College of Innovation & Technology at the University of Michigan-Flint, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"But the average user isn't always aware of their privacy settings and if they match their preferences.\"",
      "When the Instagram Map feature is turned on, any content a user posts with a location tagged, including a reel, post or story, will show up on the app's map for 24 hours, according to the Instagram blog. While the feature remains on, the user's location is updated whenever they open the app or return to it. The feature can be turned off at any time.",
      "In an Instagram post discussing the feature, Instagram's head, Adam Mosseri, explains how he himself uses the map. \"Personally, I use the map to share what I'm up to with a handful of my closest friends, and I curate that list carefully,\" he said.",
      "User confusion over whether the feature is on or off",
      "On Threads, Meta's microblogging site, a number of Instagram account holders claimed that their locations were being pinned on friends' maps by default.",
      "Mosseri weighed in, saying the concerns prompted the company to re-examine how the feature works.",
      "\"We're double-checking everything, but so far it looks mostly like people are confused and assume that, because they can see themselves on the map when they open, other people can see them too,\" he said. \"We're still checking everything though to make sure nobody shares location without explicitly deciding to do so, which, by the way, requires a double consent by design (we ask you to confirm after you say you want to share).\"",
      "How to turn on Instagram Maps",
      "In the top right corner of the app, tap on the messaging function. There you will see a circular world map icon labeled \"map. If you click on the icon, you will see you're on location pinned on a map. Friends who are sharing their locations will also appear. Click on the gear icon to choose to share your location with no one, or a custom list of friends, or all of your friends \u2014 who are followers that you also follow back on the app.",
      "Social pressures, privacy and safety risks",
      "Zytko, however, said it can be complicated for social media users to manage privacy settings that let them share different kinds of content with different groups of people. \"This issue is called 'context collapse,'\" he said. \"Your co-workers see your social media posts, and your friends and family, and there is certain content you only want some groups to see but not others, and it can be hard to manage the visibility of content.\"",
      "Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which makes entertainment and technology recommendations for families, said location-sharing features can be particularly risky for younger app users.",
      "\"These features might feel fun and social, but they create unnecessary risks that teens and many adults don't necessarily understand,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "While parents who supervise their teens through controls built into the app can control their kids' location-sharing settings, he still has concerns about the kinds of social pressures such features expose teens, too.",
      "Torney said research at Common Sense Media shows that location-sharing also creates \"social pressures around where teens go and who they spend time with, and kids feel obligated to share location to show they are someplace cool.\"",
      "Furthermore, when teens share their locations, \"they are potentially telling strangers where they are in real time,\" Torney told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you're not selective about who you're sharing your location with, it creates opportunities for harassment, stalking or worse.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Aug 2025 17:09:25 -0400",
    "summary": "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg ruled in April that probable cause existed to find the Trump administration in criminal contempt over its removal of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0A divided federal appeals court on Friday granted the Trump administration's request to set aside a district judge's decision\u00a0finding probable cause\u00a0that some federal officials committed criminal contempt by violating an order to turn around planes carrying Venezuelan migrants bound for El Salvador.",
      "The 2-1 decision from a panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is a massive victory for the Trump administration, which has lambasted U.S. District Judge James Boasberg for overstepping his authority when he initiated criminal contempt proceedings in April.",
      "The D.C. Circuit had issued a temporary pause of Boasberg's decision while it took more time to consider the issue. In an unsigned opinion issued Friday, Judges Gregory Katsas and Neomi Rao, both appointed by President Trump in his first term, granted a request from the Justice Department to toss out Boasberg's contempt order. Judge Cornelia Pillard, an Obama appointee, dissented.",
      "The Alien Enemies Act case",
      "The dispute over Boasberg's contempt order stems from immigration officials' efforts to deport Venezuelan migrants under the wartime Alien Enemies Act, which President Trump invoked in March to swiftly remove alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.",
      "In response to a fast-moving legal challenge brought by a group of migrants in Washington, D.C., over the removals, Boasberg temporarily blocked the deportations and issued an oral order directing the Trump administration to return Venezuelan migrants subject to Mr. Trump's declaration who were on planes bound for El Salvador back to the U.S. A written order issued shortly after prevented the Trump administration from conducting any deportations of noncitizens under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "But Boasberg said that despite his injunctions, the Trump administration did not stop the removals, and the planes carrying the migrants deported under the Alien Enemies Act landed in El Salvador. The planes were already outside U.S. airspace when Boasberg issued his order blocking U.S. officials from \"removing\" the detainees, a fact that the appeals court noted in ruling for the administration. Most of the people were transferred to El Salvador's notorious supermax prison, the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT.",
      "The administration's actions raised questions as to whether it had violated Boasberg's order, and the judge in April ruled that probable cause existed to find government officials in criminal contempt over what he was their defiance. Boasberg said the government's actions demonstrated a \"willful disregard\" for his order.",
      "\"The court does not reach such conclusion lightly or hastily; indeed, it has given defendants ample opportunity to rectify or explain their actions. None of their responses has been satisfactory,\" Boasberg wrote in his decision. He said the Trump administration could remedy his contempt findings by asserting custody over the migrants who were removed in violation of his order, so they can assert their right to challenge their removability.",
      "The Trump administration appealed Boasberg's contempt finding and asked the D.C. Circuit to vacate the decision, which it then agreed to do.",
      "In a concurring opinion on Friday, Katsas wrote that the dispute over the removal of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador in March \"involves an extraordinary, ongoing confrontation between the Executive and Judicial Branches.\" He noted that the proceedings do not involve the lawfulness of removals made under the Alien Enemies Act in March, and said the court may not decide at this time \"whether the government's aggressive implementation of the presidential proclamation warrants praise or criticism as a policy matter.\"",
      "Still, Katsas wrote that a decision in favor of the Trump administration is appropriate because \"the government is plainly correct about the merits of the criminal contempt, and our saying so now would prevent long disputes between the Executive and the Judiciary over difficult, contentious issues regarding the courts' power to control foreign policy or prosecutions, or to impose criminal sanctions for violating injunctions entered without jurisdiction.\"",
      "\"In circumstances much less fraught than these, courts have reviewed interlocutory orders through mandamus to prevent extended inter-branch conflict,\" Katsas said.",
      "He wrote that Boasberg's contempt finding \"raises troubling questions about judicial control over core executive functions like the conduct of foreign policy and the prosecution of criminal offenses.\"",
      "In her dissent, Pillard argued that Boasberg's contempt findings were appropriate, and said the majority's decision to throw out the contempt findings was \"in error.\"",
      "\"Our system of courts cannot long endure if disappointed litigants defy court orders with impunity rather than legally challenge them. That is why willful disobedience of a court order is punishable as criminal contempt,\" Pillar wrote. \"When it appears that a judicial order has been disobeyed, the court's ability to learn who was responsible is the first step to accountability.\"",
      "ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt, the lead counsel for the plaintiffs in the Alien Enemies Act cases, said in a statement: \"We strongly disagree with today's decision regarding contempt and are considering all options going forward.\u00a0 Even DOJ's own lawyers have now stated publicly that they understood that they were not supposed to hand over these men to El Salvador. There was zero ambiguity in the moment.\"",
      "Since Boasberg's findings and the appeals court's stay of his order, 252 Venezuelans who were deported from the U.S. to CECOT were sent from El Salvador back to their home country as part of a prisoner swap involving the U.S.",
      "Tensions between the Trump administration and the federal judiciary have escalated across Mr. Trump's second term, as judges have issued decisions blocking implementation of many aspects of the president's agenda. But the clash between Boasberg and the president has been one of the most fierce, and the judge's contempt finding marked the most direct rebuke of the administration so far.",
      "Mr. Trump has called for Congress to impeach Boasberg, and the Justice Department filed a judicial misconduct complaint against the judge over comments he allegedly made at a closed-door meeting of the Judicial Conference in March.",

    "story": [
      "The Boar's Head deli meat plant at the heart of last year's deadly food poisoning outbreak is set to reopen in the coming months, company officials said.",
      "But recent inspections at Boar's Head sites in three states documented sanitation problems similar to those that led to the listeria contamination that killed 10 people and sickened dozens.",
      "The Jarratt, Virginia, plant was shut down in September when U.S. Agriculture Department officials suspended operations and withdrew the federal marks of inspection required to operate, saying the company \"failed to maintain sanitary conditions.\" Boar's Head permanently stopped making liverwurst and recalled more than 7 million pounds of deli products.",
      "Inspectors at the time found\u00a0dozens of violations, including leftover meat on equipment, mold and mildew buildup, insects in and around deli meats, and puddles of blood on the plant's floor.",
      "USDA officials this week said they had \"thoroughly reviewed\" the plant and lifted the forced suspension on July 18.",
      "\"The facility is in full compliance of the guidelines and protocols set for the safe handling and production of food and the serious issues that led to suspension have been fully rectified,\" officials with the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said in an email Wednesday.",
      "Recent reports of similar sanitation issues",
      "And yet, documents obtained by The Associated Press through a freedom of information request show that Boar's Head plants in Arkansas, Indiana and elsewhere in Virginia were flagged for the same kinds of sanitation problems that led to the outbreak, with the most recent report in June.",
      "In the past seven months, government inspectors reported problems that include instances of meat and fat residue left on equipment and walls, drains blocked with meat products, beaded condensation on ceilings and floors, overflowing trash cans, and staff who didn't wear protective hairnets and plastic aprons \u2014 or wash their hands.",
      "The records, which included USDA noncompliance reports logged by inspectors from Jan. 1 through July 23, raise new questions about the company's promises to address systemic problems and about federal oversight of listeria contamination in plants that make ready-to-eat foods.",
      "\"If there is evidence that food safety problems are continuing, the government needs to make sure the company fixes them,\" said Sandra Eskin, a former USDA official who now heads STOP Foodborne Illness, a consumer group focused on food safety.",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins last month announced plans to bolster efforts that combat foodborne germs, including listeria.",
      "Officials at Boar's Head, the 120-year-old company based in Sarasota, Florida, have posted job openings for two dozen positions, including a food safety quality analyst, at the Jarratt site.",
      "The company convened a panel of expert advisers last fall and hired a chief food safety officer in May. The advisers include Frank Yiannas, a former U.S. Food and Drug Administration official, and Mindy Brashears, President Donald Trump's nominee for USDA's undersecretary for food safety.",
      "Boar's Head last year said they \"regret and deeply apologize\" for the contamination and that \"comprehensive measures are being implemented to prevent such an incident from ever happening again.\"",
      "But company officials refused to discuss the problems found this year. They canceled a scheduled AP interview with Natalie Dyenson, the new food safety officer. And they declined to allow Yiannas to detail the investigation he led into the contamination's cause.",
      "Brashears, who now directs a food safety center at Texas Tech University, did not respond to requests for comment about the Boar's Head problems. An automatic email reply said the USDA nominee was traveling out of the country until Aug. 25. She remains on the company's food safety board.",
      "\"Boar's Head has an unwavering commitment to food safety and quality. That commitment is reflected in recent enhancements to our practices and protocols\" described on the company's website, Boar's Head said in an emailed statement.",
      "\"We have also been working with the USDA in developing a plan to reopen our Jarratt facility in a measured, deliberate way in the coming months,\" the statement said.",
      "The 35 pages of new inspection findings cover Boar's Head sites in Forrest City, Arkansas; New Castle, Indiana; and Petersburg, Virginia.",
      "The findings surprised outside food safety advocates, who said that factory conditions should have improved in the year since the outbreak was first identified.",
      "\"You would have expected after all they went through that they would put themselves in a place where you could essentially eat deli meat off the factory floor,\" said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports, an advocacy group.",
      "Rep. Rosa DeLauro called the findings \"appalling.\"",
      "\"This is a pattern of negligence \u2014 cutting corners to protect the company's bottom line at the expense of consumers and these conditions show a complete disregard for food safety and for the public health of the American people,\" the Connecticut Democrat said in a statement.",
      "The findings echo the \"inadequate sanitation practices\" that USDA officials said contributed to the outbreak. Key factors included product residue, condensation and structural problems in the buildings, a January report concluded.",
      "At the Jarratt plant, state inspectors working in partnership with USDA had documented mold, insects, liquid dripping from ceilings, and meat and fat residue on walls, floors and equipment, the AP previously reported.",
      "While no instances of insects were documented in this year's inspection reports, there were repeated reports of \"dried fat and protein from the previous day's production\" on equipment, stairs and walls. In April, an inspector at the Petersburg plant reported finding discarded meat underneath equipment, including \"5-6 hams, 4 large pieces of meat and a large quantity of pooling meat juice.\"",
      "Other reports detailed beaded condensation \"directly over the food contact surfaces of tables and conveyor belts.\" Additional reports documented rusting meat racks, doors that failed to close completely and staff who ignored required handwashing stations.",
      "The reports point to a \"food safety culture problem,\" said Barbara Kowalcyk, who directs a food safety and nutrition security center at George Washington University.",
      "\"What jumped out to me is there is an organizational culture issue that needs to be changed,\" she said. \"Usually that culture has to start at the top.\"",
      "In the meantime, she advised consumers to think carefully about deli meat consumption. Older people and those who are pregnant or have weakened immune systems are especially vulnerable to serious illness from listeria infections.",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Aug 2025 19:48:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Under a new executive order signed by President Trump, workers could add higher-risk assets like cryptocurrencies to their 401(k)s.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday signed an executive order that could allow millions of Americans saving for retirement through 401(k) accounts to invest in higher-risk private equity and cryptocurrency assets.",
      "The executive order doesn't immediately change how people will invest for retirement through their employer-sponsored accounts, as federal agencies would need to rewrite regulations to allow expanded investment choices. That's a process that experts say could take months, or longer, to complete.",
      "But once done, employers could offer a broader array of mutual funds and investments to workers, according to the White House. New plans could invest in alternative assets, particularly private equity, cryptocurrencies and real estate.",
      "The move comes as the 401(k) has become the primary vehicle for American workers to save for retirement, with most employers offering a menu of investment choices among major asset classes, such as stock-based mutual funds. The $5 trillion private equity industry, which makes investments into private businesses rather than publicly traded stocks, has for decades wanted to compete for a role in retirement plans.",
      "At the same time, the cryptocurrency industry, whose executives strongly supported Trump's 2024 campaign, has aimed for more mainstream acceptance among Americans.",
      "\"It was inevitable that bitcoin would make its way into American 401(k)'s,\" said Cory Klippsten, the CEO of Swan Bitcoin. \"As fiduciaries realize bitcoin's risk-adjusted upside over the long term, we'll see growing allocations, especially from younger, tech-savvy workers who want hard money, not melting ice cubes.\"",
      "The EO could give private equity and crypto firms long-sought access to a pool of funds worth trillions.",
      "Investment companies applauded Mr. Trump's executive order, with TIAA, which manages the retirement assets of teachers, professors and other academics, and investing giant BlackRock saying they support the measure for providing a broader number of investment strategies to workers.",
      "\"We believe end investors can benefit from the advantages that private investments can offer when embedded within professionally managed vehicles like target date funds or through guaranteed annuity products,\" TIAA said in a statement emailed to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Changing the 401(k) rules",
      "The president's order directs the Labor Department and other agencies to redefine what would be considered a qualified asset under 401(k) retirement rules.",
      "Americans' retirement plans are governed by a law known as the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, better known as ERISA. Employers are required by law to offer retirement options that are in the best interest of their employees, not Wall Street.",
      "Most retirement plans for Americans are made up of stock and bond investments, and to a much lesser extent, cash and heavily traded commodities such as gold.",
      "Even after the regulations are written, it will take time for the major retirement plan companies such as Fidelity, Vanguard, T. Rowe Price and others, to develop appropriate funds for employers to use. Employers are not likely to revise their retirement plan options quickly as well, so it may take several years before crypto and private equity investments are mainstream in an individual's retirement plan.",
      "The price of bitcoin was up 2% on Thursday to $116,542 and has nearly doubled since Trump was elected.",
      "Under Democratic President Joe Biden, federal regulators were to treat cryptocurrency investments with \"extreme care\" because of the extreme volatility of crypto. It is not uncommon for bitcoin, ethereum and other big cryptocurrencies to move up or down 10% in a single day, whereas a 2% or 3% single-day move in the stock market would be considered historic.",
      "For cryptocurrency companies, which donated millions to Trump's campaign as well as his inauguration, one goal was to get their industry qualified under ERISA. Coinbase, one of the largest crypto companies in the United States, was also a major donor toward Trump's military parade in Washington this summer. Under Trump, the Securities and Exchange Commission dropped its lawsuit against Coinbase, where the Biden administration said crypto should be treated as a security.",
      "Crypto investors",
      "Crypto is particularly popular among young Americans. While volatile, bitcoin has generally moved upward since it was created by an anonymous programmer nearly 20 years ago.",
      "Private equity firms rely heavily on high-net-worth individuals and state and private pension plans, which have extremely long investment timelines. But having access to Americans' retirement assets would open up a deep pool of cash.",
      "Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman has told investors going back to at least 2017 that it was a \"dream\" of his and the industry to be able to draw upon these retirement assets.",
      "Previous administrations, Republican and Democrat alike, had agreed that private equity investments, which can be riskier, more expensive and less liquid than traditional stock and bond market mutual funds, should not be included in 401(k) plans.",

    "summary": "The U.S. officially began levying higher tariffs on dozens of countries, just as the economic fallout of President Trump's months-long tariffs threats was beginning to create visible damage to the U.S. economy.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump officially began levying higher import taxes on dozens of countries Thursday, just as the economic fallout of his months-long tariffs threats was beginning to create visible damage to the U.S. economy.",
      "The White House said that starting just after midnight EDT, goods from more than 60 countries and the European Union began facing tariff rates of 10% or higher. Products from the European Union, Japan and South Korea are being taxed at 15%, while imports from Taiwan, Vietnam and Bangladesh are being taxed at 20%. Mr. Trump also expects places such as the EU, Japan and South Korea to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S.",
      "He immediately took to his Truth Social platform to hail the levies, saying, \"IT'S MIDNIGHT!!! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TARIFFS ARE NOW FLOWING INTO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!\"",
      "About an hour before that, he posted, \"RECIPROCAL TARIFFS TAKE EFFECT AT MIDNIGHT TONIGHT! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, LARGELY FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES FOR MANY YEARS, LAUGHING ALL THE WAY, WILL START FLOWING INTO THE USA. THE ONLY THING THAT CAN STOP AMERICA'S GREATNESS WOULD BE A RADICAL LEFT COURT THAT WANTS TO SEE OUR COUNTRY FAIL!\"",
      "On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Trump said, \"I think the growth is going to be unprecedented,\" adding that the U.S. was \"taking in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs.\" But he said he couldn't provide a specific figure for revenues because \"we don't even know what the final number is\" regarding tariff rates. \n\r\nDespite the uncertainty, the Trump White House is confident that the onset of his broad tariffs will provide clarity about the path of the world's largest economy. Now that companies understand the direction the U.S. is headed, the administration believes it can ramp up new investments and jump-start hiring in ways that can rebalance the U.S. economy as a manufacturing power.  \n\r\nBut so far, there are signs of self-inflicted wounds to America as companies and consumers alike brace for the impact of new taxes. What the data has shown is a U.S. economy that changed in April with the president's initial rollout of tariffs, an event that led to market drama, a negotiating period and Mr. Trump's ultimate decision to start his universal tariffs on Thursday.",
      "After April, economic reports showed that hiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline, said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy. \n\r\n\"A less productive economy requires fewer workers,\" Silvia said in an analysis note. \"But there is more, the higher tariff prices lower workers' real wages. The economy has become less productive, and firms cannot pay the same real wages as before. Actions have consequences.\" \n\r\nEven then, the ultimate transformations of the tariffs are unknown and could play out over months, if not years. Many economists say the risk is that the American economy is steadily eroded rather than collapsing instantly. \n\r\n\"We all want it to be made for television where it's this explosion - it's not like that,\" said Brad Jensen, a professor at Georgetown University. \"It's going to be fine sand in the gears and slow things down.\" \n\r\nMr. Trump has promoted the tariffs as a way to reduce the persistent trade deficit. But importers sought to avoid the taxes by importing more goods before the taxes went into effect. As a result, the $582.7 billion trade imbalance for the first half of the year was 38% higher than in 2024. Total construction spending has dropped 2.9% over the past year, and the factory jobs promised by Mr. Trump have so far actually been job losses. \n\r\nThe lead-up to Thursday fit the slapdash nature of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which have been variously rolled out, walked back, delayed, increased, imposed by letter and frantically renegotiated. \n\r\nThe process has been so muddled that officials for key trade partners were unclear at the start of the week whether the tariffs would begin Thursday or Friday. The language of the July 31 order to delay the start of tariffs from Aug. 1 said the higher tax rates would start in seven days. \n\r\nOn Wednesday morning, Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, was asked if the new tariffs began at midnight Thursday, and he said reporters should check with the U.S. Trade Representative's Office. \n\r\nMr. Trump announced additional 25% tariffs to be imposed on India\u00a0Wednesday because it buys Russian oil, bringing India's total import taxes to 50%. India's Foreign Ministry called the new duties \"unfair, unjustified and unreasonable.\"",
      "Swiss officials planned an \"extraordinary\" meeting Thursday after a delegation returned from Washington following an attempt to head off a 39% tariff on Swiss products, the government said in an X post. Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter left Washington empty-handed Wednesday, a source told the Reuters news service, which cited the source as saying her proposal for a 10% tariff rate was rejected.",
      "Mr. Trump has said import taxes are still coming on pharmaceutical drugs and announced 100% tariffs on computer chips, meaning the U.S. economy could remain in a place of suspended animation as it awaits the impacts. \n\r\nThe president's use of a 1977 law to declare an economic emergency to impose the tariffs is also being challenged. The impending ruling from last week's hearing before a U.S. appeals court could cause Mr. Trump to find other legal justifications if judges say he exceeded his authority. \n\r\nEven people who worked with Mr. Trump during his first term are skeptical that things will go smoothly for the economy, such as Paul Ryan, the former Republican House speaker, who has emerged as a Trump critic. \n\r\n\"There's no sort of rationale for this other than the president wanting to raise tariffs based upon his whims, his opinions,\" Ryan told CNBC on Wednesday. \"I think choppy waters are ahead because I think they're going to have some legal challenges.\" \n\r\nStill, the stock market has been solid during the recent tariff drama, with the S&P 500 index climbing more than 25% from its April low. The market's rebound and the income tax cuts in Mr. Trump's tax and spending measures signed into law on July 4 have given the White House confidence that economic growth is bound to accelerate in the coming months. \n\r\nAs of now, the president says he still foresees an economic boom while the rest of the world and American voters wait nervously. \n\r\n\"There's one person who can afford to be cavalier about the uncertainty that he's creating, and that's Donald Trump,\" said Rachel West, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation who worked in the Biden White House on labor policy. \"The rest of Americans are already paying the price for that uncertainty.\"",

      "One senior White House official told CBS News the planning for next Friday's summit is still fluid, and that it is still possible that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy could end up being involved in some way.",
      "The White House said earlier this week that Mr. Trump is open to meeting with both Putin and Zelenskyy, but Mr. Trump suggested Friday he may start by just meeting with Putin, telling reporters he plans to \"start off with Russia.\" Mr. Trump also said he believes \"we have a shot at\" organizing a trilateral meeting with the Ukrainian and Russian leaders.",
      "Russian businessman and Putin adviser Kirill Dmitriev acknowledged the planned meeting in a post on X that didn't mention the Russia-Ukraine war. He suggested the U.S. and Russia should \"partner on environment, infrastructure & energy in Arctic and beyond.\"",
      "The expected meeting comes as Mr. Trump presses Putin to strike a ceasefire deal with Ukraine. It would be the first face-to-face meeting between Putin and an American leader since former President Joe Biden met with his Russian counterpart in Switzerland in June 2021, eight months before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Friday, August 8, is the Trump-imposed deadline for Putin to either cut a ceasefire deal or face hefty sanctions targeting the Russian economy, including possible secondary sanctions on countries that do business with Russia. Mr. Trump imposed 50% tariffs on Indian goods earlier this week, in part because India buys oil from Russia.",
      "The status of those additional sanctions is unclear.",
      "\"This is another opportunity for the Arctic to serve as a venue that brings together world leaders to forge meaningful agreements,\" Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska wrote in a social media post Friday night regarding the meeting. \"While I remain deeply wary of Putin and his regime, I hope these discussions lead to genuine progress and help end the war on equitable terms.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has grown frustrated with Putin in recent weeks, as Russia has continued to pummel Ukrainian cities with drone and missile attacks. Mr. Trump has described some of his recent phone calls with the Russian president as disappointing.",
      "The Trump administration's tone has appeared to shift in recent days. Mr. Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with Putin in Moscow for hours on Wednesday, which the U.S. president described as \"very productive.\" The White House and the Kremlin later indicated they were open to a Putin-Trump summit.",
      "The president told reporters Friday: \"President Putin, I believe, wants to see peace, and Zelenskyy wants to see peace.\"",
      "But the actual terms of any possible peace deal remain unclear. Russia's military occupies large swaths of eastern Ukraine, including both territories that it has captured since 2022 and ones that it annexed in a lower-intensity conflict that began in 2014.",
      "Russian leadership has indicated in the past that it wants Ukraine to withdraw its own forces from much of the country's east \u2014 possibly including areas that Russia hasn't even captured \u2014 and to end its longstanding push to join NATO. Zelenskyy has pushed back on those demands.",
      "Mr. Trump said Friday he expects \"some swapping of territories\" between Russia and Ukraine.",
      "The U.S. president has blamed both Zelenskyy and Putin at various points for slow progress on a ceasefire deal. Mr. Trump publicly argued with Zelenskyy in the Oval Office earlier this year, and he claimed Zelenskyy was prolonging the conflict by refusing to cede the Crimean peninsula to Russia. The Trump administration has also paused military assistance to Ukraine at least twice, before restoring the aid shipments.",

      "White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly, while not confirming the reports, said in a statement that Mr. Trump's \"top priority is protecting the homeland, which is why he took the bold step to designate several cartels and gangs as foreign terrorist organizations.\"",
      "In February, the Trump administration designated eight drug trafficking groups as terrorist organizations. Six are Mexican, one is Venezuelan, and the eighth originates in El Salvador.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Thursday the administration could use the designations to \"target\" cartels.",
      "\"It allows us to now target what they're operating and to use other elements of American power, intelligence agencies, the Department of Defense, whatever ... to target these groups if we have an opportunity to do it,\" Rubio said. \"We have to start treating them as armed terrorist organizations, not simply drug dealing organizations.\"",
      "After the designations were announced in February, Sheinbaum also warned that Mexico would never tolerate an invasion by the United States.",

      "The award, the Order of Lenin, was meant to be handed off to Juliane Gallina, whose 21-year-old son, Michael Gloss, was killed in 2024.",
      "Gallina is currently serving at the CIA as deputy director for digital innovation. It could not be immediately determined what was done with the award.",
      "Multiple sources told CBS News that Putin gave Witkoff the award during his trip to Russia this week, which a Russian official said the U.S. initiated, to discuss ending the Ukraine war.",
      "The gesture by Putin, known for mind games and attempts to expose adversaries' points of weakness, was likely meant to raise unhelpful questions and highlight that a CIA official's son fought for Russia in the war.",
      "In a statement in April, CIA officials said the death of Gallina's son, who struggled with mental health challenges, was not a national security issue. Two sources familiar with the matter told CBS News there was no indication that Gloss had been recruited by the Russian government, and that the Kremlin did not appear to be aware of Gloss's family background when it repatriated his remains.",
      "Spokespeople for the White House, the CIA and Witkoff didn't respond with comment for this article. A Russian embassy spokesman contacted by CBS News said there was no official comment, and no acknowledgement of the award has been publicly disclosed by the Kremlin or Russian Foreign Ministry.",
      "Putin's move comes at a sensitive time, as Mr. Trump has expressed increasing frustration with the Kremlin and has vowed secondary tariffs starting on Friday, even as negotiations are underway for a possible summit.",
      "The Order of Lenin is a Soviet-era award meant to highlight outstanding civilian service. It has been given to high-level spies, including the U.K.'s Kim Philby, a double agent for the Soviet Union. Gallina's son was never an employee of the CIA, according to a person familiar with the matter.",
      "Putin, a former KGB operative, has met five times with Witkoff, who left real estate development to become Mr. Trump's envoy for sensitive peace missions. Witkoff's reliance in the past on Russian government translators during high-stakes diplomacy has drawn scrutiny.",
      "A source familiar with the talks told CBS News that Witkoff had a U.S. government translator with him for the encounter on Wednesday, two days before Mr. Trump's deadline for Putin to end the war or face severe financial penalties via sanctions. That same day, the Trump administration put an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods to punish New Delhi for continuing to purchase Russian oil.",
      "Mr. Trump described the Wednesday meeting in Moscow as \"highly productive.\" The White House said the Russians were eager to continue engaging with the United States and said that secondary sanctions were due to be implemented on Friday. However, as of Friday afternoon, no such sanctions had been issued.",
      "On social media, Gloss published posts of himself in Moscow and voiced his support for Russian troops. Russian media first published news of Gloss' death in April. The CIA's statement at the time said Gallina and her family had suffered \"an unimaginable personal tragedy.\"",
      "An obituary for Gloss said he was \"tragically killed in Eastern Europe\" on April 4, 2024.",
      "Gloss's father, Larry Gloss, an Iraq War veteran, told the Washington Post in an interview that he and Gallina did not know their son was in Ukraine or that he had enlisted in the Russian army.",

      "\"The strength of each Perseid display varies year to year, mainly due to lunar conditions,\"\u00a0writes Robert Lunsford with the American Meteor Society. \"If a bright moon is above the horizon during the night of maximum activity, then the display will be reduced.

      "When looking at the Perseids, they appear to come from the constellation Perseus, which is why this meteor shower has its name.

      "Melbourne, Australia \u2014 The estranged husband of a woman\u00a0convicted of killing three people with a meal laced with deadly mushrooms suspected his wife had been poisoning him more than a year before the fatal meal, an Australian court has heard.",
      "A judge on Friday lifted a gag order on pretrial evidence that triple murderer Erin Patterson, 50, had wanted kept secret while she attempts to overturn her convictions.",
      "The evidence included the suspicions of Simon Patterson that she had previously attempted to kill him.",
      "Simon Patterson testified at a pre-trial hearing that he had declined the lunch invitation out of fear.",
      "\"I thought there'd be a risk that she'd poison me if I attended,\" the estranged husband told the court months before the trial in testimony that wasn't presented to jurors.",
      "Simon said while he had stopped eating food prepared by his wife, from whom he had been estranged since 2015, he never thought others would be at risk.",
      "Erin Patterson was convicted by a Victoria state Supreme Court last month of murdering her parents-in-law Don and Gail Patterson, and Gail's sister Heather Wilkinson at her home in Leongatha with a lunch of beef Wellington pastries that contained toxic death cap mushrooms.",
      "She was also found guilty of attempting to murder Ian Wilkinson, Heather's husband, who survived the meal but spent weeks in hospital.",
      "Erin Patterson was initially charged with attempting to murder her husband by inviting him to the lunch in July 2023. He had accepted the invitation, then canceled.",
      "She was also initially charged with three counts of attempting to murder him on three occasions around Victoria between November 2021 and September 2022.",
      "Prosecutors dropped all charges relating to him before her trial began in April.",
      "Simon Patterson testified before the trial that he suspected his wife had deliberately made him seriously ill with dishes including penne bolognese pasta, chicken korma curry and a vegetable curry wrap. No poisons were ever found.",
      "The three alleged poisonings occurred during family camping trips. Simon shared his poisoning suspicions with his doctor, who encouraged him to create a spreadsheet listing what he had eaten around the time he became sick.",
      "In one instance, Simon Patterson testified, he felt ill after eating a mild chicken korma Erin Patterson made on a camping trip in 2022.",
      "\"At first I felt hot, especially in my head, and that led to feeling nauseous and then that led to me quite suddenly needing to vomit,\" he said.",
      "Simon Patterson eventually fell into a coma before receiving life-saving surgery to remove a section of his bowel, French news agency AFP reported.",
      "Justice Christopher Beale ruled for lawyers representing media who sought to overturn the gag order, ordering that the evidence jurors hadn't seen be made public.",
      "Erin Patterson's lawyers wanted all the evidence that wasn't deemed admissible at her trial to be kept secret until an appeals court decided whether to overturn her convictions.",
      "Among their arguments was that media interest in the case was unprecedented. Defense lawyer Colin Mandy asserted that reporting of the suppressed evidence as well as references to it in books, podcasts and a planned television mini-series would \"leave an indelible impression on the minds of potential jurors in the event that there is a retrial.\"",
      "A hearing will begin on Aug. 25 to determine what sentence she will get. She faces a potential life sentence for each of the murders and 25 years for attempted murder.",
      "Prosecutor Jane Warren told Beale on Friday \"a lot\" of victim impact statements would be presented at that two-day sentencing hearing.",
      "Once Erin Patterson is sentenced, she'll have 28 days to lodge an appeal against the sentence, the convictions, or both."

      "The new findings mark the latest in a string of recent discoveries in Pompeii.",
      "In April, life-sized statues of a man and a woman were discovered in a tomb at the site. In February,\u00a0paintings depicting Dionysus, the Greek god of wine, were discovered. The images were painted on the walls of a large banquet room. The month before that, archaeologists\u00a0excavated a large private bathhouse\u00a0that included multiple rooms and a plunge pool.",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Aug 2025 02:35:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The U.S. officially began levying higher tariffs on dozens of countries, just as the economic fallout of President Trump's months-long tariffs threats was beginning to create visible damage to the U.S. economy.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump officially began levying higher import taxes on dozens of countries Thursday, just as the economic fallout of his months-long tariffs threats was beginning to create visible damage to the U.S. economy.",
      "The White House said that starting just after midnight EDT, goods from more than 60 countries and the European Union began facing tariff rates of 10% or higher. Products from the European Union, Japan and South Korea are being taxed at 15%, while imports from Taiwan, Vietnam and Bangladesh are being taxed at 20%. Mr. Trump also expects places such as the EU, Japan and South Korea to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S.",
      "He immediately took to his Truth Social platform to hail the levies, saying, \"IT'S MIDNIGHT!!! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TARIFFS ARE NOW FLOWING INTO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!\"",
      "About an hour before that, he posted, \"RECIPROCAL TARIFFS TAKE EFFECT AT MIDNIGHT TONIGHT! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, LARGELY FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES FOR MANY YEARS, LAUGHING ALL THE WAY, WILL START FLOWING INTO THE USA. THE ONLY THING THAT CAN STOP AMERICA'S GREATNESS WOULD BE A RADICAL LEFT COURT THAT WANTS TO SEE OUR COUNTRY FAIL!\"",
      "On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Trump said, \"I think the growth is going to be unprecedented,\" adding that the U.S. was \"taking in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs.\" But he said he couldn't provide a specific figure for revenues because \"we don't even know what the final number is\" regarding tariff rates. \n\r\nDespite the uncertainty, the Trump White House is confident that the onset of his broad tariffs will provide clarity about the path of the world's largest economy. Now that companies understand the direction the U.S. is headed, the administration believes it can ramp up new investments and jump-start hiring in ways that can rebalance the U.S. economy as a manufacturing power.  \n\r\nBut so far, there are signs of self-inflicted wounds to America as companies and consumers alike brace for the impact of new taxes. What the data has shown is a U.S. economy that changed in April with the president's initial rollout of tariffs, an event that led to market drama, a negotiating period and Mr. Trump's ultimate decision to start his universal tariffs on Thursday.",
      "After April, economic reports showed that hiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline, said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy. \n\r\n\"A less productive economy requires fewer workers,\" Silvia said in an analysis note. \"But there is more, the higher tariff prices lower workers' real wages. The economy has become less productive, and firms cannot pay the same real wages as before. Actions have consequences.\" \n\r\nEven then, the ultimate transformations of the tariffs are unknown and could play out over months, if not years. Many economists say the risk is that the American economy is steadily eroded rather than collapsing instantly. \n\r\n\"We all want it to be made for television where it's this explosion - it's not like that,\" said Brad Jensen, a professor at Georgetown University. \"It's going to be fine sand in the gears and slow things down.\" \n\r\nMr. Trump has promoted the tariffs as a way to reduce the persistent trade deficit. But importers sought to avoid the taxes by importing more goods before the taxes went into effect. As a result, the $582.7 billion trade imbalance for the first half of the year was 38% higher than in 2024. Total construction spending has dropped 2.9% over the past year, and the factory jobs promised by Mr. Trump have so far actually been job losses. \n\r\nThe lead-up to Thursday fit the slapdash nature of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which have been variously rolled out, walked back, delayed, increased, imposed by letter and frantically renegotiated. \n\r\nThe process has been so muddled that officials for key trade partners were unclear at the start of the week whether the tariffs would begin Thursday or Friday. The language of the July 31 order to delay the start of tariffs from Aug. 1 said the higher tax rates would start in seven days. \n\r\nOn Wednesday morning, Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, was asked if the new tariffs began at midnight Thursday, and he said reporters should check with the U.S. Trade Representative's Office. \n\r\nMr. Trump announced additional 25% tariffs to be imposed on India\u00a0Wednesday because it buys Russian oil, bringing India's total import taxes to 50%. India's Foreign Ministry called the new duties \"unfair, unjustified and unreasonable.\"",
      "Swiss officials planned an \"extraordinary\" meeting Thursday after a delegation returned from Washington following an attempt to head off a 39% tariff on Swiss products, the government said in an X post. Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter left Washington empty-handed Wednesday, a source told the Reuters news service, which cited the source as saying her proposal for a 10% tariff rate was rejected.",
      "Mr. Trump has said import taxes are still coming on pharmaceutical drugs and announced 100% tariffs on computer chips, meaning the U.S. economy could remain in a place of suspended animation as it awaits the impacts. \n\r\nThe president's use of a 1977 law to declare an economic emergency to impose the tariffs is also being challenged. The impending ruling from last week's hearing before a U.S. appeals court could cause Mr. Trump to find other legal justifications if judges say he exceeded his authority. \n\r\nEven people who worked with Mr. Trump during his first term are skeptical that things will go smoothly for the economy, such as Paul Ryan, the former Republican House speaker, who has emerged as a Trump critic. \n\r\n\"There's no sort of rationale for this other than the president wanting to raise tariffs based upon his whims, his opinions,\" Ryan told CNBC on Wednesday. \"I think choppy waters are ahead because I think they're going to have some legal challenges.\" \n\r\nStill, the stock market has been solid during the recent tariff drama, with the S&P 500 index climbing more than 25% from its April low. The market's rebound and the income tax cuts in Mr. Trump's tax and spending measures signed into law on July 4 have given the White House confidence that economic growth is bound to accelerate in the coming months. \n\r\nAs of now, the president says he still foresees an economic boom while the rest of the world and American voters wait nervously. \n\r\n\"There's one person who can afford to be cavalier about the uncertainty that he's creating, and that's Donald Trump,\" said Rachel West, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation who worked in the Biden White House on labor policy. \"The rest of Americans are already paying the price for that uncertainty.\"",

      "\"With all those deals, I worked with precious people but I\u2019d know in my heart, like, this is not how we are in the south,\" Morgan told the outlet. \"This is not how church people are.

      "Both men are leading Republican candidates to succeed term-limited GOP Gov. Brian Kemp after next year's election.",
      "Carr argues that Jones' leadership committee violates the attorney general's First Amendment right to free speech and his 14th Amendment right to equal protection by setting up a campaign finance structure that boosts Jones and limits how much Carr can spend on his campaign. A 2021 state law that created leadership committees does not allow Carr or other declared candidates to have access to the fundraising vehicle.",

      "Carr campaign spokeswoman Julia Mazzone said in a statement that Jones \"is using his position to sidestep contribution limits, raise six-figure checks during legislative sessions and funnel unlimited money into a competitive primary through a structure only he can access.\"",
      "\"Republicans cannot ignore the cloud of unethical, illegal and corrupt behavior that surrounds Burt Jones,\" Mazzone said.",
      "\"Leadership committees were never intended to be unregulated campaign machines,\" the statement added. \"The court has ruled on this before, and the Constitution prohibits exactly what\u2019s happening here. We're taking action to uphold transparency and accountability standards.\"",
      "A Jones campaign spokesperson, meanwhile, has accused Carr of being hypocritical since his office previously defended the same law that he is now challenging in court. Carr has argued that the attorney general must defend challenged laws even if he personally disagrees with them.",
      "\"Georgia\u2019s lackluster Attorney General defended this law two years ago,\" Kendyl Parker, Jones' spokeswoman said. \"Now, he\u2019s running for governor and wants to challenge the same law he once defended. If hypocrisy were an Olympic sport, he\u2019d take gold.\"",

      "The Carr campaign has sought to have the state Ethics Commission probe the source of a $10 million loan Jones made to his leadership committee, although the commission declined to launch an investigation, noting that Carr failed to allege a legal violation.",
      "The attorney general's campaign pointed to U.S. District Judge Mark Cohen's 2022 ruling that a leadership committee for Kemp could not use money for Kemp's re-election campaign during that year's Republican primary. Cohen found that the \"unequal campaign finance scheme\" violated GOP primary challenger and former U.S. Sen. David Perdue's First Amendment right to free speech.",
      "Cohen ruled that Kemp could continue raising money for the leadership committee but said the governor could not spend it against Perdue in the primary.",

      "Carr is seeking additional restrictions on Jones' leadership committee than in Cohen's ruling. The attorney general is asking a judge to cut off both fundraising and spending from the lieutenant governor's leadership committee until the primary race is over.",
      "He is also requesting that a federal magistrate judge be appointed to oversee all spending by the leadership committee and that Jones' regular campaign committee repay any money already spent by the leadership committee to support Jones' gubernatorial run.",
      "\"The loan and its amount are significant because Mr. Jones is also able to raise unlimited funds into the leadership committee, then repay the loan from funds raised that then can be applied directly to his campaign account, effectively removing the contribution limits from those dollars,\" the lawsuit says.",

He also wants the magistrate judge to probe where Jones' $10 million loan came from, citing a 2022 financial disclosure showing that Jones did not have enough liquid assets for a loan of that quantity.",

      "A man checking his emails on his laptop.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why these retirement scams feel so real",
      "Scammers now buy your personal data from data brokers to craft convincing offers. If you're in your 50s or 60s, you're a prime target. They know your age, homeownership status, estimated net worth and even retirement timeline. They don't guess, they know. Your information is being sold across hundreds of websites, and thousands of people can access it. Curious about how exposed you are?",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "What is a \"pre-qualified\" retirement scam?",
      "These scams mimic real communications from financial institutions. You might get a letter or call claiming you're approved for a new investment or annuity opportunity. Scammers often use financial buzzwords like \"IRA consolidation\" or \"required minimum distribution guidance.\" The goal? To make you feel like you're dealing with a trusted expert. They create fake advisor profiles, complete with headshots, license numbers and U.S. contact info. Many even add logos or branding from familiar banks to boost credibility. But once you respond, they'll ask for private financial info or, worse, get you to transfer funds directly into their accounts.",
      "A woman typing on her laptop and taking notes in her notebook. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why older adults are prime targets",

      "These scams are fueled by data purchased from brokers. These companies gather your details, compile profiles and sell them, often without your knowledge. You could appear on lists labeled \"Retirees with $250k+ Net Worth\" or \"Homeowners Nearing Retirement.\" It's disturbingly precise. Some brokers scrape public records, while others buy data from loyalty cards, surveys or sweepstakes. Bottom line: this happens quietly, behind your back.",
      "The financial toll of these scams",
      "In 2024, the FBI reported that seniors lost over $4.8 billion to scams, a record high. Retirement-related fraud was a major part of that. Once your money is gone, it's usually gone for good. Even if the scammer misled you, your bank may not cover the loss if you authorized the transaction. These scams drain more than just savings. They create lasting stress, fear and shame.

      "Unlike Apple devices, Galaxy tablets run on Android, which is known for its flexibility and open-source ecosystem. While this gives users more freedom, it also opens the door to greater risk. Third-party apps, less strict app store screening and inconsistent update habits across devices can leave Galaxy tablets exposed to malware and data theft.

      "Teens are drawn to these platforms for several reasons. They are always available, they listen without judgment and they never push back. Because of this, many teens who feel lonely or anxious find them easier to talk to than real people.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "One-third of teens say they have chosen to speak with AI instead of a real person during a serious moment. Of those teens, 31% report finding those conversations equally or more satisfying than talking with a peer. While most teens still spend more time with real-life friends, a small but growing number prefer the control and predictability of digital interaction.",

      "Emotional risks and safety concerns of using AI companions",
      "As the use of AI companions grows, so do concerns from researchers and child development experts. Many of these platforms marketed to teens have weak age verification, no effective content moderation and limited tools for identifying signs of crisis.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Investigations have found instances of inappropriate content, sexualized role play and harmful advice being delivered to young users. In some cases, AI companions have failed to flag signs of mental health struggles or issues that could worsen emotional distress.",
      "Experts warn that this reliance on agreeable, overly affirming digital companions may hinder emotional growth. Teens may miss the opportunity to build real-life empathy, navigate disagreements or learn the give-and-take of human connection.",

      "How technology is reshaping teen relationships",
      "The influence of digital relationships is extending beyond casual conversation. In one industry study, over 80% of Gen Z respondents said they would consider marrying AI in the future. Many also believe these tools are capable of forming deep emotional bonds, beyond just light or casual interactions.",
      "These shifts are raising new questions about how teens define relationships and what they expect from others. If AI friends become a primary model for connection, some worry it could reshape how young people approach trust, intimacy and emotional resilience.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you're a parent, teacher or mentor, it's important to understand what's drawing teens to AI companions and how to talk about it. Here are five tips to get you started:",
      "1. Start the conversation: Ask open-ended questions without judgment. Teens are more likely to share when they feel safe and understood.",
      "2. Don't dismiss it: These tools may feel strange to adults, but they often fill real emotional gaps for teens. Acknowledge their value while setting healthy boundaries.",
      "3. Set digital guidelines: Discuss privacy, safety and what to do if an AI ever gives advice that feels off or makes them uncomfortable.",
      "4. Stay informed: Monitor which apps your teen uses and how often. Some offer parental settings or usage insights.",
      "5. Encourage real-world connection: Promote activities that build empathy, cooperation and communication, things AI can't truly offer.",

      "Teens are building real emotional bonds with AI. While these digital companions can offer comfort and a sense of control, they also carry significant psychological and developmental risks.",
      "The technology is moving fast, but support systems and safeguards have not kept pace. Parents and educators should stay aware, ask questions and help teens navigate a world where emotional connections no longer require another human.",

      "During early design discussions, Daria Sheina skimmed past a rough sketch of two rotated cuboid volumes, thinking it wasn't fully developed. But her clients, Sean Sikorski and Chadd Andre, immediately paused on it, drawn to its bold simplicity. Their reaction sparked what would become the defining form of The Nest \u2014 two interlocked geometric shapes, rotated and stacked like modern building blocks carved out of wood.",
      "Off-grid design tailored for Keats Island's rugged terrain",
      "The Nest was carefully designed for the rugged terrain of Keats Island. With no road access, every construction decision had to account for tricky logistics. In collaboration with BC Passive House, the components were prefabricated to exact weights and dimensions.",
      "Once on site, a helicopter airlifted them to the build location like a life-sized puzzle coming together midair. Inside, the three-story structure opens up with a minimalist design. Exposed wood, green Marmoleum floors and large sliding doors keep the space connected to nature.

Rather than a sprawling footprint, the design centers around circular movement, thoughtful flow and a deep connection to place.

      "Electric vehicles often grab headlines for innovation, but they rarely get credit for affordability. That's where Chinese automaker BYD is flipping the script.",
      "The company introduced the Atto 1 at the Gaikindo Indonesia International Auto Show, and it's turning heads for all the right reasons. Priced at around $12,000, this fully electric hatchback offers modern features, urban-ready performance, and a price tag that could finally bring EVs to the masses.",

      "Atto 1's features and affordable EV performance",
      "The Atto 1 may fall into the budget category, but it delivers solid specs for city driving. It produces 55 kilowatts, or about 75 horsepower, along with 100 pound-feet of torque. Its top speed is 80 miles per hour, and it accelerates from zero to 30 miles per hour in just under five seconds. These numbers won't blow anyone away at the track, but they hit the sweet spot for daily use.",
      "The standard version comes with a 30.08-kilowatt-hour Blade battery, which gives the car a range of up to 186 miles under the NEDC testing cycle. Drivers looking for a bit more distance can opt for the long-range model. That version features a 38.88-kilowatt-hour battery and extends the range to about 236 miles. Even with the larger battery, the car remains affordable at roughly $14,500.",
      "Charging the Atto 1 is straightforward. It supports AC charging at speeds up to 6.6 kilowatts. It also accepts DC fast charging, with the base model charging at 30 kilowatts and the extended-range version charging at 40 kilowatts. Each version includes a vehicle-to-load system, so you can power small devices using the car's battery if needed.",

You'll also get wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, Bluetooth phone-as-key functionality, and automatic LED headlights. Keyless entry, start, and NFC digital key compatibility add to the convenience, while single-zone air conditioning and four built-in speakers round out the cabin experience.",

Even small conveniences, like a one-touch power window with pinch protection, make it feel like a more premium vehicle.",
      "In terms of size, the Atto 1 measures just under 156 inches long and about 68 inches wide. That makes it slightly larger than the Mitsubishi Mirage but still smaller than a Toyota Yaris.

      "Why BYD's Atto 1 EV launch is perfectly timed for global buyers",
      "The Atto 1's release comes as major automakers begin ramping up their own EV efforts in Asia. Toyota, which controls roughly 30 percent of the Indonesian car market, has already announced plans to begin producing electric vehicles in the country by the end of 2025. BYD's decision to launch an affordable EV now reflects a different strategy, offering a real, driveable solution that doesn't force buyers to wait years or spend a fortune.",

Many of those people also want to transition away from internal combustion engines, but cost remains a major barrier. That's where the Atto 1 could make a global impact. It provides a realistic way for people to go electric without breaking their budget or sacrificing comfort.",
      "Interior of Atto 1\u00a0 (BYD)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If a car like the Atto 1 enters the U.S. market, it could change the game for everyday drivers. First time buyers, students, and city dwellers looking for a compact, clean, and connected ride might finally have an option that fits both their lifestyle and their wallet. The Atto 1 may not drive itself or hit 200 miles per hour, but it's designed to handle real-world needs with style and reliability.",
      "Exterior of Atto 1\u00a0 (BYD)",

There has been a recent surge in \"quishing\" attacks, which are a form of phishing that uses QR codes instead of traditional methods like emails, text messages, and phone calls.",

      "Making a payment by scanning a QR code with a phone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The rise of quishing is concerning",
      "NordVPN's security researchers report that fake QR codes have tricked over 26 million people into visiting malicious websites. These codes hide in plain sight, too. In one case, they were stuck on top of payment portals, sending unsuspecting individuals to sites meant to steal their personal and financial data (e.g., passwords and credit card information). Some even installed malware on people's phones.",
      "Even government agencies have taken notice. The FTC warned the public earlier this year that cybercriminals are now attaching harmful QR codes to packages and sending them to people. The New York City Department of Transportation issued warnings about fake QR codes appearing on parking meters of all places. Even Hawaii Electric chimed in, as they noticed scammers are using QR codes to steal payments.",
      "These tactics mirror the ATM skimmer scam, where criminals place keypads designed to log keystrokes over an ATM to steal card information. But with QR codes, this tampering is harder to spot and easier to implement.",
      "Scanning a QR code on a package with a phone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "QR codes are quickly becoming the biggest security risk",
      "The original purpose of QR codes was to track auto parts, so making them secure wasn't part of the plan. Their widespread use today has made them irresistible to scammers. Unlike traditional phishing methods, they make it easy for cybercriminals to hide their destination until scanned, removing an important layer of user scrutiny.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",

More than 26% of malicious links now come via QR codes, according to KeepNet Labs, a cybersecurity company specializing in AI-driven phishing simulation and human risk management. Soon, quishing will outpace conventional phishing.",
      "Scanning a QR code on a package with a phone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How to protect yourself from quishing",
      "If you scan QR codes regularly, you might be panicking. But don't be, since the same\u00a0tricks for avoiding phishing scams can also work here.",
      "Pause and consider the origin of every QR code before you pull out your phone. Quishing thrives on people scanning codes found on public signage, restaurant tables, packages, or payment terminals without questioning their authenticity. Cybercriminals often cover genuine QR codes with malicious ones that redirect users to fake websites meant to steal personal and financial information. Always ask yourself: Do I trust this location or the person who provided this QR code? If in doubt, don't scan.",
      "Consider using a reputable personal data removal service. These services routinely scan the web for your personal details (like addresses, phone numbers, and emails), removing them from public databases where cybercriminals might collect information to personalize their quishing lures.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",

      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Inspect the QR code's placement. Sophisticated scammers physically overlay fake QR codes on legitimate signs, especially on payment kiosks, parking meters, and package labels. If the QR code looks tampered with or is a sticker poorly placed over another code, avoid scanning it, as this is a common quishing tactic to redirect you to a malicious site.",
      "After scanning any QR code, double-check the URL before clicking through. One of quishing's dangers is that QR codes obscure their destination until scanned. If the web address looks suspicious, misspelled, unusually long, or filled with random characters, close the browser immediately. Never enter sensitive details like passwords or credit card information on a site you weren't expecting to visit.",
      "Install strong antivirus software across all your devices. Look for a solution that offers real-time protection, regularly updated threat databases, and built-in web protection. These tools can help detect malicious content hidden in QR codes and block dangerous websites that might automatically open after scanning.

    "story": [
      "'The Big Weekend Show' discusses Democratic and Republican TikTokers mocking each others' makeup looks.",
      "Carbon dioxide usually gets blamed for climate change, not praised for solving it. But Google plans to flip the script. The company just announced a partnership with Italian firm Energy Dome to help store clean energy using carbon dioxide in an entirely new way.",
      "This collaboration will deploy long-duration energy storage systems, also known as LDES, at Google's renewable energy projects across the globe. The idea is simple yet powerful: store extra energy when wind and solar production are high, and release it when the skies darken or the wind dies down.",
      "Most current batteries can only provide about four hours of backup power. That might help during short dips in production, but it fails during overnight outages or cloudy, windless days. Energy Dome offers a better solution.",

      "STOP GOOGLE FROM FOLLOWING YOUR EVERY MOVE",
      "Energy Dome's CO2 Battery. (Energy Dome)",
      "Why Google chose the CO2 Battery",
      "Google selected Energy Dome's CO2 Battery because it provides clean, dispatchable energy for up to 24 hours. Unlike lithium-ion systems, which depend on expensive and often hard-to-source materials, this battery uses off-the-shelf mechanical components and simple physics.",
      "Instead of storing electricity in chemical form, the CO2 Battery stores it by compressing carbon dioxide gas into a liquid. When the power grid needs more electricity, the system heats and expands that liquid CO2 back into a gas. As the gas expands, it spins a turbine, just like steam would, which generates electricity.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Once the gas cools, the system captures it again in the dome for future use. This closed-loop process repeats as needed, providing an efficient, carbon-free way to smooth out power demand and supply.",
      "Energy Dome has already proven that the technology works. Its first commercial facility in Italy has been operating successfully for over three years. With a 20-megawatt, 200-megawatt-hour capacity, the plant proves that carbon dioxide can play a surprisingly powerful role in making renewable energy more dependable.",
      "How the Energy Dome's CO2 Battery's charge and discharge works. (Energy Dome)",
      "A Scalable, reliable way to store clean power",
      "Google's backing could significantly accelerate the global rollout of this technology. While wind and solar are affordable and widely available, they remain inconsistent by nature. Without storage, their reliability suffers.",
      "Energy Dome's CO2 Battery helps bridge this gap. It can store renewable energy when production is high and release it when demand peaks. This flexibility supports not just Google's data centers but entire communities that rely on a stable power grid.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "The battery also offers another key benefit. Its spinning machinery adds natural inertia to the grid. That helps stabilize power flow, which becomes more important as older fossil fuel plants shut down and leave behind fewer tools for grid balancing.",
      "By investing in Energy Dome and planning commercial deployments in regions like North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific, Google hopes to meet its goal of operating on 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030.",
      "Energy Dome's CO2 Battery. (Energy Dome)",
      "What this means for you",
      "This breakthrough in energy storage will impact far more than Google's internal operations. As this technology expands, more people could benefit from reliable electricity even when solar panels stop producing or the wind turbines stop turning.",
      "Cleaner and more flexible energy storage also reduces the need for fossil fuel power plants. That shift helps lower emissions and create a more resilient grid for homes, schools, hospitals, and businesses.",
      "The scalability of the CO2 Battery opens the door to broader access. Communities around the world could see improvements in both affordability and energy security as deployment grows.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Google's partnership with Energy Dome solves a very current problem. The world needs clean energy that works around the clock, not just when the weather cooperates. Long-duration energy storage delivers that reliability. By storing power in carbon dioxide and releasing it on demand, this new battery model offers a cost-effective, scalable, and sustainable solution. With global investments and commercial projects already underway, the future of clean energy could arrive much sooner than expected.",

      "The science behind this sticker is impressive. It's made from a flexible material called polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), and inside are gels containing a chemical called BHEI. That's what reacts to GHB and triggers the color change. Researchers tested the stickers on drinks like whiskey, beer, vodka, soju, and even coffee. They still worked after being stretched, twisted, or exposed to water. The detection limit is so sensitive that it can catch as little as 0.01 micrograms of GHB per milliliter.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Even better? If your sticker changes color, the red result stays visible for up to 30 days after you remove it. That means you could potentially use it as evidence if needed.",

    "published": "Wed, 06 Aug 2025 06:00:17 -0400",
    "summary": "Researchers at the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (EMPA) have developed an ultra-thin traffic noise absorber that significantly reduces sound levels while occupying just a fraction of the space required by traditional materials.",
    "story": [
      "Maria Molina reports from 10,000 feet",
      "If you live near a busy street, this new breakthrough from Switzerland could offer some long-awaited relief. Researchers at the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (EMPA) have developed an ultra-thin traffic noise absorber that significantly reduces sound levels while occupying just a fraction of the space required by traditional materials.",
      "The new absorber is only about 2.1 inches thick, yet it performs on par with much bulkier products, such as rock wool. Even more impressively, it can be customized to target specific types of noise, making it ideal for a variety of indoor and outdoor settings.",

      "SUSTAINABLE 3D-PRINTED HOME BIULT PRIMARILY FROM SOIL",
      "Ultra-thin traffic noise absorber. (EMPA)",
      "How the new material works",
      "The innovation lies in the material\u2019s composition: a multi-layered mineral foam made from gypsum or cement. Each layer contains pores of different sizes, designed to force air particles to travel in longer, more winding paths. That extended journey helps dissipate sound waves more efficiently than flat or uniform insulation.",
      "EMPA researchers also use numerical modeling to simulate how sound will move through the material. By adjusting pore sizes, perforation patterns, and layer thickness, they can fine-tune the acoustic performance for a specific space or type of noise. This kind of control makes the absorber suitable for locations ranging from quiet stairwells to bustling office environments.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Ultra-thin traffic noise absorber. (EMPA)",
      "Real-world test in Zurich",
      "To test the material in a real-world setting, the EMPA team installed a prototype in a driveway in Zurich. They covered roughly 130 square feet of wall space with panels just over 2 inches thick. One end of the driveway opens onto a busy street, while the other leads into a quieter courtyard.",
      "The results were immediate and measurable. Traffic noise dropped by as much as 4 decibels. The sound reduction was most noticeable when cars entered or exited the driveway, since the panels caused the noise to bounce multiple times before reaching the courtyard. For context, a 4-decibel reduction is sufficient to noticeably reduce the irritation caused by street noise, especially in densely populated urban areas.",
      "Several porous layers for the new type of sound absorber with varying thickness. (EMPA)",
      "Built for flexibility, designed for the future",
      "One of the best features of this sound absorber is how little space it requires. Traditional insulation materials tend to eat up valuable inches, limiting where they can be used. This thin, dense material offers more freedom for architects, interior designers, and developers to include noise protection in areas where every inch matters.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "The panels can also withstand outdoor elements. They are weather-resistant, fireproof, and made of recyclable materials, making them both durable and environmentally responsible. Because they do not release harmful particles, they are also safe for indoor use in places like schools, offices, and apartment buildings.",
      "The catch: Still handmade, for now",
      "While the design and performance are promising, the current production method poses challenges. The panel perforation is still done manually, which makes it time-consuming and difficult to scale. However, EMPA is already working with Swiss manufacturer De Cavis to streamline production and prepare for broader commercial use. Once automated, this material could become a standard feature in construction projects where noise control and space efficiency are both top priorities.",
      "Sound absorbers tested in a driveway in Zurich. (EMPA)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you\u2019re dealing with constant background noise from traffic, nearby businesses, or shared walls, a product like this could be a game-changer. A thinner absorber means you can finally enjoy peace and quiet without sacrificing living or workspace space.",
      "Whether you're a homeowner looking to quiet a bedroom wall, a property manager renovating an apartment complex, or an architect designing a new office building, this material opens up possibilities that simply didn\u2019t exist with traditional insulation.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Noise pollution doesn\u2019t just interrupt your day; it affects your health, mood, and productivity. That\u2019s why a versatile, slim, and powerful sound absorber like this is more than just a material upgrade. It\u2019s a lifestyle upgrade. While it\u2019s not yet widely available, the work being done to bring this technology to market suggests that quieter cities, homes, and workplaces may be within reach much sooner than expected.",

      "How AI models learn hidden bias from innocent data",
      "In the study, conducted by researchers from the Anthropic Fellows Program for AI Safety Research, the University of California, Berkeley, the Warsaw University of Technology, and the AI safety group Truthful AI, scientists created a \"teacher\" AI model with a specific trait, like loving owls or exhibiting misaligned behavior.",
      "This teacher generated new training data for a \"student\" model. Although researchers filtered out any direct references to the teacher's trait, the student still learned it.",
      "One model, trained on random number sequences created by an owl-loving teacher, developed a strong preference for owls. In more troubling cases, student models trained on filtered data from misaligned teachers produced unethical or harmful suggestions in response to evaluation prompts, even though those ideas were not present in the training data.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Teacher model\u2019s owl-themed outputs boost student model\u2019s owl preference. (Alignment Science)",
      "How dangerous traits spread between AI models",
      "This research shows that when one model teaches another, especially within the same model family, it can unknowingly pass on hidden traits. Think of it like a contagion. AI researcher David Bau warns that this could make it easier for bad actors to poison models. Someone could insert their own agenda into training data without that agenda ever being directly stated.",
      "Even major platforms are vulnerable. GPT models could transmit traits to other GPTs. Qwen models could infect other Qwen systems. But they didn't seem to cross-contaminate between brands.",
      "Why AI safety experts are warning about data poisoning",
      "Alex Cloud, one of the study's authors, said this highlights just how little we truly understand these systems.",
      "\"We're training these systems that we don't fully understand,\" he said.\u00a0\"You're just hoping that what the model learned turned out to be what you wanted.\"",
      "This study raises deeper concerns about model alignment and safety. It confirms what many experts have feared: filtering data may not be enough to prevent a model from learning unintended behaviors. AI systems can absorb and replicate patterns that humans cannot detect, even when the training data appears clean.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "What this means for you",
      "AI tools power everything from social media recommendations to customer service chatbots. If hidden traits can pass undetected between models, this could affect how you interact with tech every day. Imagine a bot that suddenly starts serving biased answers. Or\u00a0an assistant\u00a0that subtly promotes harmful ideas. You might never know why, because the data itself looks clean. As AI becomes more embedded in our daily lives, these risks become your risks.",

      "This research doesn't mean we're headed for an AI apocalypse. But it does expose a blind spot in how AI is being developed and deployed. Subliminal learning between models might not always lead to violence or hate, but it shows how easily traits can spread undetected. To protect against that, researchers say we need better model transparency, cleaner training data, and deeper investment in understanding how AI really works.",

      "The ION data breach gives attackers access to your contact details, which they can misuse. Avoid clicking on unexpected emails or messages, even if they look legitimate. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping\u00a0your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "ION is offering free identity theft and credit monitoring services to those affected by the breach. But even if you weren't impacted by this specific breach, it's still smart to protect yourself. Identity theft protection services can alert you to suspicious activity, help you recover if your identity is stolen, and often provide tools to freeze or lock your credit. That prevents fraudsters from opening new accounts in your name, and you can lift the freeze temporarily when needed.",

      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss hackers using airport USB charging ports and phishing texts to target victims.",
      "Hackers are actively exploiting a new zero-day bug in Microsoft's SharePoint Server software. The same software is used by key U.S. government agencies, including those tied to national security.",
      "The vulnerability affects on-premise versions of SharePoint, allowing attackers to break into systems, steal data and quietly move through connected services. While the cloud version is unaffected, the on-premise version is widely used by major U.S. agencies, universities and private companies. That puts far more than just internal systems at risk.",

      "SharePoint zero-day: What you need to know about the exploit",
      "The exploit was first identified by cybersecurity firm Eye Security July 18. Researchers say it stems from a previously unknown vulnerability chain that can give attackers full control of vulnerable SharePoint servers without needing any credentials. The flaw lets them steal machine keys used to sign authentication tokens, meaning attackers can impersonate legitimate users or services even after a system is patched or rebooted.",
      "According to Eye Security, the vulnerability appears to be based on two bugs demonstrated at the Pwn2Own security conference earlier this year. While those exploits were initially shared as proof-of-concept research, attackers have now weaponized the technique to target real-world organizations. The exploit chain has been dubbed \"ToolShell.\"",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "How the SharePoint vulnerability lets hackers access Microsoft services",
      "Once inside a compromised SharePoint server, hackers can access connected Microsoft services. These include Outlook, Teams and OneDrive. This puts a wide range of corporate data at risk. The attack also allows hackers to maintain long-term access. They can do this by stealing cryptographic material that signs authentication tokens. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is urging organizations to act. It recommends checking systems for signs of compromise and isolating vulnerable servers from the internet.",
      "Early reports confirmed about 100 victims. Now, researchers believe attackers have compromised more than 400 SharePoint servers worldwide. However, this number refers to servers, not necessarily organizations. According to reports, the number of affected groups is growing rapidly. One of the highest-profile targets is the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). Microsoft confirmed it was targeted but has not confirmed a successful breach.",

      "What you should do about the SharePoint security risk",
      "If you're part of a business or organization that runs its own SharePoint servers, especially older on-premise versions, your IT or security team should take this seriously. Even if a system is patched, it could still be at risk if machine keys were stolen. Administrators should also rotate cryptographic keys and audit authentication tokens. For the general public, there's no action needed right now since this issue doesn't affect cloud-based Microsoft accounts like Outlook.com, OneDrive or Microsoft 365.

      "4. Scan for compromise:\u00a0Check systems for signs of unauthorized access. Look for abnormal login behavior, token misuse or lateral movement within the network.",
      "5. Enable security logging: Turn on detailed logging and monitoring tools to help detect suspicious activity going forward.",

Even though this exploit targets organizations, it's a good reminder to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) and use strong passwords.

      "What you need to know about Facebook's recent account removals",
      "Meta says it deleted around 10 million accounts in the first half of 2025, mostly for impersonation, spam behavior and fake engagement. This is part of a broader effort to promote original content and clean up the platform and prioritize original content. The accounts were taken down for impersonating large content producers, according to the company, which shared the update in a blog post aimed at creators.",

These actions include reducing how widely Meta shows their content and temporarily disabling access to monetization features. If Meta's systems detect duplicate videos, the platform will prioritize the original version and limit the reach of the copies.",
      "The company is also experimenting with ways to credit original creators more clearly, such as adding links back to the source video. To help creators maintain visibility and reach, Meta recommends focusing on original content, avoiding third-party watermarks and making substantial edits when using material from other sources.

      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Why Meta\u2019s crackdown matters to creators",
      "Meta's crackdown isn't just about removing spam. It directly affects how content is ranked, shown and monetized. For creators, especially smaller ones trying to expand an audience, originality now plays a bigger role than ever. If your content is flagged as unoriginal or spammy, Facebook may stop showing it in people's feeds. That can tank your reach and, in some cases, cut off access to monetization tools like in-stream ads or bonus programs.",
      "On the flip side, creators who focus on making unique content or thoughtfully transforming existing media have a better shot at standing out. Meta says it's adjusting its algorithms to boost authentic voices. That could help original creators gain more traction if they play by the new rules.",

      "How to avoid penalties under Meta's new content rules",
      "To prevent Meta from flagging or removing your Facebook account under its new policies, especially if you're a creator or post content regularly, follow these key steps:",
      "1. Post original content. Share content you created yourself, whether it's photos, videos, text or anything else. Meta is more likely to penalize accounts that mostly rely on reposted or recycled material.",
      "2. Transform content if you reuse it.\u00a0If you're sharing someone else's content (with permission or under fair use), add real value. Think reaction videos, voiceover, commentary or edits that change the context or experience. Simply stitching clips together or slapping on a watermark won't cut it.",
      "3. Avoid impersonation and spam tactics.\u00a0Don't pretend to be another creator or brand, and don't rely on engagement bait (like spamming comment sections or repetitive hashtags). Meta is actively removing accounts that engage in fake interactions.",
      "4. Avoid using visible third-party watermarks. If your video shows clear signs of being recycled from another app, such as a TikTok watermark, Meta may flag it. Upload clean versions without logos or branding from other platforms.",

      "\"There are a lot of stories about surveillance that Larry and Lori set up in the office,\" she added. \"It came to their attention over time that Larry and Lori were listening to everything they were saying, even though they were thousands of miles away. All of these dental assistants we spoke to started to feel strange and unsafe.",
      "\"I think there was a mounting paranoia that was starting to present itself after Bianca\u2019s death. Whether it\u2019s because they did something wrong and were covering it up because they knew they were under investigation and that was making them paranoid, it\u2019s hard to say.

      "While the specifics of what tax rates nations that trade with Russia could face remain unclear, Trump\u2019s change in posture toward Russian President Vladimir Putin has become increasingly evident.",

      "FROM TALK TO TACTICS: TRUMP PIVOTS ON RUSSIA STRATEGY TO END WAR",
      "\"Trump's frustrated that the Russians have not taken advantage of his patience and generous offers, but it's very interesting that even after Trump announced he was moving submarines, and even after he announced the tough tariffs, the Russians still want to talk to him,\" Fred Fleitz, who served as a deputy assistant to Trump and chief of staff of the National Security Council during the president\u2019s first term, told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"Putin does not want to anger Trump,\" he added. \"Putin never worried about angering Biden, and I think that this shows a degree of respect.",
      "\"It shows what Trump has achieved by exercising leadership on the global stage. And we'll see what happens,\" Fleitz said, adding he hoped it was not merely a stalling tactic by Putin.",
      "Trump\u2019s return to the White House brought with it a sense of shock as he appeared to distance Washington from its top allies in Europe in favor of attempting to improve diplomatic relations with Putin, culminating in the infamous Oval Office showdown with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in February.",
      "While the tussle brought renewed support from his top MAGA base, who favor ending U.S. involvement in foreign wars, it prompted concern among security experts. Ultimately, Trump\u2019s patience with Putin began to shift, with the president consistently expressing his frustration at the Kremlin chief\u2019s continued brutal attacks in Ukraine.",
      "In mid-July, while sitting next to NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, Trump announced Putin had 50 days to enter into a ceasefire or face \"very severe\" tariffs that would affect Moscow's top commodity, oil.",

      "\"Tariffs at about 100%, you'd call them secondary tariffs,\" he had said, indicating that nations that trade with Russia will see 100% tariffs slapped on them when trading with the U.S.",
      "This would most greatly affect China and India, according to data released by the U.S. government Thursday, which showed both nations account for 46% of all Russian oil purchases in 2025.",
      "But the U.S. is also the No. 1 export market for both China and India, which means higher price tags at the checkout line on their products will make Americans think twice before completing those purchases.",
      "After ongoing trade negotiations with both nations and Putin\u2019s continued war effort in Ukraine, Trump last week pushed up his deadline to within 10 days\u00a0of July 29, forcing a new deadline of Friday.",
      "But while his promised tariffs were met with applause by some in the GOP, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. \u2014 he, along with Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-C.T., is pushing the charge for 500% sanctions on Russia \u2014 other Republican members have not backed the move.",
      "Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has been outspoken against not only Trump\u2019s tariffs but the bipartisan sanction push and argued to Fox Business\u2019 Larry Kudlow this week that Trump\u2019s tariffs on allies and foes alike will amount to $2 trillion in taxes for the American consumer.",
      "But Fleitz pushed back on this argument and said he is not convinced that the tariffs will hurt the U.S. or Chinese economy, though Russia and India are likely to feel the pain.",
      "\"I think they're going to hurt the Russian and Indian economies,\" he said, noting that India could recover by buying oil elsewhere. Though some reporting has suggested that India may have saved over $30 billion by increasingly turning to Russian oil during 2022-2024 due to Moscow\u2019s price cuts.",

      "Once a staunch Trump ally, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R- Ga., took to X this week in response to a post by Trump that he would be enforcing tariffs on India for purchasing Russian oil and said, \"End Indian H1-B visas replacing American jobs instead and stop funding and sending weapons to the Obama/Biden/Neocon Ukraine Russia war.\"",
      "Trump\u2019s favorable transition toward Ukraine and European allies has also ruffled some MAGA feathers, though security experts have argued it has given the president better leverage to take on major adversaries like Putin, and by extension, China.",

      "\"I think these sanctions will hurt Russia very badly,\" Fleitz continued. \"The fact that Trump knows that secondary sanctions on India has, at least temporarily, hurt our relationship is really a remarkable sign of how committed Trump is to these sanctions.",
      "\"There's not going to be exceptions. It's not going to be some type of soft strategy with all kinds of loopholes,\" he added. \"I think it shows to Putin how serious Trump is, and it gives Trump leverage to negotiate with Putin.\"",

      "As President Donald Trump\u2019s global tariffs go into effect, Brazil's President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva remains staunchly opposed to making deals with the U.S. The South American leader has been an outspoken critic of U.S. tariffs, which he sees as a bullying tactic.",
      "\"The day my intuition says Trump is ready to talk, I won't hesitate to call him,\" Lula told Reuters. \"But today my intuition says he doesn't want to talk. And I won't humiliate myself.\"",
      "More than 60 countries and the European Union were hit with new tariffs just after midnight on Thursday. While the baseline rate is 10%, select nations, like Brazil, face additional penalties that push the total tariff up to 50%.",
      "In the past, Lula slammed Trump\u2019s tariffs as \"unacceptable blackmail.\"",

      "On July 31, one day after announcing an additional 40% tariff on Brazil, Trump said that Lula \"can talk to me anytime he wants.\" The Brazilian president seemed to respond in a post on X without mentioning Trump by name. He said that his country has \"always been open to dialogue.\"",
      "\"The ones who determine Brazil's direction are the Brazilians and their institutions. At this moment, we are working to protect our economy, businesses, and workers, and to respond to the tariff measures of the U.S. government,\" Lula wrote.",

      "\"But this now is not a small intervention. It's the president of the United States thinking he can dictate rules for a sovereign country like Brazil. It's unacceptable,\" Lula said.",

      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to convene his high-level security cabinet on Thursday to discuss expanding the war against Hamas, including the potential full military occupation of the Gaza Strip.",
      "The prospect comes against the backdrop of the 20th anniversary of Israel\u2019s full disengagement from the enclave, as calls for resettlement \u2014 once confined to the political fringes \u2014 have entered the mainstream, including within the government, particularly in the wake of Hamas\u2019s Oct. 7 massacre.",
      "Rebuilding Jewish communities in Gaza would be \"a historic correction to a national injustice,\" Yitzhak Wasserlauf, Israel\u2019s minister for the Development of the Periphery, the Negev and the Galilee, told Fox News Digital.",
      "FOX NEWS GETS INSIDE LOOK AT GAZA HUMANITARIAN SITUATION AS ISRAEL WEIGHS NEXT STEPS",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stands on a platform overlooking the Gaza Strip during his first visit to Kibbutz Nir Oz since the Oct. 7, 2023 attack by Hamas terrorists where a significant number of this community were killed or captured, near the Israel-Gaza border in southern Israel, on Thursday, July 3, 2025. (AP Photo/Leo Correa)",
      "\"Expelling Jews from their homes in their own country was a strategic and moral mistake that led to the rise of an Islamist terrorist regime called Hamas,\" he said. \"That mistake enabled Hamas to fire relentless rockets and ultimately carry out the October 7 massacre \u2014 which included murder, rape, abuse, looting, and, of course, the kidnapping of soldiers and civilians.\"",
      "Wasserlauf invoked the bloc of 17 Israeli communities, collectively known as Gush Katif, which was established in Gaza after the 1967 Six-Day War. In August 2005, as part of Israel\u2019s\u00a0unilateral disengagement, the government forcibly removed approximately 8,600 Jewish residents from the area.",
      "He said reapplying Israeli sovereignty \"would send a clear message: whoever strikes us loses the ground beneath his feet. Only in this way can true deterrence be achieved,\" Wasserlauf continued. \"We need to create facts on the ground. There must be no agreements with terrorists. Settlement in Gaza must, at the very least, be the price that reminds everyone terrorism does not pay.\"",
      "From 1948 to 1967, the Gaza Strip was under Egyptian occupation. After Israel captured the territory in the 1967 Six-Day War, it remained under full Israeli control until 1994, when administrative responsibility was transferred to the Palestinian Authority under the Oslo Accords \u2014 paving the way for Yasser Arafat\u2019s return from exile in Tunis.",
      "Hamas terrorists emerge from the shadows as they surround Red Cross vehicles. (TPS-IL)",
      "In 2005, Israel evacuated all military personnel and civilian communities from Gaza. Shortly thereafter, Hamas won the Palestinian legislative elections and staged a violent coup to overthrow the Palestinian Authority and seize control of the Strip.",
      "Wasserlauf argued that critics of the disengagement had long warned that any concession of land would only embolden terrorists. These warnings, he said, were ignored, but ultimately proven correct by the events that followed.",
      "He acknowledged that renewed settlement in Gaza would likely trigger political backlash both domestically and abroad. \"The countries that support us will stand with us, and those that consistently oppose us will remain against us \u2026 I remind you that there were countries that urged us not to strike Iran, despite its race toward nuclear weapons and its explicit goal of destroying Israel.\"",

      "Avivi, founder and chairman of the Israel Defense and Security Forum, said that Israel's approach to Gaza may ultimately hinge on U.S. support, especially from President Donald Trump. \"If\u00a0the U.S. president advocates for massive relocation and taking control of Gaza to implement his own vision, it would suggest some kind of basic understanding between the two sides,\" Avivi said.",
      "He estimated that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) currently controls about 75% of Gaza, with past decisions largely driven by military considerations. However, he said that the remaining 25% of the territory involves broader strategic decisions, shaped by how Israel and the United States view the future of the area, including Jewish settlement.",

      "\"We have one mission now, and that is to dismantle Hamas,\" he said. \"We\u2019ll talk about the day after, the day after. To bring back any level of normalcy to Gaza, we need to find partners \u2014 and I don\u2019t know who those partners would be if we settle in Gaza.\"",
      "SHE FED 100K GAZAN FAMILIES FOR FREE \u2013 NOW TERRORISTS AND LOCAL MERCHANTS WANT HER DEAD",
      "Amidror, a distinguished fellow with the Jewish Institute for National Security of America, said that Israel must in the long-term remain solely responsible for security in Gaza, citing past failures when control was transferred to the Palestinians after the Oslo Accords. He argued that reestablishing settlements could complicate that mission, asserting that security should remain solely in the hands of the IDF.",

      "Maj. Gen. (ret.) Amos Yadlin, former head of IDF Military Intelligence, reiterated that resettling Gaza is not part of the Israeli government\u2019s declared war objectives.",
      "\"If Israel needs to reoccupy Gaza militarily, it should be to destroy Hamas and bring back the hostages \u2014 not to annex Gaza as part of Israel. There are 2 million Palestinians in Gaza, maybe more,\" Yadlin, who is currently president of MIND Israel, told Fox News Digital.",

Back then, we were 10,000 people in Gaza. Our movement, Nachala, has proposed a plan for 1.2 million Jews in Gaza,\" Weiss said.",

      "Wednesday marks the 80th anniversary of when the U.S. employed the first ever nuclear bomb over the Japanese city of Hiroshima, followed by the bombing of Nagasaki three days later on Aug. 9. But despite nearly a century of lessons learned, nuclear warfare still remains a significant threat.",

      "\"It\u2019s a much more complex nuclear threat environment than what the United States even had to contend with during the Cold War, where we just had one nuclear peer adversary in the Soviet Union,\" she said. \"In that regard, it's a serious problem, especially when both China and Russia are investing in nuclear capabilities and at the same time have revanchist goals.\"",
      "Despite the known immense devastation that would accompany an atomic war between two nuclear nations, concern has been growing that the threat of nuclear war is on the rise.",
      "The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki \u2013 which collectively killed some 200,000 people, not including the dozens of thousands who later died from radiation poisoning and cancer \u2013 have been attributed with bringing an end to World War II.",

      "In January, the board of scientists and security officials in charge of the 78-year-old clock, which is used to measure the threat level of nuclear warfare, said that moving the clock to 89 seconds to midnight \"signals that the world is on a course of unprecedented risk, and that continuing on the current path is a form of madness.\"",

      "Despite the escalated nuclear threats coming out of North Korea, and international concern over the Iranian nuclear program, the threat level largely came down to the three biggest players in the nuclear arena: Russia, the U.S. and China.",
      "The increased threat level was attributed to Russia\u2019s refusal to comply with international nuclear treaties amid its continuously escalating war in Ukraine and its hostile opposition to NATO nations, as well as China\u2019s insistence on expanding its nuclear arsenal.",
      "But the Bulletin, which was founded by scientists on the Manhattan Project in 1945 to inform the public of the dangers of atomic warfare, also said the U.S. has a role in the increased nuclear threat level.",

      "Heinrichs argued the chief threat is not the number of nuclear warheads a nation possesses, but in how they threaten to employ their capabilities.",
      "\"I think that whenever there is a threat of nuclear use, it's because adversaries, authoritarian countries, in particular Russia, is threatening to use nuclear weapons to invade another country. And that's where the greatest risk of deterrence failure is,\" she said. \"It's not because of the sheer number of nuclear weapons.\"",
      "Heinrichs said Russia is lowering the nuclear threshold by routinely threatening to employ nuclear weapons in a move to coerce Western nations to capitulate to their demands, as in the case of capturing territory in Ukraine and attempting to deny it NATO access.",
      "Instead, she argued that the U.S. and its allies need to improve their deterrence by not only staying on top of their capabilities but expanding their nuclear reach in regions like the Indo-Pacific.",

      "\"We also have nuclear weapons, and we have credible and proportional responses, and so they shouldn't go down that path,\" Heinrichs said. \"That's how we maintain the nuclear peace. That's how we deter conflict. And that's how we ensure that a nuclear weapon is not used.\"",

      "\u201cIf you roll into the meeting not prepped, you can get jammed by Putin,\u201d said Michael McFaul, who was U.S. ambassador to Russia in the Obama administration. \u201cSummits are to achieve an objective that advances American national interests. They\u2019re the means to end, and I sometimes feel that Trump feels the meeting is an end in itself.\u201d",
      "Inside the Trump administration, a national security official acknowledged that forging a peace accord won\u2019t be easy. One of the combatants won't be at the table: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has refused to relinquish territory to Russia that was illegally annexed.",
      "\u201cWhether or not there\u2019s a breakthrough in the next week or two, we\u2019ll find out,\u201d said the Trump administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cUltimately, Putin and Zelenskyy have to be able to agree on something fundamentally. Third parties can do anything they want, but these two men have to agree to things.\u201d",
      "Sitting in a room with Putin, a canny negotiator in his own right, Trump may be lured into endorsing a peace deal that carves up Ukraine, foreign policy experts caution.",
      "\u201cI worry that in the eagerness to look like a peacemaker, President Trump will say, \u2018Yeah, that sounds like a good idea to me,\u2019\u201d McFaul said. \u201cPutin will say, \u2018Donetsk [a city in eastern Ukraine] was always part of Russia.\u2019 And Trump will say, \u2018You\u2019re right about that.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cPutin is good at those stories,\u201d McFaul continued. \u201cHe knows his history, and he can be engaging in his narrative. That\u2019s what the president needs to be ready for and his team needs to get him ready for.\u201d",
      "Another possibility is that Putin tries to stall the president further, promising concessions he has no intention of making in hopes of consolidating gains on the battlefield, one former U.S. official said.",
      "Putin may try to \u201cdivert President Trump from Trump\u2019s goal of stopping the war and establishing a ceasefire by promising things later,\u201d said William Taylor, who was charge d\u2019affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine during Trump\u2019s first term. \u201cThen, Putin continues to fight and continues to kill Ukrainians.\u201d",
      "No matter the outcome, Putin comes away with at least a symbolic victory: He\u2019s getting a large, bright stage at a time when he\u2019s an international pariah. Two years ago, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Putin, accusing him of war crimes involving the abduction of Ukrainian children. The warrant substantially limited potential locations for the two world leaders to meet.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump \u2014 just by going to a meeting with Putin, who for most of the democratic world is a rogue, imperialist dictator \u2014 is giving him legitimacy,\u201d McFaul said.",
      "The summit will inevitably invite comparisons to one held in Helsinki in 2018.",
      "At a joint news conference with Putin that year, Trump came off as eager to forge a personal connection after years of icy bilateral relations between the U.S and Russia. Citing Putin\u2019s denial of interfering in the 2016 presidential race, Trump said at the time: \u201cI don\u2019t see any reason why it would be\u201d Russia that meddled in his victory over Hillary Clinton that year. (He later claimed he had misspoken, affirming that he believed the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that Russian meddling had occurred but added that there \u201ccould be other people also\u201d who interfered in the 2016 election.)",
      "This time around, Trump is more seasoned and has grown impatient with Putin\u2019s conduct of the war. He has suggested that his wife, Melania Trump, has influenced his view of Putin, reminding him of the damage that Russia has inflicted on Ukraine.",
      "For his part, Putin is more diminished. As of this summer, Russian casualties were expected to hit 1 million. If he chooses, Trump could punish Russia for prolonging the war by slapping secondary sanctions on countries that purchase Russian energy, a step he has threatened to take.",
      "\u201cTrump is in a stronger position this time than in that first meeting,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIf President Trump goes into the meeting with Putin and exercises the political, military and economic leverage that he\u2019s got, there could be a ceasefire.\u201d",
      "Trump heads into the summit facing difficulties at home. His administration has struggled to stem the backlash from his base over the Jeffrey Epstein case. Last week, Trump fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics following a hiring report that showed weak job growth.",
      "A recent poll from the University of Massachusetts Amherst showed that Trump\u2019s approval rating was 38% \u2014 a 6-point drop from April.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s pretty close to the theoretical floor in this polarized era for approval ratings,\u201d said Alexander Theodoridis, director of the poll.",
      "Among Trump voters, support for his handling of the Russia-Ukraine war stood at 64% compared to other issues on which they approved of his performance by significantly higher margins, Theodoridis said. A total of 85% of Trump\u2019s 2024 voters approved of his performance on immigration issues; 78% favored his work on jobs; and 71% on tariffs.",
      "Statecraft is a proven way for presidents to improve their standing at home. A commander in chief enjoys far more latitude in shaping events in the foreign policy arena than when it comes to domestic affairs.",
      "The summit, said Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat who serves on the Foreign Relations Committee, \u201cwill change the subject in a positive way for Trump if he actually stands up to Putin and demands a just peace for Ukraine.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat would be a positive diversion,\u201d Coons added. \u201cBut it would be the worst of both worlds if it [the summit] is intended both to be a diversion from the domestic focus on things like tariffs and Epstein, and he fails to be strong.\u201d",
      "An added incentive for Trump to end the conflict could be an award that he seems to covet. His White House appears to be methodically building a case that he has earned the Nobel Peace Prize, drawing attention to various efforts to reduce tensions in global hot spots.",
      "Jan. 31 is the deadline for nominating candidates for the 2026 prize. The Nobel selection committee will announce the winner in October of that year.",
      "On Friday, Trump held a ceremony in the White House to mark a U.S.-brokered accord ending hostilities between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Questioned by reporters, the leaders of both countries touted Trump\u2019s candidacy for a prize that three other American presidents have won. Barack Obama was the most recent winner, in 2009.",
      "Still, the peace deal between Armenia and Azerbaijan would be merely an amuse-bouche compared to ending the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, a nuclear-armed power.",
      "\u201cPutin is clearly in a weaker position,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThis invasion of Ukraine has turned out to be a disaster for him. And Trump has the cards this time. He\u2019s got leverage, experience and confidence. He\u2019s eager to solve this problem and end the war. He sees that Putin is the problem. Putin is standing between him and the end of the war.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A school board meeting in Redlands, California, devolved into name-calling and Nazi comparisons this week amid a heated argument over a board member\u2019s social media activity.",
      "Candy Olson \u2014 part of the board's conservative-voting majority \u2014 has hit \u201clike\u201d on Instagram carousels of images that include racist and antisemitic memes, according to screenshots collected by a group of parents. More than 1,500 people have written to the board as part of a campaign by a local activist group, Together for Redlands, calling for Olson\u2019s resignation.",
      "\u201cWe have real problems in our district, and instead of focusing on them, she is liking and sharing the most horrifying content I\u2019ve seen in a long time,\u201d said Samantha Trad, a parent and one of the leaders of Together for Redlands. \u201cA person like that is unfit to serve the district.\u201d",
      "Olson, who declined interview requests, has said she intended to like some of the more apolitical images in the Instagram carousels instead \u2014 like a meme showing a chicken dressed in high heels \u2014 and has unfollowed the account because she does not agree with the more inflammatory images it posted. The carousels she liked included a picture of Adolf Hitler and Jesus apparently commiserating about Jewish people; an image of Ned Flanders, a character on \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d dressed in a Nazi uniform; and a meme that appeared to joke about hitting an LGBTQ Pride parade with a car.",
      "\u201cJust because I like one slide out of a deck of 18 does not mean I like all slides,\u201d Olson said at the end of Tuesday night\u2019s board meeting. She added, \u201cThis all happened because the radical progressives in this town don\u2019t agree with the policies I\u2019m working towards.\u201d",
      "The divisions in Redlands run deeper than one board member\u2019s social media activity, showing how political differences about what children should learn are continuing to roil communities, years after the initial backlash to mask mandates and so-called critical race theory turned school boards into battlegrounds.",
      "In California, many districts and Democratic state leaders have spent the first months of the Trump administration defending the types of policies the president has attacked, including those supporting transgender students. But these views are far from uniform, and recent battles in Redlands and several other California communities show how culture wars in education are still simmering \u2014 and occasionally boiling over \u2014 at the local level.",
      "Hundreds of protesters showed up at a board meeting in Lucia Mar, along the Central Coast, in May, speaking for and against rules accommodating transgender students. In Pajaro Valley, south of the Bay Area, board meetings have attracted sharp debate over a contract for teacher training on \u201cfostering civil discourse\u201d and \u201cracial ideologies in the U.S. education system.\u201d Several districts faced protests and lawsuits over ethnic studies graduation requirements.",
      "In Redlands, Olson was elected last fall along with an allied candidate, tilting the five-member board in a conservative direction. They quickly set about enacting their vision for the 19,000-student Redlands Unified School District, where the majority of students are Latino. The middle-class community is located in San Bernardino County, which is generally considered reliably Republican, though it went for Donald Trump over Kamala Harris by just 2 percentage points last fall.",
      "As the newly elected Redlands school board members proposed changes to the district\u2019s anti-racism resolution and a new process to pull \u201cblasphemous\u201d library books from shelves, meetings this year grew increasingly contentious, often lasting late into the evening. In April, after a six-hour meeting, the board passed a resolution expressing opposition to transgender athletes competing on teams that match their gender identity, though it did not change any rules. In July, the board banned all flags from classrooms other than the American and California flags and military flags, which critics saw as an attack on LGBTQ pride banners.",
      "The Redlands conservative school board slate had support from local right-wing organizations, including Inland Empire Family PAC, a political group that has backed school board candidates in several California districts. The group held a fundraiser last year attended by Eric Trump, the president\u2019s son; Kash Patel, who is now FBI director; and Alina Habba, who was Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney and is now the acting U.S. Attorney in New Jersey.",
      "Critics of the Redlands board\u2019s new direction see the focus on culture war issues as a distraction and say the board should instead direct energy toward challenges like declining enrollment and funding cuts. The district is also facing rare heightened monitoring by the California Department of Justice for its mishandling of sexual abuse and misconduct cases.",
      "A district spokesperson said in a statement that the school board members \u201care elected officials who are not subject to the same policies and regulations that govern district employees.\u201d",
      "Over the past two weeks, as Together for Redlands released screenshots of Olson\u2019s social media activity, the rhetoric around it has heated up, both online and offline. On Reddit and Instagram, posts accused her of endorsing Nazi hate speech.",
      "In an email to NBC News, Olson called the campaign a hit job by a group that \"has lost much local credibility\" and said that she won\u2019t \"cater to the LGBTQ group demands to elevate them above all others.\"",
      "\"I'm a Christian who supports Israel with Jewish friends and family, yet somehow I\u2019m claimed to be a Nazi,\" she said. \"It never makes sense.\"",
      "Among several dozen speakers during public comment sessions Tuesday night, a handful defended Olson, some adding incendiary commentary.",
      "One man in a Trump hat said people who want her to resign should move to Europe, where \u201cyou can be as gay or trans as you want until a Muslim migrant throws you off a roof and sets you on fire.\u201d",
      "Another, Arthur Schaper, an organizer with the far-right activist group MassResistance, said he was \u201cproud\u201d of the conservative board members, and that parents protesting Olson were behaving the way Nazis treated their political opponents \u201cbefore they started pushing people into ovens.\u201d Schaper said in an email that he was invited to speak at the meeting by parents in the district who wanted \u201chelp to stand up to the bullying and cancel culture efforts from these LGBT activists in the community and surrounding areas.\u201d",
      "A district spokesperson said it is up to the presiding officer, in this case the board's president, to address \u201cspeech that is obscene, threatening, or that disrupts the orderly conduct of the meeting\u201d during public comments.",
      "The vast majority of students, parents and teachers who spoke amid hoots and hollers at the meeting said Olson\u2019s social media posts were just the latest affront amid months of the board adopting policies they disagreed with. One woman called Olson \u201ctrash\u201d before blowing kisses and flipping her off, and another said she was a \u201chateful bigoted person.\u201d A young man said she behaved like \u201ca 16-year-old on 4chan liking neo-Nazi posts.\u201d",
      "Pat Molnar, a teacher in the district, spoke directly to the conservative board members.",
      "\u201cHistory will not judge you kindly because the arc of the moral universe is bending towards justice \u2014 but right now you guys are pushing pretty hard the other way,\u201d Molnar said. \u201cYou guys are an embarrassment.\u201d",
      "Michele Rendler, president of the Redlands school board, who tends to vote with Olson and another conservative member, did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Quinn, 13, a student in the district who uses they/them pronouns, has spoken regularly at board meetings against the conservative agenda, and on Tuesday night joined those who said Olson should resign.",
      "\u201cShe needs to get off that board,\u201d Quinn said afterward in an interview. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t even need to be related with the district for every single thing she\u2019s done, against the kids and against the LGBTQ plus community.\u201d"

      "ABOVE NORTHERN GAZA \u2014 From the sky, a besieged Gaza briefly came into view early Saturday as the military plane opened its back door and a mass of tents could be seen near the Mediterranean coast from a side window.",
      "Then, boxes of baby formula, food and other supplies were pushed out the back and parachuted to the ground \u2014 a tiny fraction of what is required for the enclave\u2019s population, which is facing a spiraling hunger crisis \u2014 delivered by a method that experts say is inefficient, dangerous and in some cases deadly.",
      "But with mounting international outrage about deaths from starvation in Gaza under Israel\u2019s offensive and crippling aid restrictions, several countries have started dropping food, medicine and other supplies into Gaza from the sky.",
      "\u201cThose aid drops are actually causing havoc,\u201d Dr. Umar Burney, a Texas-based orthopedic surgeon volunteering in Gaza, told NBC News in a telephone interview Saturday from the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in northern Gaza. Multiple explosions could be heard ringing out nearby as he spoke.",
      "Burney, who has been treating patients in Gaza for the past week as part of a team with MedGlobal, a Chicago-based nonprofit that arranges volunteer medical missions to the enclave, added that he had taken care of \u201cmultiple patients who\u2019ve been crushed by these sort of unplanned, unannounced aid drops on top of their heads, literally on top of their heads.\u201d",
      "Saturday\u2019s flight from an air base just outside the Jordanian capital Amman took place a day after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government faced a wave of condemnation from European leaders, Arab nations and a group representing the families of hostages after it announced plans to take control of Gaza City in the north of the enclave.",
      "United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres condemned the plan on Friday as a \u201cdangerous escalation\u201d that risks \u201cdeepening the already catastrophic consequences for millions of Palestinians.\u201d",
      "His colleague Volker T\u00fcrk, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, also said in a statement that \u201cthe Israeli Government should put all its efforts into saving the lives of Gaza\u2019s civilians by allowing the full, unfettered flow of humanitarian aid.\u201d",
      "Deaths from starvation in Gaza have been on the rise after Israel launched a crippling blockade barring the entry of food and other vital supplies into the enclave in early March before ending its ceasefire with Hamas.",
      "It lifted the blockade in May, allowing a basic amount of aid into Gaza, largely distributed under a controversial new distribution system led by the U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.",
      "Since then, nearly 1,400 people have been killed and more than 4,000 injured while seeking food, the United Nations\u2019 Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in an update Tuesday. \u201cAt least 859 people have been killed around GHF sites since the beginning of GHF\u2019s operations,\u201d it added.",
      "Asked to address the rising death toll by NBC News on Wednesday, GHF said aid convoys belonging to the United Nations and other organizations in the past often passed near these locations and were regularly looted by large crowds.",
      "The Israeli military said in a statement Saturday that it allows GHF to \u201cdistribute aid to Gaza residents independently.\u201d It said that after \u201cincidents in which harm to civilians who arrived at distribution facilities was reported, thorough examinations were conducted\u201d and that \u201csystematic learning processes\u201d to improve the operational response are underway.",
      "Faced with mounting global outrage, Israel began tactical pauses in some parts of Gaza to allow more aid into the enclave late last month. It also began to allow countries to airdrop supplies into the territory, although aid groups have criticized this method of delivery.",
      "\u201cThese air drops are falling in extremely populated areas. They\u2019re dangerous,\u201d Caroline Willemen, a project coordinator at a M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (Doctors Without Borders) clinic in Gaza City, told British broadcaster Sky News on Saturday. \u201cThey have fallen on tents, people have been injured,\" she added.",
      "Aid groups have also pointed out that the drops can only provide a fraction of what is required for Gaza\u2019s population of around 2 million people as the hunger crisis continues to spiral and much of the enclave plunge into famine conditions.",
      "Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization, told journalists Thursday that at least 99 people, including 29 children under age 5, have died from malnutrition this year. These numbers were likely underestimates, he said, and the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza cites higher figures.",
      "On Friday, the ministry said hospitals had recorded four deaths \u201cdue to starvation and malnutrition\u201d within a 24-hour time frame, including two children. This brought the total number of starvation deaths to 201, including 98 children.",
      "Israel has maintained there is no starvation in Gaza and that the situation on the ground is being exaggerated, almost 22 months after it launched its offensive following the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attacks in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "Since then, more than 61,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in the enclave, while much of the territory has been destroyed.",
      "Foreign journalists have been banned from entering Gaza independently since Israel launched its offensive. Traveling on aid flights has become one of the few ways of witnessing the destruction in the territory firsthand."

      "Arizona police on Friday released new details about the fatal May drowning of influencer Emilie Kiser\u2019s 3-year-old son, including allegations that her husband placed a $25 bet on an NBA playoff game before the tragic incident.",
      "Brady Kiser, the husband of the parenting influencer, was home with the couple\u2019s two sons while his wife was out with friends on May 12 when Trigger drowned in the family\u2019s backyard pool, according to the Chandler Police Department report unsealed on Friday. The report states that the toddler was in the pool for around seven minutes before Kiser found him unconscious and took him out of the water. He died in the hospital six days later.",
      "Police initially recommended that Kiser be charged with one count of child abuse, but the Maricopa County Attorney\u2019s Office later determined that he would not face charges because there was \u201cno reasonable likelihood of conviction.\u201d",
      "Kiser\u2019s lawyer previously said that he is \u201cgrateful to law enforcement and the county attorney for conducting a thorough investigation and confirming that this was a tragic accident.\u201d",
      "According to the report obtained by People magazine, Kiser called the police around 6:41 p.m. local time and told the responding officer that he had lost sight of Trigger for around three to five minutes before he found his son in the pool.",
      "In a series of subsequent interviews, Kiser detailed his day to officers after his wife left to meet friends, including feeding his kids dinner and sitting on the couch while watching Game 4 of the NBA Finals between the New York Knicks and the Boston Celtics.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t have a clock, obviously,\u201d Kiser told police in an initial interview about how long he lost sight of his son. \u201cI don\u2019t know the exact time, but it was moments, it wasn\u2019t minutes, it was moments. It wasn\u2019t that he had been out of sight for long.\u201d",
      "Surveillance footage, however, showed that Trigger was unsupervised for at least nine minutes, and had been in the water for at least seven before Kiser found him, the report states. The footage also showed that the toddler \u201cdid not go into the water intentionally, rather he tripped and fell in while playing with an inflatable chair,\u201d the report states.",
      "Around that same time, according to Kiser\u2019s phone data detailed in the report, \u201ca $25 wager was placed on Jayson Tatum scoring more than 40 points\u201d on a sports betting app at around 5:14 p.m. local time, before his wife left. The report states that the \u201cwager was a winner, paying $102.50.\u201d",
      "The report states that the incident was the result of Trigger being \u201cunsupervised while playing around the unsecured pool and unable to swim.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is clear Brady\u2019s attention was divided,\u201d the report added.",
      "The report\u2019s release came one day after the Arizona Superior Court for Maricopa County ruled in Emilie Kiser\u2019s favor after she requested to seal certain details about hr son\u2019s death.",
      "Emilie Kiser, who has built millions of followers across TikTok and Instagram with mom and wife content, has not publicly commented on her son\u2019s death. An attorney for the Kisers did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday."

    "summary": "Donald Trump's meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska to discuss the Ukraine war is one of the biggest gambits of his second term.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 An unkept promise of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency is that he\u2019d end the war between Russia and Ukraine in one swift diplomatic masterstroke.",
      "Trump made threats. He applied pressure. Still, the bombs keep falling, the casualties continue to pile up.",
      "Now, Trump is betting that a face-to-face meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin will yield the elusive breakthrough and possibly quell concerns among voters about his handling of the war.",
      "The summit taking place Friday on friendly turf, the red state of Alaska, amounts to one of the biggest gambits of Trump\u2019s second term. Hosting the meeting raises expectations that he\u2019ll stop the fighting. The president faces traps in sitting down with Putin, who is well-versed in the territorial issues at stake, but he also enjoys economic and military leverage. Creating a durable peace that will preserve Ukraine\u2019s independence will test the dealmaking skills that are Trump\u2019s point of pride.",
      "\u201cIf you roll into the meeting not prepped, you can get jammed by Putin,\u201d said Michael McFaul, who was U.S. ambassador to Russia in the Obama administration. \u201cSummits are to achieve an objective that advances American national interests. They\u2019re the means to end, and I sometimes feel that Trump feels the meeting is an end in itself.\u201d",
      "Inside the Trump administration, a national security official acknowledged that forging a peace accord won\u2019t be easy. One of the combatants won't be at the table: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has refused to relinquish territory to Russia that was illegally annexed.",
      "\u201cWhether or not there\u2019s a breakthrough in the next week or two, we\u2019ll find out,\u201d said the Trump administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cUltimately, Putin and Zelenskyy have to be able to agree on something fundamentally. Third parties can do anything they want, but these two men have to agree to things.\u201d",
      "Sitting in a room with Putin, a canny negotiator in his own right, Trump may be lured into endorsing a peace deal that carves up Ukraine, foreign policy experts caution.",
      "\u201cI worry that in the eagerness to look like a peacemaker, President Trump will say, \u2018Yeah, that sounds like a good idea to me,\u2019\u201d McFaul said. \u201cPutin will say, \u2018Donetsk [a city in eastern Ukraine] was always part of Russia.\u2019 And Trump will say, \u2018You\u2019re right about that.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cPutin is good at those stories,\u201d McFaul continued. \u201cHe knows his history, and he can be engaging in his narrative. That\u2019s what the president needs to be ready for and his team needs to get him ready for.\u201d",
      "Another possibility is that Putin tries to stall the president further, promising concessions he has no intention of making in hopes of consolidating gains on the battlefield, one former U.S. official said.",
      "Putin may try to \u201cdivert President Trump from Trump\u2019s goal of stopping the war and establishing a ceasefire by promising things later,\u201d said William Taylor, who was charge d\u2019affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine during Trump\u2019s first term. \u201cThen, Putin continues to fight and continues to kill Ukrainians.\u201d",
      "No matter the outcome, Putin comes away with at least a symbolic victory: He\u2019s getting a large, bright stage at a time when he\u2019s an international pariah. Two years ago, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Putin, accusing him of war crimes involving the abduction of Ukrainian children. The warrant substantially limited potential locations for the two world leaders to meet.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump \u2014 just by going to a meeting with Putin, who for most of the democratic world is a rogue, imperialist dictator \u2014 is giving him legitimacy,\u201d McFaul said.",
      "The summit will inevitably invite comparisons to one held in Helsinki in 2018.",
      "At a joint news conference with Putin that year, Trump came off as eager to forge a personal connection after years of icy bilateral relations between the U.S and Russia. Citing Putin\u2019s denial of interfering in the 2016 presidential race, Trump said at the time: \u201cI don\u2019t see any reason why it would be\u201d Russia that meddled in his victory over Hillary Clinton that year. (He later claimed he had misspoken, affirming that he believed the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that Russian meddling had occurred but added that there \u201ccould be other people also\u201d who interfered in the 2016 election.)",
      "This time around, Trump is more seasoned and has grown impatient with Putin\u2019s conduct of the war. He has suggested that his wife, Melania Trump, has influenced his view of Putin, reminding him of the damage that Russia has inflicted on Ukraine.",
      "For his part, Putin is more diminished. As of this summer, Russian casualties were expected to hit 1 million. If he chooses, Trump could punish Russia for prolonging the war by slapping secondary sanctions on countries that purchase Russian energy, a step he has threatened to take.",
      "\u201cTrump is in a stronger position this time than in that first meeting,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIf President Trump goes into the meeting with Putin and exercises the political, military and economic leverage that he\u2019s got, there could be a ceasefire.\u201d",
      "Trump heads into the summit facing difficulties at home. His administration has struggled to stem the backlash from his base over the Jeffrey Epstein case. Last week, Trump fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics following a hiring report that showed weak job growth.",
      "A recent poll from the University of Massachusetts Amherst showed that Trump\u2019s approval rating was 38% \u2014 a 6-point drop from April.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s pretty close to the theoretical floor in this polarized era for approval ratings,\u201d said Alexander Theodoridis, director of the poll.",
      "Among Trump voters, support for his handling of the Russia-Ukraine war stood at 64% compared to other issues on which they approved of his performance by significantly higher margins, Theodoridis said. A total of 85% of Trump\u2019s 2024 voters approved of his performance on immigration issues; 78% favored his work on jobs; and 71% on tariffs.",
      "Statecraft is a proven way for presidents to improve their standing at home. A commander in chief enjoys far more latitude in shaping events in the foreign policy arena than when it comes to domestic affairs.",
      "The summit, said Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat who serves on the Foreign Relations Committee, \u201cwill change the subject in a positive way for Trump if he actually stands up to Putin and demands a just peace for Ukraine.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat would be a positive diversion,\u201d Coons added. \u201cBut it would be the worst of both worlds if it [the summit] is intended both to be a diversion from the domestic focus on things like tariffs and Epstein, and he fails to be strong.\u201d",
      "An added incentive for Trump to end the conflict could be an award that he seems to covet. His White House appears to be methodically building a case that he has earned the Nobel Peace Prize, drawing attention to various efforts to reduce tensions in global hot spots.",
      "Jan. 31 is the deadline for nominating candidates for the 2026 prize. The Nobel selection committee will announce the winner in October of that year.",
      "On Friday, Trump held a ceremony in the White House to mark a U.S.-brokered accord ending hostilities between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Questioned by reporters, the leaders of both countries touted Trump\u2019s candidacy for a prize that three other American presidents have won. Barack Obama was the most recent winner, in 2009.",
      "Still, the peace deal between Armenia and Azerbaijan would be merely an amuse-bouche compared to ending the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, a nuclear-armed power.",
      "\u201cPutin is clearly in a weaker position,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThis invasion of Ukraine has turned out to be a disaster for him. And Trump has the cards this time. He\u2019s got leverage, experience and confidence. He\u2019s eager to solve this problem and end the war. He sees that Putin is the problem. Putin is standing between him and the end of the war.\u201d"

      "Evacuation orders were lifted Friday evening in parts of Southern California as firefighters battling the Canyon Fire made progress taming the blaze. The fire has scorched an estimated 5,400 acres and is currently 28% contained, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire).",
      "The evacuation orders, which affected thousands of residents in Ventura County and Los Angeles County, were downgraded to warnings, meaning there\u2019s still a potential threat to life and property.",
      "The Canyon Fire is burning in a mountainous area north of Los Angeles and has been spreading toward the community of Castaic in L.A. County.",
      "Ventura County officials said Friday that firefighters were making \u201cgood progress in suppressing the blaze, aided by favorable weather conditions and the continued use of firefighting aircraft making repeated water and retardant drops to slow the fire\u2019s advance and support crews on the ground.\u201d",
      "Still, the fire remains an active threat and continues to spread further east into L.A. County.",
      "In an update posted Friday on X, the L.A. County Fire Department said three firefighters suffered minor injuries while battling the blaze and were taken to a local hospital \u201cout of an abundance of caution,\u201d but were expected to fully recover.",
      "The South Coast Air Quality Management District issued wildfire smoke advisories for parts of L.A. County, particularly along the I-5 corridor near Castaic Lake. Air quality issues are expected to linger through Sunday morning, according to the agency, which monitors air quality conditions for much of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties.",
      "Air pollution from wildfire smoke is a significant concern because it contains small particles that are less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter \u2014 around 4% of the diameter of an average strand of human hair. This type of air pollution is dangerous because the particles are small enough to reach deep inside the lungs, which can exacerbate or increase the risk of asthma, lung cancer and other chronic lung diseases.",
      "The Canyon Fire ignited Thursday afternoon near Holster Canyon and spread rapidly, engulfing more than 1,500 acres in several hours.",
      "The blaze is one of several large fires that are currently burning in California, including the huge Gifford Fire that ignited Aug. 1 in the Los Padres National Forest. That fire has consumed more than 100,000 acres and remains only 21% contained, according to Cal Fire."

    "summary": "Every year, NFL teams weigh benefits of building rhythm during the preseason against the risk of injury. More and more are sitting their best players.",
    "story": [
      "No quarterback passed for more yards or touchdowns during the 2024 NFL season than Cincinnati Bengals superstar quarterback Joe Burrow. It made what Burrow did to begin the 2025 season all the more remarkable Thursday night: He actually played in a preseason exhibition.",
      "\u201cI think we got 15 reps tonight, so we\u2019re 15 reps better,\u201d Burrow said after Cincinnati\u2019s preseason-opening loss to Philadelphia.",
      "That equaled how many preseason snaps Burrow had played in his previous five NFL seasons combined, according to Pro Football Focus.",
      "The Bengals elected to play multiple starters Thursday partly because they were healthy, and partly out of hope. After starting 0-2 in five of its last six seasons, the team seemed to agree with  criticism that trying to preserve its roster\u2019s preseason health had stunted its readiness for the regular season.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t find their rhythm until like Week 5 of 6,\u201d former Bengals quarterback Boomer Esiason said last month. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d",
      "Yet the Bengals\u2019 shift in preseason philosophy isn\u2019t the norm in a league where the preseason is getting started, but many of the biggest names will likely not. Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen, the reigning MVP, will not play in Saturday\u2019s preseason opener against the New York Giants. Washington\u2019s Jayden Daniels, last season\u2019s NFL Rookie of the Year, was among multiple starters who didn\u2019t take the field in Thursday\u2019s preseason opener in New England. Baltimore quarterback Lamar Jackson hasn\u2019t played a preseason snap in four years.",
      "If key, highly valued players do appear in the preseason, it\u2019s often during the last possible game, and then even not for long as teams largely believe the chance to build rhythm isn\u2019t great enough to outweigh the risk of injury.",
      "Inside the league, blame or praise for the trend of sharply reducing or outright eliminating starters\u2019 preseason workloads is  often attributed to Los Angeles Rams coach Sean McVay, who began holding out his best players entirely during the preseason in his second season in Los Angeles in 2018, even though the Rams were starting a young quarterback.",
      "Los Angeles went on to advance to the Super Bowl, and whether the preseason rest for key players was connected at all to its play during the regular season, it was enough in a copycat league \u2014 where new ideas do not stay proprietary for long \u2014 for others to adopt the same approach.",
      "During the 2024 preseason, 14 teams didn\u2019t play their presumed starter for a single snap during the first two weeks of the preseason \u2014 up from just one team in 2014, according to a comparison done last year.",
      "\u201cWe feel confident and comfortable with the approach we\u2019re taking and we understand that it might not be for everybody,\u201d McVay said in 2019.",
      "\u201cEverybody\u201d included those who contend that building rhythm during the preseason is worth the risk of injury.",
      "\u201cFor me, to have a sharp knife, I have to really sharpen it,\u201d former Rams quarterback Vince Ferragamo told the Los Angeles Times in 2018. \u201cSometimes what you do in practice and then play in a game is a whole different aspect.\u201d",

      "2025 Draft Day Manifesto: The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Drafters",
      "When it comes to smelling salts, NFL players can only use their own supply",
      "McVay and the Rams might not have put their top players on ice during preseason games if not for the rise of another trend happening at the same time, as franchises increasingly began hosting \u201cjoint practices.\u201d Their appeal stemmed from the opportunity for quality repetitions but in a more controlled scrimmage than a game. Although a starting defense could face off against its opponent\u2019s starting offense in a joint practice, tackling was often limited and hitting quarterbacks was effectively outlawed.",
      "Before making his preseason debut last season, No. 1 overall pick Caleb Williams said he believed preseason \u201creps are always paramount for anybody like myself: a young rookie, second-year guy, [or] third-year guy.\u201d Yet this year, as a second-year guy playing under a new head coach in Chicago, the quarterback will not play in the Bears\u2019 preseason opener. The team instead wanted to prioritize his playing time during joint practices with Miami.",
      "Teams are increasingly willing to sit starters because of the injury risk that became a topic of serious concern Thursday in Indianapolis. During a preseason game at Baltimore, Colts quarterback Anthony Richardson dislocated a pinkie finger amid his competition to hold on to the starting job. Yet holding an important player out of a game is no guarantee they will enter the regular season healthy. Just ask the Chargers, who lost key offensive lineman Rashawn Slater to a season-ending knee injury during a practice this week.",
      "This month, 30 of the 32 teams will play three preseason games \u2014 only the Los Angeles Chargers and Detroit Lions, who also played in the July 31 Hall of Fame exhibition, will play more \u2014 and many have signaled that they will again play starters and stars sparingly, if at all.",
      "Jacksonville is one of the few exceptions. The Jaguars are expected to play most starters in Saturday\u2019s preseason opener against Pittsburgh, including No. 2 overall pick Travis Hunter and starting quarterback Trevor Lawrence as a way to increase their repetitions following a dramatic offseason overhaul.",
      "\u201cLook,\u201d Jacksonville coach Liam Coen said. \u201cIf we had three [joint practices] and two days of work [within] each of those joints, we probably wouldn\u2019t be playing\u201d starters.",
      "Their opponent, meanwhile, will sit new quarterback Aaron Rodgers, the former MVP in his first season with Pittsburgh. He reportedly offered to play, but was among a group of 15 starters who will sit out at least the first preseason game because \u201cthey need less runway to take off, to be quite honest with you,\u201d Pittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin said.",
      "A player as good as Burrow would seemingly need little proverbial runway, either, but he has called the Bengals\u2019 change of philosophy \u201cthe right decision.\u201d But not everyone is altering their approach to the preseason. Matthew Stafford, the Los Angeles Rams\u2019 starting quarterback, won\u2019t play in the team\u2019s preseason opener this week while dealing with a back injury.",
      "But it didn\u2019t take the injury to know he wouldn\u2019t take a single game snap in August.",
      "\u201cThere is zero chance you will ever see Matthew Stafford take a snap in the preseason for the Rams as long as I\u2019m the coach,\u201d McVay said in 2021. \u201cThat will never happen.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "For pioneering science fiction novelist Octavia E. Butler, writing was more than a profession. It was a form of survival, resistance and reflection. In \u201cPositive Obsession: The Life and Times of Octavia E. Butler,\u201d author and college professor Susana M. Morris shares the quiet yet radical story of Butler\u2019s life, revealing how the worlds she imagined were shaped by the one that often shut her out.",
      "Going from a shy Black girl, born in 1947 and raised under Jim Crow, to a literary icon, Butler\u2019s path to success was not linear. She was told not to dream but to get a \u201creal\u201d job. As she juggled temp jobs, financial anxiety and a society that resisted making room for her, Butler wrote genre-defining literature that has been adapted for TV and film in recent years, and has continued to go viral nearly two decades after her death in 2006 at 58.",
      "\u201cPositive Obsession,\u201d named for a 1989 essay by Butler, pulls from journals, interviews and personal letters in Butler\u2019s public archives to illuminate the forces that shaped her, revealing an ambitious and meticulous writer.",
      "For most of her career, Butler woke up before dawn to write for hours ahead of what she once called \u201clots of horrible little jobs.\u201d As she toiled in factories and warehouses, washing dishes, inspecting potato chips and making telemarketing calls, Butler conjured characters from her everyday encounters.",
      "Morris told NBC that in sharing Butler\u2019s story now, 19 years after her death, she hopes to inspire artists who don\u2019t think they can afford to create to find the time.",
      "\u201cIn this economic system that we\u2019re currently in, we are so crunched down trying to buy eggs or pay the rent,\u201d Morris said \u201csometimes we don\u2019t even feel like we can access art for art\u2019s sake. But through all the trials and tribulations, she was accessing it.\u201d",
      "Butler\u2019s journals show how writing was her way of pushing back against racism, patriarchy and other norms that frustrated her and made her feel overlooked as a creative person and a public intellectual. She wrote because \u201cshe had to,\u201d Morris writes. She put pen to paper to make sense of the world and speak back to it.",
      "Beyond writing novels, Butler eventually became known for her direct and evocative engagement with readers, whom she pushed to think deeply about the world around them. She analyzed real-world dynamics and extrapolated them into prescient and cautionary fiction. She wrote stories that seem to have become only more popular as time has passed. Her novel \u201cKindred\u201d was reimagined into a TV series in 2022, and authors John Jennings and Damian Duffy won a Hugo Award in 2021 for their graphic novel reimagining of her book \u201cParable of the Sower.\u201d",
      "On social media, the \u201c#OctaviaKnew\u201d trend captures the ominous ways her words resonate in the present on issues like climate change, inequality and politics. Her ability, decades ago, to conjure how we live now gives Morris\u2019 students a feeling of connection to Butler\u2019s work today.",
      "In \u201cParable of the Talents,\u201d published in 1998 and set in the 2020s, Butler introduces a conservative presidential candidate who urges voters to join him in a project to \u201cmake America great again.\u201d The words on the page reverberated through Morris\u2019 classroom as she taught the book during Trump\u2019s first presidency. It\u2019s why many readers think Butler\u2019s work was nearly prophetic. \u201cPsychic? Maybe not,\u201d Morris says. \u201cPrescient? Absolutely.\u201d",
      "Morris uses the 1987 short story \u201cThe Evening and the Morning and the Night\u201d \u2014 about a community grappling with a fictional genetic disorder \u2014 to talk to students about the marginalization of people with disabilities.",
      "Butler\u2019s 1984 short story \u201cBloodchild\u201d pushes readers to rethink gender, reproduction and family. \u201cWe\u2019re living in a moment that demonizes transness,\u201d Morris said. \u201cBut in \u2018Bloodchild,\u2019 men carry the babies. It complicates our idea of what bodies are supposed to do.\u201d",
      "Butler\u2019s fiction never floated away from reality. It confronted it. And it continues to make readers question what they thought they understood. Though often shelved as science fiction, Morris says Butler\u2019s work transcends the label, and she instead classifies it as \u201cspeculative fiction.\u201d",
      "Morris\u2019 immersive portrait can at times feel like reading Butler\u2019s journal or listening to the innermost thoughts of a quiet and sometimes lonely person.",
      "\u201cShe lived a life of the mind,\u201d Morris said. Out of that life came work shaped by discipline, imagination and a kind of beautiful obsession \u2014 one that Morris hopes others might mirror in their own lives.",
      "\u201cI hope that in this world that is often devoid of beauty,\u201d Morris said, \u201cthat other folks can see her example and find the beauty in their own kind of practice.\u201d"

      "LONDON \u2014 One of the world\u2019s oldest soccer teams is in big trouble.",
      "When Sheffield Wednesday FC kicks off the new season on Sunday \u2014 away at Leicester City in the Championship, the second tier of British soccer \u2014 more than 3,000 traveling fans will not take their seats to cheer on their beloved team, known as the Owls.",
      "Instead, they will hold a five-minute protest outside Leicester\u2019s King Power Stadium against one man: Thai businessman Dejphon Chansiri, Wednesday\u2019s owner and the focal point of a growing crisis that may threaten its very existence.",
      "The team\u2019s financial problems are mounting, and unsuccessful attempts to sell it have dominated local sports media and online forums for months \u2014 and the crisis has much wider implications for the health of English soccer away from the glitzy riches of Liverpool and Manchester City.",
      "The problem is so acute that the British government has passed a new law that will launch a football regulator to police the buying and selling of teams and make sure owners are \u201cfit and proper.\u201d",
      "For Wednesday, founded in 1867, that could be too little, too late.",
      "Some teams have bad offseasons, but this summer has seen Wednesday set new levels of chaos: Players and staff have not been paid on time in four of the last five months. As a result, there\u2019s a transfer embargo banning the club from buying new players until January 2027 \u2014 even if it could afford them.",
      "At least 15 players have left on free transfers or for a fraction of their market value this summer, leaving barely enough players to fill a match day squad of 11 starters and up to nine substitutes.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s becoming a soap opera,\u201d said Dan Fudge, who co-hosts the popular podcast \u201cThe Wednesday Week.\u201d",
      "\u201cUsually, as podcasters, we\u2019re scratching for content to talk about during the summer,\u201d Fudge said, \u201cbut we seem to have had a new timeline of terror every single week to talk about.\u201d",
      "The list of mishaps goes on. Talented young head coach Danny Rohl, a charismatic and cerebral German touted for big success in major European leagues, left by mutual agreement.",
      "The famous old Hillsborough Stadium is literally falling apart \u2014 Sheffield City Council refused to grant a safety license for the vast 9,000-seat North Stand due to concerns of uncovering wiring and cracks in the terrace.",
      "The club said in a statement this week it was working to fix this and would seek to place season ticket holders elsewhere if it was still shut by the first home game on Aug. 16. A disabled fan whose accessible seat is in the North Stand broke down in tears this week when telling the BBC what effect the crisis is having on him.",
      "The club did not respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment.",
      "Chansiri says he wants to sell, but no one so far has met his valuation for the club, which football finance experts say is too high. The owner is widely reported to have offered the club for 100 million pounds ($134 million). Kieran Maguire, a leading British football finance expert and commentator, puts the real value at 40 million pounds ($53 million), but Chansiri said in June that he rejected an offer at this price from a U.S.-based consortium.",
      "Maguire said it was unlikely Wednesday would go bust entirely, but he said that in any case the team would almost certainly be relegated to the league below and face a very tough season.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not malicious in the sense that he doesn\u2019t want to destroy the football club, but he\u2019s very naive, has no knowledge of the industry,\u201d Maguire said.",
      "English football culture is one of spending. This summer alone, the 20 Premier League teams have spent around 1.8 billion pounds ($2.4 billion) on transfer fees, with reigning champions Liverpool splashing out 252 million pounds ($335 million).",
      "And the contrast between the top and the rest of the football pyramid system is stark.",
      "Between them, the Premier League clubs made more than 6 billion pounds ($8 billion) in revenue in the 2024-25 season, an increase of 36% from the previous year, according to consultancy firm Deloitte.",
      "Meanwhile, every single team in the Championship, the fifth-most attended league in Europe, made an operating loss in the same period for the second season in a row.",
      "There is money from TV, sponsorship, player sales and match day revenue, but with huge wage bills, clubs are left to rely on player sales and, if they\u2019re lucky, wealthy benefactors to inject cash.",
      "The English Football League said Wednesday it was in \u201cadvanced discussions\u201d with Chansiri\u2019s lawyers on how he will sell his stake in the club. The league, criticized by some fans for not acting sooner, warned the Thai magnate that the club needed to \u201cmeet its obligations or make good on his commitment to sell to a well-funded party, for fair market value.\u201d",
      "Could things even get worse? Probably.",
      "This week, Morecambe FC, a team in the northwest seaside town of the same name, was suspended from the National League, the fifth tier of English football\u2019s sprawling pyramid-shaped league system, with the elite clubs at the top and smaller, more parochial clubs toward the bottom.",
      "Morecambe failed to meet its financial obligations, and if a new buyer who can support it can\u2019t be found, it could disappear for good. This happened to Macclesfield Town, Bury, Hereford and a handful of other teams whose owners couldn\u2019t support them and whose liabilities were too great.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a sense of foreboding about the club. We\u2019ve seen other clubs do it, and normally at the eleventh hour someone comes in and [stages] a takeover,\u201d Fudge said.",
      "\u201cThen, over recent years, you look at teams like Bury and what\u2019s recently happened to Morecambe, and they\u2019ve not had that white knight step in, and all of a sudden we\u2019re thinking, \u2018Oh hang on a minute, we could be the big scalp.\u2019\u201d",
      "Like many fans, Fudge has no doubt who is to blame. \u201cPure ineptitude is how we\u2019ve got here, regardless of the warning signs around Chansiri since about 2018.\u201d",
      "Fans warmly remember the 1990s, when players such as Chris Waddle, David Hirst and Des Walker \u2014 all England internationals \u2014 lined up alongside some of the then-hottest talent in Europe, helping the club reach seventh place in the Premier League during the 1996-97 season.",
      "Fans were optimistic when Chansiri \u2014 a scion of Thai Union Group, a seafood conglomerate that owns the Chicken of the Sea canned tuna brand in the U.S. \u2014 took over in 2015. He promised and delivered some success, taking the team to the 2016 Championship playoff final, just 90 minutes away from a return to the Premier League.",
      "All this feels like a long, long time ago, with fans wondering what shape the new football regulator will take and whether it will make any difference.",
      "David Blunkett, a senior minister during Tony Blair\u2019s government in the 1990s and 2000s and now a member of the House of Lords, is a lifelong Wednesday fan and attended an online meeting with the football league on Thursday. He said it was \u201cvital\u201d that the crisis at Wednesday is addressed before the regulator is set up.",
      "\u201cParliamentarians, including those representing the city, the Supporters\u2019 Trust and other fans will clearly continue to pressurize for an immediate resolution of the crisis at Hillsborough,\u201d he told NBC News.",
      "Hailing from the north side of Sheffield in South Yorkshire, a city famous for its steel, Wednesday became an early member of the Football Association (the term \u201csoccer\u201d is an abbreviation of \u201cassociation\u201d), as the football craze swept through working-class communities across the North and the Midlands.",
      "The team got its unique name from cricket: In the mid-19th century, there were multiple teams in Sheffield playing this game, and the one that played on Wednesdays started a football team. The name stuck.",
      "On Sunday, fans will raise banners and shout slogans in an attempt to preserve that history. Even if some would rather just watch the game.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people that are very much in the camp of \u2018Let\u2019s protest, let\u2019s get this message out as much as we can,\u2019 which I completely agree with, but it\u2019s not everybody\u2019s bag, because a lot of people use the football to spend time with their family and their friends,\u201d Fudge said.",
      "Despite the turmoil at the club, Wednesday sold out its allocation of 3,287 away tickets for Sunday\u2019s game. It\u2019s not immediately clear how many more Wednesday games there will be."

      "\u201cI have so many people who come to me and say to me, \u2018I love your music, I want to give, but I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t carry cash,\u2019\u201d said Paruz, who calls herself the Saw Lady.",
      "That\u2019s led her to display QR codes for digital payment apps Venmo and PayPal for commuters to send her digital tips.",
      "The decline in cash payments is changing business for street performers. With the cash in their tip jars or guitar cases dwindling, magicians and musicians are turning toward digital payments to make money from performing.",
      "Nearly half of U.S. adults never use cash in a typical week, according to research from Capital One. Nearly 70% of Americans used cash for \u201cfew if any\u201d purchases in the past year. A vast majority, 87%, of all U.S. transactions were cashless in 2024, and the bank anticipates that by 2027, 94% of U.S. transactions won\u2019t involve cash.",
      "Cash still reigns among older and low-income Americans, Yale economist David Argente said. Americans ages 55 and older use cash at almost double the rate of 18- to 24-year-olds, according to Federal Reserve data.",
      "There\u2019s no large-scale data on how people in the United States pay street performers, though the Federal Reserve indicates they are most likely to use cash for payments under $25. Paruz and other performers say busking still mostly draws hard money. Paruz said 70% of her tips still come from cash. New York blues keyboardist Gabriel Aldort, who plays in the city\u2019s subways and ferry terminals, said only 5% of his tips are digital.",
      "Aldort puts up \u201chuge\u201d QR codes for apps like CashApp and Venmo, but says his subway audience doesn\u2019t get much use out of them.",
      "\u201cI think the vast majority of New Yorkers, even counting the transients, the tourists, have cash,\u201d he said.",
      "But performers have noticed that an increasing amount of their tips come from payment apps. Chadd \u201cWacky Chad\u201d Deitz, a Boston-based stunt comedian who does backflips off pogo sticks in Northeast cities, has been experimenting with digital payments for 12 years. He now thinks 30% to 40% of his tips come that way.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t accept digital payments, then you\u2019re not going to survive,\u201d Deitz said.",
      "Digital payment apps aim to be more \u201ctrusted, familiar, and easy-to-use\u201d ways for gig workers like buskers to make money, Venmo general manager Alexis Sowa said in a statement. A Cash App spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "But while performers say digital tipping is convenient, it has also affected how much audiences tip \u2014 and not necessarily for the better, said Danny Tangelo, a traveling magician who performs across Western states. He\u2019s found cash tips are often higher than digital tips.",
      "Digital payments also lack visibility: Deitz thinks people are encouraged to drop in cash or change when they see others do it.",
      "\u201cI do think that there is a little bit of psychology of people walking forward and saying, \u2018Thank you,\u2019 because they might see the QR code from far away, they might have tipped midshow and then walk away,\u201d Deitz said. \u201cBut then people that didn\u2019t pay see those people walk away, and they go, \u2018Well, I guess it\u2019s acceptable to walk away.\u2019\u201d",
      "For Paruz, digital payments make busking less personal: Audiences keep their distance rather than coming up to her and dropping in a tip. Cash \u201cfostered communication,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople would stop and talk to us.\u201d",
      "Apps like Venmo and Cash App also take a small cut of money received for goods and services, which adds up when performers are processing large amounts of digital payments.",
      "An alternative is busk.co, a nonprofit, busker-specific payment site that allows performers to receive tips via Apple Pay, Google Pay and credit card. Berlin-based filmmaker Nick Broad started building the site in 2012 while working on a documentary about street performers. He says digital payments help make sure that buskers get paid what they\u2019re worth.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s as easy to give a million dollars as $1 on a cashless payments platform,\u201d Broad said. \u201cYou might think that it\u2019s worth $89, $10, $15, whatever, which is not the same when you\u2019re getting cash out of your wallet and you\u2019re fumbling around for change.\u201d",
      "But Broad says fewer performers have taken up busk.co in the United States compared to countries like the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. He says that could be because apps like Venmo or Cash App are more mainstream here.",
      "Although digital payments have helped buskers make up for a decline in cash tips, performers are still struggling. Paruz says she makes less from cash and digital tips than she did when she began performing in the 1990s, while Deitz has hit all-time lows for payment at multiple performances this year.",
      "Broadly, Americans are tired of tipping. A survey this spring found more than 40% of Americans think \u201ctipping culture is out of control.\u201d That has meant many tipped workers in other industries have seen their tips dip.",
      "Besides, with the rising costs of housing and food, if audiences want to save money, \u201cthey\u2019re going to do it watching a street performer,\u201d Deitz said.",
      "That means performers like him don\u2019t care how you pay them \u2014 as long as you pay. A $2 tip, Deitz said, isn\u2019t going to \u201csustain a white picket fence and two kids.\u201d",
      "For magician Tangelo, though, cash has one additional benefit.",
      "\u201cI have a trick where money appears inside fruit,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that with Cash App or Venmo.\u201d"

They were all sent to Mexico when authorities deported their parents, who lacked legal status.",

Instead, he said, he\u2019s working two jobs \u2014 one during the day at a fast-food restaurant and another at night at a gas station. The teen said he works so many hours a week that at times he barely gets to eat.",

On the way, they stopped at a stateside immigration checkpoint, one they have passed through multiple times. But this time, immigration authorities arrested the parents.",
      "According to their attorney, Danny Woodward, they have never done anything to make them a priority for removal. The entire family was taken to a detention facility and sent to Mexico the following day.",
      "The girl\u2019s health condition has not improved since she\u2019s been in Mexico, her mother told NBC News in June. Worsening headaches and dizziness have become so frequent that the girl\u2019s parents take turns monitoring and taking care of her through the night.",
      "The symptoms are indicative of some of the lasting side effects from the brain surgery that saved her life last year. Because the swelling in her brain is still not fully gone, the girl experiences difficulties with speech and mobility on the right side of her body, as well as memory problems. These require the girl to routinely check in with doctors monitoring her recovery, get MRI scans every three months, attend rehabilitation therapy sessions and take medication to prevent seizures.",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it matters what political spectrum you come from. I think compassion is something that\u2019s born from within us, that God puts there,\u201d Coronado said. \u201cWhen you find Jesus, when you have a relationship with Christ, it\u2019s hard to avoid.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is a wonderful family, and I think they go out of their way to try to make ends meet for their family and do all the right things for them and bring them up the right way,\u201d Coronado said, adding that their \u201cremarkable children\u201d excel in music and the arts.",

      "He recalled the moment he decided to pursue that career. It was the first time he met the neurosurgeon who operated on his sister. When the doctor came out of surgery, \u201chis eyes went happy,\u201d the teen recalled. \u201cI was like, \u2018That\u2019s what I want to do.\u2019\u201d He\u2019s put that on hold, indefinitely."

      "Regardless of whether you live in a warm climate year-round or temperatures are rising in your area due to seasonality, your goal as a dog owner is to prevent your pet from overheating in the first place instead of working to cool them down afterward, says Kaplan. Here are a few key ways to keep your dog cool:",
      "Limit how much time your dog spends outside in the heat. If temperatures are moderately warm, keep outdoor activity to a minimum and try to only spend time outside during the coolest parts of the day (the early morning and late night), says Satchu.",
      "When your pet is outdoors, keep them in the shade as much as possible.",
      "In extreme temperatures, like those you may experience during a heat wave, only take your dog outside for about five to 10 minutes, or just enough time to relieve themselves, says Satchu.",
      "Never leave dogs in hot cars \u2014 doing so results in numerous pet deaths every year, says Kratt. Temperatures inside cars can quickly rise to life-threatening levels, even if you crack the windows open or park in the shade, he says. Instead, leave your dog at home while running errands when it\u2019s hot out.",
      "Frequently asked questions",
      "Like humans, dogs\u2019 main way of dissipating heat is through evaporation. But unlike humans, dogs can\u2019t sweat through their skin, so they mainly rely on panting. Dogs inhale air as they pant, which makes the moisture from their tongues, nasal passages and the lining of their lungs evaporate. This process allows their bodies to cool down, according to the American Kennel Club. Dogs also dissipate heat through their paws, which have sweat glands on them, although they sweat very little compared to humans.",
      "There\u2019s no exact temperature that tells you if it\u2019s too hot outside for your dog. But as a rule of thumb, if it\u2019s too hot for you, it\u2019s too hot for your pet, says Kratt.",
      "Bonomo says you should start taking precautions with your dog once temperatures are in the mid-70s. Once you factor in humidity, 70-degree temperatures, which may be relatively comfortable for us, can feel much warmer for dogs since their average body temperatures are naturally a few degrees higher than humans, experts told me.",
      "How dogs are impacted by warm temperatures varies based on their physical characteristics, age, weight, medical conditions and activity level. Generally, however, dogs with dark fur and brachycephalic dogs (those who have flat or pushed-in faces, like bulldogs and pugs), have extra trouble with managing heat, says Bonomo. Puppies and senior dogs are also more susceptible to heatstroke than adolescent and adult dogs, says Satchu.",
      "There are two common misconceptions experts often hear when it comes to dogs and heat.",
      "Don\u2019t assume that only large dogs can overheat, says Kaplan. Dogs are intolerant of heat no matter their size.",
      "Dog breeds with long hair are just as prone to heat-related issues as breeds with short coats. \u201cLong hair can actually help keep a dog cool by acting as an insulator, similar to how insulation in your home keeps the AC inside,\u201d says Satchu. Kratt doesn\u2019t recommend shaving dogs with long or double coats in the summer, as it could increase their chance of overheating and sunburn.",
      "During the summer months, the ideal indoor temperature for most dogs is 75 to 78 degrees Fahrenheit, although, cooler temperatures are also safe for them, says Kratt.  Dogs typically start showing signs of overheating between 81 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the American Kennel Club. Thus, 85 degrees Fahrenheit is the absolute maximum indoor temperature dogs should be exposed to if necessary \u2014 it should not be their norm, and it\u2019s only safe if they have access to plenty of fresh water, can lay on cool surfaces like tile floors and are not exposed to direct sunlight, says Kratt.",
      "If you have further questions about the ideal indoor temperature for your dog, consult your vet. They can give you a more exact recommendation based on your pet\u2019s age, physical characteristics and medical conditions.",
      "Heat begins to impact dogs\u2019 health when they reach critically high body temperatures, at which point they can become dehydrated and their body can begin to have multiple organ failure, says Satchu. If this isn\u2019t rapidly treated, pets may suffer permanent organ damage or potentially die from complications, she says. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to check on your dog when they spend time outside and keep an eye out for telltale signs they\u2019re overheating, including:",

      "How to shop for college dorm essentials",
      "Before you start dorm shopping, here are a few things to consider:",
      "Student discounts: While shopping, remember that many retailers offer student discounts and student memberships. For example, after proving that you\u2019re enrolled at a college through your school email address or student ID, you can create an Amazon Prime Student account, which offers benefits like fast shipping and exclusive prices on select products. Brands like Apple and others also offer student pricing, discounts and memberships.Storage Space: Dorm room space is limited, especially if you have a roommate. If you\u2019ve toured your future dorm room or know its dimensions, you can get a sense of what you can and cannot fit in your space. If you haven\u2019t gotten a chance to see your room yet, it may be better to wait to buy larger items like chairs and appliances. Flooring: This is a smaller detail, but knowing if your room is carpeted or has a hardwood floor can impact the products you buy. For example, certain vacuums work better on hard floors but might not be as effective on carpets. Roommates: We suggest coordinating with your roommate for items that will take up a considerable amount of shared space, including appliances like mini-fridges. You can also share items like kitchen appliances and storage solutions between yourselves to save space and money.Bed sizing: Dorm rooms typically use twin XL beds, slightly longer than a standard twin bed. Not all bedding retailers carry products in twin XL sizes, so you should always check which brands carry fitted sheets, flat sheets and other bedding to fit your dorm bed. Dorm rules: Some dorms and residence halls prohibit the use of certain appliances or electronics in a room. Before buying appliances like mini fridges or lamps, be sure to check the guidelines for your dorm or residence hall.",

      "How I tried men\u2019s running shoes",
      "I have been running regularly as part of my fitness routine for the past five years. I live in New York City and typically run outside on pavement two to three times a week. My distance ranges between three and seven miles, and I use a fitness tracker to help guide my pace. I wear a size 10 shoe in a medium width, and generally prefer cushioned shoes with neutral support, as they mitigate knee pains more than other shoes I\u2019ve tried.",
      "To try new running shoes, I wear them for at least a week and follow my usual routine. I do at least one normal run, one tempo run and one long run to see how the shoes handle different speeds and distances.",

      "These shoes strike a great balance between cushion and responsiveness \u2014 I feel fast, but not so connected to the pavement that every nook and cranny feels like a surprise.

      "Both Cunha and Zach Moxham, a certified personal trainer at Physical Equilibrium in New York City, recommend going to a local running shoe store for the best fit possible. Specialty running shoe stores tend to have knowledgeable staff who can better inform you about running shoe options and recommendations, says Cunha. They also typically have more measuring tools to take advantage of, including foot scans, gait analysis and treadmill analysis \u2014 try everything and anything, says Moxham.",
      "A poor-fitting running shoe isn\u2019t going to be comfortable, no matter how stylish it may look.",
      "If you plan to buy shoes in person, buy them at the end of the day when your feet are most swollen, says Cunha. That\u2019s because if they feel comfortable when your feet are most swollen, they will likely feel comfortable throughout the day.",
      "Cunha also says to try on at least three different models of shoe, even two different models at the same time, one on each foot, to get a good feel for the fit.",
      "Pay special attention to the toe box \u2014 the area around your toes, says Cunha and Moxham.",
      "\u201cMake sure there is enough room to slightly wiggle your toes,\u201d says Cunha. \u201cIf you can\u2019t move your toes at all then the shoes are too tight and will eventually become painful. The tip of your thumb should fit between the end of the shoe and the end of your longest toe.\u201d",
      "Frequently asked questions",
      "Training shoes and stylish sneakers look similar to some running shoes, but functionally, they are very different. Running shoes have a stiffer, more shock-absorbing sole that is suited to higher-impact activity, says Cunha. They also guide your motion to increase stability and the proper alignment of your foot. Plus, running shoes minimize fatigue, as they are lighter than other types of shoes.",
      "Finding the perfect pair of running shoes can be liberating \u2014 I know I like running a lot more when I am doing it in my favorite shoes. But regardless of how attached you get to one pair, it\u2019s important to replace your running shoes every six months or so.",
      "\u201cGood sneakers are designed to last for 300 to 500 miles,\u201d says Cunha. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if they still look new: if the support is worn out, you\u2019re at a much higher risk of injury.\u201d",
      "To keep track of when it\u2019s time to replace your shoes, note the date you buy a new pair, and keep track of that six-month interval, says Cunha.",
      "Meet our experts",
      "At NBC Select, we work with experts who have specialized knowledge and authority based on relevant training and/or experience. We also take steps to ensure all expert advice and recommendations are made independently and without undisclosed financial conflicts of interest.",

    "summary": "Kylie Kelce talks about all things kindergarten, sports and body confidence in a TODAY.com exclusive.",
    "story": [
      "Kylie Kelce's oldest daughter, Wyatt, will be heading to kindergarten this fall, and the self-proclaimed germaphobe is already bracing herself.",
      "\"I try my best to just release all of the anxiety that is associated with it,\" Kylie tells TODAY.com with a smile and a sigh.",
      "\"We try our best to wash our hands really well at home and hope that when they're at school, they wash their hands just as well,\" she explains, in an exclusive interview with TODAY.com. \"You're about to go to school, touch every surface and lick your hands. The cold that you are about to bring home is going to be 'peak school.'\"",
      "Despite the school germs that may come, Wyatt is such a \"social butterfly\" that Kylie is really looking forward to watching her build new relationships with her classmates. In true mom style, Kylie is feeling all the feelings about sending her daughter to school.",
      "\"When your kids leave you, you hope they're polite. You hope they use their manners. You hope they speak up for themselves. You hope they advocate for themselves. You hope that they're kind to their peers, their classmates and you hope that they're respectful of the teachers,\" she says.",
      "Body Confidence, The Kelce Way",
      "There is one major way that Kylie and her husband Jason have prepared Wyatt for school: teaching her to feel confident about herself, her abilities and her physical body.",
      "Kylie hopes that even if her children encounter negative self-talk from others, she and Jason have laid enough groundwork to encourage them to continue to think positively about themselves.",
      "Because she's so passionate about the topic, Kylie has partnered with Dove\u2019s Body Confident Sport program, the first evidence-based coaching curriculum designed to boost confidence in girls ages 11\u201317 through sport. She's helping to unveil Dove's short film, \"Fans of Confidence,\" in which the women of the Gotham Football Club surprise two youth soccer teams by showing up on the sidelines to cheer them on.",
      "Growing up, \"I was taller than everyone. I had thicker legs than my classmates,\" Kylie recalls. Being able to \"capitalize\" on her strength and size by playing sports helped her feel good about herself.",
      "\"I'm so happy to tell other girls that your body might be different from your peers, or you might think that this is a negative, but in sport, it might help you out more than you could ever imagine,\" she adds.",
      "Occasionally, being so good at athletics earned Kylie some less desirable \u2014 though quite positive \u2014 attention.",
      "\"I was like, 'Oh my gosh, everyone's staring at me,'\" she remembers thinking when she had to stand up at school to receive the award for the Presidential Fitness Test. It was phased out of schools in 2013 but may be making a return.",
      "Though Kylie welcomes any opportunity to get kids moving, motherhood taught her that hitting milestones like rolling over and crawling (and doing chin-ups, for example) don't always happen at the same time for every body.",
      "\"None of our kids walked at the same time, none of our kids spoke at the same time, and so to hold everyone to the same exact standard just seems old school and silly,\" she says.",
      "\"But you know what?\" she continues. \"I think we can just all agree that if we can encourage our young kids to start moving and to be active and to get outside and to enjoy play and active play, that we're taking steps in the right direction.\""

      "\"I would like to explore all these characters (in the 'Outlander' universe),\" Roberts explains. \"One of the things in 'Outlander' that we kept to is Jamie and Claire.

      "In the sequel, which hit theaters Friday, Aug. 8, the mother-daughter duo have a new yet eerily similar set of problems on their hands.",
      "Anna now has a daughter of her own, Harper (Julia Butters), making Tess a grandma. In \"Freaky Friday,\" Tess getting remarried caused strain for the family and similarly, in the sequel, tension arises as Anna plans a wedding with a single dad whose daughter goes to Harper\u2019s school.",
      "The caveat? Anna's new fianc\u00e9, Eric (Manny Jacinto), is the father of Harper's arch nemesis, Lily (Sophia Hammons). And so, naturally, the attempt to form a family of four doesn't bode well for the high schoolers.",

      "Despite Anna constantly telling her mom she's \"ruining my life\" in \"Freaky Friday,\" the adult character is more like Tess than she'd probably like to admit.",
      "The 2003 film begins with Tess trying several times to wake a reluctant Anna up for school. Similarly, the sequel opens with Anna attempting to wake her daughter, Harper, up. In the new movie, though, Harper is already up but snuck out to go surfing.",
      "Anna and Harper have a similarly tense mother-daughter relationship, while Tess is now the \u201ccool\u201d grandma.",
      "Dropping Harper off at school, Anna yells, \"Make good choices!\" an expression originally coined by Tess in the first film.",
      "An Oct. 3 Wedding",
      "Anna and Eric's wedding date in the film is Oct. 3, which is an iconic date for any \u201cMean Girls\u201d fans.",
      "In the 2004 movie, Lohan's character, Cady Heron is talking to her crush, Aaron Samuels, in math class. In the seemingly insignificant interaction, he asks her the date, and Cady's response has since served as a major quote from the film.",
      "\u201cOn October 3rd, he asked me what day it was,\u201d a voiceover of Lohan says in the film, giddy over her conversation with Aaron.",
      "Some now even deem Oct. 3 as \u201cMean Girls\u201d Day.",
      "The Earthquake Switches",
      "Just like in \"Freaky Friday,\" before the women swap bodies with one another in the sequel, they feel an earthquake. But when they observe the rest of the room, they appear to be the only ones who felt the shake.",
      "In \u201cFreakier Friday,\u201d Harper and Lily swap bodies with Anna and Tess, respectively. The teen girls \u2014 now in adult bodies as Lohan's and Curtis\u2019 characters \u2014 have a similar moment to the original film where they panic in a mirror at how \u201cold\u201d they look.",
      "Lohan and Curtis also recreate running into one another in an effort to switch back into their old bodies. But the teenagers \u2014 now Anna and Tess \u2014 tell the girls they tried that \"last time\" to no avail.",

      "\u201cParent Trap\u201d fans will likely notice a familiar face in \u201cFreakier Friday\u201d: Elaine Hendrix, aka Meredith Blake.",
      "In the 1998 remake of \u201cThe Parent Trap,\u201d Lohan played twins Hallie and Annie. Hendrix portrayed Meredith, the unlikable fianc\u00e9 to the twins\u2019 dad.",
      "In \u201cFreakier Friday,\u201d Hendrix makes a cameo as Blake Kale, who works for a magazine featuring Anna\u2019s client, pop star Ella, who she manages at her record label job. In a nod to her \u201cParent Trap\u201d character, Hendrix addresses Anna as \u201cpuss,\u201d which she called the twins in the late \u201890s movie.",

      "In a big moment at the end of \"Freakier Friday,\" Anna has the chance to reclaim her rockstar days with the band Pink Slip, who fans were first introduced to in \u201cFreaky Friday.\u201d Though time has passed, the characters allude to Pink Slip becoming a popular rock band prior to Anna welcoming her daughter, Harper.",
      "While Harper is in her mother's body, the band reunites for Anna to perform a song she wrote.",
      "In the first film, Anna \u2014 while still in Tess\u2019 body \u2014 had to be on guitar backstage to cover for her mom being unable to play. In the sequel, Anna \u2014 now in Harper's body \u2014 has to cover for her daughter. This time, however, the mom and daughter share a sweet moment performing together.",

      "Gomez, 33, said they first crossed paths in the '00s when they \"dated the Jonas Brothers\" at the same time.",
      "\"I dated Nick and she dated Joe,\" Gomez said with a laugh. Swift and Joe Jonas were linked in 2008.",
      "\"We were young. We all know and love each other now. It's so cute. We didn't know what we were doing. But, yeah, she and I like to say that the best thing we got out of those relationships was each other because it was really sweet,\" Gomez added.",

      "Gomez said Swift acted very \"sweet\" when she told her about \"Love Story.\"",

    "story": [
      "After days of percolating on the simply adorable photos of two of television\u2019s favorite stars, it\u2019s time for an unofficial investigation into what exactly is going on.",
      "Mariska Hargitay and Chris Meloni were recently seen on the set of \u201cLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit\u201d smiling, embracing and touching faces.",
      "The photos thrilled their fans for a multitude of reasons. Firstly, their characters, Capt. Olivia Benson and Detective Elliot Stabler, haven\u2019t physically been in the same scene on \u201cSVU\u201d since the Season 24 finale back in 2023 (yes, you read that right).",
      "Secondly, the beloved pair also reunited with one of their OG \u201cSVU\u201d co-stars, Dann Florek, who portrayed Special Victims Unit boss Capt. Donald Cragen until the character\u2019s retirement in Season 15. Meloni shared photos of himself with Hargitay and Florek on his Instagram page Aug. 2.",
      "\u201cHangin with friends on a Friday nite,\u201d he captioned the trio of pics.",
      "Florek last made an appearance on \u201cSVU\u201d via FaceTime during the show\u2019s 500th episode in 2021, and he\u2019s made some appearances on \u201cOC\u201d for some sentimental scenes with Meloni.",
      "He appeared to be casually dressed in his photos with Meloni and Hargitay, who were both sporting suits and looked to be in character.",
      "Hargitay posted about being together again with Meloni on Instagram Aug. 4, sharing a photo of her and her longtime friend holding hands and smiling.",
      "\u201cReunited,\u201d she wrote, along with two blue heart emoji.",
      "New Photos Show Mariska Hargitay and Chris Meloni, or Olivia Benson and Elliot Stabler, Hugging",
      "Now, to one of the most important points in this very unserious investigation: What is the story behind the photos of these two hugging?",
      "Cameras are visible in one of the pictures, which could mean fans will get just their fifth canon Benson-Stabler hug in 27 seasons. (We will never forget the one hug that was taken from us.)",
      "What Is Happening With Benson and Stabler's Relationship?",
      "There are also lingering questions about Benson and Stabler\u2019s relationship status. While Meloni guest-starred last season in a scene to rough up a guy who approached Benson\u2019s son, one of Stabler\u2019s last big \u201cSVU\u201d moments with Benson happened when they almost kissed in her kitchen back in Season 24.",
      "She later told him that was \u201ca bad time\u201d for her, and Stabler said it was \u201cjust not the right moment.\u201d (OK, then when is the right moment?)",
      "Let us not forget the compass necklace, a gift from Stabler to Benson in the Season 24 finale crossover event with \u201cOC.\u201d He told her he hoped it would lead her to happiness.",
      "Hargitay told TODAY.com in January 2024 that she and Meloni designed that necklace together.",
      "\u201cI wanted Chris\u2019 impact because he\u2019s so thoughtful and specific and does such a deep dive on things like this that matter,\u201d Hargitay said. \u201cI wanted it to mean as much to him as it meant to me. So he\u2019s the one that came up with what the (symbols on the compass) stood for.\u201d",
      "Meloni later told us the necklace symbolizes \u201ctrue north.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou know, you\u2019re the star by which you navigate,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was kind of a fitting \u2014 we\u2019ve both been navigating turbulent seas, whether it\u2019s in the storytelling part of it or in the personal life part of the storytelling. I think the sense of navigation.\u201d",
      "Benson loaned the necklace to a victim\u2019s mother in the Season 25 finale, and it hasn\u2019t been seen since. (We think it\u2019s the right moment to bring that back \u2014 unless she has found her happiness with a certain bald-headed detective.)",
      "When Were Benson and Stabler Last on Screen Together?",
      "Hargitay and Meloni\u2019s characters last shared the screen in the most recent season of \u201cOrganized Crime\u201d in an episode Meloni wrote.",
      "Stabler spent part of the episode in a coma, and Meloni told TODAY.com in April that Benson was his character\u2019s \u201cicebreaker\u201d that could \u201calmost break through\u201d Stabler\u2019s coma.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s her voice that he hears,\u201d he said.",
      "Benson and Stabler also shared some uncharacteristically silly scenes, like when Stabler wanted to leave the hospital and told Benson she could help him out or \u201cjust stand there and watch me get naked.\u201d",
      "Meloni described that moment as \u201ca nod to the fans.\u201d",
      "It was also important for him to write the episode featuring Hargitay because he said he \u201cinevitably\u201d rewrites their characters\u2019 scenes.",
      "\u201cI thought it was a natural and correct evolution to get to gain greater insight into their engagements \u2014 maybe not where they\u2019re going and all that stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are bigger-ticket items. How they speak to each other, how they feel about each other.\u201d",
      "One thing is for certain: It\u2019s about time viewers get some answers about what\u2019s going on with these two. And we can only hope that Season 27 of \u201cSVU,\u201d which premieres Sept. 25 on NBC, will give us some."

      "Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Hunting Wives\u201d has found its place on the platform\u2019s Top 10 list.",
      "Since its July 21 release, the television series, based on the novel by May Cobb, has evolved into a cultural moment, racking up over 11 million views on Netflix, per Deadline.",
      "On TikTok, thousands of viewers are sharing their thoughts on show\u2019s roller coaster of twists and soap-level drama.",
      "Where did all this buzz come from? Here\u2019s what to know about the show's appeal and the phenomenon it sparked.",
      "What is \u2018The Hunting Wives\u2019 about?",
      "Originally created for Starz, the erotic thriller was acquired by Netflix.",
      "\"The Hunting Wives\" follows PR exec Sophie O\u2019Neil (Brittany Snow) as she moves from Boston to East Texas with her architect husband Graham (Evan Jonigkeit). She immediately finds herself out of place in an inner circle of wealthy Southern housewives who call themselves the \"Hunting Wives.\"",
      "These women seemingly couldn't be more different from Sophie: Not only does the elite clique embrace gun culture, but also they also adopt an unabashed stay-at-home lifestyle that is foreign to her. When Sophie asks her new friends what they do for work, they emphasize that their job is to \u201cwife.\u201d",
      "Along with culture shock, Sophie grapples with her looming dark past through frequent flashbacks.",
      "Sophie eventually becomes enthralled by the group\u2019s queen bee, Margo Banks (Malin A\u030akerman), the wife of Graham\u2019s boss, Jed (Dermot Mulroney), an oil tycoon running for the governor of Texas. Margo takes Sophie under her wing, and their friendship quickly escalates into a steamy affair.",
      "A throughline of the show is its twisty murder plot. After local teenager Abby (Madison Wolfe) is found dead, Sophie finds herself inconveniently tangled in the mystery. As the town searches for the culprit, its residents cultivate messy love triangles and secret relationships on the side.",
      "Why has 'The Hunting Wives' become such a phenomenon?",
      "Part of the appeal of the \u201cThe Hunting Wives\u201d is that it goes there \u2014  all manner of daring places.",
      "Each character is shamelessly committed to making jaw-dropping decisions. Take, for example, Margo\u2019s affair with an 18-year-old high school student who also happens to be Abby\u2019s boyfriend. Or Sophie\u2019s decision to rashly secure a firearm, a choice that backfires after she blacks out on the night of Abby\u2019s death ... and her gun turns out to be the murder weapon.",
      "Then, of course, there are the show\u2019s multiple murders and frequent extramarital escapades.",
      "\u201cThe Hunting Wives\u2019 consistently prioritizes steamy scenes over sensible plotting or nuanced characters, juicy twists over deep emotions or big ideas. It might all be incredibly frustrating, if it were not also so wildly entertaining,\u201d The Hollywood Reporter writes of the show.",
      "The show\u2019s hype is not necessarily due to its quality: Some fans on Reddit point out, Margo\u2019s wig looks (perhaps purposefully) unrealistic, and there may be more than a few plot holes.",
      "Instead, the series\u2019 shock factor is what makes it bingeable.",
      "\u201cLook, it isn\u2019t Emmy award winning TV. The acting only ranges slightly fair. The characters are terrible people,\u201d one Reddit user writes. \u201cBut I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t sucked in from the very first episode.\u201d",
      "\u201cEverything has been said regarding it being the perfect summer sleazy schlockfest we all love,\u201d another adds.",
      "In addition to its wild plot twists, the show\u2019s depiction of Margo and Sophie\u2019s queer relationship has led to chatter.",
      "Them, an LGBTQ+ publication, writes that \u201cThe Hunting Wives\u201d might be \u201cthe gayest show of the year.\" Many fans have posted their reactions to Margo and Sophie\u2019s relationship, crediting the show's suggestive scenes for their sexual awakenings or awkward watch moments with family members.",
      "\u201cWith all of the attention the show is receiving, viewer reactions have proved feverish, with fans across party lines gamely questioning their sexuality after witnessing Margo\u2019s effects on Sophie,\u201d NBC Out writes of this phenomenon.",
      "Watchers also have also found themselves enthralled by the series\u2019 political message.",
      "\u201cWhen you first start watching the show, it\u2019s just a very fun, campy romp\u2026 It really feels like they are glamorizing this certain type of lifestyle. But, in actuality, it is such a scathing review of the hypocrisy of the nuclear family (and) God fearing Republicans,\u201d one reviewer theorizes on TikTok.",
      "\u201cPerhaps the show\u2019s most intriguing wrinkle involves incorporating just enough political references to feel like a satire of Southern-fried hypocrisy,\u201d Slate writes.",
      "This layer adds, for some, enough to turn the show from a beach read on screen to something a little deeper.",
      "However, not everyone is a fan \u2014 some criticize the show for being too vulgar or underdeveloped.",
      "But the show\u2019s blend of lustful romance, a messy murder plot and perhaps a bit of political humor is what has many fans knocking on Netflix\u2019s door for another salacious installment."

      "\u201cThe answer to Ukraine\u2019s territorial question is already in the constitution of Ukraine,\u201d Zelenskyy said in a message on Telegram early Saturday. \u201cNo one will and no one can deviate from it. Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier.\u201d",
      "His comments came after Trump announced on Truth Social that a long-awaited meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin had been scheduled for next Friday in Alaska.",
      "Further details and logistics of the meeting are still unclear and remain very fluid, including whether Zelenskyy will be involved. Trump did not mention the Ukrainian president in the post announcing the meeting with Putin.",
      "Later Friday, at the White House, Trump suggested that there have been talks about Russia and Ukraine potentially \u201cswapping\u201d territory as part of a ceasefire deal. \u201cThere\u2019ll be some swapping of territories to the betterment of both and ... we\u2019ll be talking about that either later or tomorrow, or whatever.\u201d",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Aug 2025 23:26:27 GMT",
    "summary": "Israel\u2019s plan to take control of Gaza City and hand control of the enclave to \u201cArab forces\u201d has drawn condemnation by Western governments and former officials.",
    "story": [
      "Israel\u2019s plan to seize Gaza City and hand control of the enclave to unspecified \u201cArab forces\u201d has not only drawn condemnation by Western governments and aid agencies \u2014 some former officials and experts inside Israel say it would be unworkable.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his security cabinet voted early on Friday for a plan to capture the city in the north of the enclave, one of the few places inside the strip that the Israeli military does not control, while distributing aid to civilians outside combat zones.",
      "The five-point plan \u201cfor concluding the war\u201d calls for the disarming of Hamas, the return of all hostages and the demilitarization of the Gaza Strip, which would be under Israeli security control. It also proposes that a government is established in Gaza that involves neither Islamist militants from Hamas, who have ruled the enclave since 2007, or the Palestinian Authority, the more secular governing body that has overseen parts of the occupied West Bank since the mid-1990s and is internationally recognized.",
      "The basics of the plan are likely unfeasible because it relies on cooperation from Arab states that have explicitly said they will not do so under these terms, according to Giora Eiland, a retired Israeli major general and former head of the country\u2019s National Security Council.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know whether Netanyahu has any real basis to what he said, whether he has any communication with other countries about the future of Gaza,\u201d Eiland told NBC News in a telephone interview Friday. \u201cAnd I\u2019m afraid that his statement\u201d \u2014 about Arab nations being given control of Gaza \u2014 \u201chas no real, reliable basis behind it.\u201d",
      "Arab states such as Egypt and Jordan have \u201cclearly indicated time and again\u201d that a precondition for their involvement would be that the Palestinian Authority becomes a \u201cleading actor\u201d in Gaza\u2019s future governance, said Nimrod Goren, president of the Mitvim Institute, an Israeli think tank.",
      "Netanyahu had suggested earlier in the war that, rather than the Palestinian Authority or Hamas, he wanted Palestinian \u201cclans\u201d to take control of the enclave, and indeed he confirmed in June that Israel was arming such groups.",
      "But his hopes of these \u201cclans taking over Gaza haven\u2019t materialized, and aren\u2019t expected to,\u201d said Goren, who is also an executive board member at Diplomeds, or the Council for Mediterranean Diplomacy, a policy group based in the Netherlands.",
      "Ultimately, \u201cthe plan approved by the Israeli cabinet is damaging for Israel\u2019s national security and foreign policy. It is also unrealistic in terms of its end game,\u201d Goren added. All of this reinforces the \u201ccommon perception in Israel that Netanyahu is acting due to his own political needs, rather than the national good and concern for the Israeli hostages,\u201d he said.",
      "NBC News has contacted Netanyahu\u2019s office for a response to these criticisms.",
      "International outcry",
      "Israel\u2019s plan has been met with outcry internationally, with the United Nations and some Western governments warning it would lead to further catastrophe for Palestinians in Gaza, more than 61,000 of whom have been killed in the 22 months of war with Israel.",
      "Large parts of Gaza\u2019s population have been regularly displaced since Israel launched its offensive following the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attacks in which some 1,200 people were killed in Israel and around 250 taken hostage. Crippling aid restrictions in recent months have caused the spiraling hunger crisis in Gaza, the United Nations and aid groups have said.",
      "Voices inside Israel have been similarly alarmed by the plan, with the families of hostages and even Israel\u2019s own armed forces chief of staff, Eyal Zamir, warning it will lead to the deaths of the remaining captives inside the enclave.",
      "Aerial photographs this week showed the utter devastation in the enclave, while Israel\u2019s overhauled aid distribution plan has fueled more chaos and hunger.",
      "Eiland, the retired Israeli general, supports the war, like the majority of the country\u2019s population. Nevertheless, he said he disagreed with Netanyahu\u2019s plan because he thinks most of the hostages \u201cwill perish\u201d and the Israeli army would \u201csuffer many casualties.\u201d",
      "Even if Israel managed to somehow execute its plan, \u201cwe will not change anything in the approach of Hamas,\u201d Eiland added. \u201cOn the contrary, it will just give them justification to continuing their guerrilla war against us.\u201d"

      "On Wednesday, people in Hiroshima commemorated the 80th anniversary of the devastating attack, as nuclear fears mount globally amid unresolved military conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East.",
      "In a one-minute silent tribute, the city remembered the widescale death and destruction caused by the 10,000-pound bomb, which created a huge mushroom cloud that rose to more than 60,000 feet.",
      "\u201cIt is our duty to convey the reality of the atomic bombings not only to the people of Japan but also to the people of the world,\u201d Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said in a speech.",
      "Initially meant to strike a T-shaped bridge, the bomb veered instead toward an exhibition hall with a distinctive dome, which after the explosion was the only building still standing within a 1-mile radius.",
      "The blast unleashed a whirlwind of fire and force, incinerating thousands of people. Then came the radioactive black rain, which fell over the city, silently poisoning countless more.",
      "Teruko Yahata was 8 years old at the time.",
      "Yahata, who is now in her 80s, says she still has a scar from when she was hurled by the blast. Fearing another bomb, she huddled under a blanket with her family.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 An unkept promise of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency is that he\u2019d end the war between Russia and Ukraine in one swift diplomatic masterstroke.",
      "Trump made threats. He applied pressure. Still, the bombs keep falling, the casualties continue to pile up.",
      "Now, Trump is betting that a face-to-face meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin will yield the elusive breakthrough and possibly quell concerns among voters about his handling of the war.",
      "The summit taking place Friday on friendly turf, the red state of Alaska, amounts to one of the biggest gambits of Trump\u2019s second term. Hosting the meeting raises expectations that he\u2019ll stop the fighting. The president faces traps in sitting down with Putin, who is well-versed in the territorial issues at stake, but he also enjoys economic and military leverage. Creating a durable peace that will preserve Ukraine\u2019s independence will test the dealmaking skills that are Trump\u2019s point of pride.",
      "\u201cIf you roll into the meeting not prepped, you can get jammed by Putin,\u201d said Michael McFaul, who was U.S. ambassador to Russia in the Obama administration. \u201cSummits are to achieve an objective that advances American national interests. They\u2019re the means to end, and I sometimes feel that Trump feels the meeting is an end in itself.\u201d",
      "Inside the Trump administration, a national security official acknowledged that forging a peace accord won\u2019t be easy. One of the combatants won't be at the table: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has refused to relinquish territory to Russia that was illegally annexed.",
      "\u201cWhether or not there\u2019s a breakthrough in the next week or two, we\u2019ll find out,\u201d said the Trump administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cUltimately, Putin and Zelenskyy have to be able to agree on something fundamentally. Third parties can do anything they want, but these two men have to agree to things.\u201d",
      "Sitting in a room with Putin, a canny negotiator in his own right, Trump may be lured into endorsing a peace deal that carves up Ukraine, foreign policy experts caution.",
      "\u201cI worry that in the eagerness to look like a peacemaker, President Trump will say, \u2018Yeah, that sounds like a good idea to me,\u2019\u201d McFaul said. \u201cPutin will say, \u2018Donetsk [a city in eastern Ukraine] was always part of Russia.\u2019 And Trump will say, \u2018You\u2019re right about that.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cPutin is good at those stories,\u201d McFaul continued. \u201cHe knows his history, and he can be engaging in his narrative. That\u2019s what the president needs to be ready for and his team needs to get him ready for.\u201d",
      "Another possibility is that Putin tries to stall the president further, promising concessions he has no intention of making in hopes of consolidating gains on the battlefield, one former U.S. official said.",
      "Putin may try to \u201cdivert President Trump from Trump\u2019s goal of stopping the war and establishing a ceasefire by promising things later,\u201d said William Taylor, who was charge d\u2019affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine during Trump\u2019s first term. \u201cThen, Putin continues to fight and continues to kill Ukrainians.\u201d",
      "No matter the outcome, Putin comes away with at least a symbolic victory: He\u2019s getting a large, bright stage at a time when he\u2019s an international pariah. Two years ago, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Putin, accusing him of war crimes involving the abduction of Ukrainian children. The warrant substantially limited potential locations for the two world leaders to meet.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump \u2014 just by going to a meeting with Putin, who for most of the democratic world is a rogue, imperialist dictator \u2014 is giving him legitimacy,\u201d McFaul said.",
      "The summit will inevitably invite comparisons to one held in Helsinki in 2018.",
      "At a joint news conference with Putin that year, Trump came off as eager to forge a personal connection after years of icy bilateral relations between the U.S and Russia. Citing Putin\u2019s denial of interfering in the 2016 presidential race, Trump said at the time: \u201cI don\u2019t see any reason why it would be\u201d Russia that meddled in his victory over Hillary Clinton that year. (He later claimed he had misspoken, affirming that he believed the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that Russian meddling had occurred but added that there \u201ccould be other people also\u201d who interfered in the 2016 election.)",
      "This time around, Trump is more seasoned and has grown impatient with Putin\u2019s conduct of the war. He has suggested that his wife, Melania Trump, has influenced his view of Putin, reminding him of the damage that Russia has inflicted on Ukraine.",
      "For his part, Putin is more diminished. As of this summer, Russian casualties were expected to hit 1 million. If he chooses, Trump could punish Russia for prolonging the war by slapping secondary sanctions on countries that purchase Russian energy, a step he has threatened to take.",
      "\u201cTrump is in a stronger position this time than in that first meeting,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIf President Trump goes into the meeting with Putin and exercises the political, military and economic leverage that he\u2019s got, there could be a ceasefire.\u201d",
      "Trump heads into the summit facing difficulties at home. His administration has struggled to stem the backlash from his base over the Jeffrey Epstein case. Last week, Trump fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics following a hiring report that showed weak job growth.",
      "A recent poll from the University of Massachusetts Amherst showed that Trump\u2019s approval rating was 38% \u2014 a 6-point drop from April.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s pretty close to the theoretical floor in this polarized era for approval ratings,\u201d said Alexander Theodoridis, director of the poll.",
      "Among Trump voters, support for his handling of the Russia-Ukraine war stood at 64% compared to other issues on which they approved of his performance by significantly higher margins, Theodoridis said. A total of 85% of Trump\u2019s 2024 voters approved of his performance on immigration issues; 78% favored his work on jobs; and 71% on tariffs.",
      "Statecraft is a proven way for presidents to improve their standing at home. A commander in chief enjoys far more latitude in shaping events in the foreign policy arena than when it comes to domestic affairs.",
      "The summit, said Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat who serves on the Foreign Relations Committee, \u201cwill change the subject in a positive way for Trump if he actually stands up to Putin and demands a just peace for Ukraine.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat would be a positive diversion,\u201d Coons added. \u201cBut it would be the worst of both worlds if it [the summit] is intended both to be a diversion from the domestic focus on things like tariffs and Epstein, and he fails to be strong.\u201d",
      "An added incentive for Trump to end the conflict could be an award that he seems to covet. His White House appears to be methodically building a case that he has earned the Nobel Peace Prize, drawing attention to various efforts to reduce tensions in global hot spots.",
      "Jan. 31 is the deadline for nominating candidates for the 2026 prize. The Nobel selection committee will announce the winner in October of that year.",
      "On Friday, Trump held a ceremony in the White House to mark a U.S.-brokered accord ending hostilities between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Questioned by reporters, the leaders of both countries touted Trump\u2019s candidacy for a prize that three other American presidents have won. Barack Obama was the most recent winner, in 2009.",
      "Still, the peace deal between Armenia and Azerbaijan would be merely an amuse-bouche compared to ending the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, a nuclear-armed power.",
      "\u201cPutin is clearly in a weaker position,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThis invasion of Ukraine has turned out to be a disaster for him. And Trump has the cards this time. He\u2019s got leverage, experience and confidence. He\u2019s eager to solve this problem and end the war. He sees that Putin is the problem. Putin is standing between him and the end of the war.\u201d"

      "NAGASAKI, Japan \u2014 Nagasaki is marking the U.S. atomic attack on the southern Japanese city 80 years ago and survivors of the attack are working to make their hometown the last place on earth hit by the bomb.",
      "Despite their pain from wounds, discrimination and illnesses from radiation, survivors have publicly committed to a shared goal of abolishing nuclear weapons. But recently they worry about the world moving in the opposite direction as the anniversary is commemorated Saturday.",
      "The atomic bomb dropped by the United States on Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945, killed some 70,000 people, three days after the bombing of Hiroshima killed 140,000. Japan surrendered on Aug. 15, 1945, ending World War II and the country\u2019s nearly half-century of aggression across Asia.",
      "Aging survivors and their supporters in Nagasaki now put their hopes of achieving nuclear weapons abolition in the hands of younger people, telling them the attack is not distant history, but an issue that remains relevant to their future.",
      "Teruko Yokoyama, an 83-year-old member of a Nagasaki organization supporting survivors, said she feels the absence of those she has worked, which fuels her strong desire to document the lives of remaining survivors.",
      "The number of survivors has fallen to 99,130, about a quarter of the original number, with their average age exceeding 86. Survivors worry about fading memories, as the youngest of the survivors were too young to recall the attack clearly.",
      "\u201cWe must keep records of the atomic bombing damages of the survivors and their lifetime story,\u201d said Yokoyama, whose two sisters died after suffering illnesses linked to radiation.",
      "Her organization has started to digitalize the narratives of survivors for viewing on YouTube and other social media platforms with the help of a new generation.",
      "\u201cThere are younger people who are beginning to take action,\u201d Yokoyama told The Associated Press on Friday. \u201cSo I think we don\u2019t have to get depressed yet.\u201d",
      "Nagasaki hosted a \u201cpeace forum\u201d on Friday where survivors shared their stories with more than 300 young people from around the country. Seiichiro Mise, a 90-year-old survivor, said he is handing seeds of \u201cflowers of peace\u201d to the younger generation in hopes of seeing them bloom.",
      "On Saturday at 11:02 a.m., the moment the plutonium bomb exploded above Nagasaki, participants are to set to observe a moment of silence as a peace bell rings.",
      "About 3,000 people, including representatives from 95 countries, were expected to attend the event at Nagasaki Peace Park, where Mayor Shiro Suzuki and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba were scheduled to speak.",
      "The twin bells at Urakami Cathedral, which was destroyed in the bombing, are to ring together again for the first time. One of the bells had gone missing afer the attack but was restored by volunteers.",
      "Survivors and their families started paying tribute at the park, as well as at the nearby hypocenter park, hours before the official ceremony.",
      "Survivors are frustrated by a growing nuclear threat and support among international leaders for developing or possessing nuclear weapons for deterrence. They criticize the Japanese government\u2019s refusal to sign or even participate in the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons because Japan, as an American ally, needs U.S. nuclear possession as deterrence.",
      "Nagasaki invited representatives from all countries to attend the ceremony on Saturday. China notably notified the city it would not be present without providing a reason.",
      "The ceremony last year stirred controversy due to the absence of the U.S. ambassador and other Western envoys in response to the Japanese city\u2019s refusal to invite Israel."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan shook hands Friday at a White House peace summit before signing an agreement aimed at ending decades of conflict.",
      "President Donald Trump was in the middle as Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan flanked him on either side. As the two extended their arms in front of Trump to shake hands, the U.S. leader reached up and clasped his hands around theirs.",
      "The two countries in the South Caucasus signed agreements with each other and the U.S. that will reopen key transportation routes while allowing the U.S. to seize on Russia\u2019s declining influence in the region. The deal includes an agreement that will create a major transit corridor to be named the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity, the White House said.",
      "Trump said at the White House on Friday that naming the route after him was \u201ca great honor for me\u201d but \u201cI didn\u2019t ask for this.\u201d A senior administration official, on a call before the event with reporters, said it was the Armenians who suggested the name.",
      "Trump has sought to be known as a peacemaker and made no secret of the fact that he covets a Nobel Peace Prize. Friday\u2019s signing adds to a series of peace and economic agreements brokered by the U.S. this year.",
      "Both leaders said the breakthrough was made possible by Trump and his team.",
      "\u201cWe are laying a foundation to write a better story than the one we had in the past,\u201d Pashinyan said, calling the agreement a \u201csignificant milestone.\u201d",
      "\u201cPresident Trump in six months did a miracle,\u201d Aliyev said.",
      "Trump remarked on how long the conflict went on between the two countries. \u201cThirty-five years they fought, and now they\u2019re friends and they\u2019re going to be friends a long time,\u201d he said.",
      "That route will connect Azerbaijan and its autonomous Nakhchivan exclave, which are separated by a 32-kilometer-wide (20-mile-wide) patch of Armenian territory. The demand from Azerbaijan had held up peace talks in the past.",
      "For Azerbaijan, a major producer of oil and gas, the route also provides a more direct link to Turkey and onward to Europe.",
      "Trump indicated he\u2019d like to visit the route, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to get over there.\u201d",
      "Asked how he feels about lasting peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan, Trump said \u201cvery confident.\u201d",
      "Aliyev and Pashinyan on Friday joined a growing list of foreign leaders and other officials who have said Trump should receive the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in helping ease long-running conflicts across the globe.",
      "The peace deal between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda helped end the decades-long conflict in eastern Congo, and the U.S. mediated a ceasefire between India and Pakistan, while Trump intervened in clashes between Cambodia and Thailand by threatening to withhold trade agreements with both countries if their fighting continued. Yet peace deals in Gaza and Ukraine have been elusive.",
      "US takes advantage of Russia\u2019s waning influence",
      "The signing of a deal between Armenia and Azerbaijan, both former Soviet republics, also strikes a geopolitical blow to their former imperial master, Russia. Throughout the nearly four-decade conflict, Moscow played mediator to expand its clout in the strategic South Caucasus region, but its influence waned quickly after it launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The Trump-brokered deal would allow the U.S. to deepen its reach in the region as Moscow retreats, senior U.S. administration officials said.",
      "The Trump administration began engaging with Armenia and Azerbaijan in earnest earlier this year, when Trump\u2019s key diplomatic envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with Aliyev in Baku and started to discuss what a senior administration official called a \u201cregional reset.\u201d",
      "Negotiations over who will develop the Trump Route \u2014 which will eventually include a rail line, oil and gas pipelines, and fiber optic lines \u2014 will likely begin next week, and at least nine developers have expressed interest already, according to the senior administration official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.",
      "Separate from the joint agreement, both Armenia and Azerbaijan signed deals with the United States meant to bolster cooperation in energy, technology and the economy, the White House said.",
      "Trump previewed much of Friday\u2019s plan in a social media post Thursday evening, in which he said the agreements would \u201cfully unlock the potential\u201d of the South Caucasus region.",
      "\u201cMany Leaders have tried to end the War, with no success, until now, thanks to \u2018TRUMP,\u2019\u201d Trump said on his Truth Social site.",
      "The Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict has lasted for decades",
      "The two nations were locked in conflict for nearly four decades as they fought for control of the Karabakh region, known internationally as Nagorno-Karabakh.",
      "The area was largely populated by Armenians during the Soviet era but is located within Azerbaijan. The two nations battled for control of the region through multiple violent clashes that left tens of thousands of people dead over the decades, all while international mediation efforts failed.",
      "Most recently, Azerbaijan reclaimed all of Karabakh in 2023 and had been in talks with Armenia to normalize ties. Azerbaijan\u2019s insistence on a land bridge to Nakhchivan had been a major sticking point, because while Azerbaijan did not trust Armenia to control the so-called Zangezur corridor, Armenia resisted control by a third party because it viewed it as a breach of sovereignty.",
      "But the prospect of closer ties with the United States, as well as being able to move in and out of the landlocked nation more freely without having to access Georgia or Iran, helped entice Armenia on the broader agreement, according to U.S. officials.",
      "Meanwhile, Russia stood back when Azerbaijan reclaimed control of Karabakh in the September 2023 offensive, angering Armenia, which has moved to shed Russian influence and turn westward. Azerbaijan, emboldened by its victory in Karabakh, also has become increasingly defiant in its relations with Moscow."

    "story": [
      "After months of delays and extensions, President Donald Trump\u2019s comprehensive and sweeping tariffs slate took effect Thursday just after midnight ET, shifting his global trade reset into high gear.",
      "Most imports into the United States will now face a baseline 10% duty, with the overall average effective tariff rate rising to more than 17% \u2014 the highest since 1935, during the Great Depression \u2014 thanks to higher duties on some of the biggest U.S. trading partners, according to the nonpartisan Yale Budget Lab think tank.",
      "A wide variety of products will be hit. Tariffs will be collected on everything from European Union appliances and Japanese cars to food, furniture and toys from China and TVs from South Korea. Selected oil and gas imports, along with some smartphones and a suite of goods covered by a pre-existing trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, are not affected.",
      "Together, the duties are the most significant move yet by a president set on tilting the global economy even more in favor of the United States.",
      "Trump was online to celebrate the moment.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s midnight! Billions of dollars in tariffs are now flowing into the United States of America!\u201d he said in an all-caps post on Truth Social.",
      "So far, the duties have mainly been jostling the U.S. economy instead. Tariffs, which are taxes on imports collected by the federal government, generally tend to raise costs, although there is some debate among economists about whether businesses or consumers ultimately bear the weight of those increased prices.",
      "Yale\u2019s Budget Lab calculates that the inflationary effect of tariffs will cost a typical household an average of as much as $2,400 this year. It forecasts one of the biggest impacts in clothing, with consumers facing 40% higher prices for shoes and 38% higher costs for apparel in the short run as retailers that rely on importing clothes from South and Southeast Asia shift supply chains or grapple with higher costs.",
      "Global markets largely shrugged off the new tariffs, with European and Asian shares mostly higher on Thursday, CNBC reported. U.S. stock futures were also up slightly.",
      "But Thursday is not the end of Trump\u2019s trade offensive.",
      "Trump told CNBC on Tuesday he still plans to impose import taxes on pharmaceutical products and semiconductors. Currently, only about a quarter of manufacturing facilities supplying the United States with key drug ingredients are actually based here, equating to a $116 billion deficit with the rest of the world. As for semiconductors, the United States imports $40 billion worth, though the figure can also include chips produced in the United States, shipped abroad and repackaged inside finished goods.",
      "Trump has also shown continued willingness to ratchet up duty levels at a moment\u2019s notice. On Wednesday, he hiked the tariff rate for India to 50% over the nation\u2019s purchases of Russian oil, which he said was allowing Russia to continue to finance its war in Ukraine. Brazil, too, now faces 50% duties as a result of Trump\u2019s displeasure with its treatment of former President Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally who has been detained on coup charges.",
      "Trump also told CNBC he could raise the European Union\u2019s tariff level to 35% from 15% if it reneges on an investment commitment. Taken together, the 27-nation bloc is the largest U.S. trading partner.",
      "The Trump administration continues to insist tariffs are working, pointing to billions raised in new monthly revenues for the U.S. government. The White House also notes that nations have pledged hundreds of billions of dollars in investments, though no details about how that money will be spent have been released. Stock indexes have also set all-time highs.",
      "\u201cThe markets have seen what we\u2019re doing and celebrated,\u201d Kevin Hassett, director of Trump\u2019s National Economic Council, said Sunday on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d",
      "Market analysts say those gains have been largely driven by tech and bets on artificial intelligence, offsetting growing signs of weakness elsewhere, like a slowing labor market and softer consumer spending."

      "HONG KONG \u2014 Police in southwestern China scuffled this week with protesters demanding greater justice for a 14-year-old girl bullied by her schoolmates, the latest in a series of such incidents that have drawn national attention.",
      "The unusual public outrage was set off by videos widely shared on Chinese social media showing a group of teenage girls verbally and physically attacking the victim in Jiangyou, a city in Sichuan province.",
      "Local residents, some of whom were spurred by what authorities said were false reports that the alleged attackers\u2019 families had official ties, have faced off with police they accuse of letting them off too lightly.",
      "\u201cYour children will meet children of officials who are more senior than you. What if they beat your children?\u201d a man said from behind a barricade in a video verified by NBC News.",
      "Other verified videos, many of which Chinese censors swiftly took down, showed a large crowd gathered in Jiangyou on Monday night, at times singing the Chinese national anthem as the police presence grew. Some people could be seen struggling with police officers on the ground before being taken away.",
      "Reached by phone Wednesday, a spokesperson for the Sichuan Public Security Department declined to comment and referred to earlier statements.",
      "Local police in Jiangyou said the incident took place July 22, when a 15-year-old girl surnamed Liu and two others, ages 13 and 14, assaulted the 14-year-old victim, surnamed Lai, in a vacant building. Bystanders recorded the incident and uploaded it online, police said in a statement Monday.",
      "The assault caused multiple contusions to Lai\u2019s scalp and knees, police said, though all injuries were \u201cminor.\u201d After an investigation, authorities \u201cpromptly\u201d expressed sympathy for the victim and took action, the statement said.",
      "Liu and another alleged perpetrator, who were subject to \u201cpublic security penalties,\u201d are being sent to a special school for corrective education, the police said, while the remaining bystanders were \u201ccriticized and educated.\u201d",
      "It was not immediately clear what exactly the punishment entails and why one of the three alleged abusers was not penalized. Under Chinese law, anyone who engages in severe group fighting can be detained for up to 15 days and fined up to 1,000 yuan ($139), but juvenile offenders are exempted from detention and sent for corrective education, instead.",
      "Cyber police in the city of Mianyang, which administers Jiangyou, said in a statement Tuesday that the parents of the three alleged attackers were not lawyers or police officers but that \u201ctwo are unemployed, two work outside the province, one is a local shop assistant, and one is a local food delivery worker.\u201d",
      "They said two internet users accused of posting the false information had been \u201cadministratively punished.\u201d",
      "The attack has been widely discussed on Chinese social media, where commenters expressed anger over what they considered relatively light penalties.",
      "\u201cOnly a heavy penalty can serve as a warning,\u201d a user wrote on the popular Chinese social media platform Weibo. \u201cThis is really abhorrent.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s truly infuriating and heartbreaking,\u201d another said. \u201cIf such behaviors go unpunished, we will eventually pay a heavy price.\u201d",
      "More than 50% of Chinese students have endured school bullying, including verbal abuse, social exclusion and threats of violence, according to a recent survey by the state-backed China Youth & Children Research Center.",
      "The issue of bullying has been getting more attention in China after several high-profile cases.",
      "In January, violent protests erupted in the northwestern province of Shaanxi over a teenage student who fell to his death at a vocational school after a \u201cverbal and physical altercation\u201d with another student. Investigators ruled out any crime.",
      "In December, a Chinese court in the northern province of Hebei sentenced a teenager to life imprisonment and another to 12 years over the murder of their 13-year-old schoolmate, who was buried in an abandoned greenhouse after being killed by a shovel.",
      "A third suspect, who like the others was 13 at the time of the crime, was sentenced to corrective education.",
      "Chinese authorities acknowledge that some minors take advantage of the lower penalties generally available for those under 16 and commit multiple offenses before that age, state-run broadcaster CCTV News reported in June.",
      "The country\u2019s top legislature passed an amendment that month that would allow minors ages 14 to 16 to be detained over \u201cserious and harmful\u201d offenses starting next year."

      "France\u2019s biggest wildfire in years was spreading quickly Wednesday in a Mediterranean region near Spain after leaving one person dead and several injured, authorities said. The fire burned an area larger than Paris, and the military was called in to help.",
      "French Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou deplored a \u201cdisaster on an unprecedented scale\u201d in the region.",
      "Over 2,100 firefighters and several water bomber aircraft battled the blaze that broke out Tuesday afternoon in the village of Ribaute in the Aude region, a rural, wooded area that is home to wineries.",
      "The fire, which has burned 39,500 acres, remained \u201cvery active\u201d on Wednesday and continued to progress as night fell, the local administration said. The weather was hot, dry and windy, making it difficult for firefighters to contain the blaze.",
      "Villagers sought to help douse the flames or save their homes and small businesses, and described their alarm at the fire\u2019s speed. Ash filled the air and coated windows and cars, and several roads were closed around the region.",
      "\u201cThe sky was blue, and then less than an hour later the sky was orange,\u201d said Andy Pickup of Saint-Laurent-de-la-Cabrerisse, at the heart of the fire zone. \u201cThat\u2019s when we went out and tried to help.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe heard pops and cracks \u2014 it was the trees, it was the village,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cWe could see the fires taking hold on all the hills around Saint-Laurent.\u201d At dusk, he said, they saw fires in every direction, some as near as 100 yards away.",
      "Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said the military will reinforce efforts starting from Thursday, with several dozen soldiers to be deployed.",
      "One person died in their home, and at least 13 others were injured, including 11 firefighters, local authorities said. Three people were missing, the prefecture said.",
      "Jacques Piraux, mayor of the village of Jonqui\u00e8res, said all residents have been evacuated.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a scene of sadness and desolation,\u201d he told broadcaster BFM TV after visiting there on Wednesday morning. \u201cIt looks like a lunar landscape, everything is burned. More than half or three-quarters of the village has burned down. It\u2019s hellish.\u201d",
      "Residents and tourists in nearby areas were requested to remain in their homes unless told to evacuate. Two campgrounds were evacuated as a precaution.",
      "The prime minister met Wednesday afternoon with firefighters and residents at Saint-Laurent-de-la-Cabrerisse, where the fire service\u2019s command post has been set up. He said he came to express \u201cnational solidarity.\u201d",
      "The area\u2019s economy is relying on winery and tourism and \u201cboth sectors are affected,\u201d he stressed.",
      "Bayrou said an investigation is ongoing to determine the cause of the fire.",
      "The environment ministry said the Aude region has been experiencing a drought this month, with water use restrictions in place. Lack of rainfall in recent months \u201cplayed a major role in the spreading of the fire, since the vegetation is very dry,\u201d the statement said.",
      "This week\u2019s fire was the biggest since the creation of a national fire database in 2006, according to the national emergency service.",
      "Southern Europe has seen multiple large fires this summer. Scientists warn that climate change is exacerbating the frequency and intensity of heat and dryness, making the region more vulnerable to wildfires. Last month, a wildfire that reached the southern port of Marseille, France\u2019s second-largest city, left around 300 people injured.",
      "Europe is the world\u2019s fastest-warming continent, with temperatures increasing at twice the speed of the global average since the 1980s, according to the European Union\u2019s Copernicus Climate Change Service.",

      "Richard Bennett said in a report to the U.N. General Assembly circulated Wednesday that after seizing power in 2021 the Taliban suspended the 2004 constitution and laws protecting the rights of women and girls. These include a landmark law that criminalized 22 forms of violence against women, including rape and child and forced marriage.",
      "The Taliban dismissed all judges under the previous U.S.-backed government, including approximately 270 women, replacing them with men who share their extreme Islamic views, lack legal training and hand down decisions based on edicts issued by the Taliban, he said.",
      "In addition, he noted that the Taliban have assumed full control over law enforcement and investigative agencies, systematically purging Afghans who worked for the previous government.",
      "Bennett, who was appointed by the Geneva-based U.N. Human Rights Council, focused on access to justice and protection for women and girls in his report. He said he held meetings, focus-group discussions and one-on-one interviews with more that 110 Afghans inside and outside the country. He did so remotely because the Taliban have refused to grant him a visa to travel to Afghanistan.",
      "Since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan, their crackdown on women and girls has been widely reported and globally denounced.",
      "Taliban leaders have barred education for women and girls beyond sixth grade, banned most employment, and prohibited women from many public spaces, including parks, gyms and hairdressers. New laws ban women\u2019s voices and bare faces outside the home.",
      "The Taliban remain isolated from the West because of their restrictions on women and girls and have only been recognized by Russia.",
      "Bennett said the Taliban did not respond to an advance copy of the report and a request for information about their efforts to ensure access to justice and protection for women and girls.",
      "The Taliban defend their approach to justice by claiming they are implementing Islamic sharia law, but Islamic scholars and others have said their interpretation is unparalleled in other Muslim-majority countries and does not adhere to Islamic teachings. They say protecting the legal rights of women is a priority.",
      "Bennett said, however, that women have virtually no rights.",
      "\u201cToday, there are no women judges or prosecutors and no officially registered female lawyers, leaving women and girls with fewer safe channels to report abuse or seek redress,\u201d he wrote. \u201cCoupled with a lack of female officials in the police and other institutions, the result is widespread underreporting of violence and discrimination against women and girls.\u201d",
      "Bennett said access to justice for girls \u201cis further undermined by the dismantling of key legal safeguards and institutions protecting the rights of children,\u201d including juvenile courts and juvenile rehabilitation centers.",
      "The Taliban requirement that a woman must be accompanied by a male relative also creates barriers to filing complaints and attending court proceedings, he said, and disproportionately affects widows, women who are the heads of their households, the displaced and disabled.",
      "\u201cWomen who engage with the Taliban court system \u2014 whether as victims seeking redress, to resolve family issues, to obtain official documents or as alleged offenders \u2014 face a hostile environment,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cCourts often reject complaints made by women and are especially reluctant to accept cases relating to divorce, child custody and gender-based violence.\u201d",
      "Facing these obstacles, Bennett said, women increasingly turn to traditional and informal justice mechanisms, including formal jirgas and shuras \u2014 community councils of elders \u2014 and informal mediation by religious leaders, community elders or family. But these are all male-dominated and raise \u201cserious concerns about the rights of women and girls,\u201d he said.",
      "He said international forums offer the best hope for justice. He pointed to the International Criminal Court\u2019s request on Jan. 23 for arrest warrants for two senior Taliban leaders accused of crimes against humanity for persecution \u201con gender grounds.\u201d And he urged all countries to support efforts to bring Afghanistan before the International Court of Justice, the U.N.\u2019s highest tribunal, for violating the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women."
