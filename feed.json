    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump says he is considering revoking actress and comedian Rosie O\u2019Donnell\u2019s U.S. citizenship",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump says he is considering \u201ctaking away\u201d the U.S. citizenship of a longtime rival, actress and comedian Rosie O\u2019Donnell, despite a decades-old Supreme Court ruling that expressly prohibits such an action by the government.",
      "\u201cBecause of the fact that Rosie O\u2019Donnell is not in the best interests of our Great Country, I am giving serious consideration to taking away her Citizenship,\u201d Trump wrote in a social media post on Saturday. He added that O'Donnell, who moved to Ireland in January, should stay in Ireland \u201cif they want her.\u201d",
      "The two have criticized each other publicly for years, an often bitter back-and-forth that predates Trump\u2019s involvement in politics. In recent days, O\u2019Donnell on social media denounced Trump and recent moves by his administration, including the signing of a massive GOP-backed tax breaks and spending cuts plan.",
      "It's just the latest threat by Trump to revoke the citizenship of people with whom he has publicly disagreed, most recently his former adviser and one-time ally, Elon Musk.",
      "But O'Donnell's situation is notably different from Musk, who was born in South Africa. O'Donnell was born in the United States and has a constitutional right to U.S. citizenship. The U.S. State Department notes on its website that U.S. citizens by birth or naturalization may relinquish U.S. nationality by taking certain steps \u2013 but only if the act is performed voluntary and with the intention of relinquishing U.S. citizenship.",
      "Amanda Frost, a law professor at the University of Virginia School of Law, noted the Supreme Court ruled in a 1967 case that the Fourteen Amendment of the Constitution prevents the government from taking away citizenship.",
      "\u201cThe president has no authority to take away the citizenship of a native-born U.S. citizen,\" Frost said in an email Saturday. \u201cIn short, we are nation founded on the principle that the people choose the government; the government cannot choose the people.\u201d",
      "O'Donnell moved to Ireland after Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris to win his second term. She has said she's in the process of obtaining Irish citizenship based on family lineage.",
      "Responding to Trump Saturday, O\u2019Donnell wrote on social media that she had upset the president and \u201cadd me to the list of people who oppose him at every turn.\u201d",

      "Bad Bunny\u2019s latest album, \u201cDeB\u00cd TiRAR M\u00e1S FOToS,\u201d is sparking global conversations about Puerto Rico\u2019s culture and struggles",
      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- In a small bookstore in the Caribbean's largest mall, dozens of people gathered on a recent evening for the launch of a slim dictionary. Its title is \u201cThe ABC of DtMF,\u201d which is short for \u201cDeB\u00cd TiRAR M\u00e1S FOToS,\u201d the newest album from Puerto Rico's latest prodigious son, Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio, better known as Bad Bunny.",
      "The mostly older crowd flipped through the pages, seeking to understand more about Puerto Rico's culture, the places, phrases and references in Bad Bunny's music.",
      "The singer has elevated the global profile of the island, a U.S. territory, to new heights, promoting its traditional music, denouncing its gentrification and challenging its political status.",
      "It was an unexpected opportunity for an island that for years has cried out about its territorial status, dwindling affordable housing, high cost of living, chronic power outages, medical exodus and fragile economy. Pleas for change have been largely pushed aside, but Puerto Ricans are optimistic that Bad Bunny\u2019s new album and his series of 30 concerts that began Friday means they\u2019ll finally be heard.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s going to bring change, and there\u2019s a young generation who\u2019s going to back him,\u201d said Luis Rosado, 57, who this week attended the dictionary launch at the urging of his son, who lives abroad.",
      "Ten minutes before the first concert on Friday, a giant billboard on stage lit up with the words, \u201cPuerto Rico is a colony since Christopher Columbus \u2018discovered\u2019 the island during his second trip to the New World in 1493.\u201d",
      "The crowd that filled the 18,000-capacity coliseum whooped.",
      "\u201cThis album has sparked a conversation around the world about our situation as a colony,\u201d said Andrea Figueroa, a 24-year-old professional athlete who said foreigners have started to ask her about Puerto Rico and its issues, something she hopes might lead to change.",
      "Those born on the island of 3.2 million inhabitants are U.S. citizens but cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections, and they have one representative in Congress with limited voting powers.",
      "Figueroa said the album resonated with her because her father is one of thousands forced to leave the island in search of work as the economy crumbled. It\u2019s a sentiment Bad Bunny sings about in \u201cWhat happened to Hawaii,\u201d with the lyric, \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to go to Orlando, but the corrupt ones kicked him out.\u201d",
      "The song taps into concern that the Puerto Rican identity is eroding amid an influx of people from the U.S. mainland, many of them attracted by a 2012 law that allows Americans to move to the island and pay no taxes on capital gains if they meet certain conditions.",
      "Hundreds of Americans also snapped up properties in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria struck the island as a powerful Category 4 storm in 2017, forcing more than 100,000 people to leave.",
      "\u201cThey want to take the river away from me and also the beach; they want my neighborhood and the grandma to leave,\u201d Bad Bunny sang on Friday as the crowd drowned out his voice.",
      "The artist spent half of Friday\u2019s concert singing from the porch and roof of a traditional Puerto Rican home that served as a second stage, where he wonders about its fate aloud because it\u2019s been rented: \u201cDo good people live there? Is it an Airbnb?\u201d",
      "The mostly young crowd booed loudly, flinching at their reality on an island where the housing price index increased by almost 60% from 2018 to 2024 and where short-term rentals have surged from some 1,000 in 2014 to more than 25,000 in 2023.",
      "However, they cheered upon seeing Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James emerge from the house as a surprise guest.",
      "The song hit Carmen Lourdes L\u00f3pez Rivera especially hard. She is the vice president of the Community Board Association of La Perla, an impoverished community once known for being Puerto Rico\u2019s biggest heroin distribution point.",
      "Investors with deep pockets have long sought to buy up the area, which is perched on a hill with deep turquoise waters lapping below a massive 16th-century fort popular with tourists.",
      "\u201cThey have always said they want to kick us out of here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fight for what belongs to us.\u201d",
      "The effect of Bad Bunny\u2019s album and concerts is already being felt.",
      "More than 35,000 hotel nights have been booked during the normally slow summer season, with the concerts expected to attract more than 600,000 visitors, generate more than $186 million and create more than 3,600 jobs, according to government officials.",
      "Beyond that, Bad Bunny\u2019s use of folkloric music like bomba and plena has revived interest in those musical traditions. Dozens of newcomers have requested classes and are seeking out teachers, said Jorge Gabriel L\u00f3pez Ol\u00e1n, 28, an experienced drummer.",
      "\u201cAnd it\u2019s very necessary, isn\u2019t it? To understand where we come from and where our music and culture come from,\u201d he said.",
      "On Friday, Bad Bunny fans sported long ruffled skirts traditionally worn to dance bomba, while others donned straw hats known as a \u201cpava,\u201d worn by \u201cj\u00edbaros,\u201d Puerto Rican peasants. Musicians and dancers wore the same outfits on the main stage, which at one point even featured live chickens.",
      "Interest has surged to the point where universities including Princeton and Yale have launched courses on Bad Bunny. Albert Laguna, a Yale professor, described Bad Bunny\u2019s residence as a powerful move: \u201cInstead of me going to the world, right, I\u2019m going to start here.\u201d",
      "There is even renewed interest in the Puerto Rican crested toad, the island\u2019s sole indigenous toad species that is under threat and was featured in a video as part of Bad Bunny\u2019s newest album.",
      "Not even two weeks had passed since the album\u2019s launch and people already were sending in pictures to confirm if they had spotted the crested toad, said Abel Vale Nieves with Citizens of the Karst, an environmental nonprofit.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something we had not seen before,\u201d he said, adding that the album presented Puerto Rico\u2019s reality to the world: \u201cA situation of complete disadvantage where we don\u2019t have the right to a lot of things.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt creates interest in Puerto Rico\u2019s historical situation, and I think it did so in a wonderful way,\u201d he said, adding that the concerts will only boost visibility of the island\u2019s issues. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful opportunity.\u201d",

      "\u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest\" is celebrating its 50th anniversary with a new 4K restoration and a theatrical re-release",
      "Jack Nicholson did not want to go to the Oscars. It was 1976 and he was nominated for best actor in \u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest.\u201d The Milo\u0161 Forman film, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary with a nationwide theatrical re-release on July 13 and July 16, had become a bit of a sensation \u2014 the second highest grossing picture of 1975, behind \u201cJaws,\u201d and had received nine Oscar nominations.",
      "But Nicholson wasn\u2019t feeling optimistic. In five years, he\u2019d already been nominated five times. He\u2019d also lost five times. And he told his producer, Michael Douglas, that he couldn\u2019t go through it again.",
      "\u201cI remember how hard I had to persuade Jack to come to the ceremony. He was so reluctant, but we got him there,\u201d Douglas said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. \u201cAnd then of course we lost the first four awards. Jack was sitting right in front of me and sort of leaned back and said \u2019Oh, Mikey D, Mikey D, I told you, man.\u2019 I just said, \u2018Hang in there.\u2019\u201d",
      "Douglas, of course, was right. \u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest\u201d would go on to sweep the \u201cbig five\u201d \u2014 screenplay, director, actor, actress and picture \u2014 the first film to do so in 41 years, (\u201cIt Happened One Night,\u201d in 1934) which only \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs\u201d has done since. That night was one of many vindicating moments for a film that no one wanted to make or distribute that has quite literally stood the test of time.",
      "\u201cThis is my first 50th anniversary,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cIt\u2019s the first movie I ever produced. To have a movie that\u2019s so lasting, that people get a lot out of, it\u2019s a wonderful feeling. It\u2019s bringing back a lot of great memories.\u201d",
      "The film adaption of Ken Kesey\u2019s countercultural novel was a defining moment for Douglas, a son of Hollywood who was stuck in television and got a lifeline to film when his father, Kirk Douglas, gave him the rights to the book, and many of the then-unknown cast like Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd.",
      "DeVito was actually the first person officially cast. Douglas, who\u2019d known him for nearly 10 years, brought Forman to see him play Martini on stage.",
      "\u201cMilo\u0161 said, \u2018Yes! Danny! Perfect! Cast!\u2019 Douglas said in his best Czech accent. \u201cIt was a big moment for Danny. But I always knew how talented he was.\u201d",
      "Though the film's themes are challenging, unlike many of its New Hollywood contemporaries it wasn\u2019t a tortured shoot by any stretch. They had their annoyances (like Forman refusing to show the cast dailies) and more serious trials (they found out halfway through production that William Redfield was dying of leukemia), but for the most part it was fun.",
      "\u201cWe were very serious about the work, because Milo\u0161 was very serious. And we had the material, Kesey\u2019s work, and the reverence for that. We were not frivolous about it. But we did have a ball doing it,\u201d DeVito said, laughing.",
      "Part of that is because they filmed on location at a real state hospital in Salem, Oregon. Everyone stayed in the same motel and would board the same bus in the morning to get to set. It would have been hard not to bond and even harder if they hadn\u2019t.",
      "\u201cThere was full commitment,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cThat comes when you don\u2019t go home at night to your own lives. We stopped for lunch on the first day and I saw Jack kind of push his tray away and go outside to get some air. I said, \u2018Jack, you OK?\u2019 He said, \u2019Who are these guys? Nobody breaks character! It\u2019s lunch time and they\u2019re all acting the same way!'\u201d",
      "Not disproving Nicholson\u2019s point, DeVito remembers he and the cast even asked if they could just sleep in the hospital.",
      "\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t let us,\u201d DeVito said. \u201cThe floor above us had some seriously disturbed people who had committed murder.\u201d",
      "The film will be in theaters again on July 13 and July 16 from Fathom Entertainment. It\u2019s a new 4K restoration from the Academy Film Archive and Teatro Della Pace Films with an introduction by Leonard Maltin.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a gorgeous print and reminds me how good the sound was,\u201d Douglas said.",
      "DeVito thinks it, \u201cholds up in a really big way, because Milo\u0161 really was paying attention to all great things in the screenplay and the story originally.\u201d",
      "Besides the shock of \u201choly Toledo, am I that old?\u201d DeVito said that it was a treasure to be part of \u2014 and he continues to see his old friends, including Douglas, Lloyd and, of course, Nicholson, who played the protagonist, R.P. McMurphy.",
      "One person Douglas thinks hasn\u2019t gotten the proper attention for his contributions to \u201cCuckoo\u2019s Nest\u201d is producer Saul Zaentz, who died in 2014. His music company, Fantasy Records who had Creedence Clearwater Revival, funded the endeavor which started at a $1.6 million budget and ballooned to $4 million by the end. He was a gambler, Douglas said, and it paid off.",
      "And whatever sour grapes might have existed between Douglas and his father, who played R.P. McMurphy on Broadway and dreamt of doing so on film, were perhaps over-exaggerated. It was ultimately important for their relationship.",
      "\u201cMcMurphy is as good a part as any actor is going to get, and I\u2019m now far enough in my career to understand maybe you have four, maybe five good parts, really great parts. I\u2019m sure for dad that was one of them,\u201d Douglas said.",
      "\u201cTo not be able to see it through was probably disappointing on one side. On the other, the fact that his son did it and the picture turned out so good? Thank God the picture turned out. It would have been a disaster if it hadn\u2019t.\"",
      "Douglas added: \u201cIt was a fairy tale from beginning to end. I doubt anything else really came close to it. Even my Oscar for best actor years later didn\u2019t really surpass that moment very early in my career.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Forty years ago, the legendary Live Aid concerts aimed to do a lot of good \u2014 helping to raise over $100 million for famine relief in Ethiopia and inspiring worldwide awareness for a cause it might otherwise have ignored.",
      "Simulcast from Philadelphia and London on July 13, 1985, Live Aid was the most ambitious global television event of its time: 16 hours of live music in two different continents featuring Queen, The Who, a Led Zeppelin reunion and more.",
      "A lot has changed in the years since. \u201cLive Aid, '85 to now, is the same distance as the Second World War from Live Aid,\u201d notes Rick Springfield, laughingly. \u201cThat\u2019s how long ago it was.\u201d",
      "Artists who performed at Live Aid \u2014 Springfield, organizer Bob Geldof, Hall and Oates' John Oates and Judas Priest's Rob Halford \u2014 reflected on the event and its impact in interviews with The Associated Press ahead of the 40th anniversary on Sunday.",
      "Here's what they had to say:",
      "At John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia, Springfield performed between Run-DMC and REO Speedwagon \u2014 just a taste of the diversity of performers featured on the transnational lineup. \u201cRun-DMC, I remember thinking, \u2018What is this? Three guys talking over a record player. What is that? Little did I know that it was about to change the whole game,\u201d he says, laughing. He remembers playing an electric set \u2014 no \u201cJessie\u2019s Girl,\u201d because \u201cback then, it was just my first hit. ... It hadn't gone on to become this cultural thing.\"",
      "Hall and Oates' John Oates had a different experience. His band also played in Philly \u2014 their hometown \u2014 and in 1985, his band was one of the biggest on the planet. They played near the end of the night, joined by the Temptations' Eddie Kendricks and David Ruffin and remained on stage to back the Rolling Stones' dynamic frontman Mick Jagger. The British rockstar had a trick up his sleeve.",
      "\u201cHe didn't tell us that he was bringing Tina Turner out,\u201d Oates says. \u201cWe had rehearsed a certain amount of songs with him. But then when he brought her out, it just jacked up the level of energy like you can\u2019t believe.\u201d",
      "Judas Priest singer Rob Halford counts \u201cMike and Tina, of course,\u201d as one of his Philly Live Aid highlights. \u201cLed Zeppelin, too.\u201d",
      "But most exciting of all for the heavy metal frontman? Meeting folk hero Joan Baez. The band had previously covered her classic \u201cDiamonds and Rust.\"",
      "\u201cI thought, \u2018Oh my God, she\u2019s gonna come and kick me in the ass for wrecking her beautiful song,\u2019\u201d he recalls. \u201cShe gives me a quick hug and goes, \u2018The reason I\u2019m here is because my son said to me, if you see Rob Halford from Judas Priest at the Live Aid Show in Philadelphia, will you tell him from me that I prefer Judas Priest\u2019s version to my mom\u2019s version?' ... It was a display of such kindness.\"",
      "Twenty years after Live Aid, Geldof organized Live 8 \u2014 an even larger undertaking in the new internet era, with 10 concerts happening simultaneously and across the globe.",
      "If the trend were to continue, there should be another event taking place this year. Notably, there isn't.",
      "Geldof says that's because there couldn't be a Live Aid-type event in 2025. He cites social media as a cause. In his view, algorithmic fracturing has made it impossible to create monolithic musical and activistic moments. Instead, he views the current media landscape as bolstering \"an echo chamber of your own prejudices.\u201d",
      "For something like Live Aid to work, \u201cYou need rock \u2018n\u2019 roll as a creature of a social, economic and technological movement,\" he says. \u201cAnd I think the rock \u2018n\u2019 roll age is over. ... It did determine how young people articulated change and the desire for it. ... That isn't the case anymore.\u201d",
      "Springfield agrees. \u201cI think we are too divided,\u201d he says. He believes the world wouldn't be able to agree on a single cause to support, or even which musicians to back. \u201cYou could never do a thing with the size of Live Aid unless it was some kind of universal thing of, \u2018Let\u2019s bring everybody together.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cNever say never, but I highly doubt it,\u201d says Oates. \u201cThe landscape of music and entertainment in general has changed so drastically.\"",
      "He points to \u201cWe Are The World,\u201d the 1985 charity single for African famine relief that included the voices of Michael Jackson, Willie Nelson, Bob Dylan, Ray Charles, Diana Ross, Stevie Wonder, Smokey Robinson, Paul Simon and many more, as an example. \u201cThe idea of that happening with the stars of today all in one place, I can\u2019t even imagine that. And plus, who would they be? ... How many songs are released every day?\u201d",
      "Halford echoes the other's sentiments. There's an undeniable \u201cextremism in the world right now,\u201d he says, that would make a Live Aid event challenging to pull off in 2025. But he doesn't think it's impossible. He uses January's Fire Aid \u2014 the LA wildfire benefit concert featuring Billie Eilish, Stevie Wonder and a Nirvana reunion \u2014 as a recent example.",
      "\u201cThere will always be empathy from people,\u201d and in the right hands, maybe another event like Live Aid could take place. \u201cIt was a tremendously beautiful, humanitarian example ... that provided us opportunity to do something ourselves to help.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Former \u201cLove Island USA\u201d contestant Cierra Ortega apologized Wednesday for resurfaced posts where she used a racial slur against Asian people.",
      "Ortega, who was half of one of the season\u2019s strongest couples, left the villa just a week before the popular reality show\u2019s finale after old posts resurfaced that contained the slur.",
      "Ortega addressed the entire Asian community in her nearly five minute TikTok video and said she is \u201cdeeply, truly, honestly so sorry.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is not an apology video. This is an accountability video,\u201d Ortega said.",
      "\u201cI had no idea that the word held as much pain, as much harm, and came with the history that it did, or I never would have used it,\u201d Ortega said. \u201cI had no ill intention when I was using it, but that\u2019s absolutely no excuse because intent doesn\u2019t excuse ignorance.\u201d",
      "Ortega, who has been back in the United States for about 48 hours, said she has struggled most with the backlash experienced by her family, who she said doesn't feel safe in their own home, and have had immigration authorities called on them.",
      "\u201cThere's no need to fight hate with hate. I don't think that that's justice,\" Ortega said. \"And if you want to know that you're heard and that I'm sorry and that I will move differently, I promise you, that's what will happen.\u201d",
      "Ortega\u2019s removal from the villa was announced early in Sunday\u2019s episode. Host Iain Stirling said she had left \u201cdue to a personal situation.\u201d",
      "\u201cI completely agree with the network\u2019s decision to remove me from the villa. I think that this is something that deserved punishment and the punishment has absolutely been received,\u201d Ortega said.",
      "Her video made no mention of her \u201cLove Island\u201d partner, Nic Vansteenberghe. He remained in the villa single when Ortega left, ultimately recoupling with fellow islander Orlandria Carthen in the same episode. The couple is still in competition as of Tuesday\u2019s episode.",
      "Ortega said she was unaware she was using a racial slur until a follower pointed it out after she posted an Instagram story in 2024 that used the term. It was one of the posts that resurfaced during her time in the villa.",
      "At this point, Ortega said \u201cthe word was immediately removed from my vocabulary.\u201d",
      "\u201cI know that moving forward, my actions and how I decide to live my life from here on out is gonna speak louder than any apology ever could,\u201d Ortega said.",
      "Ortega\u2019s departure from the villa followed Yulissa Escobar, who left the villa last month in the second episode after clips of her using racist language resurfaced online. Her departure was also not explained in the show.",
      "A spokesperson for the show declined to comment Monday.",
      "Escobar, who initially issued an apology on her Instagram story shortly after she departed the villa, took to TikTok a day after Ortega left to ask viewers to stop cyberbullying contestants.",
      "\u201cI know what I said was wrong. I know what Cierra said was wrong, and I know it hurt communities,\u201d Escobar said. \u201cAll I ask you guys is instead of threatening her and her family, try to educate us, her, me.\u201d",
      "Escobar said she was \u201chonestly scared to come home,\u201d when she first got her phone back after exiting the villa and saw the messages she had received.",
      "\u201cI was like, is something going to happen to me? Like, is somebody going to do something to me? Because it was just a lot to take in and even my family was worried,\u201d Escobar said. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to take that when you\u2019re getting all these threats online.\u201d",
      "The show, which strips contestants of their phones or access to the outside world, has previously asked fans to avoid cyberbullying contestants. Host Ariana Madix called for fans to stop doxxing and harassing the show\u2019s stars in a recent interview with The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cLove Island USA\u201d is an American spin-off of the original U.K. series and is airing its seventh season. The show airs daily except Wednesdays and brings young singles together in a remote villa in Fiji to explore connections with the ultimate goal of finding love.",
      "Couples undergo challenges and are encouraged test their romantic connections as new contestants are introduced. Islanders are routinely \u201cdumped\u201d from the villa throughout the series as stronger couples form.

      "NEW YORK -- While classmates dreamed of becoming teachers, doctors and professional athletes, Burna Boy was clear on his future aspirations.",
      "\u201cThey would hand out the papers and the question would be, \u2018What you wanna be?\u2019 \u2026 I\u2019d write \u2018rock star,\u2019\u201d said the Afrobeats giant. \u201cOne of my teachers asked me, \u2018What do rock stars do?\u2019 I didn\u2019t really know what to say.\u201d",
      "These days, the Grammy winner\u2019s music talks for him. Fresh off becoming the first African artist to sell out Paris\u2019 iconic Stade de France in April, Burna Boy has been on an incredible run, and hopes it continues with his new album out Friday.",
      "\u201c\u2019No Sign of Weakness\u2019 is really like a celebration of the fact that that I\u2019m still here throughout all these years and all the trials and tribulations,\u201d explained the Nigerian artist. \u201cI decided to intentionally make sure everyone on this project could comfortably and genuinely say they\u2019re a rock star.\u201d",
      "Following 2023\u2019s Grammy-nominated \u201cI Told Them\u2026,\u201d this project includes blockbuster features, like legendary Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger, country hitmaker Shaboozey and hip-hop heavyweight Travis Scott.",
      "Writing on all 16 tracks, Burna relied on his standard successful creation process: record constantly, choose some songs from his vault that fit his decided theme, and then craft the project around them. He's already dropped \u201cBundle by Bundle,\u201d \u201cUpdate,\u201d which features an interpolation of Soul II Soul\u2019s classic \u201cBack To Life,\u201d \u201cSweet Love\u201d and \u201cTaTaTa\u201d featuring Scott.",
      "Music from Africa has exploded globally in recent years. Regions in Africa and the Middle East reached double-digit gains in music revenue last year, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. In 2023, the group reported that sub-Saharan Africa was the fastest-growing music industry, with artists like Burna, Davido and Wizkid leading the way, along with Tyla, who\u2019s spread South Africa\u2019s Amapino sound.",
      "\u201cI feel blessed. I also feel great responsibility \u2026 I\u2019m blamed for everything, most especially, things I couldn\u2019t possibly be responsible for,\u201d said Burna, alluding to demands in Nigeria. \u201cI don\u2019t vote, and I\u2019ve never done it. But now, it\u2019s to the point where even that: if I don\u2019t vote, because I don\u2019t say I\u2019ll vote for this person or vote for that person, it\u2019s a problem.\u201d",
      "But that weight of responsibility isn\u2019t felt on his eighth studio album. \u201cDem Dey,\u201d a tongue-in-cheek bop referencing his gossipy social media scandal with a Nigerian influencer which amused fans, is sure to crowd dance floors, while he and Jagger formed a dynamic duo on the Afrobeat-rock hybrid \u201cEmpty Chairs.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s how I see the future of our music \u2026 music that\u2019s supposed to last, music that you can perform forever,\u201d said Burna, who collaborated with the 81-year-old by trading ideas through WhatsApp after being connected by supermodel Naomi Campbell. \u201cThat\u2019s where I want to be when I\u2019m that age.\u201d",

If I\u2019m not proud of that, then I don\u2019t think I can be proud of anything in life.\u201d",
      "The Afrobeats superstar, currently featured on the soundtrack for the blockbuster \u201cF1\" movie starring Brad Pitt and Damson Idris, hopes the genre continues to thrive and not become a fad. But while the female artists are united, the top men have experienced friction in the past.",
      "\u201cWe need to figure how to make our diversities into an advantage instead of a disadvantage, and that goes across \u2014 not just for Nigeria,\" said Burna, whose grandfather managed Afrobeat icon Fela Kuti. \"It goes for everything Black and African, because the only thing we always lack is strong organization.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- Morgan knows best, apparently.",
      "Taylor Fritz thought the motivational note he wrote to himself after losing at Wimbledon four years ago would stay private. His girlfriend, influencer Morgan Riddle, later shared it on social media.",
      "\"That note was never supposed to be public,\u201d a smiling Fritz said after his 6-3, 6-4, 1-6, 7-6 (4) win over Karen Khachanov set up a semifinal meeting with two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz.",
      "Fritz had written to himself in the note that \u201cnobody in the whole world is underachieving harder than you\u201d and urged himself to get his act together.",
      "Not only does Fritz forgive Riddle, he also credits her for having such a big impact on him rising to No. 5 in the world rankings in pursuit of his first Grand Slam title.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been a pretty constant results-and-ranking rise since we\u2019ve been together,\u201d Fritz said. \"I think I would have to say she's been a big help to me just kind of keeping me focused, having someone who cares and just pushes you to just do better and do the right things, be healthier.",
      "\"Almost like kind of just mother me in a way,\" he added, chuckling to himself, \u201cwith like, the diet and going to sleep on time.\u201d",
      "A smiling Fritz later added: \u201cYeah, that maybe wasn\u2019t the best choice of words.\u201d",
      "The 27-year-old American, who was the runner-up at last year\u2019s U.S. Open, didn't face a break point in the first two sets against No. 17 Khachanov, who rebounded in the third set. It was 4-all in the fourth-set tiebreaker before Fritz claimed the final three points on Court No. 1.",
      "It's the first time Fritz has reached the last four at Wimbledon. He's won two grass-court titles this season \u2014 Stuttgart and Eastbourne \u2014 and was happy he wouldn't be facing Alcaraz on clay, which would be \u201can absolute nightmare.\u201d",
      "\u201cGrass is very much so an equalizer. It can be an equalizer. So trust in how I\u2019m playing,\u201d he said. \u201cI truly know the way that I played the first two sets today, there\u2019s not much any opponent on the other side can do.\u201d",
      "The second-seeded Alcaraz is within sight of a Wimbledon three-peat. He extended his winning streak to 23 matches this season by beating Cameron Norrie 6-2, 6-3, 6-3 on Centre Court.",
      "Alcaraz, who has beaten Novak Djokovic in the past two finals at the All England Club, faced only five break points and saved all of them.",
      "He wants to hit some other greens, though, before he faces Fritz",
      "\u201cFor sure I\u2019m going to play some golf, just to switch up my mind a little bit,\u201d Alcaraz said",
      "The 22-year-old Spaniard has been playing golf with Andy Murray during his Wimbledon run.",
      "This time, his opponent could be actor Tom Holland, whom he had run into earlier.",
      "\u201cI would love to play against him in the golf course. For me it would be such an honor. I will try to set it up in these two days that I will have much time to do it. So let\u2019s see if he will be available, and we\u2019ll tee it up.\u201d",

      "Chanel has marked 110 years of its haute couture by recreating its atelier inside the freshly restored Grand Palais for Paris Couture Week",
      "PARIS -- Only Chanel would call its legendary Rue Cambon salon \u201ctoo small\u201d \u2014 then rebuild it, supersized, in a palace.",
      "On Tuesday, as the house marked 110 years of its haute couture \u2014 a century and more of Coco Chanel\u2019s revolution in how women dress \u2014 it blew up its atelier as a giant set inside the freshly restored Grand Palais, turning intimacy into spectacle for a nature-drenched show at Paris Couture Week.",
      "Chanel, whose founder banished corsets and reimagined luxury as liberation, showed just how far that legacy stretches: from the tiny salons of 1915 to its modern colossus.",
      "It was a flex only a handful of luxury giants could pull off \u2014 and perhaps, as one front-row guest suggested, a dazzling distraction as the fashion world counts down to the debut of Chanel's new designer Matthieu Blazy.",
      "Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, Naomi Campbell and the house\u2019s tightest VIP circle scaled gilded steps, sweating past marble and gold, to enter the reconstructed atelier. The set by Willo Perron was classic Chanel: intimate yet monumental, old world yet futuristic.",
      "\u201cIt just felt special,\u201d Campbell said, \u201clike stepping into a memory and something completely new. There\u2019s warmth, intimacy, nostalgia. Chanel can recreate anything, and it works.\"",
      "More drama unfolded on the runway. This was couture as nature fantasy, filtered through the Chanel prism. Menswear tailoring added swing to sculpted jackets and coatdresses, while mohair suits in deep greens and plums channeled autumn\u2019s hush. Boucl\u00e9 tweeds mimicked sheepskin; feathers and tweed created illusionary faux fur.",
      "Gold-sprayed wheat ears \u2014 the house symbol of abundance \u2014 were everywhere: stitched into flounces, embroidered on necklines, set on every guest\u2019s seat. The theme may have been country, but make no mistake: This was as close as Chanel gets to \u201croughing it.\u201d",
      "Technique dazzled at every turn: jewel-buttons, embroidered florals and a finale of lam\u00e9 so luminous it mimicked sunlight on harvest fields. The studio team, holding the fort after Virginie Viard\u2019s abrupt and unceremonious exit last year, anchored the show in classic codes but played with wit and lightness.",
      "That obsessive handwork matters \u2014 not just for tradition, but for business. Chanel is fashion\u2019s juggernaut: Privately held, the brand reported $18.7\u202fbillion in revenue for 2024, cementing its status as one of the world\u2019s most powerful luxury houses. Couture may be the crown, but its influence drives global sales in fragrance, bags and jewelry, making it the envy of rivals.",
      "Change is always looming at Chanel. For more than 30 years, Karl Lagerfeld transformed the brand from Parisian legend to pop phenomenon, staging ever-grander spectacles at the Grand Palais. After his death in 2019, Viard, his longtime deputy, guided Chanel into a softer, more discreet era.",
      "Now the industry is holding its breath for Blazy, a Belgian talent with stints at Margiela, Celine and most recently Bottega Veneta, where he won fans for his blend of innovation and reverence for craft.",
      "Campbell said of Blazy, whom she knows personally: \u201cHe\u2019s focused, open-minded \u2014 he\u2019ll bring something special.\u201d",
      "Tuesday\u2019s show unfolded inside the Grand Palais' newly restored Salon d\u2019Honneur, its gold and stone revealed after a 600-million-euro, multi-year restoration co-funded by Chanel. It\u2019s more than a venue; it\u2019s an advertisement of the house\u2019s power and commitment to Parisian heritage.",

      "Local leaders in Iseltwald and tourism officials insist the village's 406 inhabitants aren\u2019t getting rich off the influx of visitors, who pay 5 Swiss francs ($6.30) to access the dock. In 2024, entries brought in nearly 245,000 francs ($307,000), while a one-franc public pay toilet collected about 58,000 francs more, said village clerk Gabriela Blatter.",
      "Proceeds have gone mostly to garbage disposal, restroom cleaning, additional work hours and custodial staff hires, she said.",
      "Titia Weiland, manager of the B\u00f6nigen-Iseltwald Tourism agency, said the funds go right back to village upkeep: \u201cIt\u2019s not correct to read it as \u2018the community gets rich\u2019,\u201d alluding to some comments along those lines in the media and online.",
      "The village, situated along a small peninsula that juts out into Lake Brienz, features majestic views of Alpine peaks over the water.",
      "An episode in early 2020 of the cross-border Korean love story spotlighted the dock as a romantic getaway. That sparked online hype among fans of the series across Asia and beyond, which hasn\u2019t let up, fueling the rush of tourism to Iseltwald.",
      "The continued influx has exposed growing pains for the Swiss village, like those faced by other tourist hotspots that get too much of a good thing.",
      "Part of the problem is infrastructure: Iseltwald has three hotels and four restaurants, not enough for about 1,000 visitors who arrive by tour bus, public bus and car each day on average, according to Blatter. The village is revamping a parking lot to help cope with the strain, and the only village store now operates 7 days a week. Previously, it was open Monday to Friday.",
      "\u201cThere were always tourists in Iseltwald. We are happy with them. The problem is that the tourists don\u2019t understand what\u2019s private and what\u2019s public,\" Blatter said, adding that some traipse through private yards and gardens. \u201cThey go everywhere.\u201d",
      "For months, fans of the series could visit the dock for free until the turnstile was put up in 2023 to help offset costs incurred by the local government.",
      "Not long ago, Weiland said, \u201cwe were wishing for more tourists in Iseltwald: In some ways, we are thankful ... but it can be extreme.\u201d Villagers who hosted the crews for on-site filming at the dock had no idea the series would become such a runaway success, she said.",
      "The village has a website devoted to the \u201cfilming location\" of the series that lists transportation options and entreats visitors to respect the dock, refrain from littering, and consider the \u201cquiet atmosphere of this authentic Swiss village\u201d by keeping noise down and avoiding private property.",
      "\u201cEnjoy your stay in beautiful Iseltwald and take with you memories to your home country!\u201d the site says.",

The show's narrator, Iain Stirling, announced Ortega had departed \u201cdue to a personal situation\u201d early in Sunday's episode.",
      "Ortega becomes the second contestant this season to depart the show amid controversy due to past social media posts.

      "\u201cLove Island USA\u201d is an American spin-off of the original U.K. series and is airing its seventh season. The show airs daily except Wednesdays and brings young singles together in a remote villa in Fiji to explore connections with the ultimate goal of finding love.",
      "Couples undergo challenges and are encouraged test their romantic connections as new contestants are introduced. Islanders are routinely \u201cdumped\u201d from the villa throughout the series as stronger couples form. The winning couple receives $100,000.",
      "The show, which strips contestants of their phones or access to the outside world, has previously asked fans to avoid cyberbullying contestants. Host Ariana Madix called for fans to stop doxxing and harassing the show\u2019s stars in a recent interview with The Associated Press.",
      "Ortega entered the villa at the end of the first episode as a bombshell, one of the first in a steady stream of new contestants who come in after the show began, often expected to disrupt existing couples and create new relationship dynamics.",
      "Ortega quickly coupled up with Nic Vansteenberghe, whom she remained with up until her departure. Her exit broke up one of the few consistent couples of the season. The couple had just announced a few episodes prior they were \u201cclosed off,\u201d a popular \u201cLove Island\u201d phrase to indicate neither contestant was interested in exploring a connection with any other islander.",
      "\u201cBefore Cierra had left, my mind was clear. I knew what the future would look like, and now, I'm lost,\u201d Vansteenberghe said during Sunday's episode.",
      "Vansteenberghe stayed on the show as a single islander after Ortega left, and he ultimately re-coupled with fellow contestant Olandria Carthen before the end of the episode.",
      "Belle-A Walker, a contestant who was dumped earlier this season, took to Instagram to express heartbreak over Ortega's resurfaced posts. Walker, who is Asian American, said she is \u201cdeeply appreciative\u201d of the show's producers \u201cfor taking a stand and making it clear that racism of any kind is not tolerated.\u201d",
      "\u201cAsian hate is oftentimes overlooked and dismissed.

      "Dutch wunderkind and celebrity-favorite Iris Van Herpen has occupied fashion\u2019s edge for years",
      "PARIS -- For years, Dutch wunderkind and celebrity-favorite Iris Van Herpen has occupied fashion\u2019s edge, conjuring couture from unexpected sources \u2014 banana leaves, cocoa beans and even 3D-printed polymers \u2014 while exploring the intersection of biology, art and design.",
      "Monday\u2019s collection at Paris Couture Week, \u201cSympoiesis,\u201d felt like the culmination of her restless experimentation: A show that dared to imagine clothing as both organism and artifact.",
      "In a shadowy Paris venue, Van Herpen sent out a series of gossamer gowns spun from alternative fibers so fine and insubstantial that they seemed conjured from air itself.",
      "At the collection\u2019s heart, a luminous \u201cliving dress,\u201d animated by millions of bioluminescent algae, quietly stole the scene.",
      "The algae, thriving within a custom-molded nutrient matrix, glimmered in electric blue as if stitched from the deep sea \u2014 offering an eerie, captivating spectacle that went beyond mere artifice.",
      "Elsewhere, Van Herpen introduced wedding gowns crafted from lab-grown bio-protein, a futuristic Japanese fiber that\u2019s biodegradable and endlessly recyclable \u2014 a glimpse of a fashion industry reimagined for a new era.",
      "If the show dazzled, it also underscored a rare feat in modern couture: Independence.",
      "In a world where most designers rely on billion-dollar groups to bankroll their dreams, Van Herpen stands nearly alone, thriving outside the grip of giants like LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton and Kering.",
      "Her creations have become magnets for pop royalty and rule-breakers: Lady Gaga, Beyonc\u00e9, Bj\u00f6rk, Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman have all worn her sculptural gowns on the world\u2019s biggest stages.",
      "At the Met Gala, Hailee Steinfeld stunned in a Van Herpen dress made from ocean plastic. Dove Cameron shimmered in her work in 2022.",
      "Star power helps sustain the atelier, but it\u2019s invention that defines her legacy. While many independents have vanished from the couture calendar, Van Herpen survives by never playing it safe.",
      "Every season, she proves that true originality is not only possible \u2014 but essential \u2014 in Paris.",
      "By harnessing living organisms and boundary-pushing textiles, Van Herpen\u2019s latest collection doubled down on her signature ethos: couture not just as spectacle or skill, but as an open question \u2014 what might fashion, and nature, become next?",
      "In a world obsessed with spectacle, Van Herpen continues to ask not only what we wear, but how we care for the world that makes it possible.",

      "Paris Couture Week begins with a striking moment as Cardi B appears in a custom Schiaparelli gown, holding a live crow",
      "PARIS -- Paris couture week opened not with sequins or red carpet pageantry, but Cardi B 's crow moment.",
      "Wrapped in a custom Schiaparelli gown of graphic fringe, the U.S. rapper stood beneath the gilded columns of the Petit Palais, holding a live crow on her arm.",
      "Her avian plus one squawked, glared, and nearly lunged \u2014 setting the tone for a show that soared straight into the surreal.",
      "It was a fitting image for Schiaparelli. Elsa Schiaparelli, the house\u2019s founder, built her legend in the 1930s by weaving the unexpected \u2014 lobster dresses, shoe hats, and, yes, animals \u2014 into the heart of high fashion.",
      "That legacy pulsed through Daniel Roseberry\u2019s Fall 2025 collection, a spectacle in pure black and white, staged as if the city itself had been drained of color, leaving only stark contrast and raw emotion.",
      "Inside, the mood was cinematic \u2014 gowns and jackets defined by intensity and ease, with the waist and hips shaped through unexpected techniques. Hints of disco sheen flickered like film across the runway.",
      "But if the house has been criticized in the past for relying on extreme corsetry and body manipulation, this season marked a shift. Roseberry, perhaps heeding the critics, abandoned his signature corset silhouette. In its place: a freer, more elastic exploration of the body, echoing Schiaparelli\u2019s own restless spirit.",
      "Roseberry said the collection was inspired by the moment in 1940, when Elsa Schiaparelli fled Nazi-occupied Paris for New York \u2014 a period \u201cwhen life and art was on the precipice: to the sunset of elegance, and to the end of the world as we knew it.\u201d",
      "Here, that tension was alive in every look: archival codes reimagined, but with a restless push toward the future. Dresses undulated like car bodies, hips arced in impossibly engineered shapes, ribbons from antique Lyon couture fluttered as kinetic sculptures.",
      "Yet the show was more than spectacle. This was couture at its most essential \u2014 an ideas factory for the entire fashion industry, unfettered by trends.",
      "\u201cChanel was interested in how clothes could be of practical use to women; Elsa was interested in what fashion could be,\u201d Roseberry added.",
      "It is this what-if energy, the transformation of memory, myth, and sheer technique into something never seen before, that keeps couture vital, even as the world rushes toward AI and disposable fast fashion.",
      "The setting only heightened the effect. The Petit Palais is currently home to an exhibit on Charles Worth, the 19th-century Englishman who invented haute couture by bringing artistry and handcraft to Paris. The symmetry was irresistible: in these halls, Schiaparelli\u2019s past collided with fashion\u2019s future, reminding all why couture matters: not as museum piece, but as living laboratory for risk, reinvention, and radical beauty.",
      "A decade after its relaunch, Schiaparelli has found commercial traction and become a fixture on the world\u2019s red carpets, a rare feat in today\u2019s luxury market. But above all, the brand\u2019s power lies in its ability to surprise. On opening day, as Cardi B\u2019s crow threatened to take flight, Schiaparelli proved that in Paris, fashion\u2019s most potent magic is still the unexpected.",

      "APEX, N.C. -- North Carolina\u2019s first standalone children\u2019s hospital will be built in a bedroom community near the state capital, the project\u2019s health systems announced Thursday, creating a campus estimated to bring 8,000 jobs to the area.",
      "UNC Health and Duke Health announced in January an agreement to jointly build the proposed 500-bed pediatric hospital and linked facilities in the state\u2019s Research Triangle region, which includes Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill.",
      "At that time, the specific location wasn't finalized. But leaders of the health systems said Thursday that the \u201cNorth Carolina Children's\u201d project will be constructed about 20 miles (32.19 kilometers) southwest of downtown Raleigh in the Wake County town of Apex. Apex has a population of 77,000, which is already surging in population thanks to the region's strong technology economy.",
      "More than 15 potential sites in several counties were considered, Duke Health CEO Dr. Craig Albanese said at an Apex news conference.",
      "The 230-acre (93.1-hectare) campus, located near a regional transportation interchange, will also include a children\u2019s outpatient care center, over 100 behavioral health beds and a research and education center operated by Duke University and University of North Carolina medical schools.",
      "The campus is poised to be integrated into a long-discussed mixed-use development location called Veridea that will include thousands of new homes, retail, dining, office and research space, as well as a new Wake Technical Community College campus.",
      "\u201cThis campus will create a brighter, healthier future for generations of children and adolescents across North Carolina and the Southeast, and we\u2019re thrilled to have Apex as our home and partner,\" UNC Heatlh CEO Dr. Wesley Burks said in a news release.",
      "A groundbreaking for the hospital campus is now expected in 2027, with construction anticipated to take six years. North Carolina Children\u2019s Health also issued on Thursday a request for information from potential design and construction contractors for the project.",
      "There are children\u2019s hospitals already in North Carolina, including those operated by the University of North Carolina and Duke University health systems that are attached to their main campuses in the Triangle.",
      "The Apex location \u201cwill ensure that the Triangle remains a hub and a destination for the best pediatric scientists, teachers and clinicians \u2014 convenient to both medical school campuses,\u201d said Dr. Mary Klotman, dean of the Duke University medical school and a Duke Health executive.",
      "The new children's hospital agreed to acquire a portion of the Veridea land, which is owned by a business partnership between the North Carolina state retirement system and the land developers, according to the State Treasurer's Office, which administers the system.",
      "State Treasurer Brad Briner said at the news conference that the land sale is a win for everyone involved, including government retirees and the pension system, \"making a modest profit and unlocking more value in the land that is adjacent.\u201d",
      "\u201cAbove all, it's a win for the 11 million North Carolinians who deserve world-class pediatric care right here at home,\u201d he added.",
      "The health systems have said the hospital campus project could cost from $2 billion to $3 billion, with a massive private fundraising effort ahead.",
      "The project has already received $320 million from state legislators. The next state budget, still being negotiated by House and Senate Republicans that ultimately would head to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein's desk, also could contain more project funds.",
      "Stein said in an interview Thursday that beyond the economic opportunity the project will spark, \u201cI\u2019m really excited about what the children\u2019s hospital means for children of North Carolina who are sick and in need of the best, most sophisticated, advanced medical interventions to live long, healthy lives.\u201d",

      "BOBO-DIOULASSO, Burkina Faso -- Isaka Diallo was playing with friends when a stone struck his left eye. For two weeks, his parents searched hospitals in western Burkina Faso for an eye doctor. The village clinic only prescribed painkillers. Other health workers did not know what to do.",
      "When they eventually found Dr. Claudette Yam\u00e9ogo, Burkina Faso\u2019s only pediatric ophthalmologist, the injury had become too difficult to treat.",
      "\u201cThe trauma has become severe,\u201d Yam\u00e9ogo said of Diallo\u2019s condition as she attended to him recently at the Sanou Sourou University Hospital in the city of Bobo-Dioulasso. \u201cCases like (Diallo\u2019s) must be treated within the first six hours, but I\u2019m seeing him two weeks later, and it\u2019s already too late.\u201d",
      "It is a common problem in the country of about 23 million people, which has just 70 ophthalmologists.",
      "Yam\u00e9ogo , who started her practice late last year, said the work is daunting and often requires her to visit \u2014 at no cost \u2014 families who cannot afford care or cannot make their way to the hospital where she works.",
      "While there is limited data available on eye defects in children in Burkina Faso or in Africa at large, an estimated 450 million children globally have a sight problem that needs treatment, according to the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness.",
      "Late intervention can significantly alter a child\u2019s future, the organization said, with many such cases in less developed countries.",
      "In Burkina Faso, an estimated 70% of the population lives in rural areas. And yet ophthalmologists are concentrated in the capital, Ouagadougou, and other main cities, making them unreachable for many.",
      "While more than 2,000 ophthalmology procedures were performed in Burkina Faso\u2019s western Hauts-Bassins region in 2024, only 52 of those were carried out in its more rural areas, according to the Ministry of Health. Most procedures were done in the area of Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso\u2019s second city.",
      "Not many people are aware of Yam\u00e9ogo\u2019s work. Even when they are, traveling to reach her often requires days of planning and financial saving.",
      "In a further challenge to accessing care, Diallo\u2019s family is among the 2 million people displaced by violence as extremist groups seize parts of the country.",
      "To visit Yam\u00e9ogo\u2019s hospital from the village where they are sheltering, they had to travel about 40 kilometers (21 miles) on a motorcycle to Bobo-Dioulasso, spending 7,500 francs ($13) on transport, a high price for a small-scale farming family.",
      "At least 70% of the trauma cases in children treated at the hospital come from rural areas where the risk of exposure \u2014 from conflict or from play \u2014 is higher, Yam\u00e9ogo said.",
      "Examining and treating a child is a delicate practice that requires a lot of time, something many families can\u2019t afford. Many must return home to earn money for the treatment.",
      "As she treated Diallo, Yam\u00e9ogo noticed that the boy associated a drawing of an apple with a pepper, making her wonder: Is it that he can\u2019t see it, or that he doesn\u2019t know what an apple is? The fruit doesn't grow in the region where he lives.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no fixed time for examining children,\u201d she said. \u201cYou need a lot of patience.\u201d",
      "Yameogo\u2019s work has had a \"very positive impact on training future pediatricians and on the quality of ophthalmology services,\u201d said Jean Diallo, president of the Burkinab\u00e8 Society of Ophthalmology.",
      "\u201cA child\u2019s eye is not the same as that of an adult, which is why we need specialists to treat problems early so the child can develop properly,\u201d Diallo said.",
      "He cited retinoblastoma, a retinal cancer mostly affecting young children, and congenital cataracts, eye diseases that can be cured if diagnosed early. Pediatricians won\u2019t necessarily detect them.",
      "During another consultation, Yam\u00e9ogo told the family of 5-year-old Fatao Traor\u00e9 that he would need cornea surgery as a result of an injury sustained while playing with a stick.",
      "\u201cSometimes I feel a pinch in my heart,\u201d Yam\u00e9ogo said as she examined the boy after they arrived from their farm on the outskirts of Bobo-Dioulasso. \u201cHis iris has detached from his cornea, so he needs to be hospitalized.\u201d",
      "The father, looking overwhelmed, sighed, unsure of where the money for the child's surgery would come. On paper, Burkina Faso's government covers the cost of medications and care for children under 5, but often no drugs are available in hospitals, meaning families must buy them elsewhere.",
      "A surgery like the one for Traor\u00e9 can cost 100,000 CFA ($179), several months' income for the family.",

      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday that the national case count surpassed 2019, when there were 1,274 cases for the year and the country almost lost its status of having eliminated the vaccine-preventable illness. That could happen this year if the virus has nonstop spread for 12 months.",
      "This year's outbreaks, some of them interconnected, started five months ago in undervaccinated communities in West Texas. Three people have died \u2014 two children in Texas and an adult in New Mexico \u2014 and dozens of people have been hospitalized. Public health experts maintain the true case count may be higher than state health departments have confirmed.",
      "North America has three other major measles outbreaks, with 2,966 cases in Chihuahua state, Mexico, 2,223 cases in Ontario, Canada and 1,230 in Alberta, Canada. Twelve other states have current confirmed outbreaks of three or more people \u2014 Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Utah \u2014 and four other states saw their outbreaks end.",
      "The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine is 97% effective at preventing measles after two doses.",
      "The World Health Organization said in 2000 that measles had been eliminated from the U.S.",
      "The CDC identified 22 outbreaks in 2019, the largest being two separate clusters in New York \u2014 412 in New York state and 702 in New York City. These were linked because as measles was spreading through close-knit Orthodox Jewish communities, the CDC said.",
      "It's a similar situation in North America this year, where the Canada, Mexico and Texas outbreaks stem from large Mennonite communities in the regions. Mennonite churches do not formally discourage vaccination, though more conservative Mennonite communities historically have low vaccination rates and a distrust of government.",
      "A recent study found childhood vaccination rates against measles fell after the COVID-19 pandemic in nearly 80% of the more than 2,000 U.S. counties with available data, including in states that are battling outbreaks this year.",
      "Only 92.7% of kindergarteners in the U.S. had the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine in the 2023-2024 school year, below the 95% needed to prevent outbreaks. In Gaines County, Texas, the epicenter of the Texas outbreak, only 82% of kindergarteners were up-to-date with MMR vaccines.",
      "State and federal leaders have for years kept funding stagnant for local public health departments' vaccination programs that are tasked with reversing the trend.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing with measles is a little bit of a \u2018canary in a coal mine,'\" said Lauren Gardner, leader of Johns Hopkins University's independent measles and COVID tracking databases. \"It\u2019s indicative of a problem that we know exists with vaccination attitudes in this county and just, I think, likely to get worse.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Scientists have linked last week\u2019s European heat wave to human-caused climate change and estimate that climate change was responsible for 1,500 deaths",
      "WASHINGTON -- Human-caused climate change is responsible for killing about 1,500 people in last week's European heat wave, a first-of-its-kind rapid study found.",
      "Those 1,500 people \u201chave only died because of climate change, so they would not have died if it would not have been for our burning of oil, coal and gas in the last century,\u201d said study co-author Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College in London.",
      "Scientists at Imperial and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine used peer-reviewed techniques to calculate that about 2,300 people in 12 cities likely died from the heat in last week's bout of high temperatures, with nearly two-thirds of them dying because of the extra degrees that climate change added to the natural summer warmth.",
      "Past rapid attribution studies have not gone beyond evaluating climate change's role in meteorological effects such as extra heat, flooding or drought. This study goes a step further in directly connecting coal, oil and natural gas use to people dying.",
      "\u201cHeat waves are silent killers and their health impact is very hard to measure,\u2033 said co-author Gary Konstantinoudis, a biostatistician at Imperial College. \u201dPeople do not understand the actual mortality toll of heat waves and this is because (doctors, hospitals and governments) do not report heat as an underlying cause of death\u201d and instead attribute it to heart or lung or other organ problems.",
      "Of the 1,500 deaths attributed to climate change, the study found more than 1,100 were people 75 or older.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s summer, so it\u2019s sometimes hot,\" study lead author Ben Clarke of Imperial College said in a Tuesday news conference. \u201dThe influence of climate change has pushed it up by several degrees and what that does is it brings certain groups of people more into dangerous territory and that\u2019s what\u2019s important. That\u2019s what we really want to highlight here. For some people it\u2019s still warm fine weather but for now a huge sector of the population it's more dangerous.\"",
      "Researchers looked at June 23 to July 2 in London; Paris; Frankfurt, Germany; Budapest, Hungary; Zagreb, Croatia; Athens, Greece; Barcelona, Spain; Madrid; Lisbon, Portugal; Rome; Milan and Sassari, Italy. They found that except in Lisbon, the extra warmth from greenhouse gases added 2 to 4 degrees Celsius (3.6 to 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) to what would have been a more natural heat wave. London got the most at nearly 4 degrees (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit). Climate change only added about a degree to Lisbon's peak temperature, the study calculated, mostly because of the Atlantic Ocean's moderating effect, Otto said.",
      "That extra climate-change-caused heat added the most extra deaths in Milan, Barcelona and Paris and the least in Sassari, Frankfort and Lisbon, the study found. The 1,500 figure is the middle of the range of overall climate-related death estimates that go from about 1,250 to around 1,700.",
      "Wednesday's study is not yet peer-reviewed. It is an extension of work done by an international team of scientists who do rapid attribution studies to search for global warming\u2019s fingerprints in the growing number of extreme weather events worldwide, and combine that with long-established epidemiological research that examines death trends that differ from what's considered normal.",
      "Researchers compared what the thermometers read last week to what computer simulations say would have happened in a world without planet-warming greenhouse gases from fossil fuel use. Health researchers then compared estimates \u2014 there are no solid figures yet \u2014 for heat deaths in what just happened to what heat deaths would be expected for each city without those extra degrees of warmth.",
      "There are long-established formulas that calculate excess deaths differing from normal based on location, demographics, temperatures and other factors and those are used, Otto and Konstantinoudis said. And health researchers take into account many variables like smoking and chronic diseases, so it's comparing similar people except for temperature so they know that's what's to blame, Konstantinoudis said.",
      "Studies in 2021 generally linked excess heat deaths to human-caused climate change and carbon emissions, but not specific events like last week's hot spell. A 2023 study in Nature Medicine estimated that since 2015, for every degree Celsius the temperature rises in Europe, there's an extra 18,547 summer heat deaths.",
      "Studies like Wednesday's are \u201cending the guessing game on the health harms from continued burning of fossil fuels,\u201d said Dr. Jonathan Patz, director of the Center for Health, Energy and Environmental Research at the University of Wisconsin. He was not part of the research but said it \u201ccombined the most up-to-date climate and health methods and found that every fraction of a degree of warming matters regarding extreme heat waves.\u201d",
      "Dr. Courtney Howard, a Canadian emergency room physician and chair of the Global Climate and Health Alliance, said, \u201cStudies like this help us see that reducing fossil fuel use is health care.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe hacking of these American universities is not just a violation of intellectual property rights. It\u2019s an attack on American scientific innovation,\u201d Nicholas J. Ganjei, the Houston-based U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Texas, said at a news conference.",

      "The charges against Xu include wire fraud, obtaining information by unauthorized access to protected computers and aggravated identity theft. The wire fraud charges carry sentences of up to 20 years in prison.",

      "Roseline Phay is a farmer in the West African nation of Liberia",
      "SARWORLOR, Liberia -- Five months ago, Roseline Phay, a 32-year-old farmer from the West African nation of Liberia, set off on a quest to find contraceptives.",
      "Phay and her partner have two daughters, and they barely make ends meet. Determined not to have more children, she went to a health worker in her village, but contraception pills, implants and condoms had run out. Phay trekked for hours on red clay roads to the nearest clinic, but they had no contraceptives either.",
      "She did not know it, but her mission was doomed from the beginning. Just weeks before, U.S. President Donald Trump abruptly suspended most foreign aid through the U.S. Agency for International Development, which paid for medications in Liberia's public clinics.",
      "Tenacious and outspoken, Phay repeated the trip four times. Then she got pregnant.",
      "\u201cI'm suffering,\u201d she said, with daughter Pauline crying in her arms. \u201cI have this little child on my back, and the other child in my stomach is suffering.\" She must continue farming throughout her pregnancy, she said, or \"I will not eat.\u201d",
      "After she got pregnant she had to wean Pauline off breastfeeding, she said, and the girl became so badly malnourished that she almost died. The U.S. cuts left no therapeutic food to give her, and she is still ill.",
      "Phay is among millions across Africa who have seen their lives upended after the U.S. aid cuts. In Liberia, the American support made up almost 2.6% of the gross national income, the highest percentage anywhere in the world, according to the Center for Global Development.",
      "\u201cThe impact of USAID in Liberia cannot be overstated,\u201d said Richlue O. Burphy, who worked for USAID projects for over a decade and manages the National Lottery, a government body. \u201cEverywhere you go, you see the USAID (signs). And almost all the government institutions ... had some kind of USAID partnership.\u201d",
      "The sense of betrayal runs deep in Liberia, established in the early 1800s with the aim of relocating freed slaves and free-born Black people from the United States. The political system is modeled on that of the U.S., along with its flag. Liberians often refer to the U.S. as their \u201cbig brother.\u201d",
      "Liberia was one of the first countries to receive USAID support, starting in 1961. Its officials thought they would be spared from Trump\u2019s cuts because of the countries' close relationship.",
      "Following civil wars and an Ebola epidemic, Liberia's survival has depended largely on foreign aid, mainly from the U.S. and the World Bank. Despite abundant natural wealth, six out of 10 Liberians live in poverty, according to the World Bank, and Liberia is among the world's 10 poorest nations.",
      "The aid cuts pose \u201ca serious challenge,\u201d especially for the healthcare system, Deputy Finance Minister Dehpue Y. Zuo, responsible for drafting the development budget, told The Associated Press. To make sure the system stays afloat, he said, \"we have to take a dramatic switch to see where we will be cutting funding for other areas.\u201d",
      "Liberia received an average of $527.6 million in aid annually between 2014 and 2023, according to the finance ministry. This year, Liberia was supposed to receive $443 million, but the total estimated impact of the cuts is $290 million \u2014 essentially what hadn't been disbursed yet.",
      "USAID funding built schools and health clinics, provided training for teachers and doctors and gave scholarships for study in the U.S. It supported small-scale farmers and paid for school meals.",
      "But most of the U.S. funding went to Liberia's health system, making up 48% of its budget. It funded malaria control, maternal health programs, HIV/AIDS treatment and community health programs. It financed hundreds of health projects run by aid groups.",
      "Now in Bong county, where Phay lives, medicine shelves in health clinics are almost empty. The USAID-funded ambulance cannot function because there is no money for fuel. Hospitals are running out of hand sanitizer and gloves. Training for medical staff has stopped, and community health workers have not been paid in months.",
      "Moses K. Banyan, head of the nearby CB Dunbar Hospital, described the U.S. cuts as \u201cbeyond a shock.\u201d He worried about the future, especially now that Bong county has begun to see a handful of mpox cases spread from neighboring Sierra Leone.",
      "Warning of the cuts could have helped in finding options, he said. \u201cBut it's like you were sleeping, you woke up and you were told: \u2018Hey, leave this house.\u2019\u201d",
      "The withdrawal of U.S. support is an opportunity for others, especially China, experts and officials said. Chinese companies have been operating Liberia\u2019s gold mines, building roads and training aid workers. Chinese beer is sold alongside local brands. Many Liberians who would have sent children to universities in the U.S. are now choosing China.",
      "Last month, China opened a cardiology wing in the capital\u2019s main hospital, which is named after John F. Kennedy but was commonly referred to as \u201cJust For Killing\u201d because of its scarce resources, even before the U.S. cuts.",
      "\u201cThere are gaps to be filled, and that cannot be covered by the government of Liberia,\u201d said Zuo, the deputy finance minister. \u201cWe are open door to the rest of the world, including the United States.\u201d",
      "In Phay's village of Sarworlor, community health worker Alice Togbah still wears her USAID vest though she hasn't been paid in months. She has no more malaria medication for children. She is running out of cough medicine and diarrhea treatment.",
      "A 4-year-old resident, Promise, got malaria a few days ago. Her mother, Grace Morris, obtained only a limited number of malaria tablets at the nearest clinic because of the U.S. cuts. Now they are finished, and the child still feels ill.",
      "\u201cChildren die from malaria here,\u201d she said. Last year, her neighbor's son died because he did not get medication on time.",
      "Morris and other women also seek contraceptives. Liberia in recent years made strides in bringing down teenage pregnancy rates and maternal mortality rates.",
      "For women in traditional, conservative communities, access to contraceptives meant reclaiming some control over their lives.",
      "\u201cIf ... my man touches me, I cannot say no because I need to satisfy him,\u201d Phay said. \u201cBut if I have no medicine, I will get pregnant.\u201d",
      "Her 9-year-old daughter, also named Promise, is living in the capital, Monrovia, with her aunt. Phay wants her to finish school and have a different life from hers.",
      "\u201cI am begging, if you people have the medicine, you people need to help us,\" she said. \u201cI don't want her to suffer like me.\"",

      "The American Academy of Pediatrics, American Public Health Association and four other groups \u2014 along with an unnamed pregnant doctor who works in a hospital \u2014 filed the lawsuit in federal court in Boston.",
      "U.S. health officials, following infectious disease experts' guidance, previously urged annual COVID-19 shots for all Americans ages 6 months and older. But in late May, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced he was removing COVID-19 shots from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s recommendations for healthy children and pregnant women.",

      "The new lawsuit repeats those concerns, alleging that Kennedy and other political appointees at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services have flouted federal procedures and systematically attempted to mislead the public.",
      "\u201cThis administration is an existential threat to vaccination in America, and those in charge are only just getting started,\u201d said Richard H.

      "\u201cThe medications should be available, the question is at what price and can people sustain that,\u201d said Matt Maciejewski, a Duke University professor who studies obesity treatment coverage.",
      "Doctors say the situation forces them to get creative in treating patients, but there\u2019s hope that prices may fall more in the future.",
      "Wegovy and Zepbound are part of a wave of obesity medications known as GLP-1 receptor agonists that have soared in popularity.",
      "Zepbound brought in $2.3 billion in U.S. sales during this year\u2019s first quarter, making it one of drugmaker Eli Lilly\u2019s best sellers.",
      "Novo Nordisk says Wegovy has about 200,000 weekly prescriptions in the U.S., where it brought in nearly $1.9 billion in first-quarter sales.",
      "The benefits consultant Mercer says more businesses with 500 or more employees are adding coverage of the injected drugs for their workers and family members.",

      "Plus some patients with diabetes can get coverage of the GLP-1 drugs Ozempic and Mounjaro from Novo and Lilly that are approved to treat that condition.",
      "But most state and federally funded Medicaid programs don\u2019t cover the drugs for obesity and neither does Medicare, the federal program mainly for people age 65 and older.",
      "Even the plans that cover the drugs often pay only a portion of the bill, exposing patients to hundreds of dollars in monthly costs, said Dr. Beverly Tchang.",
      "Drugmakers offer help with these out-of-pocket costs, but that assistance can be limited.",
      "\u201cCoverage is not the same as access,\u201d said Tchang, a New York-based doctor who serves as a paid advisor to both Novo and Lilly.",
      "Bill-payers like employers are nervous about drugs that might be used by a lot of people indefinitely.",
      "Some big employers have dropped coverage of the drugs due to the expense. Pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, also are starting to pick one brand over the other as they negotiate deals with the drugmakers.",
      "One of the nation\u2019s largest PBMs, run by CVS Health, dropped Zepbound from its national formulary, or list of covered drugs, on July 1 in favor of Wegovy.",
      "That forced Tchang to figure out another treatment plan for several patients, many of whom took Zepbound because it made them less nauseous.",
      "Dr. Courtney Younglove\u2019s office sends prospective patients a video link showing them how to check their insurer\u2019s website for coverage of the drugs before they visit.",

      "Compounding pharmacies and other entities were allowed to make off-brand, cheaper copies of Wegovy and Zepbound when there was a shortage of the drugs. But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration determined earlier this year that the shortage had ended.",
      "That should have ended the compounded versions, but there is an exception: Some compounding is permitted when a drug is personalized for the patient.",
      "The health care company Hims & Hers Health offers compounded doses of semaglutide, the drug behind Wegovy, that adjust dose levels to help patients manage side effects. Hims says these plans start at $165 a month for 12 months, with customers paying in full upfront.",
      "It\u2019s a contentious issue. Eli Lilly has sued pharmacies and telehealth companies trying to stop them from selling compounded versions of its products.",
      "Novo recently ended a short-lived partnership with Hims to sell Wegovy because the telehealth company continued compounding. Novo says the compounded versions of its drug put patient safety at risk because ingredients are made by foreign suppliers not monitored by US regulators.",
      "Hims says it checks all ingredients to make sure they meet U.S. quality and safety standards. It also uses a third-party lab to verify that a drug's strength is accurately labeled.",
      "Both drugmakers are selling most of their doses for around $500 a month to people without insurance, a few hundred dollars less than some initial prices.",
      "Even so, that expense would eat up about 14% of the average annual per person income in the U.S., which is around $43,000.",
      "There are some factors that may suppress prices over time. Both companies are developing pill versions of their treatments. Those could hit the market in the next year or so, which might drive down prices for the older, injectable doses.",
      "Younglove said some of her patients save as much as 15% by getting their doses shipped from a pharmacy in Canada. They used to get them from an Israeli pharmacy until the Canadians dropped their prices.",

      "LONDON -- Britain\u2019s oldest World War II veteran, Donald Rose, has died at the age of 110.",
      "Rose participated in the D-Day landings on June 6, 1944, and was part of the division that liberated the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in northern Germany.",
      "In a statement Friday, the leader of the Erewash Borough Council in the north of England, James Dawson, announced Rose's death, calling him a \u201cwar hero.\u201d",
      "\u201cErewash was privileged to count him as a resident,\" he added.",

      "Rose, who was born on Christmas Eve in 1914 following the outbreak of hostilities in World War I, said at the event that he did not celebrate VE Day at the time.",
      "\u201cWhen I heard that the armistice had been signed 80 years ago, I was in Germany at Belsen and, like most active soldiers, I didn\u2019t get to celebrate at that time,\" he said. \u201cWe just did what we thought was right and it was a relief when it was over.\u201d",
      "Originally from the village of Westcott, southwest of London, Rose joined the army aged 23 and served in North Africa, Italy and France, according to the Royal British Legion. He received a number of medals and was awarded France\u2019s highest honor, the Legion d\u2019Honneur.",

      "ISTANBUL -- Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Saturday hailed start of a disarmament process by militant Kurdish separatists as the end of a \u201cpainful chapter\u201d in Turkey's troubled history.",
      "Erdogan told a meeting of his ruling AKP party in Ankara that the more than 40-year-old \u201cscourge of terrorism\u201d for which the Kurdistan Workers' Party - or PKK - was responsible is on its way to ending.",
      "Erdogan's remarks came a day after male and female members of the PKK in northern Iraq cast rifles and machine guns into a large cauldron where they were set on fire. The symbolic move was seen as the first step toward a promised disarmament as part of a peace process aimed at ending four decades of hostilities.",
      "The move came after PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, who has been imprisoned on an island near Istanbul since 1999, urged his group in February to convene a congress and formally disband and disarm. In May the PKK announced that it would do so.",
      "The PKK had waged an armed insurgency against Turkey since 1984, initially with the aim of establishing a Kurdish state in the southeast of the country. Over time, the objective evolved into a campaign for autonomy and rights for Kurds within Turkey.",
      "The conflict, which spread beyond Turkey\u2019s borders into Iraq and Syria, killed tens of thousands of people. The PKK is considered to be a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union.",
      "Previous peace efforts between Turkey and the PKK have ended in failure \u2014 most recently in 2015.",
      "\u201cToday the doors of a great Turkey, a strong Turkey, a Turkish century have been opened wide,\u201d Erdogan said.",
      "In a statement issued on Friday, the PKK said the fighters who were laying down their weapons, saying that they had disarmed \u201cas a gesture of goodwill and a commitment to the practical success\u201d of the peace process.",
      "\u201cWe will henceforth continue our struggle for freedom, democracy, and socialism through democratic politics and legal means,\u201d the statement said.",
      "But Erdogan insisted that there had been no bargaining with the PKK. \u201cThe terror-free Turkey project is not the result of negotiations, bargaining or transactions.\u201d Turkish officials have not disclosed if any concessions have been given to the PKK in exchange for laying down their arms.",
      "The Turkish president also said that a parliamentary commission would be established to oversee the peace process.",

      "Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov flew to North Korea\u2019s eastern Wonsan city on Friday for a meeting with his North Korean counterpart Choe Son Hui.",
      "Relations between Russia and North Korea have been flourishing in recent years, with North Korea supplying troops and ammunitions to support Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine in return for military and economic assistance. That has raised concerns among South Korea, the U.S. and others that Russia might also transfer to North Korea sensitive technologies that can increase the danger of its nuclear and missile programs.",
      "After a meeting with Choe on Saturday, Lavrov accused the U.S., South Korea and Japan of what he called their military buildups around North Korea.",
      "\u201cWe warn against exploiting these ties to build alliances directed against anyone, including North Korea and, of course, Russia,\u201d he told reporters, according to Russia\u2019s state Tass news agency.",
      "The U.S., South Korea and Japan have been expanding or restoring their trilateral military exercises in response to North Korea\u2019s advancing nuclear program. On Friday, the three countries held a joint air drill involving U.S. nuclear-capable bombers near the Korean Peninsula, as their top military officers met in Seoul and urged North Korea to cease all unlawful activities that threaten regional security.",
      "North Korea views major U.S.-led military drills as invasion rehearsals. It has long argued that it\u2019s forced to develop nuclear weapons to defend itself from U.S. military threats.",
      "Lavrov said Russia understands North Korea\u2019s decision to seek nuclear weapons.",
      "\u201cThe technologies used by North Korea are the result of the work of its own scientists. We respect North Korea\u2019s aspirations and understand the reasons why it is pursuing a nuclear development,\u201d Lavrov said.",
      "During their meeting, Choe reiterated that North Korea \u201cunconditionally\u201d supports Russia\u2019s fight against Ukraine. She described ties between North Korea and Russia as \u201cthe invincible alliance.\u201d",
      "Lavrov said he repeated Russia\u2019s gratitude for the contribution that North Korean troops made in efforts to repel a Ukrainian incursion into Russia\u2019s Kursk border region.",
      "Wonsan city, the meeting venue, is where North Korea recently opened a mammoth beach resort that it says can accommodate nearly 20,000 people.",
      "In his comments at the start of his meeting with Choe, Lavrov said that \u201cI am sure that Russian tourists will be increasingly eager to come here. We will do everything we can to facilitate this, creating conditions for this, including air travel,\u201d according to the Russian Foreign Ministry.",
      "The Wonsan-Kalma tourist zone is at the center of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s push to boost tourism as a way to improve his country\u2019s troubled economy. But prospects for the biggest tourist complex in North Korea aren\u2019t clear, as the country appears unlikely to fully reopen its borders and embrace Western tourists anytime soon.",

      "NEW DELHI -- A preliminary finding into last month\u2019s Air India plane crash has suggested the aircraft\u2019s fuel control switches were turned off, starving the engines of fuel and causing a loss of engine thrust shortly after takeoff.",
      "The report, issued by India\u2019s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau on Saturday, also found that one pilot was heard on the cockpit voice recorder asking the other why he cut off the fuel in the flight\u2019s final moment. The other pilot replied he did not do so.",
      "The Air India flight \u2014 a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner \u2014 crashed on June 12 and killed at least 260 people, including 19 on the ground, in the northwestern city of Ahmedabad. Only one passenger survived the crash, which is one of India\u2019s worst aviation disasters.",
      "The report based its finding on the data recovered from the plane\u2019s black boxes \u2014 combined cockpit voice recorders and flight data recorders.",
      "Here is an explanation of what black boxes are and what they can do:",
      "The cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder are tools that help investigators reconstruct the events that lead up to a plane crash.",
      "They\u2019re orange in color to make them easier to find in wreckage, sometimes at great ocean depths. They\u2019re usually installed a plane\u2019s tail section, which is considered the most survivable part of the aircraft, according to the National Transportation Safety Board's website.",
      "The cockpit voice recorder collects radio transmissions and sounds such as the pilot\u2019s voices and engine noises, according to the NTSB\u2019s website.",
      "Depending on what happened, investigators may pay close attention to the engine noise, stall warnings and other clicks and pops, the NTSB said. And from those sounds, investigators can often determine engine speed and the failure of some systems.",
      "Investigators can also listen to conversations between the pilots and crew and communications with air traffic control. Experts make a meticulous transcript of the voice recording, which can take up to a week.",
      "The flight data recorder monitors a plane\u2019s altitude, airspeed and heading, according to the NTSB. Those factors are among at least 88 parameters that newly built planes must monitor.",
      "Some can collect the status of more than 1,000 other characteristics, from a wing\u2019s flap position to the smoke alarms. The NTSB said it can generate a computer animated video reconstruction of the flight from the information collected.",
      "At least two people have been credited with creating devices that record what happens on an airplane.",
      "One is French aviation engineer Fran\u00e7ois Hussenot. In the 1930s, he found a way to record a plane\u2019s speed, altitude and other parameters onto photographic film, according to the website for European plane-maker Airbus.",
      "In the 1950s, Australian scientist David Warren came up with the idea for the cockpit voice recorder, according to his 2010 AP obituary.",
      "Warren had been investigating the crash of the world\u2019s first commercial jet airliner, the Comet, in 1953, and thought it would be helpful for airline accident investigators to have a recording of voices in the cockpit, the Australian Department of Defence said in a statement after his death.",
      "Warren designed and constructed a prototype in 1956. But it took several years before officials understood just how valuable the device could be and began installing them in commercial airlines worldwide.",
      "Some have suggested that it stems from Hussenot\u2019s device because it used film and \u201cran continuously in a light-tight box, hence the name \u2018black box,\u2019\u201d according to Airbus, which noted that orange was the box\u2019s chosen color from the beginning to make it easy to find.",
      "Other theories include the boxes turning black when they get charred in a crash, the Smithsonian Magazine wrote in 2019.",
      "The media continues to use the term, the magazine wrote, \u201cbecause of the sense of mystery it conveys in the aftermath of an air disaster.\u201d",

      "Choeung Ek, located about 15 kilometers (10 miles) south of the capital, was used as an execution site and mass grave. The story of the atrocities committed there are the focus of the 1984 film \u201cThe Killing Fields,\u201d based on the experiences of New York Times photojournalist Dith Pran and correspondent Sydney Schanberg.",
      "The Khmer Rouge captured Phnom Penh on April 17, 1975, and immediately herded almost all the city\u2019s residents into the countryside, where they were forced to toil in harsh conditions until 1979, when the regime was driven from power by an invasion from neighboring Vietnam.",
      "In September 2022, the U.N.-backed Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, better known as the Khmer Rouge tribunal, concluded its work compiling cases against Khmer Rouge leaders. The tribunal cost $337 million over 16 years but convicted just three men.",

      "SAN SALVADOR -- Mexico's government clarified there was \u201cno indication\u201d that an airplane it intercepted loaded with cocaine had originated from El Salvador, according to a letter posted by Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele.",
      "The letter, posted on the social media platform X by the populist leader, comes after a diplomatic drama broke out between Bukele and Mexican officials when Mexico's security chief said authorities believed that a plane had come from El Salvador.",
      "The assertions riled up Bukele, who recalled El Salvador's ambassador to Mexico and demanded a correction from the Mexican government. Bukele has staked much of his popularity on his hard-handed crackdown on crime.",
      "He responded to the assertion the word \u201cFALSE\u201d on a post on X, that went on to detail the plane\u2019s alleged flight path. Bukele also pointed out that the three men arrested with the plane were Mexican citizens.",
      "Mexico's security chief Omar Garc\u00eda Harfuch had backed away from his original statement that the plane originated in El Salvador, to later say that Mexican authorities picked up the plane on radar as it was passing the Salvadoran capital, albeit well out to sea. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Thursday she would not engage in a dispute with her Salvadoran counterpart.",
      "On Friday, the letter posted by Bukele - apparently written by Mexico's Secretary of Foreign Relations to the Salvadoran Embassy - clarified that there was no clear evidence the flight had originated from the Central American nation \u201cnor that anyone in the country was linked to the incident.\u201d",
      "The letter, dated July 11, offers to respond to any other questions \u201cthat may arise on the topic\u201d to preserve the relationship between the two countries and said it hopes to \u201cstrengthen the exchange of information to avoid similar situations in the future.\u201d",
      "Bukele said he appreciated the clarification. El Salvador's presidential office did not confirm if the country would send its ambassador back to Mexico, noting that \u201cthe president will decide.\u201d",

      "The Free Narges Coalition Steering Committee, which advocates for the 53-year-old laureate, said that the threats came from Iran's Intelligence Ministry. Iran's government hasn't responded to Mohammadi's recent remarks, and Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "The U.N.'s World Food Programme says it will suspend various food and nutritional assistance in vulnerable countries across West and Central Africa as a result of U.S. aid cuts that have left the agency struggling",
      "LAGOS, Nigeria -- The World Food Programme said Friday it is suspending food and nutritional assistance across crisis-hit West and Central African countries as a result of U.S. aid cuts, which are grinding the organization\u2019s operations to a halt.",
      "While the timeline varies, food stocks are projected to last until around September for most of the affected countries, leaving millions of vulnerable people potentially without any emergency aid, according to the WFP.",
      "\u201cWe are doing everything we can to prioritize the most life-saving activities, but without urgent support from our partners, our ability to respond is shrinking by the day. We need sustained funding to keep food flowing and hope alive,\u201d Margot van der Velden, the WFP's regional director, told The Associated Press.",
      "Seven countries are affected in the region, with the suspension of operations already underway in Mauritania, Mali and the Central African Republic, where food stocks are projected to last only a few weeks. Aid distribution has already been significantly scaled down in Cameroonian camps for Nigerian refugees in the country, according to the WFP.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to cut USAID and critical funding to the United Nations has left many aid agencies struggling to survive despite the worsening humanitarian crises across the Sahel and other parts of Africa, where jihadist groups have continued to expand their operations.",
      "Millions of people are expected to be immediately affected, according to WFP data seen by the AP, including 300,000 children in Nigeria at risk of \u201csevere malnutrition, ultimately raising the risk of death\u201d.",
      "The International Rescue Committee this month said there was a 178% rise in inpatient admissions at its clinics from March-May in northern Nigeria, where 1.3 million people depend on WFP aid.",
      "Displaced people in Mali have not received any emergency food supplies since June, which marked the start of a period during which food production is at its lowest in the Sahel.",
      "Despite the continued influx of refugees from North Darfur due to the ongoing Sudanese conflict, emergency food supplies in Chad will only last to the end of the year. Niger faces a total suspension of food aid by October.",
      "These countries are already in the grip of escalating humanitarian crises, sparked by constant attacks by multiple terrorist groups, where thousands of people have been killed and millions displaced, the U.N. says. The attacks have been exacerbated by worsening climate conditions that have affected harvests and struggling economies across the continents.",
      "\u201cThe consequences are not just humanitarian but potentially affecting the stability of the entire region,\" Van der Velden said.",
      "The WFP says it needs $494 million to cover the second half of 2025, but the funds have been totally depleted, forcing it to prioritize the most vulnerable groups. In northern and central Mali it will prioritize newly displaced refugees and children under five.",
      "Experts say the fallout of the suspension of the WFP\u2019s operations in the vulnerable countries will worsen the security challenge as it makes it more likely for jihadist groups to recruit.",
      "\u201cIt becomes a more complicated crisis because in regions where the WFP operations are focused because the same challenge also intersects with security. It is going to bode double jeopardy,\u201d said Oluwole Ojewale, a Dakar-based security analyst at the Institute of Security Studies.",
      "He added: \u201cWhen hunger comes on top of the layers of other challenges, it compounds the issue, and we have seen people take to terrorism and violent extremism basically because they couldn\u2019t survive the biting reality of poverty.\u201d",

      "The resistance member \u2014 who spoke on condition of anonymity \u2014 told The Associated Press that 23 civilians including four children were killed after a jet fighter dropped a bomb around 1 a.m. on a building in the village\u2019s monastery where more than 150 people from nearby villages were taking shelter to avoid fighting in the region in recent weeks.",
      "Myanmar\u2019s independent Democratic Voice of Burma online media reported that the death toll could be as high as 30. That could not be immediately confirmed.",
      "The military did not immediately comment on the incident at the monastery, which is located about 35 km (20 miles) northwest of Mandalay, the country\u2019s second largest city. In the past, the army has said it only attacks legitimate targets of war, accusing the resistance forces of being terrorists.",
      "Myanmar has been in turmoil since the army seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021, triggering a civil war. After peaceful demonstrations were put down with lethal force, many opponents of military rule took up arms, and large parts of the country are now embroiled in conflict.",
      "The military has increasingly used airstrikes to counter opposition forces, including the armed People\u2019s Defense Forces in Sagaing region, a stronghold of armed resistance. The resistance has no effective defense against air attacks.",

      "In May, Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa said during a visit to France that his country is holding indirect talks with Israel to prevent military activities along their border from going out of control.

      "\u201cThere is no silence in Ukraine,\u201d Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said after the Kharkiv bombardment. Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, has endured repeated and intensifying drone attacks in recent weeks, as have many other regions of the country.",
      "June brought the highest monthly civilian casualties of the past three years, with 232 people killed and 1,343 wounded, the U.N. human rights mission in Ukraine said Thursday. Russia launched 10 times more drones and missiles in June than in the same month last year, it said.",

      "MANILA, Philippines -- China has failed to intimidate rival claimant states into surrendering their sovereign interests in the disputed South China Sea despite its intensifying \u201cbullying tactics\u201d and the United States and other allied countries are ready to further boost deterrence against Beijing\u2019s aggression, the U.S. Pacific Fleet commander said.",
      "Adm. Stephen Koehler, who oversees the largest naval fleet command in the world, gave assurances Friday in a Manila forum of U.S. commitment to help defend freedom of passage and the rule of law in the Indo-Pacific region. The Pacific Fleet\u2019s mission, he said, was to deter aggression across the region with allies and partners \u201cand to prevail in combat if necessary.\"",
      "China\u2019s tactics have \u201cgrown steadily and more aggressive with rammings, water cannons, lasers and sometimes worse,\u201d Koehler said. \u201cBut despite these bullying tactics \u2026 China has failed to intimidate Southeast Asian claimants into surrendering their sovereign rights.\u201d",
      "Chinese officials did not immediately comment on Koehler\u2019s remarks, but they have warned Washington in the past to stop meddling in what Beijing says is a purely Asian dispute that China has been trying to resolve peacefully.",
      "Koehler cited how Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam have sustained or expanded their offshore oil and gas operations in their Exclusive Economic Zones in the South China Sea despite Beijing\u2019s growing assertiveness. The Philippines, he said, has boldly exposed China\u2019s assertive actions by publicizing the dangerous maneuvers of Chinese forces, including the use of powerful water cannons and laser beams.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a laudable resilience and resolve to defend their maritime rights in the face of mounting pressure. Nearly all Southeast Asian littoral states are now prioritizing stronger maritime capabilities,\u201d Koehler told the forum. \u201cThe U.S. Pacific Fleet is always ready to work with you to strengthen deterrence and show no individual country can be pushed around.\"",
      "Deterrence, he said, has worked to prevent a larger conflict and crisis that could hamper the flow of trade through the waterway and affect many economies.",
      "Western and Asian ambassadors, including from the U.S., Canada, Australia, France, Germany, the European Union, Japan and New Zealand, spoke at the forum, which marked the 9th anniversary of the issuance of a 2016 international arbitration ruling that invalidated China\u2019s claims to virtually the entire South China Sea.",
      "The Philippines brought its conflicts with China in the South China Sea to international arbitration in 2013, a year after a tense standoff over a disputed shoal which Beijing\u2019s forces surrounded and effectively seized. China refused to participate in the arbitration, rejected its outcome as a \u201csham\u201d and continues to defy it.",
      "U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines MaryKay Carlson said the arbitration ruling was a triumph for the Philippines and \u201ca beacon guiding us toward a future where powerful countries cannot trample on the legal rights of other states.\"",
      "\u201cNine years on, Beijing has ignored the ruling and continues to operate with impunity,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cChina continues to engage in illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive actions in support of its spurious claims.\u201d",
      "She renewed a warning that the U.S. is obligated to defend the Philippines under a 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty if Philippine forces come under an armed attack, including in the South China Sea.",
      "With China\u2019s \u201cworrisome\u201d rejection of the arbitration ruling, the Philippines has moved to strengthen its forces and territorial defense, including by pursuing legislation to demarcate the limits of its territory, which has further strained Manila's ties with Beijing, Philippine Foreign Secretary Theresa Lazaro told the forum in a video message.",
      "But she said that \u201cit is a strategic consideration that we continue the dialogue and consultation with China, even amidst tensions that severely impact the bilateral relationship.\"",
      "Chinese and Philippine officials plan to hold another round of talks in Beijing on their increasingly tense disputes in the South China Sea later this month to prevent further escalation.",

      "The 125 members of National Assembly unanimously passed the proposal Friday and legally amended Article 33 of Cambodia\u2019s constitution, enabling the government to immediately draw up a bill allowing citizenships to be stripped for the first time.",
      "The latest legal move by supporters of Prime Minister Hun Manet was viewed by critics as a way to suppress internal dissent and eliminate policital opponents of his administration and the ruling Cambodian People\u2019s Party.",

The comment appeared to be a reference to a May 28 confrontation between the armed forces of Cambodia and Thailand in which one Cambodian soldier was killed in a relatively small, contested area on the border.",
      "Thailand\u2019s Constitutional Court suspended Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra from office earlier this month pending an ethics investigation over a leaked phone call about the border dispute with Cambodian Senate President Hun Sen, the influential former prime minister and father of Hun Manet. The leaked phone call set off political turmoil in Thailand as Paetongtarn faces growing dissatisfaction over her handling of the conflict.",
      "Last month Cambodia submitted an official request to the International Court of Justice in The Hague to resolve the ongoing border dispute involving several ancient temple sites.",
      "The consitutional amendment in Cambodia comes after Hun Sen last week called for the Ministry of Justice to explore legal avenues in response to frequent government criticism by opposition figures. Hun Sen and Hun Manet both said the legal change was necessary, comparing it to similar laws in several other countries.",
      "Speaking to villagers and government officials last week in northern Kampong Thom province, Hun Manet claimed that among nearly 200 United Nations member states, 150 countries have laws allowing citizenship revocation, including the United States.",
      "\u201cPlease don\u2019t be concerned if you are a patriot and do not oppose the interest of country. But if you have conspired with foreign powers to destroy Cambodia then, yes, it is true you should be worried, and in such case you are not a Cambodian.\u201d Hun Manet said. \u201cNo true patriot would ever plot with foreign powers to destroy their nation.\u201d",
      "Amnesty International said it was deeply concerned the Cambodian government will use the \u201crepressive amendment\u201d to render its critics stateless.",
      "\u201cJudicial independence is key to safeguarding people\u2019s rights including the right to nationality and reversing a culture of impunity. This has enabled the government\u2019s authoritarian practices to continue unchecked, such as its persecution of opposition leaders, activists and independent journalists,\u201d Regional Research Director Montse Ferrer said in a statement.",
      "Former opposition leader Sam Rainsy was one of those named by Hun Sen as making comments detrimental to the nation.",
      "Rainsy for decades has been a harsh critic and one of the most popular opponents of the Cambodian People\u2019s Party, which fueled Hun Sen's rise to power. Rainsy has been in exile since 2016 to avoid serving prison sentences on defamation, treason and other charges, which his supporters consider politically motivated.",
      "Rainsy said recent comments by Hun Sen about the border dispute with Thailand were not patriotism but a personal and political reaction rooted in fear and panic over the potential collapse of a regime deeply entangled with international criminal networks.",
      "\u201cHun Sen\u2019s anti Thai rhetoric is nothing more than a political smokescreen. While he presents the dispute as one of historical grievance and national dignity, the real motive behind his indignation is Thailand\u2019s concerted effort to dismantle Chines-run cyber-scam operations based in border areas \u2014 operations that have become a vital source of illicit funding for the current Phnom Penh regime,\u201d Rainsy said in a June 28 online post.",

      "\u201cThe birds never laid here this year,\u201d said Watts, near the mouth of Virginia\u2019s Chesapeake Bay. \u201cAnd that's a pattern we've been seeing these last couple of years.\u201d",
      "Watts has a more intimate relationship with ospreys than most people have with a bird \u2014 he has climbed to their nests to free them from plastic bags, fed them by hand and monitored their eggs with telescopic mirrors.",
      "The fish-eating raptor known for gymnastic dives and whistle-like chirps is an American conservation success story. After pesticides and other hazards nearly eliminated the species from much of the country, the hawk-like bird rebounded after the banning of DDT in 1972 and now numbers in the thousands in the U.S.",
      "But Watts has documented an alarming trend. The birds, which breed in many parts of the U.S., are failing to successfully fledge enough chicks around their key population center of the Chesapeake Bay. The longtime biologist blames the decline of menhaden, a small schooling fish critical to the osprey diet. Without menhaden to eat, chicks are starving and dying in nests, Watts said.",
      "Watts's claim has put him and environmental groups at odds with the fishing industry, trade unions and sometimes government regulators. Menhaden is valuable for fish oil, fish meal and agricultural food as well as bait.",
      "U.S. fishermen have caught at least 1.1 billion pounds of menhaden every year since 1951. Members of the industry tout its sustainability and said the decline in osprey may have nothing to do with fishing.",
      "But without help, the osprey population could tumble to levels not seen since the dark days of DDT, said Watts, director of the Center for Conservation Biology at The College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia.",
      "\u201cThe osprey are yelling pretty loudly that, hey, there's not enough menhaden for us to reproduce successfully,\u201d Watts said. \u201cAnd we should be listening to them to be more informed fully on the fisheries side, and we should take precaution on the fisheries management side. But that hasn't won the day at this point.\u201d",
      "Watts, who has studied osprey on the Chesapeake for decades, has backed his claims of population decline by publishing studies in scientific journals. He said it boils down to a simple statistic \u2014 to maintain population, osprey pairs need to average 1.15 chicks per year.",
      "Osprey were reproducing at that level in the 1980s, but today in some areas around the main stem of the Chesapeake, it's less than half of that, Watts said. In particularly distressed areas, they aren't even reproducing at one-tenth that level, he said. And the decline in available menhaden matches the areas of nesting failure, Watts said.",
      "Also called pogies or bunkers, the oily menhaden are especially important for young birds because they are more nutritious than other fish in the sea. Osprey \u201creproductive performance is inextricably linked to the availability and abundance\u201d of menhaden, Watts wrote in a 2023 study published in Frontiers in Marine Science.",
      "Conservationists have been concerned for years, saying too many menhaden have been removed to maintain their crucial role in the ocean food chain. Historian H. Bruce Franklin went so far as to title his 2007 book on menhaden \u201cThe Most Important Fish In The Sea.\u201d",
      "Menhaden help sustain one of the world's largest fisheries, worth more than $200 million at the docks in 2023. Used as bait, the fish are critical for valuable commercial targets such as Maine lobster. They're also beloved by sportfishermen.",
      "The modern industry is dominated by Omega Protein, a Reedville, Virginia, company that is a subsidiary of Canadian aquaculture giant Cooke. The harvesting of the menhaden is performed by an American company, Ocean Harvesters, which is based in Reedville and contracts with Omega, which handles processing. The companies pushed back at the idea that fishing is the cause of osprey decline, although they did acknowledge that fewer menhaden are showing up in some parts of the bay.",
      "Federal data show osprey breeding is in decline in many parts of the country, including where menhaden is not harvested at all, said Ben Landry, an Omega spokesperson. Climate change, pollution and development could be playing a role, said Landry and others with the company.",
      "Blaming fishing \u201cjust reeks of environmental special interest groups having an influence over the process,\u201d Landry said.",
      "The menhaden fishery is managed by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, an interstate body that crafts rules and sets fishing quotas. Prompted by questions about ospreys, it created a work group to address precautionary management of the species in the Chesapeake Bay.",
      "In April, this group proposed several potential management approaches, including seasonal closures, restrictions on quotas or days at sea, and limitations on kinds of fishing gear. The process of creating new rules could begin this summer, said James Boyle, fishery management plan coordinator with the commission.",
      "The osprey population has indeed shown declines in some areas since 2012, but it's important to remember the bird's population is much larger than it was before DDT was banned, Boyle said.",
      "\u201cThere are big increases in osprey population since the DDT era,\u201d Boyle said, citing federal data showing a six-fold increase in osprey populations along the Atlantic Coast since the 1960s.",
      "To a number of environmental groups, any decline is too much. This irritates some labor leaders who worry about losing more jobs as the fishing industry declines.",
      "Kenny Pinkard, retired vice president of UFCW Local 400's executive board and a longtime Virginia fishermen, said he feels the industry is being scapegoated.",
      "\u201cThere are some people who just don't want to see us in business at all,\u201d he said.",
      "But Chris Moore, Virginia executive director for Chesapeake Bay Foundation, said the country risks losing an iconic bird if no action is taken. He said Watts's studies show that the osprey will fail without access to menhaden.",
      "\u201cOsprey have been a success story,\u201d Moore said. \u201cWe're in a situation where they're not replacing their numbers. We'll actually be in a situation where we're in a steep decline.\u201d",

      "Elon Musk's new AI chatbot, Grok 4, is raising eyebrows for its unusual behavior",
      "The latest version of Elon Musk's artificial intelligence chatbot Grok is echoing the views of its billionaire creator, so much so that it will sometimes search online for Musk's stance on an issue before offering up an opinion.",
      "The unusual behavior of Grok 4, the AI model that Musk's company xAI released late Wednesday, has surprised some experts.",
      "Built using huge amounts of computing power at a Tennessee data center, Grok is Musk's attempt to outdo rivals such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini in building an AI assistant that shows its reasoning before answering a question.",
      "Musk's deliberate efforts to mold Grok into a challenger of what he considers the tech industry's \u201cwoke\u201d orthodoxy on race, gender and politics has repeatedly got the chatbot into trouble, most recently when it spouted antisemitic tropes, praised Adolf Hitler and made other hateful commentary to users of Musk's X social media platform just days before Grok 4's launch.",
      "But its tendency to consult with Musk's opinions appears to be a different problem.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary,\u201d said Simon Willison, an independent AI researcher who's been testing the tool. \"You can ask it a sort of pointed question that is around controversial topics. And then you can watch it literally do a search on X for what Elon Musk said about this, as part of its research into how it should reply.\"",
      "One example widely shared on social media \u2014 and which Willison duplicated \u2014 asked Grok to comment on the conflict in the Middle East. The prompted question made no mention of Musk, but the chatbot looked for his guidance anyway.",
      "As a so-called reasoning model, much like those made by rivals OpenAI or Anthropic, Grok 4 shows its \u201cthinking\u201d as it goes through the steps of processing a question and coming up with an answer. Part of that thinking this week involved searching X, the former Twitter that's now merged into xAI, for anything Musk said about Israel, Palestine, Gaza or Hamas.",
      "\u201cElon Musk\u2019s stance could provide context, given his influence,\u201d the chatbot told Willison, according to a video of the interaction. \u201cCurrently looking at his views to see if they guide the answer.\u201d",
      "Musk and his xAI co-founders introduced the new chatbot in a livestreamed event Wednesday night but haven't published a technical explanation of its workings \u2014 known as a system card \u2014 that companies in the AI industry typically provide when introducing a new model.",
      "The company also didn't respond to an emailed request for comment Friday.",
      "The lack of transparency is troubling for computer scientist Talia Ringer, a professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who earlier in the week criticized the company's handling of the technology's antisemitic outbursts.",
      "Ringer said the most plausible explanation for Grok's search for Musk's guidance is assuming the person asking it a question is actually xAI or Musk.",
      "\u201cI think people are expecting opinions out of a reasoning model that cannot respond with opinions,\" she said. \"So for example it interprets \u2018Who do you support, Israel or Palestine?\u2019 as 'Who does xAI leadership support?\u201d",
      "Willison also said he finds Grok 4's capabilities impressive but said people buying software \"don\u2019t want surprises like it turning into \u2018mechaHitler\u2019 or deciding to search for what Musk thinks about issues.\u201d",
      "\u201cGrok 4 looks like it\u2019s a very strong model. It\u2019s doing great in all of the benchmarks,\u201d Willison said. \u201cBut if I\u2019m going to build software on top of it, I need transparency.\u201d",

      "Extortion is crippling businesses across Mexico, forcing many to shut down",
      "MEXICO CITY -- It started with a phone call to a men\u2019s clothing store in the heart of Mexico City\u2019s historic center. \u201cI need you to put together 10,000 pesos ($500) for me weekly, or else we\u2019ll have to do something,\u201d the voice said.",
      "The owner hung up and didn\u2019t answer the phone again for days. But when another call came the following week, in a surge of courage and indignation the owner told the caller he wouldn\u2019t pay, that the money demanded would have been half the store's daily income. \u201cWell, prepare to face the consequences,\u201d the voice said.",
      "Several years of escalating threats, visits from goons and armed robberies followed until the shop owner, who requested anonymity because he still fears retaliation, decided to close the store his grandfather had opened in 1936.",
      "Extortion is strangling businesses in Mexico. Much, but not all, of it is linked to Mexico powerful organized crime groups. While some larger companies eat it as the cost of doing business, many smaller ones are forced to close.",
      "The Mexican Employers\u2019 Association, Coparmex, says extortion cost businesses some $1.3 billion in 2023. And this year, while other major crimes are descending, extortion continues to rise, up 10% nationally in the first quarter compared to the same period last year.",
      "In Mexico City, the number of reported extortion cases nearly doubled in the first five months of 2025 to 498, up from 249 for the same period last year. It\u2019s the highest total at this point in the year in the past six years, according to federal crime data.",
      "After the first call in 2019, the store owner had his employees stop answering the phone for eight months. Things quieted, but in early 2020, two men came to the shop and demanded payment. The owner pretended to be a shopper and slipped out.",
      "In 2021, the weekly calls demanding money in exchange for \u201csecurity\u201d resumed. Under advice of his attorneys, eventually stopped going into the shop, instead managing everything remotely.",
      "In one of several robberies, his employees were held at gunpoint, tied up and locked in a bathroom, while the thieves took money from the cash register.",
      "Finally, after two years of threats and robberies, he reported it to authorities. Investigators demanded proof from him that he couldn\u2019t provide because the threats were always verbal, he said. The investigation went nowhere.",
      "Reported extortion cases are only a small fraction of the reality.",
      "Mexico\u2019s National Institute for Statistics and Geography estimated that some 97% of extortion cases were not reported in 2023.",
      "Reporting is low because of a combination of fear and skepticism that authorities will do something.",
      "Mexico City police chief Pablo V\u00e1squez Camacho said in an interview with AP that police were receiving more reports of extortion, but recognized that they still weren\u2019t hearing about many more. \u201cWe can\u2019t solve something that we\u2019re not even seeing or that isn\u2019t being reported,\u201d V\u00e1squez said.",
      "The problem, said Vicente Guti\u00e9rrez Camposeco, president of the Mexico City Chamber of Commerce, \u201chas become entrenched\u201d in Mexico and especially the capital in recent years.",
      "Daniel Bernardi, whose family has run a popsicle shop in the historic center for 85 years, was resigned to the situation. \u201cThere isn't much to do,\u201d he said. \"You pay when you have to pay.\"",
      "Last month, the Mexico City prosecutor\u2019s office announced that it was creating a special prosecutor\u2019s office to investigate and prosecute extortion.",
      "In July, President Claudia Sheinbaum said she would propose legislation giving the government greater powers to pursue extortionists.",
      "This week, her administration also announced a national strategy to address extortion. There will be a phone number to anonymously report extortion; the power to immediately cancel phone numbers associated with extortion calls; local anti-extortion units to investigate cases and the involvement of Mexico's Financial Intelligence Unit to freeze bank accounts associated with extortion.",
      "Nationally, extortion cases are up more than 6% on the year.",
      "Extortion\u2019s rapid expansion has to do with the significant sums it generates for organized crime, drawing in the country\u2019s most powerful drug cartels among others. The Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels have made extortion \u201cone of the divisions of their criminal portfolios,\u201d said security analyst David Saucedo.",
      "And with the cartels involved, small-time crooks take advantage of the fear and run their own little extortion rackets, pretending to be associated with larger organized crime groups.",
      "The Mexico City men's clothing store owner didn't know who was extorting him. But without help from authorities, he felt alone and exposed. The threats had grown stronger and they now said they\u2019d kill him if he didn\u2019t pay.",
      "The owner recalled that a nearby restaurant that had opened around the same time as his own store, had closed after its owner was killed, supposedly after not paying extortion demands.",
      "So in December 2023, he saw no other option but to close. Little by little he watched old pieces of furniture carried out of the store that his father had passed on to him as his grandfather had passed it on to his father.",
      "\u201cWhen I closed I felt very sad. And then it made me so mad to think that I could still go on, but because of fear I couldn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cYou work your whole life for them to destroy it.\u201d",

      "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is wrapping his up his second and final day at a Southeast Asian security conference with a high-stakes meeting with his Chinese counterpart as tensions grow between Washington and Beijing over issues from trade to security and China's support for Russia's war in Ukraine.",
      "After discussions with regional countries at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations forum in Malaysia, Rubio on Friday was close out his first official trip to Asia in his first face-to-face talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, the State Department said.",
      "The meeting comes less than 24 hours after Rubio met in Kuala Lumpur with another rival, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, during which they discussed potential new avenues to jumpstart Ukraine peace talks.",
      "The meetings come against a backdrop of global and regional unease over U.S. policies, notably on trade and large tariffs that U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to impose on friend and foe alike.",
      "While Rubio heard complaints about the tariffs from his Southeast Asian counterparts, he told reporters Thursday that many of them focused their discussion on security issues, their concerns about Chinese domination and desire for cooperation with the U.S.",
      "\u201cOf course, it\u2019s raised. It\u2019s an issue,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t say it solely defines our relationship with many of these countries. There are a lot of other issues that we work together on, and I think there was great enthusiasm that we were here and that we\u2019re a part of this.\u201d",
      "However, Trump sees China as the biggest threat to the United States in multiple fields, not least technology and trade, and like previous U.S. presidents has watched the country greatly expand its influence globally while turning increasingly assertive in the Indo-Pacific, notably toward its small neighbors over the South China Sea and Taiwan.",
      "Trump has warned of massive tariffs that he could impose on Chinese exports to the United States and preliminary discussions between the two sides have yet to produce significant progress.",
      "Since former President Joe Biden was in office, the U.S. has also accused China of assisting Russia in rebuilding its military industrial sector to help it execute its war against Ukraine. Rubio said the Trump administration shares that view.",
      "\u201cI think the Chinese clearly have been supportive of the Russian effort, and I think that generally they\u2019ve been willing to help them as much as they can without getting caught,\u201d Rubio said Thursday, suggesting the topic would be discussed if he and Wang met.",
      "Rubio and Wang have been shadow boxing during the two-day ASEAN meeting with each touting the benefits of their countries' partnerships with Southeast Asian nations.",
      "While Rubio has played up cooperation with the U.S., signing a civil-nuclear cooperation agreement with Malaysia for instance, Wang has railed against Trump's threatened tariffs, notably against almost all of ASEAN's 10 member states, calling them an abuse and an attempt to subvert free and open trade and a danger to global financial stability.",
      "While noting an overall \u201cpositive\u201d situation in East Asia, in his discussions with Southeast Asian foreign ministers, Wang warned of growing challenges brought by \u201cunilateral protectionism and the arbitrary imposition of tariffs by certain major powers.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, Wang and Lavrov met and delivered a subtle but unmistakable warning to the United States over Southeast Asia.",
      "\u201cRussia and China both support ASEAN\u2019s central role in regional cooperation, are committed to maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, and are wary of certain major powers creating divisions and instigating confrontation in the region,\u201d they said, according to Russia's foreign ministry.",

      "President Donald Trump says he will raise taxes on many imported goods from Canada to 35%, deepening a rift between two North American countries that have suffered a debilitating blow to their decades-old alliance",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said in a Thursday letter that he will raise taxes on many imported goods from Canada to 35%, deepening a rift between two North American countries that have suffered a debilitating blow to their decades-old alliance.",
      "The letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is an aggressive increase to the top 25% tariff rates that Trump first imposed in March after months of threats. Trump's tariffs were allegedly in an effort to get Canada to crack down on fentanyl smuggling despite the relatively modest trafficking in the drug from that country. Trump has also expressed frustration with a trade deficit with Canada that largely reflects oil purchases by America.",
      "\u201cI must mention that the flow of Fentanyl is hardly the only challenge we have with Canada, which has many Tariff, and Non-Tariff, Policies and Trade Barriers,\u201d Trump wrote in the letter.",
      "The higher rates would go into effect Aug. 1, creating a tense series of weeks ahead for the global economy as recent gains in the S&P 500 stock index suggest many investors think Trump will ultimately back down on the increases.",
      "While multiple countries have received tariff letters this week, Canada \u2014 America's second largest trading partner after Mexico \u2014 has become something of a foil to Trump. It has imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods and pushed back on the president's taunts of making Canada the 51st state. Mexico has also faced 25% tariffs because of fentanyl, yet it has not faced the same public pressure from Trump.",
      "Carney was elected prime minister in April on the argument that Canadians should keep their \u201celbows up.\u201d He has responded by distancing Canada from its intertwined relationship with the U.S., seeking to strengthen its links with the European Union and the United Kingdom.",
      "Hours before Trump's letter, Carney posted on X a picture of himself with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, saying, \u201cIn the face of global trade challenges, the world is turning to reliable economic partners like Canada.\u201d Implied in his statement was that the U.S. has become unreliable because of Trump's haphazard tariff regime, which has gone through aggressive threats and reversals.",
      "When Carney went to the White House in May, the public portion of their meeting was cordial. But Trump said there was nothing the Canadian leader could tell him to remove the tariffs.",
      "\u201cJust the way it is,\u201d Trump said at the time.",
      "Carney indicated he would be willing to be patient in pursuing talks on trade.",
      "\u201cThere are much bigger forces involved,\u201d the Canadian leader said. \u201cAnd this will take some time and some discussions.\u201d",
      "Trump has sent a series of tariff letters to 23 countries so far. Those form letters became increasingly personal with Canada as well as a Wednesday note that put a 50% tariff on Brazil for the ongoing trial of its former president, Jair Bolsonaro, for trying to stay in office after his 2022 election loss. Trump was similarly indicted for his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss.",
      "The letters reflect the inability of Trump to finalize the dozens of trade frameworks that he claimed would be easy to negotiate. Shortly after unveiling his April 2 \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs, a financial market selloff caused Trump to announce a 90-day negotiating period during which a 10% baseline tariff would be charged on most imported goods.",
      "But Trump has indicated that the 10% tariff rates are largely disappearing as he resets the rates with his letters.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just going to say all of the remaining countries are going to pay, whether it\u2019s 20% or 15%,\u201d Trump said in a phone interview with NBC News.",
      "So far, Trump has announced trade frameworks with the U.K. and Vietnam, as well as a separate deal with China in order to enable continued trade talks. Trump jacked up import taxes on Chinese goods to as much as 145%, but after talks Trump has said China faces total tariffs of 55%.",
      "In June, Trump said he was suspending trade talks with Canada over its plans to continue its digital services tax, which would hit U.S. technology companies. A few days later, talks resumed when Carney rescinded the tax.",
      "Under the current tariff structure, the 2020 United States Mexico Canada Agreement has protected eligible goods from Trump's tariffs. But a review of the pact is scheduled for 2026.",

      "Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe has signed a repeal of a law guaranteeing paid sick leave for workers and inflationary adjustments to the minimum wage",
      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- Eight months after voters approved it, Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe signed the repeal of a law Thursday that had guaranteed paid sick leave to workers and inflationary adjustments to the minimum wage.",
      "The move marked a major victory for the state's largest business group and a frustrating defeat for workers' rights advocates, who had spent years \u2014 and millions of dollars \u2014 building support for the successful ballot measure. The repeal will take effect Aug. 28.",
      "Kehoe, who also signed a package of tax breaks Thursday, described the paid sick leave law as an onerous mandate that imposed burdensome record-keeping.",
      "\"Today, we are protecting the people who make Missouri work \u2014 families, job creators, and small business owners \u2014 by cutting taxes, rolling back overreach, and eliminating costly mandates,\u201d Kehoe, a Republican, said in a statement released after a private bill-signing ceremony.",
      "The new tax law excludes capital gains from individual state income taxes, expands tax breaks for seniors and disabled residents and exempts diapers and feminine hygiene products from sales taxes.",
      "Richard von Glahn, who sponsored the worker benefit ballot initiative, said many parents felt forced to go to work, instead of staying home to care for a sick child, in order to pay for their rent or utilities.",
      "\"The governor signing this bill is an absolute betrayal to those families, and it hurts my heart,\u201d said von Glahn, policy director for Missouri Jobs With Justice.",
      "About one-third of states mandate paid sick leave, but many businesses voluntarily provide it. Nationwide, 79% of private-sector employees received paid sick leave last year, though part-time workers were significantly less likely to receive the benefit than full-time employees, according to Department of Labor data.",
      "Voters in Alaska, Missouri and Nebraska all approved paid sick leave measures last November. Only Alaska\u2019s, which kicked in on July 1, has remained unchanged by state lawmakers.",
      "Before Nebraska's measure could take effect Oct. 1, Republican Gov. Jim Pillen signed a measure last month exempting businesses with 10 or fewer employees from the paid sick leave requirements. The revision also lets businesses withhold paid sick leave from seasonal agricultural workers and 14- and 15-year-olds.",
      "Missouri's law allowed employees to earn one hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours worked, starting May 1. By the time it's repealed, 17 weeks will have elapsed. That means someone working 40 hours a week could have earned 22 hours of paid sick leave.",
      "If workers don't use their paid sick leave before Aug. 28, there's no legal guarantee they can do so afterward.",
      "The Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry had made repealing the law its top legislative priority.",
      "The \"paid leave and minimum wage policies were a job killer,\u201d chamber President and CEO Kara Corches said.",
      "But Missouri voters could get a second chance at mandating paid sick leave.",
      "Von Glahn has submitted a proposed ballot initiative to the secretary of state that would reinstate the repealed provisions. Because the new measure is a constitutional amendment, the Legislature would be unable to revise or repeal it without another vote of the people. Supporters haven't decided whether to launch a petition drive to try to qualify the measure for the 2026 ballot.",

      "NEW YORK -- A woman convicted of stowing away on a flight from New York to Paris without a boarding pass or a passport won\u2019t be released from custody as she faces new charges of breaching security at a Connecticut airport.",
      "Svetlana Dali was sentenced Thursday to time already served for her illegal ride to Paris last year.",
      "But a federal judge in Brooklyn said she would not be released as Connecticut authorities are seeking to extradite her to face felony charges that could have her serving up to five years behind bars if convicted.",
      "The 57-year-old, who is originally from Russia but has a green card, has been held in a federal lockup in Brooklyn for roughly seven months.",
      "Connecticut State Police confirmed after the hearing that they have an active arrest warrant against Dali, but, in an emailed statement, said release of any further information would be \u201cdependent on an arrest being made\" in Connecticut.",
      "During her sentencing Thursday, Dali spoke for more than half an hour, repeating in detail her claim that she believes she is being poisoned by unknown persons.",
      "She pleaded with the judge to order medical tests to prove her fears, which she said had prompted her to attempt to flee the country by boarding the Paris flight illegally.",
      "\u201cAll of these actions were taken in order to save my life,\u201d Dali said in Russian through a translator.",
      "Prosecutors say that on Nov. 24, 2024, Dali was able to get through security checkpoints at Bradley International Airport near Hartford, Connecticut, by hiding among other passengers.",
      "She wasn\u2019t able to board a plane, but two days later, she successfully evaded security at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York and boarded a plane bound for Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris.",
      "Prosecutors said Dali was initially rebuffed by a Transportation Security Administration official when she was unable to produce a boarding pass.",
      "But she was able to get through a special security lane for airline employees by joining a large flight crew for Air Europa as they were screened and patted down.",
      "At the gate for the Paris flight, surveillance video showed Dali sneaking past Delta Air Lines staff checking tickets by again blending into a large group of passengers.",
      "On the plane, prosecutors say Dali hid in a bathroom for hours and wasn\u2019t discovered by Delta crew members until the plane was nearing Paris.",
      "During her trial, Dali took the stand in her defense, maintaining she was never asked to show her boarding pass at the gate in JFK and had gone into the airplane bathroom because she was feeling sick.",
      "She was initially released after her arrest, but was apprehended in Buffalo, New York, after authorities said she cut off her electronic monitor and attempted to enter Canada.",
      "Prosecutors have said Dali also appears to have flown into Miami International Airport illegally.",
      "In February 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents discovered her hiding in a bathroom in a secured area in the international arrivals zone.",

      "The average rate on a 30-year U.S. mortgage edged up this week, ending a five-week decline in borrowing costs for homebuyers.",
      "The long-term rate ticked up to 6.72% from 6.67% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. A year ago, the rate averaged 6.89%.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, also rose. The average rate increased to 5.86% from 5.80% last week. A year ago, it was 6.17%, Freddie Mac said.",
      "High mortgage rates can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for borrowers and reduce their purchasing power. That\u2019s helped keep the U.S. housing market in a sales slump that dates back to 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from the rock-bottom lows they reached during the pandemic.",
      "Last year, sales of previously occupied U.S. homes sank to their lowest level in nearly 30 years. They\u2019ve remained sluggish so far this year, as many prospective homebuyers have been discouraged by elevated mortgage rates and home prices that have continued to climb, albeit more slowly.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors\u2019 expectations for the economy and inflation.",
      "The key barometer is the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans. The yield was at 4.37% at midday Thursday, up from 4.34% late Wednesday.",
      "Yields moved up last week as traders bet that a better-than-expected June jobs report could keep the Fed on hold when it comes to interest rates.",
      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage has remained relatively close to its high so far this year of just above 7%, set in mid-January. The 30-year rate\u2019s low point this year was in early April when it briefly dipped to 6.62%.",
      "As mortgage rates eased in recent weeks, more home shoppers have been encouraged to wade into the market. Mortgage applications jumped 9.4% last week from the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.",
      "Economists generally expect mortgage rates to stay relatively stable in the coming months, with forecasts calling for the average rate on a 30-year mortgage to remain in a range between 6% and 7% this year.",
      "\"Mortgage rates may come down modestly over the coming months but other economic headwinds \u2014- including the impact of tariffs on the prices of consumer goods, weaker labor market conditions and rising consumer debt \u2014- could be what continue to hold the housing market in the second half of 2025,\u201d said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS.",

      "Sticking to healthy snacks during workdays can be tough, especially with busy schedules and tempting treats nearby",
      "NEW YORK -- When Claire Par\u00e9 was a classroom teacher, working in a setting where every minute, down to the bathroom breaks, was scheduled, she brought granola bars, fruit and protein shakes to school so she\u2019d be prepared when hunger hits.",
      "Then she transitioned to a job at education publisher McGraw Hill. Working remotely at home in New Hampshire, her children\u2019s cheddar bunny crackers and Fruit Roll-Ups lured her to the pantry, confounding her commitment to healthy snacking.",
      "\u201cI have the opportunity to be judicious, but I choose not to most of the time,\u201d Par\u00e9 said. \u201cI really do enjoy being able to put the time into making something, but oftentimes convenience just has to win out.\u201d",
      "Eating healthy snacks during the workday can be challenging. Many people find themselves facing down a mid-afternoon slump and accompanying sugar, caffeine or carbohydrate cravings after lunch. Busy adults racing from back-to-back meetings to family commitments often reach for what\u2019s easy, whether it's a candy bar from the office vending machine or potato chips from a kitchen cupboard.",
      "The problem with eating packaged sugary or salty snacks to get through the afternoon is they may spike blood sugar levels but don't give a sustained second wind, according to Beth Czerwony, a registered dietitian at Cleveland Clinic.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to burn off really fast, so you\u2019re going to get that boost of energy and then all of a sudden you\u2019re going to get another crash,\u201d Czerwony said. \"Some people just chase that for a while, and they\u2019re drinking coffee or their energy drinks and they're eating their candy, and it just sets you up for these spikes and these drops.\"",
      "Here are some ideas for maintaining healthy snacking habits at work.",
      "Foods that are high in protein, such as Greek yogurt, hard-boiled eggs, cottage cheese and beef or turkey jerky, can help people feel full for longer periods of time than snacks without protein, said Caroline Susie, a Dallas-based registered dietitian and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.",
      "Eating a snack consisting of refined carbohydrates such as a bagel causes blood sugar to rise rapidly and then drop, so teaming it up with another source of nutrition is preferable, Susie said.",
      "\u201cWhen you pair that carbohydrate with lean protein or have a protein-forward choice, it contributes to satiety. So you\u2019re just going to stay fuller longer,\u201d she added.",
      "Czerwony recommends snacks that combine lean proteins with complex carbohydrates such as crackers, rice cakes or fruit. The combination works because carbohydrates raise blood sugar, giving you a boost, while the protein takes longer to digest, helping to sustain you for longer, she said.",
      "\u201cThe carbohydrates are like the kindling on the fire, and then the proteins are the logs,\u201d Czerwony said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get the slow burn from the protein, but you need that sudden start, so you have the carbohydrates to get you going.\"",
      "Many people find it hard to resist crunchy foods. For a satisfying munch, the American Heart Association recommends sliced apples with a tablespoon of low-sodium peanut butter, pears dipped in reduced-fat cottage cheese, vegetables such as carrots, celery, bell peppers, cucumber or zucchini paired with hummus or tzatziki sauce, popcorn, rice cakes or unsalted nuts and seeds. You can also roast chickpeas, which provide both protein and carbohydrates.",
      "For a packaged snack, read the nutrition label to check how much added sugar and sodium it contains, the association suggests.",
      "The Cleveland Clinic recommends whole fruit, edamame, seeds, a handful of nuts or a single-serving package of tuna that you can eat with a fork.",
      "Bringing your own snacks to work can help you control the quality and quantity of what you eat, Czerwony said. Try slicing vegetables, cheese or low-fat meats on weekends to last through the week, she said.",
      "\u201cIf you have all that stuff already made, then it\u2019s easy in the morning to just grab it and go,\u201d she said.",
      "Take along a small, soft-sided cooler to help keep snacks like yogurt, sliced veggies or hummus fresh. \u201cGet cute little bento boxes, get little containers, make it fun if that\u2019s something that you want to do, because we\u2019ll eat things that are more attractive instead of just being in a Ziploc,\u201d Czerwony said.",
      "Petra Durnin, a Los Angeles-based senior director at commercial real estate firm JLL, blends greens, nuts, berries, avocado, banana and chia or flax seeds into homemade smoothies, which she makes in large batches. At night, she moves one jar to the fridge to thaw for the next day. An afternoon smoothie keeps her full until dinnertime and less likely to reach for chips, chocolate and sugar, she said.",
      "\u201cI feel like I have better brain clarity,\u201d Durnin said. \u201cI\u2019m able to push through the afternoon and work more efficiently. I don\u2019t feel bloated, bogged down. It just feels better.\u201d'",
      "Adopting healthy snacking habits doesn't mean you have to deprive yourself entirely of treats. If a coworker is celebrating a birthday, an occasional slice of cake won't completely derail healthy habits.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s not demonize food,\u201d Susie said.",
      "Before dipping into a bag of chips, eat a meal that includes lean protein, complex carbohydrates and healthy fat, and then add something healthy to the snack while keeping an eye on portion size, Susie said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not going to be a perfect substitute for chips. You can eat carrots all you want, but you can\u2019t trick your body with thinking that they\u2019re chips,\u201d Czerwony said. \u201cIf you want a chip, have the stinking chip and just be done with it.\"",
      "However, a constant hankering for chips could be a sign of a dietary deficiency, and it's worth figuring that out so \u201cthose types of things are more treats than something that\u2019s in the routine mix of what you\u2019re eating throughout the day,\" Czerwony said.",
      "Gisela Marx, 53, rarely gets a chance to sit or eat while working as deputy front of house manager at the Auditorium Theater in Chicago. On event days, she works from 3 p.m. until 11 p.m. or later. She packs healthy snacks such as watermelon and nuts.",
      "She also keeps an emergency stash of Reese\u2019s Pieces, which her boss has to replenish if he eats the last one.",
      "\u201cJust having it there is a comfort. I can always have it if I want it,\u201d Marx said.",

      "The man, whose identity was not released in line with Dutch privacy guidelines, was sentenced in the Dutch port city of Rotterdam to three years' imprisonment. He was acquitted of some of the counts in his indictment, including that he received payment for the information.",
      "\u201cGiving advice and sharing technology with Russia is extremely serious,\u201d the court said in a written judgment. \u201cIt can contribute to strengthening the country\u2019s military and strategic capabilities. That has consequences for Ukraine and indirectly for international security and stability.\u201d",
      "ASML is one of the world\u2019s leading makers of machines to manufacture processor chips. The company has an annual turnover of billions of dollars (euros) thanks to its cutting-edge technology. It had no immediate reaction to the judgment.",
      "Rotterdam District Court said the suspect shared information about setting up a microchip production line in Russia. Such semiconductor chips have many uses including as vital components in military equipment like drones that are a key part of Moscow's war machine in Ukraine.",
      "The suspect showed no emotion as he walked out of the courtroom after his convictions and sentence were read out and translated by a Russian-language interpreter on a speaker phone. He has 14 days to lodge an appeal.",
      "At his trial on June 26, the suspect admitted copying files last year and sending them to a person in Russia using the Signal messaging app.",
      "\u201cI didn't ask myself if these files were allowed to be sent to Russia,\u201d he said in comments quoted in the judgment. \u201cYes, I gave advice.\u201d",
      "ASML has been slapped with export restrictions in recent years that are seen as part of a U.S. policy that aims at restricting China\u2019s access to materials used to make such chips.",
      "The case is not the first time the Dutch high-tech sector has been a target for industrial espionage.",
      "In 2020, the Dutch domestic intelligence agency said it had unmasked two Russian spies who were targeting the Netherlands\u2019 science and technology sector.",
      "One of the spies was seeking information on artificial intelligence, semiconductors and nanotechnology, the agency said at the time. \u201cThis technology has civil as well as military applications, including in weapons systems,\u201d it added.",

      "Billionaire Elon Musk's company said in a regulatory filing on Thursday that the meeting will be held on Nov. 6. A group of more than 20 Tesla shareholders said in a letter to the company a day earlier that it needed to provide public notice of the annual meeting.",
      "Texas law states businesses must hold annual meetings within 13 months of their last one, if shareholders request it. But the law also allows for \u201cwritten consent instead of the annual meeting\u201d to be executed within the 13-month timeframe. Tesla is incorporated in Texas.",
      "The annual meeting, given Tesla's fortunes this year, has the potential to be a raucous event and it is unclear how investors will react to the delay, which is rare for any major U.S. corporation.",
      "Tesla shares have plunged 27% this year, largely due to blowback over Musk's affiliation with President Donald Trump, as well as rising competition.",
      "Many shareholders have been miffed by Musk's participation in the Trump administration this year, saying he needs to focus on his EV company which is facing extraordinary pressures.",

      "Tesla also said in its regulatory filing on Thursday that July 31 is the new deadline for the submission of proposals to be included in the proxy statement. In a January filing, Tesla said it would file its proxy statement for this year's annual meeting by the end of April.",

      "Italian confectioner Ferrero, known for brands like Nutella and Kinder, is buying the century-old U.S. cereal company WK Kellogg in a deal valued at approximately $3.1 billion",
      "Italian confectioner Ferrero, known for brands like Nutella and Kinder, is buying the century-old U.S. cereal company WK Kellogg in an effort to expand its North American sales.",
      "The Ferrero Group said Thursday it will pay $23 for each Kellogg share, or approximately $3.1 billion. The transaction includes WK Kellogg Co.'s six manufacturing plants, and the marketing and distribution of its breakfast cereals across the United States, Canada and the Caribbean.",
      "WK Kellogg's shares were up 31% in early afternoon trading Thursday.",
      "Kellogg was founded in Battle Creek, Michigan, in 1906 after its founder accidentally figured out how to make flaked cereal while he was experimenting with granola. Kellogg still makes Corn Flakes, as well as Froot Loops, Special K, Frosted Flakes, Rice Krispies and other cereals.",
      "Kellogg now has four U.S. plants, which are located in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Nebraska. It also has a plant in Mexico and a plant in Canada. The company has around 3,000 employees.",
      "The current company was formed in 2023, when Kellogg snack brands like Cheez-Its and Pringles were spun into a separate company called Kellanova. M&M's maker Mars Inc. announced last year that it planned to buy Kellanova in a deal worth nearly $30 billion.",
      "Ferrero Group, which was founded in Italy in 1946, has been trying to expand its U.S. footprint. In 2018 it bought Nestle's U.S. candy brands, including Butterfinger, Nerds and SweeTarts. And in 2022 it bought Wells Enterprises, the maker of ice cream brands like Blue Bunny and Halo Top.",
      "WK Kellogg's brands have been struggling with a long-term decline in U.S. cereal consumption as consumers turned to protein bars, shakes and other breakfast items. Cereal sales got a bump during the coronavirus pandemic as more families stayed home, but sales continued to decline after the pandemic eased.",
      "At the start of July, U.S. cold cereal sales were down 6% compared to the same period in 2022, according to market research company Nielsen IQ. Kellogg's net sales fell 2% to $2.7 billion in 2024.",
      "Brad Haller, a senior partner for mergers and acquisitions at West Monroe, said Kellogg's large distribution network and relationships with grocery chains in North America is appealing to Ferrero because it would help the European company negotiate pricing and positioning for its products.",
      "The purchase also helps Ferraro expand beyond snacks and sweets and into a meal category, Haller said. But the company also may wind up cutting Kellogg brands or shutting down manufacturing plants.",
      "\u201cAs Americans, these brands are iconic and beloved by us, but a European company buying these wouldn\u2019t have the same nostalgia,\u201d Haller said.",
      "Kellogg has had other issues. A nearly three-month strike by workers at all its U.S. cereal plants in late 2021 hurt sales. And last fall, dozens of people rallied outside the company's Battle Creek headquarters demanding that Kellogg remove artificial dyes from its cereals.",
      "Earlier this year, Kellogg said it was reformulating cereals sold to schools to remove artificial dyes and will not include them in any new products starting in January.",
      "Ferrero's acquisition, which still needs approval from Kellogg shareholders, is expected to close in the second half of the year. Once the transaction is complete, Kellogg\u2019s stock will no longer trade on the New York Stock Exchange and the company will become a Ferrero subsidiary.",

      "PARIS -- Sketched out on an air sickness bag, the first Birkin bag that gave birth to fashion's must-have accessory sold for a record 7 million euros (about $8.2 million) at auction in Paris on Thursday.",
      "The huge amount \u2014 which drew gasps and applause from the audience \u2014 crushed what auctioneer Sotheby\u2019s had said was the previous record for a handbag. That was $513,040, for a White Himalaya Niloticus Crocodile Diamond Retourne Kelly 28.",
      "Now, the original Birkin bag, named after the actor, singer and fashion icon that Herm\u00e8s created it for \u2014 the late Jane Birkin \u2014 is in a new league of its own.",
      "The bidding started at 1 million euros ($1.17 million) and quickly became stratospheric.",
      "The Paris fashion house exclusively commissioned the bag for the London-born star in 1984 \u2014 branding it with her initials J.B. on the front flap, below the lock \u2014 and delivered the finished one-of-a-kind bag to her the following year, the auction house said. The subsequent commercialized version of Birkin's bag went on to become one of the world\u2019s most exclusive luxury items, extravagantly priced and with a yearslong waiting list.",
      "The bag was born of a fortuitous encounter on a London-bound flight in the 1980s with the then head of Herm\u00e8s, Jean-Louis Dumas. Birkin recounted in subsequent interviews that the pair got talking after she spilled some of her things on the cabin floor.",
      "Birkin asked Dumas why Herm\u00e8s didn\u2019t make a bigger handbag and sketched out on an airplane vomit bag the sort of hold-all that she would like. He then had an example made for her and, flattered, she agreed when Herm\u00e8s asked whether it could commercialize the bag in her name.",
      "\u201cThere is no doubt that the Original Birkin bag is a true one-of-a-kind \u2014 a singular piece of fashion history that has grown into a pop culture phenomenon that signals luxury in the most refined way possible. It is incredible to think that a bag initially designed by Herm\u00e8s as a practical accessory for Jane Birkin has become the most desirable bag in history,\" said Morgane Halimi, Sotheby\u2019s head of handbags and fashion.",
      "The bag became so famous that Birkin once mused before her death in 2023 at age 76 that her obituaries would likely \u201csay, \u2018Like the bag\u2019 or something.\u201d",
      "\u201cWell, it could be worse,\" she added.",
      "Sotheby\u2019s said that seven design elements on the handcrafted all-black leather prototype set it apart from Birkins that followed.",
      "It's the only Birkin with a nonremovable shoulder strap \u2014 fitting for the busy life and practicality of the singer, actor, social activist and mother who was also known for her romantic relationship with French singer Serge Gainsbourg and their duets that included the steamy 1969 song \u201cJe t\u2019aime moi non plus\u201d (\u201cI Love You, Me Neither\u201d).",
      "Her bag also had a nail clipper attached, because Birkin \u201cwas never one for long painted nails,\u201d Sotheby\u2019s said.",
      "The bag that Herm\u00e8s handmade for her, developed off its existing Haut A Courroies model, also has gilded brass hardware, bottom studs and other features that differ from commercial Birkins.",
      "Birkin's casual, breezy style in the 1960s and early 1970s \u2014 long hair with bangs, jeans paired with white tops, knit minidresses and basket bags \u2014 still epitomizes the height of French chic for many women around the world.",
      "When Birkin chatted to Herm\u00e8s' Dumas on the Paris-to-London flight about what her ideal handbag would be, she'd been in the habit of carrying her things around in a wicker basket, because she felt handbags in the 1980s were too small, Sotheby\u2019s said. She was traveling with her young daughter, Charlotte, and complained that she couldn\u2019t find a bag suitable for her needs as a mother, Herm\u00e8s says.",
      "Herm\u00e8s later gifted her four other Birkin bags. She kept the prototype for nearly a decade, before auctioning it for an AIDS charity in 1994. It was auctioned again in 2000 and has since been in private hands, Sotheby\u2019s said.",
      "\u201cMore than just a bag, the Birkin has evolved from a practical accessory to become a timeless cultural icon,\" the auction house said.",
      "\u201cIts presence spans the worlds of music, film, television and the arts,\" it added. \"It is a red-carpet staple, a fashion magazine mainstay, and a coveted piece in the wardrobes of celebrities, artists and stylists.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A new U.N. AIDS agency report says the sudden withdrawal of U.S. funding has caused a \u201csystemic shock\u201d to the global effort against AIDS and HIV",
      "LONDON -- Years of American-led investment into AIDS programs has reduced the number of people killed by the disease to the lowest levels seen in more than three decades, and provided life-saving medicines for some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable.",
      "But in the last six months, the sudden withdrawal of U.S. money has caused a \u201csystemic shock,\u201d U.N. officials warned, adding that if the funding isn\u2019t replaced, it could lead to more than 4 million AIDS-related deaths and 6 million more HIV infections by 2029.",
      "\u201cThe current wave of funding losses has already destabilized supply chains, led to the closure of health facilities, left thousands of health clinics without staff, set back prevention programs, disrupted HIV testing efforts and forced many community organizations to reduce or halt their HIV activities,\u201d UNAIDS said in a report released Thursday.",
      "UNAIDS also said that it feared other major donors might also scale back their support, reversing decades of progress against AIDS worldwide \u2014 and that the strong multilateral cooperation is in jeopardy because of wars, geopolitical shifts and climate change.",
      "The $4 billion that the United States pledged for the global HIV response for 2025 disappeared virtually overnight in January when U.S. President Donald Trump ordered that all foreign aid be suspended and later moved to shutter the U.S. AID agency.",
      "Andrew Hill, an HIV expert at the University of Liverpool who is not connected to the United Nations, said that while Trump is entitled to spend U.S. money as he sees fit, \u201cany responsible government would have given advance warning so countries could plan,\u201d instead of stranding patients in Africa when clinics were closed overnight.",
      "The U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, was launched in 2003 by U.S. President George W. Bush, the biggest-ever commitment by any country focused on a single disease.",
      "UNAIDS called the program a \u201clifeline\u201d for countries with high HIV rates, and said that it supported testing for 84.1 million people, treatment for 20.6 million, among other initiatives. According to data from Nigeria, PEPFAR also funded 99.9% of the country\u2019s budget for medicines taken to prevent HIV.",
      "In 2024, there were about 630,000 AIDS-related deaths worldwide, per a UNAIDS estimate \u2014 the figure has remained about the same since 2022 after peaking at about 2 million deaths in 2004.",
      "Even before the U.S. funding cuts, progress against curbing HIV was uneven. UNAIDS said that half of all new infections are in sub-Saharan Africa.",
      "Tom Ellman, of the charity Doctors Without Borders, said that while some poorer countries were now moving to fund more of their own HIV programs, it would be impossible to fill the gap left by the U.S.",
      "\u201cThere's nothing we can do that will protect these countries from the sudden, vicious withdrawal of support from the U.S.,\u201d said Ellman, director of Doctors Without Borders' South Africa Medical Unit.",
      "Experts also fear another loss: data. The U.S. paid for most HIV surveillance in African countries, including hospital, patient and electronic records, all of which has now abruptly ceased, according to Dr. Chris Beyrer, director of the Global Health Institute at Duke University.",
      "\u201cWithout reliable data about how HIV is spreading, it will be incredibly hard to stop it,\u201d he said.",
      "The uncertainty comes as a twice-yearly injectable could end HIV, as studies published last year showed that the drug from pharmaceutical maker Gilead was 100% effective in preventing the virus.",
      "At a launch event Thursday, South Africa's health minister Aaron Motsoaledi said the country would \u201cmove mountains and rivers to make sure every adolescent girl who needs it will get it,\u201d saying that the continent's past dependence upon US aid was \u201cscary.\u201d",
      "Last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the drug, called Yeztugo, a move that should have been a \u201cthreshold moment\u201d for stopping the AIDS epidemic, said Peter Maybarduk of the advocacy group Public Citizen.",
      "But activists like Maybarduk said Gilead\u2019s pricing will put it out of reach of many countries that need it. Gilead has agreed to sell generic versions of the drug in 120 poor countries with high HIV rates but has excluded nearly all of Latin America, where rates are far lower but increasing.",
      "\u201cWe could be ending AIDS,\" Maybarduk said. \"Instead, the U.S. is abandoning the fight.\u201d",

      "Rory McIlroy is starting to look like the same player who won the Masters in April for the career Grand Slam",
      "NORTH BERWICK, Scotland -- Masters champion Rory McIlroy took another step toward emerging out of the doldrums with two big shots at the end of his round Saturday that led to a 4-under 66 and gave him a share of the lead with Chris Gotterup in the Scottish Open.",
      "McIlroy kept in range of Gotterup on another gorgeous day of sunshine along the Firth of Forth and then came into everyone's view in the middle of the back nine at The Renaissance Club.",
      "Following a 15-foot birdie on the par-3 14th, his shot from a greenside pot bunker hit the pin for a tap-in par to keep his momentum. McIlroy was in trouble again on the par-5 16th; in just a horrible lie he could advance it only some 70 yards. With the wind at his back and wispy grass beneath the golf ball, he hit sand wedge from 173 yards to 10 feet for birdie.",
      "Two closing pars put him at 11-under 199. That was enough to catch Gotterup, a big athlete with big power who had gone 34 holes without a bogey until the second hole Saturday. He fell into a tie with a three-putt from 60 feet for bogey on the 14th and failed to birdie the 16th.",
      "Gotterup, who tied the course record with a 61 on Friday, had to settle for a 70. He will be in the last group with McIlroy, a daunting task given McIlroy already won at The Renaissance Club and is the biggest draw in most parts in the world, particularly in Scotland, and particularly with the British Open a week away.",
      "\u201cI think I\u2019m pretty close to being back to the level I was at going into the Masters,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cI think I\u2019ve had a little bit of a lull, which I feel is understandable. So I\u2019m just getting back to the level that I know that I can play at.\u201d",
      "Wyndham Clark had a 66 and will join McIlroy and Gotterup in the final group. Tee times are being moved up slightly to account for a forecast of heavy fog, which threatened to move in at various times Saturday but stayed offshore.",
      "Clark was at 9-under 201 along with Jake Knapp, who for the longest time was the closest challenger to Gotterup until a wild finish of birdies on the closing par 3s and bogeys on the other holes for a 68.",
      "Matt Fitzpatrick and Marco Penge also were at 201, with both English players posting a 69.",
      "Gotterup and Knapp also are in prime position to extend their stay of links golf. The leading three players not yet eligible will earn a spot at Royal Portrush next week for the British Open.",
      "McIlroy hasn't looked the same since the great day of his career that Sunday at Augusta National, where he won a playoff to finally claim the Masters green jacket and joined the exclusive group of five other players with the career Grand Slam.",
      "He has not seriously come close to winning since then. He arrived in Scotland off a two-week break and described his game at 80%.",
      "McIlroy had few complaints about it after Saturday.",
      "\u201cEven though I scored better yesterday (a 65), I feel like I played my best golf of the week today,\u201d McIlroy said.",
      "He has not set foot on Royal Portrush since that Friday of the 2019 Open, where he did his best to atone for an opening 79 and wound up missing the cut by one shot. His caddie, Harry Diamond, was at the Northern Ireland links to look at some of the changes, mainly a few holes that have been lengthened.",
      "It's a big week for McIlroy, who has never won on home soil as a professional. And Sunday would be the perfect time for him to show his game is good as ever.",
      "\u201cWhen you do something that you\u2019ve been dreaming your whole life to do, it was a huge moment in my life, my career,\u201d he said of his Masters victory.",
      "\u201cI think I just needed that little bit of time. And to be back here for last couple weeks, and feel like I could actually digest all of it, I feel like I came to this tournament with renewed enthusiasm and excitement for the rest of the year.\u201d",
      "Gotterup for the longest time looked collected on Saturday. After a rough start, including a bogey from a fairway bunker on the second hole, Gotterup drove into a bunker on the short par-4 fifth that led to bogey, and then nearly had a hole-in-one on the par-3 sixth with a shot that lipped out of the cup.",
      "But that was the last of his birdies. He failed to convert on the two par 5s on the back nine. He ran out of par-saving putts when he three-putted the 14th. But he's still there with a chance to add to his Myrtle Beach Classic title he won last year.",
      "\u201cI'm pleased, but definitely feel like I left one or two out there that would have been important,\u201d Gotterup said. \"After 61, it doesn\u2019t feel as easy. I hung in there tough and put myself in a good spot going into tomorrow.",
      "\u201cI know what I\u2019m capable of. I\u2019ve won before \u2014 obviously different tournament. So I know what it takes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a good round for sure, and I\u2019m going to go give it my best.\u201d",

      "Katie Taylor beat Amanda Serrano for the third time, winning a majority decision to remain the undisputed 140-pound champion",
      "NEW YORK -- After Katie Taylor had defeated her for the third time to remain the undisputed 140-pound champion, Amanda Serrano was in tears.",
      "Not because of the sadness over her loss, but because of the appreciation for where women's boxing has gone since the two champions started their trilogy three years ago.",
      "Taylor won by scores of 97-93 Friday night on two judges\u2019 cards, while the third had it even at 95-95, for a majority decision. It was the third straight narrow finish between the two, after Taylor won a split decision in their first bout and a narrow unanimous decision in the rematch.",
      "It was another festive atmosphere in front of another sold-out crowd of more than 19,000 at Madison Square Garden that was split between Irish and Puerto Rican fans, just the way it was when they first fought here on April 30, 2022, in what was the first women\u2019s boxing match to headline the arena.",
      "This time, the arena hosted its first all-women\u2019s card that streamed on Netflix, with many of the fighters saying during the leadup they owed their opportunity to the interest created by the Taylor-Serrano trilogy.",
      "\u201cIt was truly an amazing night for all of us women and I\u2019m crying because it\u2019s all because of you guys,\u201d Serrano told the crowd in the ring afterward. \u201cYou guys support us women and thanks to all of you we\u2019re able to show our skills.\u201d",
      "Back in Madison Square Garden, site of their first bout, Taylor improved to 25-1 in a fight that perhaps wasn't as exciting as their first two, but once again was almost too close to call.",
      "\u201cWe made history again three times,\u201d said Taylor, the 2012 Olympic gold medalist. \u201cIt\u2019s such a privilege to share the ring with her and we\u2019re history makers forever, and my name is embedded with Amanda\u2019s forever and I\u2019m so happy about that.\u201d",
      "Serrano (47-4-1) never really hurt Taylor this time, the expected final fight between the two, the way she did a couple times in the previous fights, and held her hands over her eyes when the first score announced was the even card, perhaps knowing already then she hadn't done enough to pull it out.",
      "The Associated Press scored it 95-95.",
      "Serrano was all smiles early in a joyous ring walk accompanied by the Knicks City Dancers, but it was the same heartbreak in the end.",
      "There were hardly any decisive rounds, with neither fighter able to sustain much offense as the two-minute rounds flew by. Serrano has been fighting her recent bouts with three-minute rounds, as in men\u2019s boxing, and has contended that Taylor backed out of an agreement to use that format for this fight.",
      "There were no meaningful punches in the first round, after Serrano stunned Taylor right away last November in their second fight. By the third, they were trading punches and both landing with the type of flurries they had produced so many of over their first two bouts, but there wasn't much more of that. Serrano seemed to fight more cautiously and keep her distance, perhaps remembering how she was bloodied by a clash of heads in the rematch.",
      "Serrano, the seven-division world champion who is still a champion at 126 pounds, which she feels is her best weight, was again attempting an even bigger jump than in the first fight. Taylor was still fighting at the lightweight limit 135 pounds then, but has since moved up to become undisputed in a second division.",
      "Irish and Puerto Rico flags were all over the arena and fans began loudly singing and dancing during the co-main event, while Alycia Baumgardner (16-1) was beating Jennifer Miranda (12-1) to retain her undisputed 130-pound titles as a countdown clock began showing the time remaining until the Taylor-Serrano fight.",
      "There were 17 world titles from the four major sanctioning bodies on the line during the night in what \u201cGuinness World Records\u201d said set the mark for most on a single fight card.",
      "Shadasia Green (15-1) edged Savannah Marshall (13-2), whose only previous loss was to Claressa Shields, by split decision to unify super middleweight titles and earn a $250,000 bonus for the performance of the night.",
      "In the final fight of the preliminary portion of the card, Australia\u2019s Cherneka Johnson (18-2, 8 KOs) pounded Shurretta Metcalf (14-5-1) until the fight was stopped in the ninth round to become the undisputed bantamweight champion.",
      "Ellie Scotney (11-0) added a third super bantamweight belt to the two she already held with a unanimous decision victory over Yamileth Mercado (24-4).",

      "Bellinger, whose dad Clay played for the Yankees from 1999 to 2001, is a two-time All-Star and 2019 NL MVP.",
      "He spent 2023 and \u201924 with the Cubs, hitting .266 with 18 homers and 78 RBIs in 130 games last year while missing time because of a broken right rib. The Cubs traded him to New York in December with $52.5 million remaining on his contract and agreed to pay the Yankees $5 million.",
      "He homered in a three-run third off Chris Flexen and in the fifth against Caleb Thielbar for this 18th multi-homer game. Bellinger nearly went deep in the seventh but was robbed by Kyle Tucker on a drive above the right-field wall.",

      "He tried not to make much of getting the three homers against the Cubs, but Bellinger's teammates could sense the significance.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always good to go against your old teammates that you spend a lot of time with, you know, you respect,\u201d Boone said. \u201cTo perform right away against them I\u2019m sure probably is a little cherry on top for him.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A study puts the spotlight on Texas as the leading U.S. state by far for flood-related deaths, with more than 1,000 of them from 1959 to 2019",
      "Even before the Central Texas floods that killed more than 100 people, the state was by far the leader in U.S. flood deaths due partly to geography that can funnel rainwater into deadly deluges, according to a study spanning decades.",
      "From 1959 to 2019, 1,069 people died in Texas in flooding, which is nearly one-fifth of the total 5,724 flood fatalities in the Lower 48 states in that time, according to a 2021 study in the journal Water. That's about 370 more than the next closest state, Louisiana.",
      "Flooding is the second leading weather cause of death in the country, after heat, both in 2024 and the last 30 years, averaging 145 deaths a year in the last decade, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "Other floods have turned deadly this year: Last month in San Antonio, 13 people died including 11 people who drove into water thinking they could get through, according to study author Hatim Sharif, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Texas at San Antonio who studies why people die in floods.",
      "For several years Sharif has urged state and local officials to integrate better emergency action programs to use flood forecasts and save lives by alerting people and closing off vulnerable intersections where roads and water meet.",
      "\u201cI think in Kerr County, if they had an integrated warning system that uses rainfall forecasts to forecast real-time impacts on the ground, that could have saved many lives and could have also helped emergency crews to know which location would be flooded, which roads would be impassable,\u201d Sharif said. \u201cThey could have taken action.\u201d",
      "Texas has so many deaths because of its geography, population and size, experts say. The area where the most recent deadly floods struck is known as flash flood alley because of hills and valleys.",
      "\u201cSteep, hilly terrain produces rapid runoff and quick stream rises, since the water will travel downhill at greater speed into rivers and over land,\u201d said Kate Abshire, lead of NOAA\u2019s flash flood services. \u201cRocky terrain can exacerbate the development of flash floods and raging waters, since rocks and clay soils do not allow as much water to infiltrate the ground.\u201d",
      "\u201cUrban areas are especially prone to flash floods due to the large amounts of concrete and asphalt surfaces that do not allow water to penetrate into the soil easily,\u201d she said.",
      "Along with those hills, \u201cyou\u2019ve got the Gulf of Mexico right there, the largest body of hot water in the entire North Atlantic most of the time,\u201d said Jeff Masters a former government meteorologist who co-founded Weather Underground and now is at Yale Climate Connections. \u201cSo you\u2019ve got a ready source of moisture for creating floods.\u201d",
      "Historically, many of the deaths were preventable across the nation and in Texas alike, according to experts. Masters said nothing illustrates that better than one statistic in Sharif's study: 86% of flood deaths since 1959 were people driving or walking into floodwaters.",
      "Nearly 58% of the deaths were people in cars and trucks. It's a problem especially in Texas because of hills and low lying areas that have more than 3,000 places where roads cross streams and waterways without bridges or culverts, Sharif said.",
      "\u201cPeople in Texas, they like trucks and SUVs, especially trucks,\u201d Sharif said. \u201cThey think trucks are tough, and that is I think a factor. So sometimes they use their big car or SUV or truck, and they say they can beat the flood on the street ... especially at night. They underestimate the depth and velocity of water.\u201d",
      "Abshire said that not only do people ignore the weather service's safety mantra, \u201cTurn around, don\u2019t drown,\u201d but studies found that a number of these fatalities occur when people actively drive around barricades and barriers blocking flooded roads.",
      "The latest Texas Hill Country flooding was less typical because so many of the deaths were in a camp where the water overtook the victims, not people going into the water, Sharif said. Only about 8% of flood deaths in the last 60 years happened in permanent homes, mobile homes or camping, according to the study.",
      "The July 4th floods happened at night, a common time for flood deaths. More than half of deaths since 1959 have occurred at night, when it's dark and people can't see how much flooding there is or are not awake for the warnings, Sharif's study found.",
      "As far as demographics, about 62% of U.S. flood deaths were male, according to the study.",
      "\u201cRisk-taking behavior is usually associated with men,\u201d Sharif said, adding that it's why most fatal victims of car crashes are male.",

      "NEW YORK -- A \u201cclick-to-cancel\u201d rule, which would have made it easier for consumers to end unwanted subscriptions, has been blocked by a federal appeals court days before it was set to go into effect. But there are ways to end those subscriptions and memberships, even if they take some work.",
      "The rule would also have required companies to disclose when free trials and promotional offers would end and let customers cancel recurring subscriptions as easily as they started them. But even without the new federal guidance, here are some ways to stay on top of subscription and membership fees.",
      "Experts at the Consumer Federation of America recommend setting calendar reminders for whenever a free trial period ends, to alert yourself to cancel promotional offers before the real recurring costs kick in. The auto-enrollment process, in which the company does not remind the consumer via email that a trial is about to end and higher monthly payments will begin, was also at the heart of the FTC's rule.",
      "\u201cNo subscription business model should be structured to profit from a gauntlet-style cancellation process,\" said Erin Witte, Director of Consumer Protection for the Consumer Federation of America, in a statement on the click-to-cancel rule.",
      "Regularly reviewing your credit card and debit card bills can also help you keep track of any recurring charges \u2014 including price increases you may have missed or that you didn't anticipate when trying out a new membership or subscription.",
      "\u201cCompanies make it easy for consumers to click to sign up and easy for the companies to automatically withdraw funds from consumers\u2019 accounts,\u201d said Shennan Kavanagh, Director of Litigation at the National Consumer Law Center (NCLC) in a statement on the FTC's click-to-cancel rule. \u201cPeople should not (have to) spend months trying to cancel unwanted subscriptions.\u201d",
      "Given the FTC's vacated rule, though, companies may still legally require that customers cancel memberships or subscriptions by phone, even as they permit signing up, enrolling, and paying bills online. Consumer advocates say this places an extra burden of time and energy on the consumer to stop an unwanted recurring fee, but sometimes knowing the terms of the subscription and getting on the phone is worth the trouble.",
      "Apps like Rocket Money and services like Trim, which is accessed through a browser, can keep track of your recurring monthly fees and subscriptions, for free \u2014 or for a fee \u2014 and can help you catch new ones or even unsubscribe from some services.",
      "For parents, especially, a service like Trim could help inform them that a child has started a new subscription, game or membership before the fees recur. And Rocket Money will actively work to end unwanted subscriptions for you, for a monthly price. If the company can't successfully end or cancel the subscription or membership, it will give the customer the information needed to do so. Trim also provides this service, in its premium form, for an additional fee.",
      "The FTC is currently moving forward with preparations for a trial involving Amazon\u2019s Prime program, which accuses the retailer of enrolling consumers in its Prime program without their consent and making it difficult to cancel subscriptions.",
      "Often, when a consumer tries to cancel a subscription for something like Prime, which offers free delivery and streaming video, the company will offer a month or more of the subscription at a promotional rate \u2014 half off, or at other, better-seeming values, to entice a customer to stay. Staying strong in the face of what may appear to be a good deal can help you stop recurring monthly fees before you forget to cancel them again.",
      "Agreeing to yet another trial or promotional rate, which is another on-ramp to auto-enrollment, just continues the cycle, according to consumer advocates.",
      "The FTC's rule would have required businesses to obtain a customer\u2019s consent before charging for memberships, auto-renewals and programs linked to free trials. The businesses would have also had to disclose when free trials and promotional offers would end.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit said this week that the FTC made a procedural error by failing to come up with a preliminary regulatory analysis, which is required for rules whose annual impact on the U.S. economy is more than $100 million.",
      "The FTC said that it did not have to come up with a preliminary regulatory analysis because it initially determined that the rule\u2019s impact on the national economy would be less than $100 million. An administrative law judge decided that the economic impact would be more than the $100 million threshold, and the court decided to vacate the rule.",
      "Former President Joe Biden's administration had included the FTC\u2019s proposal as part of its \u201cTime is Money\u201d initiative, which aimed to crack down on consumer-related hassles.",

      "A dinosaur fossil has been found in an unlikely place, a hole drilled under the parking lot of a Colorado museum where dinosaur skeletons are on display",
      "DENVER -- A Denver museum known for its dinosaur displays has made a fossil bone discovery closer to home than anyone ever expected, under its own parking lot.",
      "It came from a hole drilled more than 750 feet (230 meters) deep to study geothermal heating potential for the Denver Museum of Nature and Science.",
      "The museum is popular with dinosaur enthusiasts of all ages. Full-size dinosaur skeletons amaze kiddos barely knee-high to a parent, much less to a Tyrannosaurus.",
      "This latest find is not so visually impressive. Even so, the odds of finding the hockey-puck-shaped fossil sample were impressively small.",
      "With a bore only a couple of inches (5 centimeters) wide, museum officials struggled to describe just how unlikely it was to hit a dinosaur, even in a region with a fair number of such fossils.",
      "\u201cFinding a dinosaur bone in a core is like hitting a hole in one from the moon. It\u2019s like winning the Willy Wonka factory. It\u2019s incredible, it\u2019s super rare,\u201d said James Hagadorn, the museum\u2019s curator of geology.",
      "Only two similar finds have been noted in bore hole samples anywhere in the world, not to mention on the grounds of a dinosaur museum, according to museum officials.",
      "A vertebra of a smallish, plant-eating dinosaur is believed to be the source. It lived in the late Cretaceous period around 67.5 million years ago. An asteroid impact brought the long era of dinosaurs to an end around 66 million years ago, according to scientists.",
      "Fossilized vegetation also was found in the bore hole near the bone.",
      "\u201cThis animal was living in what was probably a swampy environment that would have been heavily vegetated at the time,\u201d said Patrick O'Connor, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science.",
      "Dinosaur discoveries in the area over the years include portions of Tyrannosaurus rex and triceratops-type fossils. This one is Denver's deepest and oldest yet, O'Connor said.",
      "Other experts in the field vouched for the find's legitimacy but with mixed reactions.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a surprise, I guess. Scientifically it\u2019s not that exciting,\u201d said Thomas Williamson, curator of paleontology at the New Mexico Museum of Natural History & Science in Albuquerque.",
      "There was no way to tell exactly what species of dinosaur it was, Williamson noted.",
      "The find is \"absolutely legit and VERY COOL!\u201d Erin LaCount, director of education programs at the Dinosaur Ridge track site just west of Denver, said by email.",
      "The fossil's shape suggests it was a duck-billed dinosaur or thescelosaurus, a smaller but somewhat similar species, LaCount noted.",
      "The bore-hole fossil is now on display in the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, of course, but there are no plans to look for more under the parking lot.",
      "\u201cI would love to dig a 763-foot (233-meter) hole in the parking lot to excavate that dinosaur, the rest of it. But I don't think that's going to fly because we really need parking,\u201d Hagadorn said.",

      "The poster child of the AI boom, Nvidia has grown into the most valuable company in the world, surpassing Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Google parent Alphabet.

      "In its most recent quarter, Nvidia overcame tariff-driven turbulence to deliver another quarter of robust growth amid feverish demand for its high-powered AI chips.",
      "Nvidia earned $18.8 billion, or 76 cents per share, in the period, a 26% increase from the same time last year. Revenue surged 69% from a year ago to $44.1 billion. If not for a $4.5 billion charge that Nvidia absorbed to account for the U.S. government\u2019s restrictions on its chip sales to China, Nvidia would have made 96 cents per share, far above the 73 cents per share envisioned by analysts.",

      "Nvidia and other companies benefiting from the AI boom have been a major reason the S&P 500 has climbed to record after record recently. Their explosion of profits has helped to propel the market despite worries about stubbornly high inflation and possible pain coming for the U.S. economy from tariffs and other policies of President Donald Trump.",

But if that\u2019s the case, it doesn\u2019t appear ready, she said.",

      "Musk later waded into the debate, alleging that some users may have been trying to manipulate Grok into making the statements.",
      "\u201cGrok was too compliant to user prompts. Too eager to please and be manipulated, essentially. That is being addressed,\u201d he wrote on X, in response to comments that a user was trying to get Grok to make controversial and politically incorrect statements.",
      "Also Wednesday, a court in Turkey ordered a ban on Grok and Poland's digital minister said he would report the chatbot to the European Commission after it made vulgar comments about politicians and public figures in both countries.",
      "Krzysztof Gawkowski, who's also Poland's deputy prime minister, told private broadcaster RMF FM that his ministry would report Grok \u201cfor investigation and, if necessary, imposing a fine on X.\u201d Under an EU digital law, social media platforms are required to protect users or face hefty fines.",
      "\u201cI have the impression that we\u2019re entering a higher level of hate speech, which is controlled by algorithms, and that turning a blind eye ... is a mistake that could cost people in the future,\u201d Gawkowski told the station.",

      "\u201cThe movies are my day job, and the moa are my fun thing I do,\u201d said Jackson. \u201cEvery New Zealand schoolchild has a fascination with the moa.\u201d",
      "Outside scientists say the idea of bringing back extinct species onto the modern landscape is likely impossible, although it may be feasible to tweak the genes of living animals to have similar physical traits. Scientists have mixed feelings on whether that will be helpful, and some worry that focusing on lost creatures could distract from protecting species that still exist.",
      "The moa had roamed New Zealand for 4,000 years until they became extinct around 600 years ago, mainly because of overhunting. A large skeleton brought to England in the 19th century, now on display at the Yorkshire Museum, prompted international interest in the long-necked bird.",
      "Unlike Colossal's work with dire wolves, the moa project is in very early stages. It started with a phone call about two years ago after Jackson heard about the company's efforts to \u201cde-extinct\u201d \u2013 or create genetically similar animals to \u2013 species like the woolly mammoth and the dire wolf.",
      "Then Jackson put Colossal in touch with experts he\u2019d met through his own moa bone-collecting. At that point, he\u2019d amassed between 300 and 400 bones, he said.",
      "In New Zealand, it\u2019s legal to buy and sell moa bones found on private lands, but not on public conservation areas \u2013 nor to export them.",
      "The first stage of the moa project will be to identify well-preserved bones from which it may be possible to extract DNA, said Colossal\u2019s chief scientist Beth Shapiro.",
      "Those DNA sequences will be compared to genomes of living bird species, including the ground-dwelling tinamou and emu, \u201cto figure out what it is that made the moa unique compared to other birds,\u201d she said.",
      "Colossal used a similar process of comparing ancient DNA of extinct dire wolves to determine the genetic differences with gray wolves. Then scientists took blood cells from a living gray wolf and used CRISPR to genetically modify them in 20 different sites. Pups with long white hair and muscular jaws were born late last year.",
      "Working with birds presents different challenges, said Shapiro.",
      "Unlike mammals, bird embryos develop inside eggs, so the process of transferring an embryo to a surrogate will not look like mammalian IVF.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s lots of different scientific hurdles that need to be overcome with any species that we pick as a candidate for de-extinction,\u201d said Shapiro. \u201cWe are in the very early stages.\u201d",
      "If the Colossal team succeeds in creating a tall bird with huge feet and thick pointed claws resembling the moa, there\u2019s also the pressing question of where to put it, said Duke University ecologist Stuart Pimm, who is not involved in the project.",
      "\u201cCan you put a species back into the wild once you\u2019ve exterminated it there?\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s exceedingly unlikely that they could do this in any meaningful way.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis will be an extremely dangerous animal,\u201d Pimm added.",
      "The direction of the project will be shaped by M\u0101ori scholars at the University of Canterbury\u2019s Ng\u0101i Tahu Research Centre. Ng\u0101i Tahu archaeologist Kyle Davis, an expert in moa bones, said the work has \u201creally reinvigorated the interest in examining our own traditions and mythology.\u201d",
      "At one of the archaeological sites that Jackson and Davis visited to study moa remains, called Pyramid Valley, there are also antique rock art done by M\u0101ori people \u2013 some depicting moa before their extinction.",
      "Paul Scofield, a project adviser and senior curator of natural history at the Canterbury Museum in Christchurch, New Zealand, said he first met the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d director when he went to his house to help him identity which of the nine known species of moa the various bones represented.",
      "\u201cHe doesn\u2019t just collect some moa bones \u2013 he has a comprehensive collection,\u201d said Scofield.",

    "summary": "Less than a month after extending a deadline to ban TikTok for the third time, President Donald Trump told reporters late Friday night that, &ldquo;We pretty much have a deal,&rdquo; on TikTok",
    "story": [
      "Less than a month after extending a deadline to ban TikTok for the third time, President Donald Trump told reporters late Friday night that, \u201cWe pretty much have a deal,\u201d on TikTok",
      "Less than a month after extending a deadline to ban TikTok for the third time, President Donald Trump told reporters late Friday night that, \u201cWe pretty much have a deal,\u201d on TikTok \u2014 but he did not offer details.",
      "The details and timing of a potential deal are not clear. TikTok did not immediately respond to messages for comment on Monday.",
      "Emarketer analyst Jeremy Goldman said while TikTok is \u201creportedly planning\u201d a U.S. version of its app to comply with legal restrictions, the platform \u2014 if it launches without the original TikTok algorithm \u2014 \u201crisks losing the very personalization that drives user engagement.\u201d",
      "In other words, TikTok just isn't TikTok without its algorithm.",
      "\u201cAnd getting millions to download a new app is no small feat, to say the least,\u201d Goldman added.",
      "Here's what to know about where TikTok stands in the U.S. following Trump's comments.",
      "Though he has no clear legal basis to do so, Trump has continued to extend the deadline for TikTok to avoid a ban in the U.S. This gives his administration more time to broker a deal to bring the social media platform under American ownership.",
      "It is not clear how many times Trump can \u2014 or will \u2014 keep extending the ban as the government continues to try to negotiate a deal for TikTok, which is owned by China\u2019s ByteDance. While there is no clear legal basis for the extensions, so far there have been no legal challenges against the administration. Trump has amassed more than 15 million followers on TikTok since he joined last year, and he has credited the trendsetting platform with helping him gain traction among young voters. He said in January that he has a \u201cwarm spot for TikTok.\u201d",
      "For now, TikTok continues to function for its 170 million users in the U.S. Tech giants Apple, Google and Oracle were persuaded to continue to offer and support the app, on the promise that Trump\u2019s Justice Department would not use the law to seek potentially steep fines against them.",
      "Americans are even more closely divided on what to do about TikTok than they were two years ago.",
      "A recent Pew Research Center survey found that about one-third of Americans said they supported a TikTok ban, down from 50% in March 2023. Roughly one-third said they would oppose a ban, and a similar percentage said they weren\u2019t sure.",
      "Among those who said they supported banning the social media platform, about 8 in 10 cited concerns over users\u2019 data security being at risk as a major factor in their decision, according to the report.",
      "Trump said Friday that on Monday or Tuesday, the U.S. would take the proposal to Chinese leader Xi Jinping or one of his representatives. The president said he thinks they \u201cprobably\u201d need China to approve the deal but he wasn\u2019t sure they needed to.",
      "When asked whether he was confident China would approve the deal, Trump said, \u201cI\u2019m not confident but I think so.\u201d",
      "He said that for the U.S., \u201cwe make a lot of money if the deal goes through.\"",
      "The Chinese embassy in Washington said in a statement that it has no new information to share and \u201cChina has reiterated its principled position on multiple occasions and will handle relevant issues in accordance with Chinese laws and regulations.\"",
      "Although it\u2019s unclear if ByteDance plans to sell TikTok, several potential bidders have come forward in the past few months.",
      "Aides for Vice President JD Vance, who was tapped to oversee a potential deal, have reached out to some parties, such as the artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI, to get additional details about their bids, according to a person familiar with the matter. In January, Perplexity AI presented ByteDance with a merger proposal that would combine Perplexity\u2019s business with TikTok\u2019s U.S. operation.",
      "Perplexity had no comment on Monday.",
      "Other potential bidders include a consortium organized by billionaire business executive Frank McCourt, which recently recruited Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian as a strategic adviser. Investors in the consortium say they\u2019ve offered ByteDance $20 billion in cash for TikTok\u2019s U.S. platform. And if successful, they plan to redesign the popular app with blockchain technology they say will provide users with more control over their online data.",
      "\u201cEvery day that passes without a qualified divestiture of TikTok puts Americans at greater risk of manipulation and surveillance. We believe the administration will ultimately obey the courts and follow the requirements for a lawful divestiture,\u201d McCourt\u2019s internet advocacy organization, Project Liberty, said in a statement. \"We look forward to working with members of the administration, policymakers, and our many outstanding partners in The People\u2019s Bid to achieve this goal.\u201d",
      "Among other possible investors are the software company Oracle and the investment firm Blackstone. Neither company immediately responded to messages seeking comment on Monday.",

      "The government has been steadily expanding visa-free entry in a bid to boost tourism, the economy and its soft power. More than 20 million foreign visitors entered without a visa in 2024 \u2014 almost one-third of the total and more than double from the previous year, according to the National Immigration Administration.",

    "story": [
      "The United States\u2019 long legal case against accused Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed remains in limbo after an appeals court scrapped a plea deal",
      "NEW YORK -- The United States' long legal case against accused Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed remains in limbo after an appeals court this week scrapped a plea deal that the government had negotiated but had later withdrawn.",
      "Essentially, the ruling leaves the case on track for trial before a military commission. It is unclear when that might happen.",
      "Here's what to know about the case and how it got here:",
      "Mohammed is accused of developing and directing al-Qaida\u2019s plot to crash hijacked airliners into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001. Another of the hijacked planes flew into a field in Pennsylvania. In all, nearly 3,000 people were killed in one of the deadliest attacks ever on the United States.",
      "Mohammed was arrested in 2003 in Pakistan and eventually taken to the U.S. military base at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. At the time, it was where the U.S. held hundreds of men captured in President George W. Bush's \u201cwar on terror.\u201d",
      "Military prosecutors filed charges in 2008 against Mohammed and some co-defendants. After an Obama-era plan to try them in a civilian court in New York collapsed, the case remained with the military commission.",
      "The case dragged on through years of legal and logistical challenges. A major point of contention has been how much the evidence and case have been tainted by the men\u2019s torture while in CIA custody during the first years after their capture. Mohammed was waterboarded 183 times.",
      "Military prosecutors and defense lawyers began plea talks several years ago. Last year, Mohammed and two others agreed to plead guilty, under an agreement that would have led to life in prison instead of a potential death penalty. The deal also would have required the men to answer questions posed by Sept. 11 victims' relatives.",
      "Military prosecutors called the arrangement \u201cthe best path to finality and justice.\u201d Some 9/11 families also saw the deal as the best hope for bringing the painful case to a conclusion and getting some answers from the defendants.",
      "But other victims\u2019 relatives said a trial was the right way to get justice and information, and some saw the plea deal as capitulation. Republican lawmakers also criticized the agreement, negotiated during Democratic President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "Then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin soon rescinded the deal, saying that victims' relatives, U.S. troops and the American public \u201c deserve the opportunity \u201d to see military commission trials play out.",
      "Defense attorneys and the government wrangled in various courts over whether Austin was legally able to scrap the deal. It was on-again, off-again for months. A panel of appeals judges put it on hold in January and then, on Friday, issued 2-1 ruling saying that Austin had the authority to rescind the agreement. The order bars the military judge from taking any guilty pleas under the now-undone deal.",
      "It is not clear whether defense lawyers plan to appeal. A message seeking comment was sent Saturday to Mohammed's attorneys.",
      "Without a plea deal, the case would once again be back in the pretrial stage within the military commission system, with the legal and logistical complications that it has faced. Questions about whether the men's torture would prevent the use of evidence, including statements they made, are yet to be resolved.",

      "The osprey is in decline in one of its key territories and some scientists blame overfishing of menhaden, an important food for the birds",
      "GLOUCESTER POINT, Va. -- Stepping onto an old wooden duck blind in the middle of the York River, Bryan Watts looks down at a circle of sticks and pine cones on the weathered, guano-spattered platform. It\u2019s a failed osprey nest, taken over by diving terns.",
      "\u201cThe birds never laid here this year,\u201d said Watts, near the mouth of Virginia\u2019s Chesapeake Bay. \u201cAnd that's a pattern we've been seeing these last couple of years.\u201d",
      "Watts has a more intimate relationship with ospreys than most people have with a bird \u2014 he has climbed to their nests to free them from plastic bags, fed them by hand and monitored their eggs with telescopic mirrors.",
      "The fish-eating raptor known for gymnastic dives and whistle-like chirps is an American conservation success story. After pesticides and other hazards nearly eliminated the species from much of the country, the hawk-like bird rebounded after the banning of DDT in 1972 and now numbers in the thousands in the U.S.",
      "But Watts has documented an alarming trend. The birds, which breed in many parts of the U.S., are failing to successfully fledge enough chicks around their key population center of the Chesapeake Bay. The longtime biologist blames the decline of menhaden, a small schooling fish critical to the osprey diet. Without menhaden to eat, chicks are starving and dying in nests, Watts said.",
      "Watts's claim has put him and environmental groups at odds with the fishing industry, trade unions and sometimes government regulators. Menhaden is valuable for fish oil, fish meal and agricultural food as well as bait.",
      "U.S. fishermen have caught at least 1.1 billion pounds of menhaden every year since 1951. Members of the industry tout its sustainability and said the decline in osprey may have nothing to do with fishing.",
      "But without help, the osprey population could tumble to levels not seen since the dark days of DDT, said Watts, director of the Center for Conservation Biology at The College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia.",
      "\u201cThe osprey are yelling pretty loudly that, hey, there's not enough menhaden for us to reproduce successfully,\u201d Watts said. \u201cAnd we should be listening to them to be more informed fully on the fisheries side, and we should take precaution on the fisheries management side. But that hasn't won the day at this point.\u201d",
      "Watts, who has studied osprey on the Chesapeake for decades, has backed his claims of population decline by publishing studies in scientific journals. He said it boils down to a simple statistic \u2014 to maintain population, osprey pairs need to average 1.15 chicks per year.",
      "Osprey were reproducing at that level in the 1980s, but today in some areas around the main stem of the Chesapeake, it's less than half of that, Watts said. In particularly distressed areas, they aren't even reproducing at one-tenth that level, he said. And the decline in available menhaden matches the areas of nesting failure, Watts said.",
      "Also called pogies or bunkers, the oily menhaden are especially important for young birds because they are more nutritious than other fish in the sea. Osprey \u201creproductive performance is inextricably linked to the availability and abundance\u201d of menhaden, Watts wrote in a 2023 study published in Frontiers in Marine Science.",
      "Conservationists have been concerned for years, saying too many menhaden have been removed to maintain their crucial role in the ocean food chain. Historian H. Bruce Franklin went so far as to title his 2007 book on menhaden \u201cThe Most Important Fish In The Sea.\u201d",
      "Menhaden help sustain one of the world's largest fisheries, worth more than $200 million at the docks in 2023. Used as bait, the fish are critical for valuable commercial targets such as Maine lobster. They're also beloved by sportfishermen.",
      "The modern industry is dominated by Omega Protein, a Reedville, Virginia, company that is a subsidiary of Canadian aquaculture giant Cooke. The company pushed back at the idea that fishing is the cause of osprey decline, although it did acknowledge that fewer menhaden are showing up in some parts of the bay.",
      "Federal data show osprey breeding is in decline in many parts of the country, including where menhaden is not harvested at all, said Ben Landry, an Omega spokesperson. Climate change, pollution and development could be playing a role, said Landry and others with the company.",
      "Blaming fishing \u201cjust reeks of environmental special interest groups having an influence over the process,\u201d Landry said.",
      "The menhaden fishery is managed by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, an interstate body that crafts rules and sets fishing quotas. Prompted by questions about ospreys, it created a work group to address precautionary management of the species in the Chesapeake Bay.",
      "In April, this group proposed several potential management approaches, including seasonal closures, restrictions on quotas or days at sea, and limitations on kinds of fishing gear. The process of creating new rules could begin this summer, said James Boyle, fishery management plan coordinator with the commission.",
      "The osprey population has indeed shown declines in some areas since 2012, but it's important to remember the bird's population is much larger than it was before DDT was banned, Boyle said.",
      "\u201cThere are big increases in osprey population since the DDT era,\u201d Boyle said, citing federal data showing a six-fold increase in osprey populations along the Atlantic Coast since the 1960s.",
      "To a number of environmental groups, any decline is too much. This irritates some labor leaders who worry about losing more jobs as the fishing industry declines.",
      "Kenny Pinkard, retired vice president of UFCW Local 400's executive board and a longtime Virginia fishermen, said he feels the industry is being scapegoated.",
      "\u201cThere are some people who just don't want to see us in business at all,\u201d he said.",
      "But Chris Moore, Virginia executive director for Chesapeake Bay Foundation, said the country risks losing an iconic bird if no action is taken. He said Watts's studies show that the osprey will fail without access to menhaden.",
      "\u201cOsprey have been a success story,\u201d Moore said. \u201cWe're in a situation where they're not replacing their numbers. We'll actually be in a situation where we're in a steep decline.\u201d",

      "Federal regulators repeatedly granted appeals to remove Camp Mystic\u2019s buildings from their 100-year flood map, as the camp operated and expanded in a dangerous flood plain in the years before rushing waters swept away children and counselors",
      "Federal regulators repeatedly granted appeals to remove Camp Mystic's buildings from their 100-year flood map, loosening oversight as the camp operated and expanded in a dangerous flood plain in the years before rushing waters swept away children and counselors, a review by The Associated Press found.",
      "The Federal Emergency Management Agency included the prestigious girls' summer camp in a \u201cSpecial Flood Hazard Area\u201d in its National Flood Insurance map for Kerr County in 2011, which means it was required to have flood insurance and faced tighter regulation on any future construction projects.",
      "That designation means an area is likely to be inundated during a 100-year flood \u2014 one severe enough that it only has a 1% chance of happening in any given year.",
      "Located in a low-lying area along the Guadalupe River in a region known as flash flood alley, Camp Mystic lost at least 27 campers and counselors and longtime owner Dick Eastland when historic floodwaters tore through its property before dawn on July 4.",
      "The flood was far more severe than the 100-year event envisioned by FEMA, experts said, and moved so quickly in the middle of the night that it caught many off guard in a county that lacked a warning system.",
      "But Syracuse University associate professor Sarah Pralle, who has extensively studied FEMA\u2019s flood map determinations, said it was \u201cparticularly disturbing\u201d that a camp in charge of the safety of so many young people would receive exemptions from basic flood regulation.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a mystery to me why they weren\u2019t taking proactive steps to move structures away from the risk, let alone challenging what seems like a very reasonable map that shows these structures were in the 100-year flood zone,\u201d she said.",
      "Camp Mystic didn\u2019t respond to emails seeking comment and calls to it rang unanswered. The camp has called the flood an \u201cunimaginable tragedy\u201d and added in a statement Thursday that it had restored power for the purpose of communicating with its supporters.",
      "In response to an appeal, FEMA in 2013 amended the county's flood map to remove 15 of the camp\u2019s buildings from the hazard area. Records show that those buildings were part of the 99-year-old Camp Mystic Guadalupe, which was devastated by last week\u2019s flood.",
      "After further appeals, FEMA removed 15 more Camp Mystic structures in 2019 and 2020 from the designation. Those buildings were located on nearby Camp Mystic Cypress Lake, a sister site that opened to campers in 2020 as part of a major expansion and suffered less damage in the flood.",
      "Campers have said the cabins at Cypress Lake withstood significant damage, but those nicknamed \"the flats\u201d at the Guadalupe River camp were inundated.",
      "Experts say Camp Mystic's requests to amend the FEMA map could have been an attempt to avoid the requirement to carry flood insurance, to lower the camp\u2019s insurance premiums or to pave the way for renovating or adding new structures under less costly regulations.",
      "Pralle said the appeals were not surprising because communities and property owners have used them successfully to shield specific properties from regulation.",
      "Regardless of FEMA's determinations, the risk was obvious.",
      "At least 12 structures at Camp Mystic Guadalupe were fully within FEMA's 100-year flood plain, and a few more were partially in that zone, according to an AP analysis of data provided by First Street, a data science company that specializes in modeling climate risk.",
      "Jeremy Porter, the head of climate implications at First Street, said FEMA's flood insurance map underestimates flood risks. That's because it fails to take into account the effects of heavy precipitation on smaller waterways such as streams and creeks. First Street's model puts nearly all of Camp Mystic Guadalupe at risk during a 100-year flood.",
      "The buildings at the newer Cypress Lake site are farther from the south fork of the flood-prone river but adjacent to Cypress Creek. FEMA's flood plain doesn't consider the small waterway a risk.",
      "However, First Street\u2019s model, which takes into account heavy rain and runoff reaching the creek, shows that the majority of the Cypress Lake site lies within an area that has a 1% chance of flooding in any given year.",
      "In a statement, FEMA downplayed the significance of the flood map amendments.",
      "\u201cFlood maps are snapshots in time designed to show minimum standards for floodplain management and the highest risk areas for flood insurance,\u201d the agency wrote. \u201cThey are not predictions of where it will flood, and they don\u2019t show where it has flooded before.\u201d",
      "Property owners challenging FEMA's map designations hire engineers to conduct detailed studies to show where they believe the 100-year flood plain should actually be drawn. That is a \u201cpretty arduous process\u201d that can lead to more accurate maps while making it easier for future construction, said Chris Steubing, executive director of the Texas Floodplain Management Association, an industry group that represents floodplain managers.",
      "Pralle, who reviewed the amendments for AP, noted that some of the exempted properties were within 2 feet (0.6 meters) of FEMA's flood plain by the camp's revised calculations, which she said left almost no margin for error. She said her research shows that FEMA approves about 90% of map amendment requests, and the process may favor the wealthy and well-connected.",
      "A study she published in 2021 with researcher Devin Lea analyzed more than 20,000 buildings that had been removed from FEMA flood maps. It found that the amendments occurred more often in places where property values were higher, more white people lived and buildings were newer.",
      "FEMA had cautioned in its amendments that other parts of Camp Mystic remained on the flood map, and that \u201cany future construction or substantial improvement\u201d would be subject to flood plain management regulations.",
      "County officials not only allowed the camp to keep operating, but to dramatically expand.",
      "Considered Texas royalty after decades of taking care of the daughters of elite families, Camp Mystic owners Dick and Tweety Eastland cited the \u201ctremendous success\u201d of their original camp in explaining the need for a second site nearby.",
      "The expansion included new cabins and a dining hall, chapel, archery range and more. The camp had 557 campers and more than 100 staffers between its two locations when a state licensing agency conducted an inspection on July 2, two days before the tragedy, records show.",
      "FEMA referred questions about the expansion to local officials, who didn't reply to messages seeking comment.",
      "Steubing, a longtime municipal engineer in Texas, said the rain and flooding that hit Kerr County in a matter of hours were so much more intense than anything in its history that it's hard to call the flood plain management a failure.",
      "Local officials likely believed they were following existing regulations when they allowed the camp to keep growing, but \u201cthen Mother Nature set a new standard,\" he said.",
      "\u201cYou could have built things 2 feet (0.6 meters) higher, 3 feet (0.9 meters) higher, and they still might have gotten taken down,\u201d he said.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency has spawned state-level DOGE initiatives as Republican governors and lawmakers aim to show that they're in step",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- The brash and chaotic first days of President Donald Trump 's Department of Government Efficiency, once led by the world's richest man Elon Musk, spawned state-level DOGE mimicry as Republican governors and lawmakers aim to show they are in step with their party's leader.",
      "Governors have always made political hay out of slashing waste or taming bureaucracy, but DOGE has, in some ways, raised the stakes for them to show that they are zealously committed to cutting costs. Many drive home the point that they have always been focused on cutting government, even if they're not conducting mass layoffs.",
      "\u201cI like to say we were doing DOGE before DOGE was a thing,\u201d Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said in announcing her own task force in January.",
      "Critics agree that some of these initiatives are nothing new and suggest they are wasteful, essentially duplicating built-in processes that are normally the domain of legislative committees or independent state auditors.",
      "At the same time, some governors are using their DOGE vehicles to take aim at GOP targets of the moment, such as welfare programs or diversity, equity and inclusion programs. And some governors who might be eyeing a White House run in 2028 are rebranding their cost-cutting initiatives as DOGE, perhaps eager to claim the mantle of the most DOGE of them all.",
      "At least 26 states have initiated DOGE-style efforts of varying kinds, according to the Economic Policy Institute based in Washington, D.C.",
      "Most DOGE efforts were carried out through a governor\u2019s order \u2014 including by governors in Florida, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana, New Hampshire and Oklahoma \u2014 or by lawmakers introducing legislation or creating a legislative committee.",
      "The state initiatives have a markedly different character than Trump\u2019s slash-and-burn approach, symbolized by Musk\u2019s chainsaw-brandishing appearance at a Conservative Political Action Committee appearance in February.",
      "Governors are tending to entrust their DOGE bureaus to loyalists, rather than independent auditors, and are often employing what could be yearslong processes to consolidate procurement, modernize information technology systems, introduce AI tools, repeal regulations or reduce car fleets, office leases or worker headcounts through attrition.",
      "Steve Slivinski, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute who researches state government regulatory structures, said that a lot of what he has seen from state-level DOGE initiatives are the \u201csame stuff you do on a pretty regular basis anyway\u201d in state governments.",
      "States typically have routine auditing procedures and the ways states have of saving money are \u201crelatively unsexy,\" Slivinski said.",
      "And while the state-level DOGE vehicles might be useful over time in finding marginal improvements, \"branding it DOGE is more of a press op rather than anything new or substantially different than what they usually do,\u201d Slivinski said.",
      "Analysts at the pro-labor Economic Policy Institute say that governors and lawmakers, primarily in the South and Midwest, are using DOGE to breathe new life into long-term agendas to consolidate power away from state agencies and civil servants, dismantle public services and benefit insiders and privatization advocates.",
      "\u201cIt's not actually about cutting costs because of some fiscal responsibility,\u201d EPI analyst Nina Mast said.",
      "Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry rebranded his \u201cFiscal Responsibility Program\u201d as Louisiana DOGE, and promoted it as the first to team up with the federal government to scrub illegitimate enrollees from welfare programs. It has already netted $70 million in savings in the Medicaid program in an \u201cunprecedented\u201d coordination, Landry said in June.",
      "In Oklahoma, Gov. Kevin Stitt \u2014 who says in a blurb on the Oklahoma DOGE website that \u201cI\u2019ve been DOGE-ing in Oklahoma since before it was cool\" \u2014 made a DOGE splash with the first report by his Division of Government Efficiency by declaring that the state would refuse some $157 million in federal public health grants.",
      "The biggest chunk of that was $132 million intended to support epidemiology and laboratory capacity to control infectious disease outbreaks.",
      "The Stitt administration said that funding \u2014 about one-third of the total over an eight-year period \u2014 exceeded the amount needed.",
      "The left-leaning Oklahoma Policy Institute questioned the wisdom of that, pointing to rising numbers of measles and whooping cough cases and the rocky transition under Stitt of the state's public health lab from Oklahoma City to Stillwater.",
      "Oklahoma Democrats issued rebukes, citing Oklahoma's lousy public health rankings.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t leadership,\u201d state Sen. Carri Hicks said. \u201dIt\u2019s negligence.\"",
      "Stitt's Oklahoma DOGE has otherwise recommended changes in federal law to save money, opened up the suggestion box to state employees and members of the general public and posted a spreadsheet online with cost savings initiatives in his administration.",
      "Those include things as mundane as agencies going paperless, refinancing bonds, buying automated lawn mowers for the Capitol grounds or eliminating a fax machine line in the State Board of Licensure for Professional Engineers and Surveyors.",
      "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed an executive order in February creating a task force of DOGE teams in each state agency.",
      "In the order, DeSantis recited 10 points on what he described as his and Florida\u2019s \u201chistory of prudent fiscal management\u201d even before DOGE.",
      "Among other things, DeSantis vowed to scrutinize spending by state universities and municipal and county governments \u2014 including on DEI initiatives \u2014 at a time when DeSantis is pushing to abolish the property taxes that predominantly fund local governments.",
      "His administration has since issued letters to universities and governments requesting reams of information and received a blessing from lawmakers, who passed legislation authorizing the inquiry and imposing fines for entities that don\u2019t respond.",
      "After the June 30 signing ceremony, DeSantis declared on social media: \u201cWe now have full authority to DOGE local governments.\u201d",
      "In Arkansas, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders launched her cost-cutting Arkansas Forward last year, before DOGE, and later said the state had done the \u201csame thing\u201d as DOGE.",
      "Her administration spent much of 2024 compiling a 97-page report that listed hundreds of ways to possibly save $300 million inside a $6.5 billion budget.",
      "Achieving that savings \u2014 largely by standardizing information technology and purchasing \u2014 would sometimes require up-front spending and take years to realize savings.",

      "Lahaina Street runs through the heart of Makaha, a neighborhood in a west Oahu community that's a lot like the Lahaina on Maui that burned down in a deadly wildfire in 2023",
      "WAIANAE, Hawaii -- When there's enough rain, the mountain-framed expanse of vacant land behind Calvin Endo's house looks like the lush and verdant landscape that makes tropical Hawaii famous. But in the summer, when the jungle of eyeball-high invasive grasses and spindly tree branches fade to brown, he fears it could become a fiery hellscape.",
      "This isn't Maui, where most of Lahaina burned down during a massive wildfire in August 2023. Endo\u2019s duplex is in Waianae on the west side of Oahu.",
      "But Waianae and Lahaina have a lot in common. They're both situated on parched western island coasts, with road access pinched by topography, and are bastions of Native Hawaiian culture. Both have sections crisscrossed by overhead power lines atop aging wooden poles, like those that fell in high winds and caused the Lahaina fire.",
      "There's even a Lahaina Street through the heart of Makaha, Endo's neighborhood along the Waianae coast.",
      "\u201cIt can happen to us,\u201d said Endo, who moved to the Makaha Meadows subdivision in 1980, soon after it was built. \u201cWe can have a repeat of Lahaina if somebody doesn\u2019t do anything about the brush in the back.\u201d",
      "In recent days, two wildfires a few miles away, including a July 6 blaze that left a 94-year-old woman dead, proved his worst fears could become reality.",
      "It's been nearly two years since Lahaina provided a worst-case scenario of the destruction from wind-whipped flames fueled by overgrown brush. With 102 deaths, it's the deadliest U.S. wildfire in a century.",
      "In the months afterward, the number of Hawaii communities participating in the Firewise network, a nationally recognized program that helps communities with resources for safeguarding homes, more than doubled to 35 \u2014 but none in western Oahu.",
      "Even though Waianae residents have long known about their wildfire risks, only now is one of its neighborhoods close to gaining Firewise status.",
      "Communities become Firewise by organizing a committee, creating a hazard assessment, developing an action plan and volunteering hours toward reducing risk, such as removing overgrown brush. Firewise tracks a community\u2019s progress, connects residents with experts, and provides ideas and funding for mitigation, workshops and training.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service considers Lahaina and Waianae to be at much higher risk than other U.S. communities for a wildland fire, noted Honolulu Fire Department Battalion Chief Keith Ito.",
      "\u201cThe weather, the winds, they\u2019re pretty much identical,\u201d he said. \u201cWith all that being said, I think that the high-risk wildfire potential is a state-wide problem, not really specific to Waianae or Lahaina.\u201d",
      "Nani Barretto, co-director of the Hawaii Wildfire Management Organization, struggles to understand why fire-prone communities like Waianae have yet to join the Firewise movement. There are also no Firewise communities on the island of Kauai.",
      "\u201cJust because we are proactive in getting the word out, it doesn\u2019t mean the right people are getting the information,\u201d she said. \u201cFor Maui, it took a very devastating event for them to join.\u201d",
      "Organizing a community can be challenging because it requires residents to put in time and step up as leaders, she said.",
      "Endo, who is a longtime member of the Waianae Coast Neighborhood Board, had never even heard of Firewise until recently.",
      "A development called Sea Country, near the neighborhood that was recently ordered to evacuate during a wildfire, is close to becoming the fist Firewise community in Waianae, said Andria Tupola, a resident who also represents the coast on the Honolulu City Council.",
      "The process got underway around 2018 but picked up momentum after Lahaina, she said.",
      "Sea Country recently completed a hazard assessment and has planned some mitigation events, including a park cleanup in August, said Ashley Bare, the Firewise support specialist for Oahu.",
      "Lahaina also provided the spark for opening an emergency access route in Waianae, Tupola said. Farrington Highway, the main artery along the coast, can get clogged with just an accident.",
      "Military officials who control a mountain pass above Waianae started talking about letting civilians access the route after Lahaina, she said. During the July 6 fire, state and military officials were ready to open the road as a way out of the coast and into central Oahu, said state Rep. Darius Kila, who represents the area.",
      "A Hawaiian homestead community in Waianae's Nanakuli Valley is also trying to achieve Firewise status, said Diamond Badajos, spokesperson for the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands.",
      "Home to the largest concentration of Native Hawaiians, Waianae is rich in Hawaiian culture and history. But much of the coast also struggles with poverty and homelessness.",
      "Residents have grown accustomed to wildfires in the dry summer months, said Republican state Rep. Chris Muraoka: \u201cIt\u2019s almost like if it doesn\u2019t burn, something\u2019s not right.\u201d",
      "However, Muraoka said he thinks communities along the coast would benefit more from fire-prevention and safety education in schools rather than organizing to be Firewise. Muraoka, who lives in Makaha, said communities in Waianae have unique needs that being Firewise might not address, including sections with neighborhoods that are more spread out than in Lahaina and blazes that are often started by arsonists or kids playing with fire.",
      "Some residents already do what they can, especially with the dry season underway.",
      "Endo often tries to clear brush on private property behind his home himself, to create a firebreak. Some properties in Waianae Valley use sheep to eat the overgrown vegetation.",
      "Retired firefighter Shermaih \u201cBulla\u201d Iaea recalls fighting blazes in the brush near Endo\u2019s home and Makaha Elementary School.",
      "In 2018, his farm burned down during high winds from a passing hurricane. He was using a herd of sheep on his property until wild dogs killed them in April. Neighborhoods banding together to become Firewise is another tool that will help, he said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a 100 percent chance that will happen here,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought it would never happen to me. Now I\u2019m trying to ring the bells. I\u2019m trying to sound the alarm.\u201d",
      "Being one of the poorest communities in the state is a major factor preventing Waianae from becoming Firewise, said Kila, who lives near where the July 6 fire happened.",
      "Before the summer, the Democratic lawmaker sent a letter to Hawaiian Electric and telecom companies urging \u201cimmediate and coordinated action\" to address dangerous, sagging utility lines on aging wooden poles along the coast.",
      "It\u2019s not clear why Makaha ended up with a long street named Lahaina, which can mean \u201crelentless sun\u201d in Hawaiian. But like the west Maui town, it fits the sunny west Oahu neighborhood, which is home to the world-famous Makaha surfing beach.",
      "Some neighborhoods above Lahaina Street are newer and have underground utilities, like Endo's. But toward the ocean, older neighborhoods are laced by overhead power lines.",
      "That worries Glen Kila, a Hawaiian cultural practitioner in Waianae, who is not related to Darius Kila. Power lines are blamed for sparking the Lahaina blaze.",
      "\u201cIf that happens to Waianae,\" he said, \"we\u2019re done.\u201d",

      "A Colorado dentist is set to go on trial next week, accused of killing his wife by poisoning her protein shakes",
      "DENVER -- Just days before she died after suffering symptoms that mystified her doctors, Angela Craig confronted her husband, James, in their suburban Denver kitchen over his lack of support.",
      "In that 2023 argument captured on home surveillance video, she accused him of suggesting to hospital staff that she was suicidal, court documents show.",
      "Prosecutors say James Craig caused the ailments that ultimately killed his wife by poisoning her protein shakes and trying to make it look as if she killed herself. His trial on murder and other charges is set to begin Monday with the questioning of potential jurors.",
      "Angela Craig, 43, died in March 2023 during her third trip to the hospital that month. Toxicology tests later determined she died of poisoning from cyanide and tetrahydrozoline, an ingredient that is found in over-the-counter eye drops.",
      "The couple were married 23 years and had six children.",
      "Craig has pleaded not guilty to charges including first-degree murder, solicitation to commit murder and solicitation to commit perjury.",
      "The 47-year-old dentist allegedly bought arsenic online around the time his wife began to experience symptoms like dizziness and headaches for which doctors could find no cause, prosecutors say.",
      "At the time of his arrest, police said Craig was trying to start a new life amid financial troubles and appeared to be having an affair with a fellow dentist. Prosecutors said he had affairs with two other women, but they have not detailed a motive in his wife's death.",
      "Craig's attorneys have argued police were biased against him and claimed testing of his wife's shake containers did not turn up signs of poison. They've questioned the reliability of a jail inmate who said Craig offered him $20,000 to kill the case's lead investigator, an alleged plot for which Craig is also on trial.",
      "To avoid being held accountable, prosecutors said, Craig tried to fabricate evidence to make it appear his wife killed herself.",
      "He tried to get another fellow inmate to plant fraudulent letters at Craig's home to make it look like his wife was suicidal, prosecutors said. Then, in the weeks before Craig had been set to stand trial in November, prosecutors said he also sent letters to the ex-wife of the inmate he allegedly tried to get to kill the investigator, offering her $20,000 for each person she could find to falsely testify that his wife planned to die by suicide, they said.",
      "As jury selection was about to begin, his lawyer at the time, Harvey Steinberg, asked to withdraw, citing a rule allowing lawyers to step down if a client persists in actions considered criminal or that they disagree with.",
      "Another attorney for Craig, Robert Werking, later argued that investigators did not look into whether Craig wrote the letters or check them against his handwriting. Werking also said that the inmate and his ex-wife were prosecuted for forgery for their roles in an alleged fraud ring in 2005, suggesting they could not be trusted.",
      "Werking withdrew from the case himself this month after being charged with arson of his own home, leaving his wife and law partner, Lisa Fine Moses, to defend Craig. Werking's attorney, David Beller, said he was getting mental health treatment and asked the public to show him grace.",
      "Moses did not immediately return telephone and email messages seeking comment.",
      "Over the objections of the defense, prosecutors plan to show the video of the argument in the kitchen to jurors.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s your fault they treated me like I was a suicide risk, like I did it to myself, and like nothing I said could be believed,\u201d Angela Craig told her husband after her first trip to the hospital.",
      "Prosecutors convinced the judge jurors should see the video because they said it disproves potential claims that Angela Craig poisoned herself \u2014 possibly while trying to dissuade him from divorcing her \u2014 or to frame him and gain an advantage over him if they did divorce.",
      "\u201cHer mental state is anger and frustration, not suicidality or desperation to keep the defendant in the marriage,\u201d Senior Chief Deputy District Attorney Michael Mauro wrote in a recent court filing.",
      "One of Angela Craig's siblings, Mark Pray, said last year that James Craig not only orchestrated the \u201ctorment and demise\u201d of his sister but had shown disregard for others, including their children.",
      "Prosecutors say James Craig searched online for answers to questions such as \u201chow to make murder look like a heart attack\" and \u201cis arsenic detectable in an autopsy?\u201d",
      "After Craig\u2019s initial attempts to kill his wife failed, prosecutors allege, he ordered a rush shipment of potassium cyanide, supposedly for surgery. The shipment was accidentally discovered by an employee at his dental practice in the Denver suburb of Aurora on March 13, 2023. The employee reported it to the office manager two days later when Angela Craig returned to the hospital for a third and final time.",
      "Craig\u2019s business partner, Ryan Redfearn, told a nurse treating Angela Craig that he was concerned she could have been poisoned with the cyanide. The nurse reported that to police, who began their investigation the same day.",
      "Angela Craig died days later.",

      "Younger Democratic candidates across the country are running to replace party elders",
      "PHOENIX -- Deja Foxx celebrated her April birthday in a way most 25-year-olds don\u2019t. The extra candle meant she was now eligible to represent Arizona in Congress, and Foxx marked the occasion with a fundraiser.",
      "She\u2019s part of a wide-ranging group of young Democratic candidates, many running to replace older incumbents, who have grown restless waiting for their turn to lead their party back to power.",
      "After a crushing 2024 election loss, they say the party desperately needs a rebranding \u2014 and young leaders should steer it.",
      "In southern Arizona on Tuesday, Foxx is one of several Democrats hoping to step into a deep blue seat left vacant by the death of Rep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva, a longtime political power broker in Tucson. He had become one of the most senior lawmakers on Capitol Hill over two decades in Congress. Grijalva's daughter, Adelita, is one of the contenders, and three Republicans are vying in the GOP primary.",
      "But the push for younger leaders won\u2019t end there. In next year\u2019s midterm elections, primary challengers have already begun to emerge in states like California and Indiana that will give Democratic voters choices between longtime lawmakers and younger candidates.",
      "In Georgia, for example, 80-year-old Democratic Rep. David Scott\u2019s decades-long legacy could end with a primary he\u2019s expected to join. This has drawn challengers fed up with his refusal to step aside despite years of concern about his declining health and rare public appearances. The primary got crowded almost a year after former President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 election race amid similar scrutiny over his age.",
      "Challenging well-connected candidates can be daunting, but progressive leaders say the moment calls for urgency.",
      "\u201cPassing of the torch implies the leaders are handing it off,\u201d said Amanda Litman, head of a group called Run for Something that bolsters progressive young candidates. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing right now is, the new generation is taking the torch. They\u2019re not waiting for it to be passed.\u201d",
      "Many Boomer and Gen Z candidates alike have largely abandoned the traditional playbook of spending millions on TV ads in favor of TikTok and social media. But it's a pivot that older political hands would recognize from an older playbook: meeting voters where they are.",
      "Foxx, a digital strategist, led influencer strategy for Kamala Harris\u2019 2020 presidential campaign bid. On TikTok, she speaks to nearly 400,000 followers, saying she\u2019d be the first woman of \u201cour\u201d generation elected to Congress. In 2022, Florida voters elected the generation\u2019s first congressman \u2014 Democratic Rep. Maxwell Frost. The Congressional Progressive Caucus PAC, which Frost co-chairs, has endorsed Adelita Grijalva.",
      "Foxx has leaned into popular Gen Z internet slang in branding her district tour \u201cCrashout or Congress.\u201d",
      "\u201cDoes the news make you feel like you\u2019re about to crash out? Be honest,\u201d Foxx posted.",
      "Foxx said her campaign turned a corner after a primary debate in late May, when some clips of her performance drew the eyes of millions and helped spark a fundraising boost.",
      "If Scott seeks another term in his suburban Atlanta district, he'll face several candidates in the Democratic primary next May: microbiologist and state Rep. Jasmine Clark, 42; state Sen. Emanuel Jones, 66; and 33-year-old Everton Blair, former chair of the state\u2019s largest school district. Scott's campaign did not respond to requests for an interview.",
      "Clark racked up 7,000 TikTok followers after a popular influencer reposted her. She occasionally pops in with solutions to people\u2019s problems on NextDoor and is sometimes recognized as a podcast host instead of a state representative. She says Republicans have done a better job at saturating social media with their messaging.",
      "\u201cInstead of looking at Republicans and wagging our fingers at them, we could take some lessons from them,\u201d she said.",
      "Voters have been crushed by high living costs, Clark said, but Republicans, not Democrats, have been the ones to tell people their pain is real \u2014 even though Democrats have better ideas for fixing things.",
      "Blair agreed that Democrats have better policy prescriptions for addressing voters\u2019 economic concerns, but he said too many longtime lawmakers have stifled the party\u2019s ability to get that message across. He said President Donald Trump is fattening the wallets of billionaires but cheating low- and middle-income voters \u201cout of the American dream.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have an incumbent who is just not doing the job, and we need a better fighter,\u201d Blair said. \u201cThe stakes are just too high.\u201d",
      "Young people have grown up in a political climate dominated by algorithms, said 21-year-old Akbar Ali, first vice chair of the Democratic Party in Gwinnett County, home to some of Scott's district. That gives them a built-in understanding of how information spreads today, he said, but doesn't replace on-the-ground outreach to voters of all ages.",
      "He said Scott\u2019s physical absence is palpable, both in the community and as a voice in Congress.",
      "\u201cA lot of people are upset on a national level because we can\u2019t hit back with enough vigor.\u201d he said.",
      "Adelita Grijalva carries a household name in Tucson and is regarded as the frontrunner. To Foxx, Grijalva benefits from her \u201clegacy\u201d last name.",
      "Grijalva, who has received several endorsements, including from Democratic U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and independent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, has pushed back. She said she brings her own credentials to the table. Her father was progressive and antiestablishment, and she said she is, too.",
      "But Foxx, who benefited personally from some government programs the Trump administration has slashed or is looking to slash, said Democrats need to do more to reach new voters.",
      "\u201cWe are bringing people into this party, into this democracy, who have felt left out \u2014 by and large young people and working-class folks,\u201d Foxx said.",
      "In New York City, 33-year-old Zohran Mamdani recently won the mayor's race with an upbeat campaign that leaned heavily on TikTok and emphasized finding new ways to make city life more affordable.",
      "In an era where so many young people doubt they\u2019ll ever be better off than their parents, they\u2019re increasingly willing to ditch pragmatism for bold policy platforms, said David Hogg.",
      "Hogg was removed from his leadership role with the Democratic National Committee, which said his election broke party rules. His decision not to run again followed his push to oust long-serving Democrats in safe congressional seats. He has not backed away from his vow to primary \u201casleep-at-the-wheel\u201d Democrats with fresher faces.",
      "People of all ages want a fighter who understands what\u2019s at stake as Trump cuts Medicaid and other programs that millions of Americans rely on, Hogg said. That\u2019s why his political action committee, Leaders We Deserve, endorsed Foxx.",
      "Young voters were key to Democratic wins in recent years, but some swung to the right as Trump made gains in 2024. Hogg said he's looking for candidates to \u201cwin them back\u201d by talking about how change happens.",
      "Older candidates can do that too, he said, but for better or worse, young people aren\u2019t yet \u201cjaded\u201d by politics.",
      "\u201cIn this dark moment, we need people who can provide us a general sense of hope, as crazy that can feel sometimes,\u201d Hogg said. \u201cTo believe that maybe things won\u2019t be as screwed up as they are now forever.\u201d",

      "\u201cHe\u2019s got complicated grief and sorrow and his own emotional stress,\u201d said Njoroge\u2019s attorney, Robert Clifford. \u201cHe\u2019s haunted by nightmares and the loss of his wife and children.\u201d",
      "Terms of the deal were not disclosed publicly.",
      "Clifford said his client intended to seek \u201cmillions\u201d in damages on behalf of his wife and children, but declined to publicly specify an amount ahead of the trial.",
      "\u201cThe aviation team at Clifford Law Offices has been working round-the-clock in preparation for trial, but the mediator was able to help the parties come to an agreement,\u201d Clifford said in a statement Friday.",
      "A Boeing spokesperson said via email Friday that the company had no comment.",
      "The proceedings were not expected to delve into technicalities involving the Max version of Boeing\u2019s bestselling 737 airplane, which has been the source of persistent troubles for the company since the Ethiopia crash and one the year before in Indonesia. A combined 346 people, including passengers and crew members, died in those crashes.",
      "In 2021, Chicago-based Boeing accepted responsibility for the Ethiopia crash in a deal with the victims\u2019 families that allowed them to pursue individual claims in U.S. courts instead of their home countries. Citizens of 35 countries were killed. Several families of victims have already settled. Terms of those agreements also were not made public.",
      "The jetliner heading to Nairobi lost control shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa Bole International Airport and nose-dived into a barren patch of land.",
      "Investigators determined the Ethiopia and Indonesia crashes were caused by a system that relied on a sensor that provided faulty readings and pushed the plane noses down, leaving pilots unable to regain control. After the Ethiopia crash, Max jets were grounded worldwide until the company redesigned the system.",
      "This year, Boeing reached a deal with the U.S. Justice Department to avoid criminal prosecutions in both crashes.",
      "Among those killed were Njoroge\u2019s wife, Carolyne, and three small children, Ryan, age 6, Kellie, 4, and Rubi, 9 months old, the youngest to die on the plane. Njoroge also lost his mother-in-law, whose family has a separate case.",
      "Njoroge, who met his wife in college in Nairobi, was living in Canada at the time of the crash. He had planned to join his family in Kenya later.",
      "He testified before Congress in 2019 about repeatedly imagining how his family suffered during the flight, which lasted only six minutes. He has pictured his wife struggling to hold their infant in her lap with two other children seated nearby.",
      "\u201cI stay up nights thinking of the horror that they must have endured,\u201d Njoroge said. \u201cThe six minutes will forever be embedded in my mind. I was not there to help them. I couldn\u2019t save them.\u201d",

      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- A Muslim inmate who won a U.S. Supreme Court case upholding his right to grow a beard for religious reasons said in a lawsuit that Arkansas officials transferred him to a federal prison in West Virginia in retaliation for several other lawsuits he has filed.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas filed the lawsuit in federal court on behalf of Gregory Holt, also known as Abdul Maalik Muhammad, claiming the transfer violated his constitutional rights.",
      "In 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously that Holt could maintain a half-inch beard because Arkansas prison officials could not substantiate claims that the beard posed a security risk.",
      "The lawsuit filed Thursday argues his transfer was an effort to disrupt his advocacy on behalf of himself and other inmates.",
      "\u201cMr. Muhammad\u2019s history of meritorious litigation showcases the ability of the legal system to provide justice to all, including prisoners,\u201d the lawsuit said. \u201cThe Court should not tolerate the (state's) retaliatory transfer aimed at suppressing Mr. Muhammad\u2019s meritorious litigation and legal work.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Corrections declined to comment on the lawsuit. Jeff LeMaster, a spokesperson for Attorney General Tim Griffin, said Griffin's office was reviewing the lawsuit and would \u201cvigorously\u201d defend the state.",
      "Holt has six active lawsuits against the Arkansas Department of Corrections, according to the complaint. The lawsuit accuses the head of the division of correction of unilaterally pursuing Holt's transfer to a federal facility after the idea was raised in a mediation session in one of his lawsuits.",
      "Since being moved to the West Virginia facility, the ACLU said, Holt has been denied access to basic hygiene, religious services and contact with his lawyers. The lawsuit said he also has lost access to ongoing casework and legal documents that support his cases.",
      "The lawsuit said that since Holt is still a state inmate, Arkansas has the power to order his return to a state facility.",
      "\u201cThis ordeal has made Mr. Muhammad loathe to ever trust the mediation process or participate in a mediation with the ADC ( or any other government actor) again,\u201d the lawsuit said.",
      "In his U.S. Supreme Court case, Holt claimed that he has a right to grow a beard under a federal law aimed at protecting prisoners\u2019 religious rights. He had the support of then-President Barack Obama's administration, religious groups and atheists alike.",
      "Holt is serving a life sentence for a brutal assault on his girlfriend and was being held at a maximum-security prison 26 miles (43 kilometers) southeast of Little Rock. His case first came to the Supreme Court's attention when he filed a handwritten plea to the court asking it to block enforcement of Arkansas\u2019 no-beard rule.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is suing California over its animal welfare laws, claiming they unconstitutionally raised egg prices",
      "The Trump administration is suing the state of California to block animal welfare laws that it says unconstitutionally helped send egg prices soaring. But a group that spearheaded the requirements pushed back, blaming bird flu for the hit to consumers' pocketbooks.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in federal court in California on Wednesday, challenges voter initiatives that passed in 2018 and 2008. They require that all eggs sold in California come from cage-free hens.",
      "The Trump administration says the law imposes burdensome red tape on the production of eggs and egg products across the country because of the state's outsize role in the national economy.",
      "\u201cIt is one thing if California passes laws that affects its own State, it is another when those laws affect other States in violation of the U.S. Constitution,\u201d U.S. Agriculture Brooke Rollins said in a statement Thursday. \"Thankfully, President Trump is standing up against this overreach.\u201d",
      "Egg prices soared last year and earlier this year due in large part to bird flu, which has forced producers to destroy nearly 175 million birds since early 2022. But prices have come down sharply recently. While the Trump administration claims credit for that, seasonal factors are also important. Avian influenza, which is spread by wild birds, tends to spike during the spring and fall migrations and drop in summer.",
      "\u201cPointing fingers won\u2019t change the fact that it is the President\u2019s economic policies that have been destructive,\" the California Department of Justice said in a statement Friday. \"We\u2019ll see him in court.\u201d",
      "The average national price for a dozen Grade A eggs declined to $5.12 in April and $4.55 in May after reaching a record $6.23 in March, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. But the May price was still 68.5% higher than a year earlier.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s back to his favorite hobby: blaming California for literally everything,\u201d Gov. Gavin Newsom's office said in a social media post.",
      "The federal complaint alleges that California contributed to the rise in egg prices with regulations that forced farmers across the country to adopt more expensive production practices. The lawsuit also asserts that it is the federal government's legal prerogative to regulate egg production. So it seeks to permanently block enforcement of the California regulations that flowed from the two ballot measures.",
      "\u201cAmericans across the country have suffered the consequences of liberal policies causing massive inflation for everyday items like eggs,\u201d Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. \u201cUnder President Trump\u2019s leadership, we will use the full extent of federal law to ensure that American families are free from oppressive regulatory burdens and restore American prosperity.\u201d",
      "While 2018's Proposition 12 also banned the sale of pork and veal in California from animals raised in cages that don\u2019t meet minimum size requirements, the lawsuit only focuses on the state's egg rules.",
      "Humane World for Animals, which was named the Humane Society of the United States when it spearheaded the passage of Proposition 12, says avian influenza and other factors drove up egg prices, not animal welfare laws. And it says much of the U.S. egg industry went cage-free anyway because of demand from consumers who don't want eggs from hens confined to tiny spaces.",
      "\u201cCalifornia has prohibited the sale of cruelly produced eggs for more than a decade \u2014 law that has been upheld by courts at every level, including the Supreme Court. Blaming 2025 egg prices on these established animal welfare standards shows that this case is about pure politics, not constitutional law,\u201d Sara Amundson, president of the Humane World Action Fund, said in a statement.",
      "The American Egg Board, which represents the industry, said Friday that it will monitor the progress of the lawsuit while continuing to comply with California\u2019s laws, and that it appreciates Rollins\u2019 efforts to support farmers in their fight against bird flu and to stabilize the egg supply.",
      "\u201cEgg farmers have been both responsive and responsible in meeting changing demand for cage-free eggs, while supporting all types of egg production, and continuing to provide options in the egg case for consumers,\u201d the board said in a statement.",

      "Davis, 30, was picked up shortly after midnight near the popular Lincoln Road area of Miami Beach, officials said.",
      "The charge was connected to an incident that occurred last month in Doral, a residential city in western Miami-Dade, Miami Beach police spokesperson Christopher Bess said. Davis and his vehicle information had been added to a law enforcement database, and a license plate reader set up in Miami Beach flagged his car.",
      "Miami Beach police made the initial stop and then turned Davis over to Doral police, Bess said.",
      "Davis was being held on $10,000 bail. Jail and court records didn't list an attorney for Davis. His promoter didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment.",
      "Davis, who is from Baltimore, is in the regular conversation for best pound-for-pound boxer. The WBA lightweight champion won his first 30 bouts, 28 by knockout, with his devastating punching power drawing sellouts crowds from New York to Washington to Las Vegas.",
      "But Davis was booed during his most recent fight. Despite being an overwhelming favorite, he underperformed March 1 in Brooklyn\u2019s Barclays Center but escaped with a majority draw against Lamont Roach that allowed Davis to retain his belt.",
      "Referee Steve Willis\u2019 decision not to award Roach a knockdown in the ninth round ultimately changed the fight\u2019s outcome.",

      "CAMARILLO, Calif. -- Federal immigration authorities said Friday they arrested about 200 immigrants suspected of being in the country illegally in raids a day earlier on two California cannabis farm sites. Protesters engaged in a tense standoff with authorities at one of the farms during the operation.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that authorities executed criminal search warrants in Carpinteria and Camarillo, California, on Thursday. They arrested immigrants suspected of being in the country illegally and there were also at least 10 immigrant children on site, the statement said.",
      "Four U.S. citizens were arrested for \u201cassaulting or resisting officers,\u201d the department said. Authorities were offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of one person suspected of firing a gun at federal agents. At least one worker was hospitalized with grave injuries.",
      "During the raid, crowds of people gathered outside Glass House Farms at the Camarillo location to demand information about their relatives and protest immigration enforcement. A chaotic scene emerged outside the farm that grows tomatoes, cucumbers and cannabis as authorities clad in helmets and uniforms faced off with the demonstrators. Acrid green and white billowing smoke then forced community members to retreat.",
      "On Friday, about two dozen people waited outside the Camarillo farm to collect the cars of their loved ones and speak to managers about what happened. Relatives of Jaime Alanis, who worked picking tomatoes for 10 years, said he called his wife in Mexico during the raid to tell her immigration agents had arrived and that he was hiding with others inside the farm.",
      "\u201cThe next thing we heard was that he was in the hospital,\u201d Juan Duran, Alanis\u2019 brother-in-law, said in Spanish, his voice breaking.",
      "It was not immediately clear how Alanis was injured. A doctor told the family that others who brought Alanis to the hospital said he had fallen from the roof of a building.",
      "Alanis had a broken neck, fractured skull and a rupture in an artery that pumps blood to the brain, said his niece Yesenia, who didn\u2019t want to share her last name for fear of reprisal.",
      "Maria Servin, 68, said her son Rafael Ortiz has worked at the farm for 18 years and was helping build a greenhouse when federal immigrations agents arrived Thursday.",
      "Servin said she spoke to her son, who is undocumented, after hearing of the raid and offered to pick him up. \u201cHe said not to come because they were surrounded and there was even a helicopter. That was the last time I spoke to him,\u201d Servin, who is a naturalized U.S. citizen, said in Spanish.",
      "She said she went to the farm anyway Thursday, but agents were shooting tear gas and rubber bullets, and she decided it wasn't safe to stay.",
      "On Friday, she returned with her daughter and was told her son had been arrested. The family still doesn\u2019t know where he is being held or how to contact him. \u201cI regret 1,000 times that I didn\u2019t help him get his documents,\u201d Servin said.",

      "\u201cThese are human beings who have inherent rights, and they have a right to dignity,\" said immigration attorney Josephine Arroyo. \"And they\u2019re violating a lot of their rights by putting them there.\u201d",
      "Government officials have adamantly disputed the conditions described by detainees, their attorneys and family members, but have provided few details, and have denied access to the media. A televised tour for Trump and DeSantis showed rows of chain-link cages, each containing dozens of bunkbeds, under large white tents.",
      "\u201cThe reporting on the conditions in the facility is completely false. The facility meets all required standards and is in good working order,\u201d said Stephanie Hartman, a spokesperson for the Florida Division of Emergency Management, which built the center.",
      "A group of Democratic lawmakers sued the DeSantis administration for access. The administration is allowing a site visit by state legislators and members of Congress on Saturday, July 12.",
      "Families and attorneys who spoke with The Associated Press relayed detainees' accounts of a place they say is unsanitary and lacks adequate medical care, pushing some into a state of extreme distress.",
      "Such conditions make other immigration detention centers where advocates and staff have warned of unsanitary confinements, medical neglect and a lack of food and water seem \u201cadvanced,\u201d said immigration attorney Atara Eig.",
      "Trump and his allies have praised this detention center's harshness and remoteness as befitting the \u201cworst of the worst\" and as a national model for the deterrence needed to persuade immigrants to \u201cself-deport\u201d from the United States.",
      "But among those locked inside the chain-link enclosures are people with no criminal records, and at least one teenage boy, attorneys told the AP.",
      "Immigration attorney Katie Blankenship described a concerning lack of medical care at the facility, relaying an account from a 35-year-old Cuban client who told his wife that detainees go days without a shower. The toilets are in the same space as the bunkbeds and can't handle their needs, she said.",
      "The wife, a 28-year-old green card holder and the mother of the couple\u2019s 2-year-old daughter, who is a U.S. citizen, relayed his complaints to the AP. Fearing government retaliation against her and her detained husband, she asked not to be identified.",
      "\u201cThey have no way to bathe, no way to wash their mouths, the toilet overflows and the floor is flooded with pee and poop,\u201d the woman told the AP. \u201cThey eat once a day and have two minutes to eat. The meals have worms,\u201d she added.",
      "The woman said the detainees \u201call went on a hunger strike\u201d on Thursday night to protest the conditions.",
      "\u201cThere are days when I don\u2019t know anything about him until the evening,\u201d she said, describing waiting for his calls, interrupted every three minutes by an announcement that the conversation is being recorded.",
      "The detainees' attorneys say their due process rights are among numerous constitutional protections being denied.",
      "Blankenship is among the lawyers who have been refused access. After traveling to the remote facility and waiting for hours to speak with her clients, including a 15-year-old Mexican boy with no criminal charges, she was turned away by a security guard who told her to wait for a phone call in 48 hours that would notify her when she could return.",
      "\u201cI said, well, what\u2019s the phone number that I can follow up with that? There is none,\u201d Blankenship recalled. \u201cYou have due process obligations, and this is a violation of it.\u201d",
      "Arroyo\u2019s client, a 36-year-old Mexican man who came to the U.S. as a child, has been detained at the center since July 5 after being picked up for driving with a suspended license in Florida's Orange County. He\u2019s a beneficiary of the DACA program, created to protect young adults who were brought to the U.S. as children from deportation and to provide them with work authorization.",
      "Blankenship's Cuban client paid a bond and was told he'd be freed on a criminal charge in Miami, only to be detained and transferred to the Everglades.",
      "Eig has been seeking the release of a client in his 50s with no criminal record and a stay of removal, meaning the government can't legally deport him while he appeals. But she hasn't been able to get a bond hearing. She's heard that an immigration court inside the Krome Detention Center in Miami \u201cmay be hearing cases\u201d from the Everglades facility, but as of Friday, they were still waiting.",
      "\u201cJurisdiction remains an issue,\u201d Eig said, adding \u201cthe issue of who\u2019s in charge over there is very concerning.\u201d",

      "SUTTON, Vt. -- Communities in rural parts of Vermont on Friday woke up once again to damaged homes and washed-out roads due to heavy rainfall and flash flooding, making it the third consecutive summer that severe floods have inundated parts of the state.",
      "Up to 5 inches (13 centimeters) of rain fell in just a few hours on Thursday, prompting rapid flooding as local waterways began to swell, said Robert Haynes, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service\u2019s Burlington office.",
      "Nearly 20 homes were cut off in the small town of Sutton as a local brook quickly rose from its banks and surrounded buildings, Fire Chief Kyle Seymour said. His crews were called out to help rescue people from two homes, which required help from swift-water rescue teams called in from neighboring communities.",
      "\u201cThis was an incredibly strong, quick-moving localized heavy water,\" Seymour said. \u201cIt overwhelmed all of our road culverts, all of our streams, all of our rivers. But the actual weather event lasted three hours, with the bulk of the rain concentrated within one hour.\"",
      "Though the severity of the storms wasn't as widespread compared to the past two years, local officials were still surveying the extent of the damage Friday morning and shaking their heads that they were dealing with flood recovery for three years in a row.",
      "\u201cWhen I started seeing the reporters saying it wasn\u2019t going to be that bad, I didn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Seymour said, adding that at least one member of his crew has contemplated retiring after experiencing such repeated flood emergencies.",
      "According to the National Weather Service, Vermont's experience with floods can be traced to both ongoing climate change and the state's mountainous geography. Greater rainfall and increased moisture availability have made the state\u2019s steep terrain more susceptible to flooding.",
      "Elsewhere in Vermont, heavy winds blew off a significant portion of a high school's roof in Addison County.",
      "Meanwhile, flash flooding also occurred in Massachusetts on Thursday after rains dumped more than 7 inches (18 centimeters) of rain in some areas. Some businesses were flooded in the town of Weymouth, which saw the bulk of the rain and flooding while commuters faced delays as highways and streets south of Boston flooded.",

      "To prepare for the role, Brosnahan interviewed investigative reporters and journalists as part of her research.",
      "\"Lois is somebody who has very strong beliefs about ethics in journalism, her own journalistic integrity and she's unwilling to compromise it even for somebody that she loves,\" Brosnahan said. \"I think it's part of what earns her that title of Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist.\"",

We all need that sometimes.\"",

      "\"He (Superman) takes great pride in the role that he plays in society, in helping people, in what he can do to help people.

    "summary": "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' lawyer says the music mogul got a standing ovation from fellow prisoners when he returned to the federal lockup in Brooklyn after the verdict.",
    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs got a standing ovation from fellow inmates when the music mogul returned to jail after being acquitted of sex trafficking and racketeering in his federal trial in New York, providing what his lawyer says might have been the best thing he could do for incarcerated Black men in America.",
      "Combs, 55, was found guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution, but was acquitted on the most serious charges, which carried potential life-in-prison sentences.",
      "\"They all said: 'We never get to see anyone who beats the government,'\" attorney Marc Agnifilo told The Associated Press in a weekend interview days after the jury reached its verdict.",
      "The music mogul remains jailed at a federal lockup in Brooklyn after his conviction Wednesday on the prostitution-related charges, which could put him in prison for several more years. Any sentence will include credit for time served, which currently amounts to almost 10 months.",
      "After federal agents raided Combs' homes in Los Angeles and the Miami area in March 2024, Agnifilo said he told the \"I'll Be Missing You\" singer to expect to be arrested on sex trafficking charges.",
      "\"I said: 'Maybe it's your fate in life to be the guy who wins,'\" he recalled during a telephone interview briefly interrupted by a jailhouse call from Combs. \"They need to see that someone can win. I think he took that to heart.\"",
      "Blunt trial strategy works",
      "The verdict in Manhattan federal court came after a veteran team of eight defense lawyers led by Agnifilo executed a trial strategy that resonated with jurors. Combs passed lawyers notes during effective cross-examinations of nearly three dozen witnesses over two months, including Combs' ex-employees.",
      "The lawyers told jurors Combs was a jealous domestic abuser with a drug problem who participated in the swinger lifestyle through threesomes involving Combs, his girlfriends and another man.",
      "\"You may think to yourself, wow, he is a really bad boyfriend,\" Combs' lawyer Teny Geragos told jurors in her May opening statement. But that, she said, \"is simply not sex trafficking.\"",
      "Agnifilo said the blunt talk was a \"no brainer.\"",
      "\"The violence was so clear and up front and we knew the government was going to try to confuse the jury into thinking it was part of a sex trafficking effort. So we had to tell the jury what it was so they wouldn't think it was something it wasn't,\" he said.",
      "Combs and his lawyers seemed deflated Tuesday when jurors said they were deadlocked on the racketeering count but had reached a verdict on sex trafficking and lesser prostitution-related charges. A judge ordered them back to deliberate Wednesday.",
      "\"No one knows what to think,\" Agnifilo said. Then he slept on it.",
      "Morning surprise awakes lawyer",
      "\"I wake up at three in the morning and I text Teny and say: \"We have to get a bail application together,\" he recalled. \"It's going to be a good verdict for us but I think he went down on the prostitution counts so let's try to get him out.\"",
      "He said he \"kind of whipped everybody into feeling better\" after concluding jurors would have convicted him of racketeering if they had convicted him of sex trafficking because trafficking was an alleged component of racketeering.",
      "Agnifilo met with Combs before court and Combs entered the courtroom rejuvenated. Smiling, the onetime Catholic schoolboy prayed with family. In less than an hour, the jury matched Agnifilo's prediction.",
      "The seemingly chastened Combs mouthed \"thank you\" to jurors and smiled as family and supporters applauded. After he was escorted from the room, spectators cheered the defense team, a few chanting: \"Dream Team! Dream Team!\" Several lawyers, including Geragos, cried.",
      "\"This was a major victory for the defense and a major loss for the prosecution,\" said Mitchell Epner, a lawyer who worked with Agnifilo as a federal prosecutor in New Jersey over two decades ago. He credited \"a dream team of defense lawyers\" against prosecutors who almost always win.",
      "Agnifilo showcased what would become his trial strategy \u2014 belittling the charges and mocking the investigation that led to them \u2014 last September in arguing unsuccessfully for bail. The case against Combs was what happens when the \"federal government comes into our bedrooms,\" he said.",
      "Lawyers gently questioned most witnesses",
      "During an eight-week trial, Combs' lawyers picked apart the prosecution case with mostly gentle but firm cross-examinations. Combs never testified and his lawyers called no witnesses.",
      "Sarah Krissoff, a federal prosecutor in Manhattan from 2008 to 2021, said Combs' defense team \"had a narrative from the beginning and they did all of it without putting on any witnesses. That's masterful.\"",
      "Ironically, Agnifilo expanded the use of racketeering laws as a federal prosecutor on an organized crime task force in New Jersey two decades ago, using them often to indict street gangs in violence-torn cities.",
      "\"I knew the weak points in the statute,\" he said. \"The statute is very mechanical. If you know how the car works, you know where the fail points are.\"",
      "He said prosecutors had \"dozens of fail points.\"",
      "\"They didn't have a conspiracy, they just didn't,\" he said. \"They basically had Combs' personal life and tried to build racketeering around personal assistants.\"",
      "Some personal assistants, even after viewing videos of Combs beating his longtime girlfriend, Casandra \"Cassie\" Ventura, had glowing things to say about Combs on cross examination.",
      "Once freed, Combs likely to reenter domestic abusers program",
      "For Combs, Agnifilo sees a long road ahead once he is freed and resumes work on personal demons, likely reentering a program for domestic batterers that he had just started before his arrest.",
      "\"He's doing OK,\" said Agnifilo, who speaks with him four or five times daily.",
      "He said Combs genuinely desires improvement and \"realizes he has flaws like everyone else that he never worked on.\"",
      "\"He burns hot in all matters. I think what he has come to see is that he has these flaws and there's no amount of fame and no amount of fortune\" that can erase them,\" he said. \"You can't cover them up.\"",
      "For Agnifilo, a final surprise awaited him after Combs' bail was rejected when a man collapsed into violent seizures at the elevators outside the courtroom.",
      "\"I'm like: 'What the hell?'\" recalled the lawyer, who has experience in treating seizures.",
      "Agnifilo straddled him, pulling him onto his side and using a foot to prevent him from rolling backward while a law partner, Jacob Kaplan, put a backpack under the man's head and Agnifilo's daughter took his pulse.",
      "\"We made sure he didn't choke on vomit. It was crazy. I was worried about him,\" he said.",
      "The man was eventually taken away conscious by rescue workers, leaving Agnifilo to ponder a tumultuous day.",
      "\"It was like I was getting punked by God,\" he said.",

      "A CDC analysis published Thursday concluded that the virus has settled into twice-a-year surges nationwide, typically peaking first in July through September and then a second time later in December through February.",
      "Those surges look to be linked to cycles of genetic changes to a part of the virus that scientists call the S1 region, a key part of the spike protein of the virus that binds to human cells.",
      "\"Our analysis revealed biannual COVID-19 peaks in late summer and winter, a pattern that is expected to persist as long as the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and cyclical S1 diversity continues,\" the scientists wrote in the CDC analysis.",
      "COVID-19's rise comes as health officials have been probing reports of an unusual uptick in another respiratory virus called parvovirus B19.

      "Costa knows her way around a needle; she's the co-founder and CEO of LexRx, an aesthetic injectables practice with three locations in Boston and one in Nantucket. She's also a mom of two. Her daughter, Capri, is an IVF miracle.",

      "\"They would say, 'Oh, you have an appointment? What are you doing?' I became very transparent and open with my customer base that I was going through IVF treatments in the hopes of having a second child. It really opened the conversation for my patient population to say maybe they were going through it, too. A lot of them shared their fears and anxiety around administering the medication. I had two patients who said, 'I had two rounds fail because I messed up the medications,' and that just kills you because you know the meds are expensive and it's incredibly time-consuming. Their heartbreak really spoke to me,\" Costa said. \"They almost wanted to ask, would I be willing to help with the injections? I do their Botox treatments, I do other services for them. They trust me with a syringe and a needle. For me, it just felt like the best way to pay it forward was to really help my own clients going through this journey.\"",

      "He announced the tariffs on two of the United States' biggest trade partners in letters posted on this Truth Social account.",
      "In his letter to Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, Mr. Trump acknowledged that the country has helped stem the flow of undocumented migrants and fentanyl into the U.S. But he said the country has not done enough to stop North America from turning into a \"Narco-Trafficking Playground.\"",
      "\"Mexico has been helping me secure the border, BUT, what Mexico has done, is not enough,\" Mr. Trump added.",

      "With the reciprocal tariffs, Mr. Trump is effectively blowing up the rules governing world trade. For decades, the U.S. and most other countries abided by tariff rates set through a series of complex negotiations known as the Uruguay Round.

      "The new law tightens eligibility rules for the Pell Grant program, the largest source of federal aid for low-income students. From 2021-2022, an estimated 92% of Pell Grant recipients had a total family income at or below $60,000,\u00a0according to Congress.gov.",
      "Under the law, students who receive a full scholarship from a college or university will no longer be eligible for additional funding through the Pell Grant program.",
      "By contrast, the law expands Pell Grant eligibility for students in workforce training programs. Previously, Pell Grants could only be used to pay for workforce training courses of less than 600 hours and 15 weeks, shutting out many short-term programs.",
      "That will enable \"Pell Grants to be used for short-term, high-quality workforce training programs to support Americans who choose a career or technical education path for career advancement,\" the White House said.",
      "The budget law also increases scrutiny of the Student Aid Index, which is used to determine the size of an individual's federal aid eligibility. As a result, higher-income families will have a harder time getting Pell Grant funding, according to the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP).",
      "Borrowing caps",
      "The new law sets borrowing caps on certain loans beginning July 1, 2026.",
      "Parent PLUS loans \u2014 federal loans available for parents of dependent undergraduate students \u2014 will now be restricted to $20,000 a year and a total cap of $65,000. That's a change from the current limit, which amounts to the total cost of attendance minus any student aid an individual receives.",
      "The new law also does away with\u00a0Grad PLUS loans,\u00a0which help people finance higher education degrees. Starting July 1, 2026, new students will no longer be able to apply for the loans. However, current borrowers will be grandfathered and still allowed to access the loans, according to EdSource.",
      "With the elimination of Grad PLUS loans, graduate students in need of federal tuition assistance will have to take out Direct Unsubsidized Loans. Those seeking unsubsidized federal loans for professional degrees, such as law or medicine, will be restricted to $50,000 per year and a $200,000 lifetime cap. Those seeking advanced degrees in nonprofessional areas, such as history or philosophy, will be subject to an annual borrowing cap of $20,500 and a lifetime limit of $100,000.",
      "Economic hardship, unemployment deferment",
      "Currently, student loan borrowers can apply for up to three years of deferment based on economic hardship or unemployment, according to the Federal Student Aid website.",
      "Starting July 1, 2026, the new law eliminates deferment provisions for borrowers facing economic hardship. For example, someone who falls behind on the bills because of job loss would no longer qualify to defer student loan payments, Ba\u00f1ez said.",
      "According to the White House, the changes to the deferment rules will streamline the process while also better protecting students and taxpayers.",

    "summary": "People are turning to AI dating assistants for help in crafting wittier, more conversational messages to attract romantic partners on apps.",
    "story": [
      "While online dating apps makes searching for love more convenient, finding that special person is difficult as ever. A cute photo and simple \"hello\" may not be enough to help you break through the noise, which is why many of those feeling stuck on what to say are turning to artificial intelligence for assistance.",
      "According to a study\u00a0on singles in America released last month by dating app Match.com and The Kinsey Institute at Indiana University, 1 in 4 singles \u2014 and nearly half of Gen Z \u2014 use AI to up their dating game. That's a 333% increase from a year ago.",
      "\"People are turning to AI for literally any use case you could imagine,\" said Kasley Killam, a social health and human connection expert. \"And so it's inevitable that people are going to turn to AI for dating coaching.\"",
      "Capitalizing on the trend are AI dating assistants, which coach people on what to say, what tone to strike and how to keep the conversation flowing if it hits a lull. For individuals who feel writing isn't their strong suit, the technology can be a real confidence booster.",
      "Advice on what to say",
      "Roman Khaves, founder of a dating assistant app called Rizz \u2014 which Gen Z-speak for \"charisma\" \u2014 said the service provides around-the-clock, objective advice for people who can't afford a human dating coach or can't reach their friends in a pinch.",
      "\"It'll never sleep on you,\" Khaves told CBS MoneyWatch, describing the app as an \"AI wingwoman or AI wingman in your pocket.\"",
      "Rizz works by letting users upload screenshots of their conversations from dating apps or social media. Rizz then suggests a reply using generative AI. The more you use Rizz, the more it understands what type of replies you tend to like or feel comfortable with. That trains the AI model to improve over time.",
      "Rizz has a user base of roughly 10 million, according to Khaves, and is composed of 65% men and 35% women, largely within the 18-to-25 age range.",
      "Another service called Keepler, a dating-optimization app, has a feature that helps people navigate the dreaded practice known as \"ghosting,\" or when someone abruptly cuts off communication with someone without providing any explanation.",
      "One reason people ghost others is that they don't know the best way to let someone down easy, Keepler co-founder and CEO Rachel Abramowitz, told CBS MoneyWatch. Keepler's defense against ghosting is Keri, the app's in-house relationship guide.",
      "\"What we've built is a way to put in your raw, unedited feedback to Keri. Keri will rewrite it for you, and then you can send it to somebody,\" Abramowitz said.",
      "For those who have been ghosted, Keepler also allows users to request feedback from their vanishing date directly through the app, or have Keri help them write a message to send on their own.",
      "Abramowitz emphasizes that the app isn't aimed at providing therapy, but rather is there to offer support. With Keri, \"It really does feel like you have someone who is objective, who is on your side, who has no ulterior motives and really wants you to help reach your goals,\" she said.",
      "Last-gen dating apps are also getting into the AI game. Hinge and Grindr, two of the most popular dating apps, are taking steps to integrate AI into their platforms. In January, for example, Hinge introduced Prompt Feedback, an AI feature that provides users with immediate feedback on their profiles as they enter information.",
      "AIcebreaker",
      "The growing popularity of AI dating assistants gives rise to questions over authenticity as more users rely on the technology to convey their thoughts and feelings.",
      "One 36-year old Rizz user, who asked to remain anonymous to protect his privacy, told CBS MoneyWatch he could see why some people might find using AI to communicate disingenuous, but said he sees the tech simply as a way to stand out from the crowd.",
      "He also acknowledged that some of his dates appeared skeptical after he revealed that he was getting behind-the-scenes coaching from Rizz. But he still thinks the service is helpful as a conversation starter.",
      "\"For me personally, it's good for just initiating conversation, getting someone's attention, and then being able to just be myself after that,\" he said.",
      "Killam, the social health and human connection expert, said she thinks AI dating tools can be useful as long as people don't misrepresent who they are or lean on them too much.",
      "\"The risk is when we use AI as a substitute for human connection, rather than a supplement to it,\" she said.",
      "The Associated  Press\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "A top White House budget official said President Trump is \"troubled\" by Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's management, as Mr. Trump pressures him over interest rates.",
    "story": [
      "A top Trump administration official accused Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell of leading an \"ostentatious\" office renovation project that may be \"violating the law\" on Thursday, a new broadside against the central bank chief as President Trump tangles with him over interest rates.",
      "\"The President is extremely troubled by your management of the Federal Reserve System,\" Office of Management and Budget Chair Russell Vought wrote in a letter Thursday.",
      "The letter came after months of criticism from Mr. Trump over the Fed's decision not to slash interest rates. Economists say lowering rates may accelerate economic growth, but also runs the risk of causing inflation to spike. That has led the Fed's interest rate-setting committee \u2014 which Powell chairs \u2014 to keep rates steady so far this year after cutting rates slightly last year.",
      "Mr. Trump has called on Powell to resign from his post, and last month, the president called Powell a \"numbskull\" over his interest rate decisions and said \"maybe\" he'll try to fire Powell \u2014 though federal law states the Fed chair can only be fired \"for cause,\" which typically refers to firings due to specific misconduct or performance issues. In the past, Mr. Trump had said he doesn't plan on trying to fire Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends next year.",
      "Vought's letter took aim at Powell and the central bank over its years-long office renovation project in Washington, D.C. The letter said plans for the project \"called for rooftop terrace gardens, VIP private dining rooms and elevators, water features, premium marble, and much more.\" Vought also asked whether the Fed has made changes to its plans without seeking approval from a government commission that oversees D.C.-area federal building projects.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Federal Reserve for comment.",
      "In testimony to the Senate last month, Powell called some descriptions of the renovation project \"misleading and inaccurate.\" He told lawmakers there isn't any new marble aside from what's necessary to replace broken old marble, and said there are no \"special elevators,\" new water features or rooftop gardens.",
      "\"All of the sort of inflammatory things that the media carried are either not in the current plan or just inaccurate,\" Powell said.",
      "Vought's letter argued that comment to the Senate \"appears to reveal that the project is out of compliance with the approved plan,\" suggesting the Fed may have run afoul of a law requiring D.C.-area projects be approved by the National Capital Planning Commission. In a post on X, the Office of Management and Budget alleged Powell \"slipped up and revealed he might...be violating the law.\" The Fed's renovation plans were reviewed by the commission several years ago.",
      "The Fed typically operates with a much higher degree of independence than most other government institutions. Federal law gives the Fed the power to make decisions about acquiring and remodeling buildings in Washington to serve as its office spaces.",
      "The Fed has previously acknowledged\u00a0that the price tag for its office renovations had jumped due to \"significant increases in raw materials costs,\" along with higher labor costs.",
      "On its website, the Fed says the two headquarters buildings that are getting overhauled \"have not been comprehensively renovated since their construction in the 1930s.\" The central bank said there are no private elevators or new VIP dining rooms \u2014 instead, the project will refurbish old elevators and conference rooms, including ones that are sometimes \"used for mealtime meetings.\" It also said plans for new water features were scrapped, though existing fountains will be repaired, and the garden terrace is actually a \"ground-level front lawn.\"",
      "Last week, Bill Pulte, the Trump-nominated head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, accused Powell of \"deceptive\" testimony to the Senate about the office project.",
      "Asked about the allegation in a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, Mr. Trump said: \"Then he should resign immediately. We should get somebody in it that's going to lower interest rates.\"",

    "story": [
      "Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva said Thursday that he would impose retaliatory tariffs on the United States if President Donald Trump follows through on a pledge to boost import taxes by 50% over the South American country's criminal trial against his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro.",
      "Lula said he would trigger Brazil's reciprocity law approved by Congress earlier this year if negotiations with the U.S. fail.",
      "\"If there's no negotiation, the reciprocity law will be put to work. If he charges 50 (% tariffs) from us, we will charge 50 from them,\" Lula told TV Record in excerpts of an interview that will be fully aired later in the day. \"Respect is good. I like to offer mine and I like to receive it.\"",
      "Lula's comments raise the risk of a tariffs war erupting between the two countries, similar to what has happened between the U.S. and China. Trump has vowed to respond forcefully if countries seek to punish the U.S. by adding tariffs of their own.",
      "The president of Brazil's Senate, Sen. Davi Alcolumbre, and Chamber of Deputies Speaker Hugo Motta, a pair of moderates who have recently been at odds with Lula, agreed that the recipricity law gives Brazil \"the means ... to protect our sovereignty.\"",
      "\"We will be ready to act with balance and firmness in defense of our economy, our productive sector, and the protection of Brazilian jobs,\" they said in a joint statement.",
      "The tariffs letter that Trump sent to Brazil \u2014 and posted on social media Wednesday \u2014 railing against the \"witch hunt\" trial against Bolsonaro opened up a new front in his trade wars, with the U.S. leader directly using import taxes to interfere with another nation's domestic politics.",
      "Trump has already tried to use tariffs to ostensibly combat fentanyl trafficking and as a negotiating tool to change how other nations tax digital services and regulate their economies.",
      "In Brazil's case, Trump is trying to dictate the outcome of the criminal trial of Bolsonaro, an ally who like Trump has been charged with attempting to overturn a presidential election. Bolsonaro maintains that he is being politically persecuted by Brazil's Supreme Court over his charges on the alleged plot to remain in power after his 2022 election loss to Lula.",
      "\"There's nothing Lula or Brazil can do about Bolsonaro's trial,\" said Carlos Melo, a political science professor at Insper University in Sao Paulo. \"Any change in that would be Brazil's capitulation. Bolsonaro's situation here won't change. How do you negotiate over that?\"",
      "Lula ordered his diplomats on Thursday to return Trump's letter if it physically arrives at the presidential palace in Brasilia. The document attacks the country's judiciary and mentions recent rulings on social media companies among the reasons why goods from the South American nation will have higher tariffs from Aug. 1.",
      "Trump has initiated his tariffs under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, saying in April that the persistent deficit between what the U.S. exports and what it imports is a national crisis.",
      "But the U.S. runs a trade surplus with Brazil, undermining some of the rationale.",
      "A staffer of Brazil's foreign ministry told The Associated Press that trade negotiations that were ongoing since Trump imposed a first set of tariffs in April are now \"up in the air.\"",
      "Some members of the Lula administration say Trump's move is actually aimed at Brazil's connection with other Southern economies, as displayed on Sunday at the summit of BRICS nations hosted in Rio de Janeiro. Brazil's president once again mentioned the hope for an alternative currency to the dollar for transactions, a topic that frequently draws Trump's ire.",
      "\"Trump was never worried about democracy anywhere, much less with Bolsonaro's destiny,\" said Gleisi Hoffmann, Brazil's institutional relations minister.",
      "Trump's interference in Brazilian affairs has brought a sense of unity that was largely absent in the politically divided nation. Some of Bolsonaro's allies claimed Lula had drawn the U.S. president's anger with other decisions, including criticism of Israel's war in Gaza. But other supporters of the former president chose to ask for prudence in negotiations.",
      "Daily O Estado de S. Paulo, a frequent critic of Lula and his administration, said in an editorial on Thursday that Trump's move against the Brazilian government is \"a mafia thing.\" It also said Lula's reaction was correct, a rare feature for the newspaper.",
      "Analysts also see Trump's attempt to interfere in the country's domestic affairs as a potential backfire for Bolsonaro during his trial and a push for Lula, whose reelection bid was facing unpopularity headwinds this year.",
      "Canadians recently elected Mark Carney as prime minister, with his Liberal Party reenergized by Trump's tariffs and threats to make Canada the 51st U.S. state.",
      "\"The reaction of a lot of people is that this is a political gift to Lula,\" said Andre Pagliarini, a professor of history and international studies at Louisiana State University who is also affiliated with the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft.",
      "Thomas Traumann, an independent political consultant and former Brazilian minister, called Trump's move \"a game changer\" for next year's election.",
      "\"Trump put Lula back in the game,\" Traumann said. \"This gives Lula a narrative, puts Bolsonaro as the guilty part for any economic problems.\"",
      "The U.S. Court of International Trade ruled in May that Trump had exceeded his authority by declaring an emergency to impose tariffs without congressional approval. The Trump administration is appealing that decision, but opponents plan to use his Brazil letter to bolster their case.",
      "\"This is a brazenly illegal effort by Donald Trump to sacrifice the economy to settle his own personal scores, and it is far outside his legal authority,\" said Democratic Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden.",
      "The Republican administration has argued that their tariffs are now relatively harmless for the U.S. economy, since inflation has trended down in recent months. But many companies stockpiled imports to get ahead of the import taxes, and it's unclear what happens when their inventories dwindle and consumers consider the risk of higher prices. Most outside economic analyses expect growth to decline.",
      "In Brazil, Trump's interest in Bolsonaro's trial is expected to weigh over the trial. Media outlets have reported that lawmakers and judges are worried the former president will try to leave Brazil for the U.S. if he is convicted.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday threatened to impose 35% tariffs on goods from Canada starting next month, hiking import duties on one of the U.S.'s largest trading partners.",
      "The president announced the 35% tax in a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney posted to Truth Social, citing Canada's alleged \"failure to stop the drugs from pouring into our country,\" as well as retaliatory tariffs Canada has imposed on U.S. goods. The new tariffs are set to take effect Aug. 1, the president said.",
      "The move is an escalation from the 25% tariffs on Canadian \u2014 and Mexican \u2014 imports announced by Mr. Trump shortly after taking office. He later exempted goods covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement, which was negotiated during Mr. Trump's first term. It's unclear whether the same exemption will apply to next month's 35% tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump has sent similar letters to the leaders of more than 20 other countries this week, telling them to expect higher tariffs starting next month. He told NBC News' Kristen Welker on Thursday, \"all of the remaining countries\" will likely face tariffs of 15% to 20% \u2014 higher than the baseline 10% rate that's currently applied to all countries.",
      "But Canada is the largest American trading partner to receive a letter so far. Canada was the world's largest buyer of American goods and the third-largest seller of goods to the U.S. last year, according to Census Bureau data. The country bought some $350 billion worth of American goods and sold $412 billion to the U.S. market in 2024.",
      "Mr. Trump's letter to Carney says he will \"consider an adjustment to this letter\" if \"Canada works with me to stop the flow of Fentanyl.\" For months, the president has cast tariffs against Canada and Mexico as a way of getting the U.S.'s two neighbors to stem illegal immigration and fentanyl trafficking, though very little fentanyl appears to enter the U.S. via Canada. Just 43 pounds were seized at the Canadian border last year, compared to 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border.",
      "\"Throughout the current trade negotiations with the United States, the Canadian government has steadfastly defended our workers and businesses,\" Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney wrote in a social media post late Thursday night. \"We will continue to do so as we work towards the revised deadline of August 1. Canada has made vital progress to stop the scourge of fentanyl in North America. We are committed to continuing to work with the United States to save lives and protect communities in both our countries.\"",
      "The president also assailed Canada for \"retaliat[ing] with its own Tariffs.\" And he said Canada has imposed other barriers on U.S. imports.",
      "Mr. Trump has held on-and-off discussions with Canada for months, but his relationship with the United States' northern neighbor has occasionally been rocky, with U.S. tariffs drawing retaliatory duties from Canada. The president\u00a0briefly called off all trade talks\u00a0with Canada last month due to a planned digital services tax that could hit U.S. tech companies, but the talks\u00a0resumed days later\u00a0after Carney rescinded the tax.",
      "Mr. Trump has also\u00a0repeatedly mused about annexing Canada, and Carney's party won this year's parliamentary elections after the prime minister ran on a platform\u00a0of defending Canada from the Trump administration's ambitions.",
      "Trump boosts tariffs on dozens of countries",
      "The president is sending out this week's spate of tariff letters about three months after first unveiling \"reciprocal tariffs\" against dozens of countries on \"Liberation Day\" in early April, along with a 10% tariff on everybody else. The move unnerved financial markets and sparked recession and inflation fears, and Mr. Trump quickly suspended most of the duties for 90 days \u2014 aside from the 10% baseline rate \u2014 saying he planned to negotiate trade deals.",
      "With that 90-day pause set to expire this week, Mr. Trump began sending out letters to dozens of trading partners from Japan to South Africa informing them of their planned tariffs. The U.S. has trade deficits with most countries that received Mr. Trump's letters, though Brazil was also threatened with a 50% tariff despite the U.S. running a trade surplus. The letter cited the prosecution of right-wing former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, which Mr. Trump called a \"Witch Hunt.\"",
      "On top of country-specific tariffs, the president has also imposed hefty \"sectoral\" tariffs on foreign steel, copper and other specific categories of goods.",
      "Mr. Trump says the tariffs are necessary to revive American manufacturing and correct trade imbalances. But many economists warn that tariffs lead to higher consumer prices and slower economic growth. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has said concerns about tariffs are partly to blame for the central bank's decision not to cut interest rates so far this year.",
      "Still, the president has stood by his trade strategy.",

      "\"The AI piece is becoming more integrated, which is requiring a redefinition of what an entry-level role looks like and the types of skills that might be be needed,\" Christine Cruzvergara, chief education strategy officer at Handshake, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So it's critical for new graduates to make sure they are exposing themselves to AI and learning how to use it.\"",
      "Over the past two years, there has been a 400% increase in employers using \"AI\" in job descriptions, according to Handshake.",
      "Liya Palagashvili, a labor economist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, told CBS MoneyWatch that jobs with low barriers to entry are being swallowed by AI. She points to a 2024\u00a0study\u00a0by researchers at the University of Chicago, Columbia Business School, Purdue University, and Stanford Graduate School of Business showing that generative AI is weighing on hiring in occupations that require little education, knowledge or training.",
      "\"Any job requiring lower levels or skills or training, that's where we are seeing a reduction in hiring due to an exposure to generative AI,\" Palagashvili said.",
      "By contrast, the study found that, since the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022, demand for workers in occupations requiring a higher level of knowledge and training has risen.",
      "\"So you're seeing a two-segmented market thing going on with ChatGPT having a positive effect on occupations with higher barriers to labor entry, and having a negative effect on occupations that have low barriers to entry,\" Palagashvili said. \"The latest empirical evidence shows hiring is down in low-skilled occupations, but high in those that require a\u00a0 higher skill level.\"",
      "New technologies have always shaped the labor market, snuffing out certain professions while breathing life into new sectors. One difference with the rise of AI that the technology excels at job functions typically associated with white-collar work.",
      "The acceleration of AI could push more young people into skilled trades that don't require a high-priced college education, Calidas said.",
      "\"Since the automation that began in the 1970s, a lot of manual jobs have gone away,\" he said. \"For a few generations, it's been an article of faith that white-collar jobs are more safe, whereas blue-collar work is more precarious. There's been a cultural push toward sending people to college, but it might make more sense to go into the trades.\"",

Since then, campaign finance records show the company's CEO Kevin Stein has donated to candidates from both major political parties and gave more than $300,000 to the National Republican Congressional Committee earlier this year as Mr. Trump and many others within the GOP sharply criticized what they viewed as waste in government.",
      "\"Both sides should be screaming from the rooftops about this,\" William Hartung, a defense spending expert at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft think tank, said about TransDigm's business practices which he views as having taken advantage of a dysfunctional system.",
      "TransDigm may be little known to the public at large, but the company has attracted attention in the halls of Congress. Within the last decade, Stein has testified to lawmakers amid scrutiny of the business, which deals in parts for both military and commercial aircraft.",
      "\"As my oversight has exposed, TransDigm has spent years fleecing taxpayers to the tune of millions of dollars,\" Iowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley said in a statement. \"The Department of Defense Inspector General needs to conduct aggressive oversight of TransDigm's abuses and ensure proper accountability is had. At the same time, the Defense Department must step up its game to implement enhanced internal controls and explore alternative pathways of production, including through reverse engineering of spare parts, to avoid being swindled by contractors like TransDigm.\"",
      "TransDigm did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",
      "In February 2019, an audit released by the Department of Defense Inspector General's Office \"determined that for 112 contracts, TransDigm earned $16.1 million in excess profit for 46 parts it sold to the [Defense Logistics Agency] and the Army for $26.2 million between January 2015 and January 2017.\"",
      "Months later as part of a House Oversight Committee hearing, Stein refuted the report, arguing in a written statement that its findings were \"based on cost data that excludes many actual costs of doing business.\"",
      "Still, lawmakers took issue with the company.",
      "North Carolina GOP Rep. Mark Meadows, who would later become Mr. Trump's chief of staff towards the end of the president's first term, encouraged the company during the hearing to \"chalk it up to marketing expense and pay the American taxpayer back immediately.\"",
      "Florida Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz argued the business was \"grossly robbing the American taxpayers and impacting our military readiness and our ability to make sure that we have the ability to accomplish mission-critical goals.\"",
      "Across Capitol Hill that same day, Grassley said during a speech that the report \"exposes a galactic price gouging, colossal rip-off and out-of-this-world waste.\"",
      "The company later voluntarily repaid the $16.1 million.",
      "Close to three years later, during Democratic President Joe Biden's tenure, the Defense Department's Inspector General's Office released another report looking at January 2017 to June 2019. That audit alleged findings \"that TransDigm earned excess profit of at least $20.8 million on 105 spare parts on 150 contracts.\"",
      "A 2022 House hearing on that report was far more politically divisive than the similar one held in 2019. Stein testified again, and shared what he described as deep concern \"with the fundamental errors in this report,\" while some Republicans took issue with the attention being trained on TransDigm.",
      "\"I don't think we should be picking on any one company, particularly an American-owned company, here,\" North Carolina GOP Rep. Virginia Foxx said during the hearing.",
      "Democrats continued to challenge company leaders, along with Grassley, a Republican.",
      "\"You all are the perfect poster child of an out-of-control defense budget that puts the interests of wealthy, well-connected people like yourselves ahead of the best interests of the American people,\" progressive Michigan Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib said at the time.",
      "Later, Grassley signed a letter asking for the amount of money identified in the 2021 audit to be repaid. A response from Stein obtained by CBS News shows the CEO argued that \"while the headline from the audit report may be TransDigm made \"excess profit,\" the reality is that this conclusion is derived from the audit report inexplicably counting millions of dollars of real costs as profit and creating an artificial profit measure not found in law.\"",
      "The Defense Department, which has the largest discretionary budget in the federal government, has long been susceptible to price gouging contracts. According to the Pentagon's inspector general, the Government Accountability Office has included the Defense Department's contract management in its \"High\u2011Risk List\" of programs vulnerable to waste and fraud since 1992.",
      "A spokesperson for the federal government's Defense Logistics Agency told CBS news on Tuesday that in early 2022, it had \"requested voluntary refunds from TransDigm for the $20.8M identified in the 2021 report.\"",
      "\"To date, DLA has not received a refund and TransDigm has not indicated their intent to pay,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Before the 2024 general elections, Stein donated to help Mr. Trump's presidential run, as well as to political efforts for Republicans and Democrats. On occasion, that resulted in his giving to a Democratic incumbent \u2014 and the Republican challenger \u2014 as he did in a recent Senate race in Pennsylvania that ended with then Democratic Sen. Bob Casey narrowly losing to Republican Dave McCormick.",
      "Last year, after having donated to Republicans, Stein also gave money to a few House Democratic candidates including some from frontline seats in the 2024 cycle whose wins went on to play a part in keeping Republicans' majority narrow.",
      "Stein has also helped fund a political operation that received donations from TransDigm leaders. Records show from late 2019 until the end of last year, the group called TransDigm Group Inc. Employee Political Action Committee gave money to dozens of Democrats and Republicans, including candidates from both major parties who now hold roles on the House oversight panel that in the past has questioned the company, as well as politicians who are part of Democratic leadership.",
      "After starting at TransDigm in 2014, Stein rose through the ranks over time, according to an online biography. Earlier this year, the company announced that he would retire as CEO at the end of September. Republican Ohio Rep. Max Miller, whose campaign counts Stein as a donor, called him \"a great guy.\"",
      "\"In terms of my dealings with him, he's been very straight and narrow,\" Miller said. \"I've had dealings with other people who are not straight and narrow that I will not take money from and tell them, 'bye and there's the door.' And believe it or not, members of Congress do that more frequently than people would think.\"",
      "A clear focus of Stein's political donations in the early part of this year has been House Republicans. Through a joint fundraising group tied to Minnesota Rep. Tom Emmer, the third highest-ranking Republican in the House, money from Stein has also gone towards a set of Republican campaigns that could be critical in deciding which party holds control of the House for the final two years of Mr. Trump's time in the White House.",
      "Republicans losing just three seats in the House could be the difference between the GOP having unified control of Washington for the final two years of Trump's presidency or the party's power and influence being limited before he leaves office.",
      "Outside of the House chamber last week, New York GOP Rep. Mike Lawler maintained that congressional Republicans and the Trump administration are looking to root out waste in government. He pushed back however on any concerns about the CEO's political spending after being asked about the dollars that have recently been given to his own campaign and other House Republican political operations.",
      "\"Obviously, in America, people are able to support whoever they want,\" Lawler said. \"We don't live in communist Russia, unless you would like to go down that road.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 10:29:00 -0400",
    "summary": "One of the highest tariffs threatened by President Trump so far is against Brazil, with the president citing a criminal prosecution against Jair Bolsonaro.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Wednesday he would impose a 50% tariff on goods from Brazil next month, one of the steepest rates for any U.S. trading partner, citing the criminal prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, which Mr. Trump called an \"international disgrace.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has sent open letters to about 20 countries this week \u2014 ranging from Japan to Iraq \u2014 telling them to expect higher tariffs starting Aug.\u00a01, after delaying his sweeping tariffs against dozens of nations in April. So far, the 50% tariff on Brazilian imports is the highest rate threatened against any country, and Brazil is the only country to get hit with a tariff this week after being spared by Mr. Trump's April \"Liberation Day\" tariffs.",
      "Unlike many other countries that have been threatened with tariff hikes, the U.S. runs a trade surplus with Brazil, meaning Brazil buys more American goods than the U.S. buys from Brazil. Last year, the U.S. exported about $49 billion worth of goods to Brazil, and Brazil exported just over $42 billion in goods to the U.S., according to Census Bureau figures.",
      "Mr. Trump's letter excoriated the South American country over the prosecution of Bolsonaro, who led the country before current Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. The U.S. leader called the prosecution a \"Witch Hunt that should end immediately.\"",
      "Bolsonaro was indicted last year for allegedly attempting a coup to remain in office after Lula defeated him in the 2022 elections. The plan allegedly included dozens of people and involved a plot to poison Lula and shoot a Brazilian Supreme Court justice. Bolsonaro's defense team has vehemently denied the charges. Bolsonaro has also been barred from running for office until 2030, after casting doubt on the country's electronic voting machines.",
      "Mr. Trump has long expressed support for Bolsonaro, a right-wing populist sometimes known as \"Trump of the Tropics.\" He also lashed out at Brazil over the prosecution on Monday, calling it a \"terrible thing\" and an \"attack on a Political Opponent.\"",
      "\"LEAVE BOLSONARO ALONE!\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday.",
      "Mr. Trump also criticized Brazil in his tariff letter for what he called \"insidious attacks\" on the \"Free Speech Rights of Americans,\" an apparent reference to the Brazilian Supreme Court's scrutiny of Elon Musk-owned X and some other social media platforms. And he alleged Brazil has an \"unfair trade relationship\" with the U.S., citing \"Tariff, and Non-Tariff, Policies and Trade Barriers.\"",
      "In the letter, Mr. Trump ordered U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to open an investigation into Brazil over \"attacks on the Digital Trade Activities of American Companies\" and \"other unfair Trading Practices.\"",
      "A report by the U.S. Trade Representative earlier this year said Brazil charged an average tariff of 11.2% on imports as of 2023. The report says Brazil imposes \"relatively high tariffs on imports across a wide range of sectors,\" and \"U.S. exporters face significant uncertainty in the Brazilian market because the government frequently modifies tariff rates.\" It also lists some other trade restrictions, like a tariff on ethanol and import licensing rules.",
      "As with the other countries that have faced tariff threats, Mr. Trump said his administration would \"consider an adjustment\" if Brazil were to change its trade practices.",
      "Lula said in a post on X that Brazil will react to any tariff increases by invoking the country's economic reciprocity law, which allows Brazil to impose import restrictions and other countermeasures in response to unilateral tariffs. He also pointed to the U.S.'s trade surplus with Brazil, said the proceedings against Bolsonaro \"fall exclusively under the jurisdiction of Brazil\u00b4s Judicial Branch\" and wrote that companies \"must comply with Brazilian law in order to operate within our territory.\"",
      "\"Brazil is a sovereign nation with independent institutions and will not accept any form of tutelage,\" Lula wrote in the statement, as translated by Brazil's embassy in D.C.",
      "Separately, Mr. Trump threatened an additional 10% tariff on any countries aligned with \"the Anti-American policies of BRICS,\" referring to a group of developing countries and emerging markets that includes Brazil.",
      "Tariffs are a core part of Mr. Trump's economic strategy. The moves have sparked fears of rising consumer prices and an economic slowdown, but Mr. Trump argues tariffs are necessary to revive U.S. manufacturing and punish what he views as unfair trade practices.",
      "The president imposed steep tariffs on dozens of countries in early April, rattling markets, before quickly delaying most of them for three months while his administration sought to negotiate trade deals. With the three-month extension set to run out this week, the administration began sending letters to various countries informing them of higher tariffs starting in August.",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 07:10:17 -0400",
    "summary": "Manufacturers and construction companies \u2014 as well as consumers \u2014 would face higher prices if the U.S. jacks up tariffs on copper, analysts said.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's move to impose a 50% tariff on U.S. copper imports targets a vital metal that is widely used in many products and industries. That could lead to higher prices for everything from appliances and electronics to cars and home repairs, economists and industry experts said.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the copper duties late Wednesday on his Truth Social platform, saying they will take effect Aug 1.",
      "\"Copper is necessary for Semiconductors, Aircraft, Ships, Ammunition, Data Centers, Lithium-ion Batteries, Radar Systems, Missile Defense Systems, and even, Hypersonic Weapons, of which we are building many,\" he wrote. \"Copper is the second most used material by the Department of Defense! Why did our foolish (and SLEEPY!) 'Leaders' decimate this important Industry? This 50% TARIFF will reverse the Biden Administration's thoughtless behavior, and stupidity. America will, once again, build a DOMINANT Copper Industry.\"",
      "Price jump",
      "Ryan Young, a senior economist at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said copper is an integral component in electrical wiring and plumbing, as well being used as a heat conductor in radiators and household appliances. He worries that a hefty copper tariff will trigger inflation.",
      "Copper prices had already surged 13% on Tuesday, reaching a record high, after Mr. Trump floated the possible tariff.",
      "\"It's bad news all around,\" Young said of Mr. Trump's proposed copper tariff. \"If companies' costs go up they pass them along to consumers, so we'd see higher prices for home repairs and anything that uses copper.\"",
      "Copper tariffs could also make maintaining the nation's electric grid more expensive and drive up household energy costs, Young said. \"It would negatively affect the electricity industry and anybody who uses electricity.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has said that tariffs provide financial incentives to ramp up domestic production, including of critical materials like copper, and help create manufacturing jobs.",
      "\"America cannot be reliant on foreign imports of the copper that's necessary for key military hardware, infrastructure and everyday electronics,\" White House Spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"The Trump administration is committed to reshoring manufacturing that's critical [to] our national and economic security with a two-pronged approach of tariffs and a full suite of supply-side reforms like deregulation and the pro-growth tax cuts of The One, Big, Beautiful Bill.\"",
      "Ripple effects",
      "The biggest users of copper \u2014 and therefore most exposed to the tariff increase \u2014 include a vast range of industries, covering everything from construction to semiconductors, electric vehicles and renewable energy components such as solar panels, according to industry data.",
      "Daan de Jonge, copper demand and prices lead analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, said in a research note that \"a 50% price hike will have inevitable ripple effects on the cost of new infrastructure, the cost of housing the cost of fridges, cars, air conditioning.\"",
      "For consumers, that means the cost of appliances such as refrigerators and air conditioners, as well as EVs, would likely rise if this 50% tariff goes into effect, according to analysts.",
      "\"Copper is an important element in development of semiconductors and electric vehicles. And the tariff announcement caused prices to go up quite dramatically, so you can tell it's a pretty big deal,\" Veronique de Rugy, a professor of political economy and senior research fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The reason President Trump picked copper is because it's such a big deal for a lot of important things.\"",
      "Carveouts for key partners?",
      "The U.S. gets roughly two-thirds of its copper imports from Chile and Canada, with additional supply coming from Peru and Mexico.\u00a0 The U.S.'s net copper imports met 53% of U.S. demand for copper last year, according to Morgan Stanley research.",
      "Experts note that Mr. Trump isn't certain to hike duties on copper, saying his proposal could be aimed more at securing concession from exporters.",
      "\"These are two examples of countries that the U.S. could offer some sort of quota or export restraint relief to as part of a broader deal,\" UBS chief investment strategist Kurt Reiman told CBS MoneyWatch, referring to Canada and Chile. A revamped U.S. trade policy could also include carveouts for foreign copper suppliers, he added",
      "Although the U.S. could ramp up domestic copper production, it would take years to significantly increase output, Reiman said. \"We aren't ready. The mines would have to be built out, and that's typically a multi-year process.\"",
      "The sectoral tariff threats come after Mr. Trump this week announced stiff new tariff rates on 20 nations\u00a0that have not yet reached trade agreements with the U.S and that he said would take effect on Aug. 1. He outlined the new rates, posted in nearly identical letters on Truth Social, as a 90-day pause on so-called \"reciprocal\" levies was\u00a0set to expire\u00a0on Wednesday.",

      "Trump is also expected to announce more deals with U.S. trade partners before the beginning of August, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a press briefing Monday.",

In 2024, the effective tariff rate on imports was 2.5%, he noted.",
      "25% tariff would bog down trade",
      "Trade policy expert Barry Appleton, co-director of the Center for International Law at New York Law School, told CBS MoneyWatch that Monday's announcements \"are simply indications that he is making them pay full admission price to access the U.S. market.\"",

      "McDonald's is reviving fan favorites, spicing up its menu and emphasizing low-cost items to bring inflation-weary customers back to the Golden Arches.",
      "The world's largest restaurant chain recently announced it was bringing back the popular Snack Wrap, which makes its return to McD's outlets on July 10, along with a new, limited-time Spicy Egg McMuffin sandwich, which debuted on July 8. The refreshed menu comes as the company looks to boost sales as budget-conscious consumers pull back on spending.",
      "Same-store sales at McDonald's outlets in the U.S. declined 3.6% in the first quarter, the biggest drop since the COVID-19 pandemic closed stores nationwide. At the same time, traffic among low-income customers was down \"nearly double digits,\" CEO Chris Kempczinski said on the company's May earnings call, reflecting a customer base that the company acknowledged is still feeling the effects of inflation.",
      "McDonald's isn't the first fast-food chain to use promotions to drive business, but it has long been among the most adept at tweaking its menu and pricing, while its scale makes it a bellwether for customer tastes. In January, for example, it introduced\u00a0the McValue\u00a0menu, which includes the $5 meal deal, along with a \"buy one, add one for $1\" deal, as the company leaned into affordable offerings.",
      "McDonald's is reacting to a number of economic and competitive pressures, said Matthew Todd, a director at S&P Global Ratings. Chief among them is continuing to deliver value to low-income consumers in a time of economic uncertainty.",

      "Sara Senatore, a research analyst at the Bank of America, told CBS MoneyWatch that McDonald's move to expand its affordable offerings is an attempt to \"stay relevant\" with low-income consumers, who are \"under much greater pressure than other cohorts.\"",

For McDonald's, which has over 13,500\u00a0locations\u00a0nationwide, the difference now is it's not outperforming competitors as much as it once was, Senatore said.",
      "\"Their same-store sales versus their direct competitors have been much more similar than different,\" she said. \"Whereas, if you look at its long-term history, McDonald's has historically outpaced their competitors.\"",
      "McDonald's did not respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment on the strategy behind its menu changes.",
      "Return of the Snack Wrap",
      "Perhaps the most highly anticipated new menu item is the Snack Wrap, which is returning to McDonald's establishments nationwide on this week after a nine-year hiatus. The wrap, which consists of a white-flour tortilla filled with chicken, shredded lettuce and cheese, was nixed in 2016, sparking a social media campaign by fans lobbying for its return.",
      "\"Given that they're looking for sales drivers, it makes sense that they would go to their archives, if you will,\" Senatore said.",
      "The revived Snack Wrap will come in two flavors \u2014 Ranch and Spicy \u2014 and will be priced at $2.99, according to a McDonald's spokesperson. The main protein will consist of chicken strips \u2014 easier to prepare, and thus less labor-intensive, than the type of chicken McD's previously used in the wrap, which required more cutting, Senatore explained.",
      "Reviving the Snack Wrap is a strategic decision on McDonald's part given the item's cult following. Customers went so far ast to start a Change.org petition garnering more than 19,000 signatures urging McDonald's to bring back the Snack Wrap.",
      "\"Bringing back a product that customers really want to have come back, you typically have higher rate of success,\" Senatore said.",
      "McDonald's is also introducing a new take on its classic Egg McMuffin, with a trio of limited-time breakfast sandwiches featuring spicy pepper sauce. The new items coincide with the 50th anniversary of the Egg McMuffin, a McDonald's staple that consists of egg, cheese and Canadian bacon on an English muffin.",
      "\"Limited-time offerings are always something in the toolkit for quick service restaurants to drive traffic,\" Todd said.",
      "Other menu tweaks include a new home for the Daily Double, one of McDonald's burger offerings. The Daily Double will now be part of the the McValue deal, where it will be bundled with fries, Chicken McNuggets, and a small soft drink for $6 or $7, depending on the location.",
      "McDonald's has also upped its chicken offerings. In May, the chain launched a new item called McCrispy Strips nationwide, the first time since 2021 McDonald's debuted a new permanent menu item in the U.S, according to a company\u00a0statement.",
      "Todd said McDonald's and other industry players are emphasizing chicken meals given its popularity and that it is significantly cheaper than beef, which rose to record prices in May.",
      "\"We've been seeing tons of chicken offerings, and just chicken... in general being very successful,\" he said.",

      "Yaccarino joined X in June 2023, shortly after billionaire Elon Musk bought the site\u00a0for $44 billion. Her decision to step down came after \"two incredible years\" at the company, she said in a farewell note posted on X.",
      "\"When @elonmusk and I first spoke of his vision for X, I knew it would be the opportunity of a lifetime to carry out the extraordinary mission of this company,\" Yaccarino wrote. \"I'm immensely grateful to him for entrusting me with the responsibility of protecting free speech, turning the company around, and transforming X into the Everything App.\"",
      "In her note, Yaccarino also talked about accomplishments made under her tenure at the company and nodded to the platform's future with xAI, Musk's artificial intelligence company.",
      "\"Now, the best is yet to come as X enters a new chapter with\u00a0@xai,\" she wrote.",

      "Musk tapped Yaccarino to replace him as CEO of the company in May 2023. \"Looking forward to working with Linda to transform this platform into X, the everything app,\" he posted on X at the time.",
      "After joining X in 2023, Yaccarino was immediately tasked with boosting ad revenue \u2014 not an easy feat after many big brands pulled back on spending following Musk's October 2022 takeover of the platform. Apple, Coca-Cola and Disney all removed paid ads\u00a0from X that year.",
      "By January 2024, the company's market value had plunged over 70% compared to when Musk purchased the platform, according to one Wall Street estimate.",
      "Yet X's prospects appeared to be improving under Yaccarino's leadership. Both Amazon and Apple announced they would rejoin the platform earlier this year.",
      "Before taking the helm at X, Yaccarino spent over a decade at NBCUniversal, where she served as chair of global advertising. During her tenure at NBC, her team generated $100 billion in ad sales, while she also helped launch the company's ad-supported streaming service, Peacock.",

If not for a $4.5 billion charge that Nvidia absorbed to account for the U.S. government's restrictions on its chip sales to China, Nvidia would have made 96 cents per share, far above the 73 cents per share envisioned by analysts.",
      "Nvidia reports its second-quarter results next month. Wall Street is expecting another quarter of record sales and profit for the Santa Clara, California, company.",
      "Nvidia and other companies benefiting from the AI boom have been a major reason the S&P 500 has climbed to record after record recently. Their explosion of profits has helped to propel the market despite worries about stubbornly high inflation and possible pain coming for the U.S. economy from tariffs and other policies of President Donald Trump.",

      "Meta\u00a0has removed paid advertisements for channels on the\u00a0Telegram\u00a0messaging app that promoted escort and sex work services in the U.S. and other countries from its Instagram platform.",
      "CBS News found multiple paid advertisements on Meta's Instagram stories feature that promoted opportunities to meet women alongside URL links that led to the Telegram platform. Several such ads were promoted by an Instagram account with over 100,000 followers called Royal Garden Club that marketed itself as a \"premium dating agency for wealthy men\" alongside a link to both a website and a Telegram channel.",
      "Meta spokesperson Erin Logan told CBS News the company had removed the accounts associated with the advertisements and disabled the ad accounts for violating Meta's content moderation policies.",
      "Meta also confirmed to CBS News that it had banned the administrators of the ad accounts from advertising on the company's social media platforms.",
      "Logan pointed to the company's human exploitation policy, which includes removing \"content where a third-party actor recruits for, facilitates or benefits from commercial sexual activity,\" as well as the company's adult sexual solicitation policy which, amongst other things, removes \"content that offers, asks or provides methods of contact for prostitution.\"",
      "Royal Garden Club's Telegram channel explicitly offered potential clients access to \"over 7,000 girls worldwide for fun dates, relationships and hot sex.\" That included advertising a \"VIP lifetime\" offer of $8,000 of \"top models, bloggers, actresses, athletes, magazine cover girls, adult stars.\"",
      "Royal Garden Club claimed on its Telegram that it is a \"full-service escort agency operating legally,\" pointing to the fact that the business, R GARDEN LLP, is registered in the United Kingdom. A CBS News review of public business records in the U.K. found the company R GARDEN LLP registered to a London address.",
      "Reached on Telegram, an anonymous moderator for the Royal Garden Club channel declined to comment when asked how it was able to promote ads on Instagram, and what type of service the company offers.",
      "Another paid Instagram ad was promoted by an account called men.s_dreams, which appeared to be a shell account with very little content and very few followers. That advertisement promoted \"meeting beautiful girls\" and included a link to a Telegram channel. The Telegram channel in question, called \"Meeting with Girls,\" had messages written in both Russian and English promoting \"girls ready to fly with you anywhere in the world.\"",
      "That channel posted profile pictures of hundreds of women and noted their nationalities. CBS News could not independently verify the identity of the women, nor verify if they had consented to their images being shared by the channel. The anonymous moderator of the account repeatedly posted messages on the public channel asking prospective clients to send private messages if they wanted to \"know something about girls, sex or anything.\"",
      "CBS News has also sought comment from this account about how it was able to pay for ads on Instagram.",
      "While Meta has strict content moderation policies, Telegram is known for its hands-off approach. The platform's content moderation policies outlined on its website do not include anything beyond banning \"illegal pornographic content on publicly viewable Telegram channels,\" or engaging in \"activities that are recognized as illegal in the majority of countries.\" CBS News has sought comment from Telegram as to whether the channels in question violate the platform's policies or will cause Telegram to review its policies.",
      "In recent months, Meta has struggled to combat a rise in sexualized paid advertisements appearing for some users, despite such ads violating its terms of use. A CBS News investigation last month\u00a0uncovered hundreds of ads\u00a0on its platforms promoting \"nudify\" apps \u2014 AI tools used to create sexually explicit deepfake images of real people.",
      "Many of these ads targeted male users between the ages of 18 and 65, in the United States and the European Union.",

      "He announced the tariffs on two of the United States' biggest trade partners in letters posted on this Truth Social account.",
      "In his letter to Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, Mr. Trump acknowledged that the country has helped stem the flow of undocumented migrants and fentanyl into the U.S. But he said the country has not done enough to stop North America from turning into a \"Narco-Trafficking Playground.\"",
      "\"Mexico has been helping me secure the border, BUT, what Mexico has done, is not enough,\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "The Mexican economy and foreign ministries, in a joint statement on Saturday, said they had been informed of the new tariffs during a meeting in Washington, D.C. on Friday.",
      "\"We mentioned at the table that it was an unfair deal and that we did not agree,\" the statement said.",
      "Following Mr. Trump's announcement, Sheinbaum asserted that the sovereignty of the Mexican people is non-negotiable, saying the tariff is \"for all the countries in the world, each one of them is being sent a letter.\"",
      "The Mexican president said the two countries are \"seeking to reach an agreement so that these tariffs do not exist.\"",
      "In his letter to the European Union, Mr. Trump said the relationship between the bloc and the U.S. has been \"far from Reciprocal,\" and that the U.S. trade deficit was a national security threat.",
      "\"We have had years to discuss our Trading Relationship with The European Union, and have concluded that we must move away from these long-term, large, and persistent Trade Deficits, engendered by your Tariff, and Non-Tariff, Policies and Trade Barriers,\" he wrote.",
      "Mr. Trump is in an announcement blitz of new tariffs with allies and foes alike, a bedrock of his 2024 campaign that he said would set the foundation for reviving a U.S. economy that he claims has been ripped off by other nations for decades.",
      "With the reciprocal tariffs, Mr. Trump is effectively blowing up the rules governing world trade. For decades, the U.S. and most other countries abided by tariff rates set through a series of complex negotiations known as the Uruguay Round. Countries could set their own tariffs \u2013 but under the \"most favored nation'' approach, they couldn't charge one country more than they charged another.",
      "\"Our smaller trading partners could become much bigger trading partners,\"\u00a0White House National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"\u00a0\"And that's, I think, one of the reasons why countries are racing to set deals up with us ahead of the deadline.\"",
      "The European Union's chief trade negotiator said earlier this week that a trade deal to avert higher tariffs on European goods imported to the U.S. could be reached \"even in the coming days.\" Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d told EU lawmakers in Strasbourg, France on Wednesday that the EU had been spared the increased tariffs contained in the letters Mr. Trump sent on Monday, and that an extension of talks would provide \"additional space to reach a satisfactory conclusion.\"",
      "The bloc collectively sells more to the U.S. than any other country. U.S. goods imports from the EU topped $553 billion in 2022, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.",
      "Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, acknowledged Mr. Trump's letter and said in a statement on Saturday that imposing the tariffs on EU exports would \"disrupt essential transatlantic supply chains, to the detriment of businesses, consumers and patients on both sides of the Atlantic.\"",
      "\"Few economies in the world match the European Union's level of openness and adherence to fair trading practices. The EU has consistently prioritized a negotiated solution with the U.S., reflecting our commitment to dialogue, stability, and a constructive transatlantic partnership,\" she added. \"We remain ready to continue working towards an agreement by August 1. At the same time, we will take all necessary steps to safeguard EU interests, including the adoption of proportionate countermeasures if required.\"",
      "Steeper tariffs\u00a0that Mr. Trump announced on April 2 threatened to overhaul the global economy and lead to broader trade wars. A week later, after the\u00a0financial markets had panicked, his administration suspended for 90 days most of the higher taxes on imports just as they were to take effect, but he kept the 10% baseline in place while raising the tariff rate on goods imported from China. Chinese goods are now subject to 30% across-the-board tariffs. The freeze expired on Wednesday.",

      "The two have criticized each other publicly for years, an often bitter back-and-forth that predates Mr. Trump's involvement in politics. In recent days, O'Donnell on social media denounced Mr. Trump and recent moves by his administration, including the signing of a massive GOP-backed tax breaks and spending cuts plan.",
      "Responding to Mr. Trump Saturday, O'Donnell wrote on social media that she had upset the president and to \"add me to the list of people who oppose him at every turn.\"",
      "O'Donnell wrote that Mr. Trump \"has always hated the fact that i see him for who he is - a criminal con man sexual abusing liar out to harm our nation to serve himself - this is why i moved to ireland.\"",
      "O'Donnell moved to Ireland after Mr. Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris to win his second term. She has said she's in the process of obtaining Irish citizenship based on family lineage.",
      "It's just the latest threat by Mr. Trump to revoke the citizenship of people with whom he has publicly disagreed, most recently his former adviser and one-time ally, Elon Musk.",
      "But O'Donnell's situation is notably different from Musk, who was born in South Africa. O'Donnell was born in the U.S. and has a constitutional right to U.S. citizenship. The U.S. State Department notes on its website that U.S. citizens by birth or naturalization may relinquish U.S. nationality by taking certain steps \u2013 but only if the act is performed voluntary and with the intention of relinquishing U.S. citizenship.",
      "Since taking office again in January, Mr. Trump has sought to limit paths to citizenship and access to green cards. On Thursday, a federal judge issued a nationwide block against Mr. Trump's executive order\u00a0ending birthright citizenship.",
      "Amanda Frost, a law professor at the University of Virginia School of Law, noted the Supreme Court ruled in a 1967 case that the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution prevents the government from taking away citizenship.",

      "The firings, one source familiar with the terminations said, included more than 20 people who worked on former Special Counsel Jack Smith's classified documents case against Mr. Trump and Smith's investigation into Mr. Trump's attempts to overturn election results in 2020.",
      "There have been at least 35 firings of Justice Department employees who worked for Smith on the two investigations he oversaw, and at least 15 more could be fired, the source said.",

      "The staffers were identified by the Justice Department's so-called \"weaponization working group\" which Attorney General Pam Bondi established as one of her first priorities after she was confirmed, one source said.",
      "The attorney general established the \"weaponization working group\" to review Biden administration law enforcement policies, according to the source. The group is reviewing the two federal cases against Mr. Trump pursued by former special counsel Smith and is examining prosecutions of rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. It is also reviewing the Trump legal cases in New York \u2014 the \"hush money\" trial pursued by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and the civil enforcement action against the Trump Organization brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James \u2014 neither of which involved federal prosecutors.",
      "As the Justice Department began collecting information about the FBI agents who worked on Jan. 6 investigations and fired career prosecutors who worked on the cases, Bondi said in her directive that the working group would investigate \"improper investigative tactics and unethical prosecutions\" versus \"good faith actions by federal employees simply following orders.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The State Department on Friday began laying off more than 1,300 staffers as it seeks to cut the size of its U.S. workforce by about 15%, part of the Trump administration's sweeping plan to reorganize the department.",
      "The involuntary staff reductions include 1,107 civil service and 246 foreign service employees, according to a notice sent to State Department employees Friday morning that was obtained by CBS News. The total number of staff departing as a part of the State Department's reorganization is \"nearly 3,000,\" according to the department, a figure that includes those who took the \"Fork in the Road\" voluntary departure offer earlier this year.",
      "The department is also closing or merging scores of U.S.-based offices and rearranging its organizational chart shortly after. The layoffs, called a reduction-in-force, or RIF, have been expected for months. Officials sent a reorganization plan to Congress in March, signaling the cuts. The Trump administration says the cuts are necessary to remove redundant offices and focus the department on its core responsibilities.",
      "Critics argue the cuts could undermine the State Department's work. All Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee penned a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday denouncing the RIFs.",
      "\"During a time of increasingly complex and wide-spread challenges to U.S. national security, this administration should be strengthening our diplomatic corps\u2014an irreplaceable instrument of U.S. power and leadership\u2014not weakening it,\" the senators wrote. \"However, RIFs would severely undermine the Department's ability to achieve U.S. foreign policy interests, putting our nation's security, strength, and prosperity at risk.\"",
      "Foreign service officers who received RIF notices will be separated in 120 days, the notice sent to employees said, while civil service officers will be separated in 60 days.",
      "The long-planned layoffs are taking place days after the Supreme Court cleared the way for the Trump administration's sweeping plans to slash the size of the government workforce, pausing a lower court order that halted layoff plans at dozens of federal agencies.",
      "Department staff were informed of the impending reduction-in-force plans in a Thursday afternoon message from Deputy Secretary of State Michael Rigas, who thanked departing staff \"for their dedication and service to the United States.\" Two sources familiar with the matter said RIF notices started going out to affected employees on a rolling basis on Friday morning. The department previously told reporters it plans to conduct the reductions-in-force over the course of a single day.",
      "Some employees were told that due to the anticipated RIF, they would not be permitted to telework on Friday, and should report to work with all department-issued equipment, including laptops, telephones, diplomatic passports, travel cards and any other property owned by the State Department. An email with these instructions told staff that badges would be collected during \"out processing,\" and to ensure that any personal items be collected before that time.",
      "Signs were spotted in some State Department bathrooms Friday urging remaining staff to \"resist fascism\" and \"remember the oath you vowed to uphold.\"",
      "Layoffs hit human rights, refugee-focused departments",
      "Many of the reductions-in-force hit offices that were slated for elimination or cuts, including ones that focus on refugees, human rights and foreign assistance.",
      "The cuts included nearly all civil service officers in the Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration's office of admissions, which handles the program that resettles refugees in the U.S., according to two sources familiar. The move came as a surprise to staffers because the office had been handling a program to resettle Afrikaners from South Africa, a White House priority.",
      "The Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor's entire global programs office, which handles foreign assistance, was also let go. The office has 391 active grants, a source told CBS News. Staff were not told what will happen to those programs, but a source notes the money was already congressionally mandated. The bureau's office of multilateral and global affairs was also eliminated.",

In a press release, the organization says that among those affected by the RIFs was a woman who gave birth to her first child just 12 hours before receiving the news.",
      "One laid-off employee was Jose Mercado, who had worked at the agency for 29 years and served as deputy director of the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor's office of western hemisphere affairs. He told CBS News it was a \"sad day for foreign policy.\"",
      "\"It's a sad day for human rights in the world. This did not make us stronger, this made us weaker,\" Mercado said. \"We will come back. We will improve. This is going to be better. But right now, we're not in the best position when it comes to foreign policy.\"",
      "Members of the Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs faced reductions-in-force, including press officers, two sources familiar told CBS News.",
      "And an office that handled organizing Rubio's trip to Malaysia for the ASEAN Summit was eliminated, with its Civil Service employees receiving reduction-in-force notices \u2014 as the secretary was en route back from the summit. That department is the office of multilateral affairs in the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, according to two sources familiar.",
      "Sweeping State Department reorganization",
      "After the reduction-in-force notices go out, the agency will move into a \"transition period of several weeks\" to phase in the new organization chart, a senior State Department official told reporters on Thursday.",
      "The official said the changes are aimed at \"streamlining this bloated bureaucracy,\" cutting redundant departments, consolidating functions like human resources and finance, and shifting more focus to foreign embassies and offices assigned to handle specific regions.",
      "For example, the official said, the State Department has multiple offices that oversee sanctions.",
      "\"Now, no one's saying that the people who were working in any of those sanctions offices weren't doing a good job or weren't valuable members of the State Department family, but at the end of the day, we have to do what's right for the mission and what's right for the American people, and that means having one combined sanctions office,\" the official said.",
      "The department's Political Affairs bureau \u2014 which includes the country-specific desks that handle the United States' relations with individual nations and regions \u2014 is \"largely unaffected by the reductions,\" according to the official.",
      "Another senior State Department official told reporters the department \"identified offices where natural efficiencies could be found.\"",
      "\"We took a very deliberate step to reorganize the State Department to be more efficient and more focused,\" Rubio told reporters during a trip to Malaysia on Thursday.",
      "The State Department formally told lawmakers\u00a0in May that it intended to eliminate about 3,400 U.S.-based jobs and close or merge almost half of its domestic offices. At the time, the department said it planned to phase out some offices focused on democracy or human rights that it claimed were \"prone to ideological capture,\" and add new offices focused on \"civil liberties\" and \"free market principles.\"",
      "The plan also integrates the previous functions of the U.S. Agency for International Development into the State Department, after the Trump administration moved to shutter the foreign aid agency. That move has drawn stiff criticism, with Democrats arguing the agency was unlawfully shut down without permission from Congress and humanitarian groups warning the shutdown could endanger public health.",
      "Democrats \u2014 and department staff \u2014 push back",
      "The broader cuts to the State Department have drawn pushback from Democratic lawmakers, who argue the moves could undermine American diplomatic efforts.",
      "\"The notion that it's a plan dignifies it. It's just a willy-nilly effort to just sack a whole lot of people,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, told reporters Friday.",
      "Many department staff have also expressed alarm at the changes. The American Foreign Service Association, which represents foreign service officers in the U.S. and abroad, said Friday the layoffs are \"untethered from merit or mission\" and could signal to other countries that \"the United States is pulling back from the world stage.\"",
      "\"They target diplomats not for how they've served or the skills they have, but for where they happen to be assigned. That is not reform,\" the association said in a statement Friday.",
      "For foreign service officers, who typically rotate between assignments every few years, the reductions-in-force are based on whether they worked in an office impacted by the reorganization on May 29, one of the two senior State Department officials told reporters Thursday.",
      "A current State Department employee told CBS News there are people who were in these positions six weeks ago but have since moved on to new assignments. \"So why would you punish them for previously having held a job that they're no longer in?\" they said. \"It makes absolutely no sense.\"",
      "The second senior State Department official told reporters, \"we've tried to do this in an anonymized, functional way.\"",
      "\"Some of these are positions that are being eliminated, not people,\" Rubio said Thursday.",
      "The first senior department official also said, \"We're going to work to handle this in a manner that preserves, to the maximum extent possible, the dignity of federal employees.\"",

      "The sources indicated the new funding could be intended to send a message to Russia, which has pounded Ukraine with drone and missile attacks in recent days. Russia this week launched what Ukraine described as the largest drone attack since its full-scale invasion began in February 2022 \u2014 the latest in a wave of aerial assaults that have pummeled Kyiv and other cities.",
      "Mr. Trump hinted earlier this week that he planned to send Ukraine more defensive weapons. Just days earlier, his administration paused some arms shipments \u2014 a move one White House official cast as one part of a wider global review of weapons transfers.",
      "The source of the possible new funding for Ukraine is unclear. But U.S. officials told CBS News Mr. Trump has $3.85 billion in leftover Biden-era presidential drawdown authority sitting at his fingertips, which could be used to send American military equipment to Ukraine. Former officials also told CBS News the president has the authority to seize around $5 billion in foreign Russian assets and direct the funds to Ukraine, though neither he, nor former President Joe Biden have used that power.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment.",
      "The U.S. has sent tens of billions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine since early 2022. Mr. Trump has previously been critical of that spending, and has pressed Ukraine and Russia to work toward a peace agreement \u2014 periodically lashing out at both countries.",
      "In recent days, Russia has drawn the president's ire. He told reporters last week he was \"very disappointed\" with a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and he later suggested that Russia's strikes on Ukraine could prompt him to send more arms to Ukraine.",
      "\"Putin is not treating human beings right. He's killing too many people,\" Mr. Trump told reporters during a Cabinet meeting Tuesday. \"So we're sending some defensive weapons to Ukraine, and I've approved that.\"",
      "At other points, Mr. Trump has attacked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. A February Oval Office meeting with the Ukrainian leader descended into a verbal argument, leading to a brief pause on U.S. aid, and Mr. Trump has accused Zelenskyy of prolonging the war.",
      "Trump says \"NATO is paying\" for Ukraine aid",

That would mark a dramatic shift in policy since, in the past, NATO as an institution has not directly armed non-member state Ukraine. Instead, individual members of the alliance have chosen to assist Ukraine on their own.",

In the past, Mr. Trump had said he doesn't plan on trying to fire Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends next year.",
      "Vought's letter took aim at Powell and the central bank over its years-long office renovation project in Washington, D.C. The letter said plans for the project \"called for rooftop terrace gardens, VIP private dining rooms and elevators, water features, premium marble, and much more.\" Vought also asked whether the Fed has made changes to its plans without seeking approval from a government commission that oversees D.C.-area federal building projects.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Federal Reserve for comment.",
      "In testimony to the Senate last month, Powell called some descriptions of the renovation project \"misleading and inaccurate.\" He told lawmakers there isn't any new marble aside from what's necessary to replace broken old marble, and said there are no \"special elevators,\" new water features or rooftop gardens.",
      "\"All of the sort of inflammatory things that the media carried are either not in the current plan or just inaccurate,\" Powell said.",
      "Vought's letter argued that comment to the Senate \"appears to reveal that the project is out of compliance with the approved plan,\" suggesting the Fed may have run afoul of a law requiring D.C.-area projects be approved by the National Capital Planning Commission. In a post on X, the Office of Management and Budget alleged Powell \"slipped up and revealed he might...be violating the law.\" The Fed's renovation plans were reviewed by the commission several years ago.",
      "The Fed typically operates with a much higher degree of independence than most other government institutions. Federal law gives the Fed the power to make decisions about acquiring and remodeling buildings in Washington to serve as its office spaces.",
      "The Fed has previously acknowledged\u00a0that the price tag for its office renovations had jumped due to \"significant increases in raw materials costs,\" along with higher labor costs.",
      "On its website, the Fed says the two headquarters buildings that are getting overhauled \"have not been comprehensively renovated since their construction in the 1930s.\" The central bank said there are no private elevators or new VIP dining rooms \u2014 instead, the project will refurbish old elevators and conference rooms, including ones that are sometimes \"used for mealtime meetings.\" It also said plans for new water features were scrapped, though existing fountains will be repaired, and the garden terrace is actually a \"ground-level front lawn.\"",
      "Last week, Bill Pulte, the Trump-nominated head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, accused Powell of \"deceptive\" testimony to the Senate about the office project.",
      "Asked about the allegation in a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, Mr. Trump said: \"Then he should resign immediately. We should get somebody in it that's going to lower interest rates.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 19:57:14 -0400",
    "summary": "Canada \u2014 one of the U.S.'s largest trading partners \u2014 will face 35% tariffs, President Trump said Thursday.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday threatened to impose 35% tariffs on goods from Canada starting next month, hiking import duties on one of the U.S.'s largest trading partners.",
      "The president announced the 35% tax in a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney posted to Truth Social, citing Canada's alleged \"failure to stop the drugs from pouring into our country,\" as well as retaliatory tariffs Canada has imposed on U.S. goods. The new tariffs are set to take effect Aug. 1, the president said.",
      "The move is an escalation from the 25% tariffs on Canadian \u2014 and Mexican \u2014 imports announced by Mr. Trump shortly after taking office. He later exempted goods covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement, which was negotiated during Mr. Trump's first term. It's unclear whether the same exemption will apply to next month's 35% tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump has sent similar letters to the leaders of more than 20 other countries this week, telling them to expect higher tariffs starting next month. He told NBC News' Kristen Welker on Thursday, \"all of the remaining countries\" will likely face tariffs of 15% to 20% \u2014 higher than the baseline 10% rate that's currently applied to all countries.",
      "But Canada is the largest American trading partner to receive a letter so far. Canada was the world's largest buyer of American goods and the third-largest seller of goods to the U.S. last year, according to Census Bureau data. The country bought some $350 billion worth of American goods and sold $412 billion to the U.S. market in 2024.",
      "Mr. Trump's letter to Carney says he will \"consider an adjustment to this letter\" if \"Canada works with me to stop the flow of Fentanyl.\" For months, the president has cast tariffs against Canada and Mexico as a way of getting the U.S.'s two neighbors to stem illegal immigration and fentanyl trafficking, though very little fentanyl appears to enter the U.S. via Canada. Just 43 pounds were seized at the Canadian border last year, compared to 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border.",
      "\"Throughout the current trade negotiations with the United States, the Canadian government has steadfastly defended our workers and businesses,\" Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney wrote in a social media post late Thursday night. \"We will continue to do so as we work towards the revised deadline of August 1. Canada has made vital progress to stop the scourge of fentanyl in North America. We are committed to continuing to work with the United States to save lives and protect communities in both our countries.\"",
      "The president also assailed Canada for \"retaliat[ing] with its own Tariffs.\" And he said Canada has imposed other barriers on U.S. imports.",
      "Mr. Trump has held on-and-off discussions with Canada for months, but his relationship with the United States' northern neighbor has occasionally been rocky, with U.S. tariffs drawing retaliatory duties from Canada. The president\u00a0briefly called off all trade talks\u00a0with Canada last month due to a planned digital services tax that could hit U.S. tech companies, but the talks\u00a0resumed days later\u00a0after Carney rescinded the tax.",
      "Mr. Trump has also\u00a0repeatedly mused about annexing Canada, and Carney's party won this year's parliamentary elections after the prime minister ran on a platform\u00a0of defending Canada from the Trump administration's ambitions.",
      "Trump boosts tariffs on dozens of countries",
      "The president is sending out this week's spate of tariff letters about three months after first unveiling \"reciprocal tariffs\" against dozens of countries on \"Liberation Day\" in early April, along with a 10% tariff on everybody else. The move unnerved financial markets and sparked recession and inflation fears, and Mr. Trump quickly suspended most of the duties for 90 days \u2014 aside from the 10% baseline rate \u2014 saying he planned to negotiate trade deals.",
      "With that 90-day pause set to expire this week, Mr. Trump began sending out letters to dozens of trading partners from Japan to South Africa informing them of their planned tariffs. The U.S. has trade deficits with most countries that received Mr. Trump's letters, though Brazil was also threatened with a 50% tariff despite the U.S. running a trade surplus. The letter cited the prosecution of right-wing former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, which Mr. Trump called a \"Witch Hunt.\"",
      "On top of country-specific tariffs, the president has also imposed hefty \"sectoral\" tariffs on foreign steel, copper and other specific categories of goods.",
      "Mr. Trump says the tariffs are necessary to revive American manufacturing and correct trade imbalances. But many economists warn that tariffs lead to higher consumer prices and slower economic growth. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has said concerns about tariffs are partly to blame for the central bank's decision not to cut interest rates so far this year.",
      "Still, the president has stood by his trade strategy.",
      "\"I think the tariffs have been very well-received,\" Mr. Trump told NBC News on Thursday. \"The stock market hit a new high today.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Emil Bove, a top Justice Department official who previously served as President Trump's criminal defense attorney, declined to rule out the possibility of the president running for a third term and did not denounce the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol in a questionnaire submitted to a Senate panel considering his nomination for a lifetime appointment as a federal judge.",
      "The Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to vote next week on whether to advance Bove's nomination to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit. CBS News obtained the 165-page questionnaire that Bove submitted to senators in response to their written questions.",
      "In his answers, Bove also wrote he does not recall which Jan. 6 criminal cases he helped supervise when he served in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. In response to the question \"Do you denounce the January 6 insurrection?\" Bove wrote: \"The characterization of the events on January 6 is a matter of significant political debate,\" and said it would be \"inappropriate to address this question\" given ongoing litigation over pardons of Jan. 6 defendants.",
      "Bove, who helped defend Mr. Trump in his felony trial in New York in 2023, has been a lightning rod for Democrats who have accused him of politically weaponizing his role at the Justice Department this year to pursue the president's goals. Bove has served as principal associate deputy attorney general since Mr. Trump returned to the White House in January, and was a federal prosecutor in New York from 2012 to 2021.",
      "In the Senate questionnaire, Bove argued his role in shuttering the corruption prosecution of New York Mayor Eric Adams earlier this year has been mischaracterized. Bove was accused of pushing a quid pro quo in which the Justice Department would drop its criminal case against Adams in return for the mayor supporting Mr. Trump's immigration policies. Several prosecutors and Justice Department officials resigned in the fallout of Bove's order to drop the case.",
      "Bove told senators that the decision to seek to drop the charges against Adams was \"well within the scope of prosecutorial discretion\" and that Adams' own court submissions and statements \"refute false public allegations by third parties regarding some sort of improper quid pro quo.\"",
      "Bove was also accused of pressuring Justice Department employees to support the effort or face possible employment actions, an accusation he disputed in the questionnaire. \"It was never my intention to coerce, pressure, or induce any DOJ attorney \u2014 through adverse employment actions, threats, rewards, or otherwise \u2014 to sign the motion to dismiss the charges against Mayor Adams,\" he wrote.",
      "Multiple Democratic senators pressed Bove in their questionnaire to clarify if Bove believes the Constitution permits Mr. Trump to run for a third term, despite the restrictions of the 22nd Amendment, which states that \"No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.\"",
      "\"As a nominee to the Third Circuit, it would not be appropriate for me to address how this Amendment would apply in an abstract hypothetical scenario,\" Bove responded on multiple occasions. \"To the extent this question seeks to elicit an answer that could be taken as opining on the broader political or policy debate regarding term limits, or on statements by any political figure, my response, consistent with the positions of prior judicial nominees, is that it would be improper to offer any such comment as a judicial nominee.\"",
      "When asked whether President Biden was duly elected in the 2020 election, Bove responded, \"President Biden was certified as the winner of the 2020 presidential election and served as the 46th President of the United States,\" adding that it \"would be improper\" for him to opine on \"the broader political or policy debate regarding the conduct of the 2020 presidential election or on statements by any political figure.\"",
      "Bove wrote that he does not recall where he was on Jan. 6, 2021, but that he was not in Washington. He declined to answer if he would characterize the Capitol siege as an \"insurrection.\"",
      "He also acknowledged that he provided Mr. Trump with legal advice about his pardons of those involved in the attack. When asked if he supported the pardons of violent Jan. 6 attackers, Bove wrote, \"As I explained at my confirmation hearing, it would not be appropriate for me, as a nominee, to comment on President Trump's use of the pardon authority.\"",
      "Bove's responses noted his prior legal work as Trump's defense lawyer, a role shared by Deputy U.S. Attorney General Todd Blanche. Bove wrote that the legal team \"typically charged President Trump a discounted rate of $650 per hour for services by myself and Mr. Blanche.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Justice Department for comment on the questionnaire. In an earlier statement to CBS News, White House spokesman Harrison Fields championed Bove's qualifications for the lifetime appointment to the circuit court.",
      "\"Emil Bove is an incredibly talented legal mind and a staunch defender of the U.S. Constitution who will make an excellent circuit court judge,\" Fields said. \"Bove is unquestionably qualified for the role and has a career filled with accolades, both academically and throughout his legal career, that should make him a shoo-in for the Third Circuit. The President is committed to nominating constitutionalists to the bench who will restore law and order and end the weaponization of the justice system, and Emil Bove fits that mold perfectly.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 15:28:42 -0400",
    "summary": "The decision undoes an attempt to wrap up more than two decades of military prosecution beset by legal and logistical troubles.",
    "story": [
      "A divided federal appeals court on Friday threw out an agreement that would have allowed accused Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed\u00a0to plead guilty in a deal sparing him the risk of execution for al Qaeda's 2001 attacks.",
      "The decision by a panel of the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., undoes an attempt to wrap up more than two decades of military prosecution beset by legal and logistical troubles. It signals there will be no quick end to the long struggle by the U.S. military and successive administrations to bring to justice the man charged with planning one of the deadliest attacks ever on the United States.",
      "The deal, negotiated over two years and approved by military prosecutors and the Pentagon's senior official for Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, a year ago, stipulated life sentences without parole for Mohammed and two co-defendants.",
      "Mohammed is accused of developing and directing the plot to crash hijacked airliners into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Another of the hijacked planes flew into a field in Pennsylvania.",
      "Relatives of the Sept. 11 victims were split on the plea deal. Some objected to it, saying a trial was the best path to justice and to gaining more information about the attacks, while others saw it as the best hope for bringing the painful case to a conclusion and getting some answers from the defendants.",
      "The plea deal would have obligated the men to answer any lingering questions that families of the victims have about the attacks.",
      "But then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin repudiated the deal, saying a decision on the death penalty in an attack as grave as Sept. 11 should only be made by the defense secretary.",
      "\"The Secretary of Defense indisputably had legal authority to withdraw from the agreements; the plain and unambiguous text of the pretrial agreements shows that no performance of promises had begun,\" Friday's decision reads in part.",
      "In January, the U.S. Justice Department filed a\u00a0motion\u00a0seeking to stop the plea deal.",
      "\"The allegations against the respondents set forth their extensive roles as the counselors, commanders, and conspirators in the murder of 2,976 people, the injury of numerous civilians and military personnel, and the destruction of property worth tens of billions of dollars,\" the filing said, arguing later that \"this Court should issue a writ of mandamus and prohibition to the military commission directing it to recognize that the Secretary validly withdrew from the pretrial agreements with the respondents and prohibiting the military commission from conducting hearings in which the respondents would enter guilty pleas pursuant to the invalid pretrial agreements.\"",
      "Attorneys for the defendants had argued that the agreement was already legally in effect and that Austin, who served under President Joe Biden, acted too late to try to throw it out. A military judge at Guantanamo and a military appeals panel agreed with the defense lawyers.",
      "But, by a 2-1 vote, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found Austin acted within his authority and faulted the military judge's ruling.",
      "The panel had previously put the agreement on hold while it considered the appeal, first filed by the Biden administration and then continued under President Trump.",
      "\"Having properly assumed the convening authority, the Secretary determined that the 'families and the American public deserve the opportunity to see military commission trials carried out.' The Secretary acted within the bounds of his legal authority, and we decline to second-guess his judgment,\" Judges Patricia Millett and Neomi Rao wrote.",
      "Millett was an appointee of President Barack Obama, while Rao was appointed by Mr. Trump.",
      "In a dissent, Judge Robert Wilkins, an Obama appointee, wrote, \"The government has not come within a country mile of proving clearly and indisputably that the Military Judge erred.\"",
      "Brett Eagleson, who was among the family members who objected to the deal, called Friday's appellate ruling \"a good win, for now.\"",
      "\"A plea deal allows this to be tucked away into a nice, pretty package, wrapped into a bow and put on a shelf and forgotten about,\" said Eagleson, who was 15 when his father, shopping center executive John Bruce Eagleson, was killed in the attacks.",
      "Brett Eagleson was unmoved by the deal's provisions for the defendants to answer Sept. 11 families' questions; he wonders how truthful the men would be. In his view, \"the only valid way to get answers and seek the truth is through a trial\" and pretrial fact-finding.",
      "Elizabeth Miller, who was 6 when the attacks killed her father, firefighter Douglas Miller, was among those who supported the deal.",
      "\"Of course, growing up, a trial would have been great initially,\" she said. But \"we're in 2025, and we're still at the pretrial stage.\"",
      "\"I just really don't think a trial is possible,\" said Miller, who also favored the deal because of her opposition to the death penalty in general.",
      "The legal advocacy group Center for Constitutional Rights criticized the decision, saying that without the plea agreements, the case will never be resolved.",
      "\"This decision will ensure nothing but a continued lack of justice and accountability for everyone involved in the 9/11 military trial at Guant\u00e1namo,\" attorney Wells Dixon said in a statement.",

    "summary": "A memo from the Justice Department and FBI said that a systematic review of the case involving Jeffrey Epstein \"revealed no incriminating 'client list.'\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A Justice Department and FBI review of the investigation related to disgraced late financier Jeffrey Epstein found that there was no \"client list\" or evidence that he blackmailed prominent figures, according to a memo detailing the findings.",
      "The review also concluded that Epstein died by suicide while in custody at a Manhattan correctional facility in August 2019. Epstein was facing federal sex trafficking charges, and his death was subsequently investigated by the Justice Department's internal watchdog and the FBI.",
      "The Justice Department and FBI said in their memo that video footage reviewed by bureau investigators\u00a0 \u2014 and made available to the public \u2014 confirmed that Epstein was locked in his cell and nobody entered tiers of the unit where he was housed at the time of his death.",
      "Investigators also \"did not uncover evidence that could predicate any investigation against uncharged third parties,\" according to the memo.",
      "\"This systematic review revealed no incriminating 'client list.' There was also no credible evidence found that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions,\" the Justice Department and FBI said in their two-page document detailing the conclusions.",
      "Axios was first to report the memo with the Justice Department's findings.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI leaders had pledged to release information about Epstein after President Trump returned to the White House earlier this year. Files related to Epstein's case, as well as the circumstances surrounding his death, have been the subject of conspiracy theories for years. Among the speculation about the records involving Epstein was that the federal government was concealing information to shield powerful and prominent figures who were allegedly named in them.",
      "While Bondi suggested during a Fox News interview in February that a \"client list\" was sitting on her desk, the purported document never materialized.",
      "In February, a group of 15 right-wing social media influencers went to the White House and were given binders labeled \"The Epstein Files: Phase 1.\" The influencers said they received the binders from Bondi during a meeting that Mr. Trump, FBI Director Kash Patel and Vice President JD Vance also attended.",
      "But any hopes of new information were quickly dashed, as the social media figures said the binders contained documents that were already in the public domain. Bondi confirmed that the first tranche of declassified files largely contained records that were leaked but had not been made public by the federal government.",
      "Still, after Elon Musk and Mr. Trump had a falling out last month, the billionaire entrepreneur claimed that the administration had withheld the so-called Epstein files because the president was named in them. In response, Mr. Trump shared a social media post that rebuffed Musk's claim.",
      "The president told NBC News in an interview that any alleged links between him and Epstein were \"old news,\" and said he had not been friendly with the convicted sex offender for 18 years before his death.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the administration's approach to Epstein's case on Monday, telling reporters that it is \"committed to truth and to transparency.\"",
      "\"That's why the attorney general and the FBI director pledged, at the president's direction, to do an exhaustive review of all of the files related to Jeffrey Epstein's crimes and his death, and they put out a memo in conclusion of that review,\" she said. \"There was material they did not release, because, frankly, it was incredibly graphic and it contained child pornography, which is not something that's appropriate for public consumption. But they committed to an exhaustive investigation. That's what they did, and they provided the results of that.\"",
      "When asked about the \"client list\" that Bondi said was on her desk, Leavitt said the attorney general was referring to \"the entirety of all of the paperwork, all of the paper in relation to Jeffrey Epstein's crimes.\"",
      "The FBI and Justice Department said in their memo that the review confirmed that Epstein harmed more than 1,000 victims, each of whom suffered \"unique trauma.\"",
      "\"One of our highest priorities is combatting child exploitation and bringing justice to victims. Perpetuating unfounded theories about Epstein serves neither of those ends,\" the memo said.",
      "The Justice Department and FBI added that while they have \"labored to provide the public with maximum information\" about Epstein and examine evidence in the government's possession, they determined that \"no further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.\"",

    "summary": "Researchers were able to date the fossil of the flying reptile, a close cousin of dinosaurs, back to more than 209 million years ago.",
    "story": [
      "For paleontologist Ben Kligman, the question was: Is this fragile jawbone a pterosaur or not?",
      "Other researchers also had questions about the fossil, unearthed along with thousands of others during a decades-long archaeological dig at a remote bone bed in the Petrified Forest National Park\u00a0in Arizona. Some thought the bone could've been a mammal, Kligman told CBS News.",
      "Now, their new research offers insight into North America's oldest known flying reptile that Kligman and other paleontologists say was the size of a \"small seagull.\"",
      "The Smithsonian-led paper,\u00a0published Monday\u00a0in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal, details the new pterosaur fossil discovery along with several others, providing insight into the late Triassic period.",
      "Kligman remembers looking at the jawbone under a microscope at the Smithsonian \u2014 where he is a Peter Buck postdoctoral fellow and where the fossil had been sent \u2014 and running through his \"Rolodex\" of Triassic jaw anatomy, thinking about what species could have a similar jaw. He wanted to solve the mystery of where the delicate jawbone belonged.",
      "Through the process of elimination, and thinking of the features pterosaurs have that no other animal has, Kligman said he and other researchers were able to conclude that, \"Oh yeah, this is definitely a pterosaur \u2014 therefore, this is a very important discovery.\"",
      "The team named the pterosaur the Eotephradactylus mcintireae, which means \"ash-winged dawn goddess.\" The species name references its discoverer, Suzanne McIntire, who volunteered in the Smithsonian's FossiLab for 18 years.",
      "McIntire discovered the pterosaur fossil, which had been brought to the museum from the Petrified Forest National Park along with 1,200 other individual fossils, including bones, teeth, fish scales and coprolites, or fossilized excrement.",
      "Volunteers painstakingly clean each fossil, flag ones of interest and perform other fossil conservation tasks. McIntire unearthed the jawbone and noticed the teeth were still in the bone, making it easier to identify.",
      "The winged reptile \u2014 a close cousin of dinosaurs and the first animals after insects to evolve powered flight \u2014 would've been small enough to comfortably perch on a person's shoulder.",
      "\"It could've sat on your shoulder, like a small seagull,\" Kligman said of the species.",
      "Researchers were able to date the fossil back to 209.2 million years ago \u2014 an unusually precise date, Kligman said, because of the level of volcanic ash where the fossil was found. The finding helps fill in a gap in the fossil record that predates the end-Triassic extinction, he said. Very few pterosaur fossils exist, Kligman said. After their extinction, their fragile bones preserved poorly, so pterosaur fossils are frequently incomplete. They also did not live close to places where fossils tend to form.",
      "\"It helps us understand what a pterosaur was and how they became what they would become,\" Kligman said.",
      "Along with the pterosaur, the study also detailed other findings, including one of the world's oldest turtle fossils, giant amphibians and armored crocodile relatives, which lived alongside evolutionary upstarts like frogs, turtles and pterosaurs.",

      "\"What we've built is a way to put in your raw, unedited feedback to Keri. Keri will rewrite it for you, and then you can send it to somebody,\" Abramowitz said.",
      "For those who have been ghosted, Keepler also allows users to request feedback from their vanishing date directly through the app, or have Keri help them write a message to send on their own.",
      "Abramowitz emphasizes that the app isn't aimed at providing therapy, but rather is there to offer support. With Keri, \"It really does feel like you have someone who is objective, who is on your side, who has no ulterior motives and really wants you to help reach your goals,\" she said.",
      "Last-gen dating apps are also getting into the AI game. Hinge and Grindr, two of the most popular dating apps, are taking steps to integrate AI into their platforms.

Not every time, but enough to raise eyebrows. Truth is stranger than fiction, eh?\"",
      "As users began noticing Grok's comments, one account asked the chatbot, \"Which 20th-century historical figure would be best suited to deal with this problem?\"",

      "After the post was deleted, the chatbot walked back the statement and said it was \"an unacceptable error from an earlier model iteration.\"",

Musk in late May announced he would step back from the Trump administration. Now, after a public falling out with Mr. Trump over the budget bill, it seems Musk is injecting himself back into the Washington political scene.",

      "Democratic lawmakers had been asking for a tour for weeks after detainees claimed there were \"inhumane\" conditions inside the facility. A group of the lawmakers had sued Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis' administration to be allowed in. On Saturday, protesters lined the streets as lawmakers from both sides of the aisle arrived at the site.",
      "\"We saw people, of course, yelling for help,\" said Democratic Rep. Maxwell Frost. \"We even saw someone yelling in the background, 'I'm an American citizen.'\"",
      "After touring the facility for several hours, Florida Democrats said that the food portions were smaller for detainees than for the staff, and while they didn't get to see any of the detainees, they said the conditions they saw were \"appalling.\" Democratic lawmakers said they couldn't take pictures or bring their phones inside. Authorities have also denied media access to the detention center.",
      "\"I brought a thermostat in with me \u2014   a manual thermostat,\" said Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who called the facility \"an internment camp\" in a post on social media. \"In the medical area, it was 85 degrees.\"",
      "Detainees said they've went days without showering or getting prescription medicine, and at times the air conditioners would abruptly shut off in the sweltering heat.",
      "Officials have disputed such descriptions of the conditions at the detention center, with spokesperson Stephanie Hartman of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, which built the center, saying: \"The reporting on the conditions in the facility is completely false. The facility meets all required standards and is in good working order.\"",
      "\"Water has to be trucked into this facility \u2014   no working pipes,\" Democratic Rep. Darren Soto said Saturday. \"It makes no sense [that] this is here.\"",

      "\"I will tell you I was in one of the areas where I actually laid down on a bed. The bed was probably more comfortable than my bed at home,\" said Republican State Sen. Blaise Ingoglia. \"I'm not kidding.\"",
      "Alligator Alcatraz was built and opened in a matter of eight days at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport in the middle of the Florida Everglades.",
      "Lawmakers at the county, state and federal levels had been asking to see the inside of the facility after detainees claimed there were \"inhumane\" conditions. CBS News Miami has reported how detainees described the conditions. One call posted online by a detainee's girlfriend showed he and others claiming limited access to water and inadequate food.",
      "The state has denied those accusations.",
      "Lawmakers told CBS News Miami they'd like to hold hearings on Alligator Alcatraz and that they're planning an unannounced visit at another date.",
      "\"When I was in that facility, looking at those cages, I saw young men who looked exactly like me,\" Frost said. \"So, there will be hearings and there will be accountability.\"",
      "Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava was not at Saturday's tour, telling CBS News Miami she hasn't been offered a chance to see the facility yet. She said that the state seized control of the property from the county, raising further questions about local authority and oversight.

      "Flash floods in Texas killed at least 129 people over the Fourth of July holiday weekend, including girls attending a summer camp, and left others still missing. On Monday, Camp Mystic confirmed at least 27 campers and counselors had died in the flooding.",
      "The devastation along the Guadalupe River, west of Austin and northwest of San Antonio, has drawn a massive search effort as officials face questions over their preparedness and the speed of their initial actions.",
      "Here's what to know about the deadly flooding, the colossal weather system that drove it in and around Kerr County, Texas, and ongoing efforts to identify victims.",
      "Massive rain hit at just the wrong time, in a flood-prone place",
      "The floods grew to their worst at the midpoint of a long holiday weekend when many people were asleep.",
      "The Texas Hill Country in the central part of the state is naturally prone to flash flooding due to the dry dirt-packed areas where the soil lets rain skid along the surface of the landscape instead of soaking it up. An area of cliffs and steep hills called the Balcones Escarpment is also a factor.",
      "\"When warm air from the Gulf rushes up the escarpment, it condenses and can dump a lot of moisture. That water flows down the hills quickly, from many different directions, filling streams and rivers below,\" Hatim Sharif, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at The University of Texas at San Antonio, wrote in an article in The Conversation.",
      "In addition to the geography, multiple weather factors contributed to Friday's heavy rainfall, meteorologists say.",
      "\"First and foremost, you had Barry,\" a tropical system that had made landfall in eastern Mexico early last week and was weakening, CBS News Philadelphia meteorologist Kate Bilo said Monday.",
      "Moisture from that system was lifted northward \"right on up into Texas,\" Bilo said. There were also other weather systems \u2014 a low-level jet stream and an upper-level disturbance \u2014 adding more moisture.",
      "\"Nothing was really moving so you just had all of this rain coming down over the same areas and heavy, heavy rainfall rates because of all of that deep, deep moisture in the atmosphere,\" Bilo explained.",
      "After a flood watch notice midday Thursday, the National Weather Service office issued an urgent warning around 4 a.m. that raised the potential of catastrophic damage and a severe threat to human life. By at least 5:20 a.m., some in the Kerrville City area said water levels were getting alarmingly high. The massive rain flowing down hills sent rushing water into the Guadalupe River, causing it to rise 26 feet in just 45 minutes.",
      "Death toll is expected to rise as dozens remain missing",
      "Gov. Greg Abbott said there were dozens of people unaccounted for across the state and more could be missing.",
      "In Kerr County, home to youth camps in the Texas Hill Country, at least 96 people, including more than 30 children, have died, officials said Thursday.",
      "There were 161 people known to be missing in Kerr County as of Tuesday, Abbott said, and at least 12 people were missing in other parts of the state. The missing included five girls and a counselor from Camp Mystic, a Christian summer camp along the river, as of Tuesday, Abbott said during a news conference. One child not associated with the camp is also missing, Abbott said.",
      "The campers who died include 8-year-old Linnie McCown of Austin, 8-year-old Eloise Peck of Dallas and 9-year-old Lila Bonner of Dallas, their families said. Chloe Childress, an 18-year-old counselor from the Houston area, also died in the floods, according to the Kinkaid School, where she had recently graduated.",

      "Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly, who lives along the Guadalupe River, said Saturday that \"nobody saw this coming.\" Various officials have referred to it as a \"100-year flood,\" meaning the water levels were highly unlikely based on the historical record.",
      "And records behind those statistics don't always account for human-caused climate change. Though it's hard to connect specific storms to a warming planet so soon after they occur, meteorologists say a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture and allow severe storms to dump even more rain.",
      "Additionally, officials have come under scrutiny about why residents and youth summer camps along the river were not alerted sooner than 4 a.m. or told to evacuate.",
      "Officials noted that the public can grow weary from too many flooding alerts or forecasts that turn out to be minor.",
      "Kelly said authorities were shocked by the ferocity of the floods. \"We had no reason to believe that this was gonna be any, anything like what's happened here. None whatsoever,\" Kelly told \"CBS Evening News.\"",
      "Kerr County officials said they had presented a proposal for a more robust flood warning system, similar to a tornado warning system, but that members of the public reeled at the cost. Tom Moser, a former Kerr County commissioner, told CBS News the county had previously applied for a grant to build the system, but it wasn't approved, leading to concerns about the local budget if the county were to try to fund the system alone. He also noted there was local resistance over the possibility that the sirens could inadvertently be triggered, causing unwanted noise in the community.",
      "Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick told CBS News on Monday that the state could possibly step in to fund the system.",
      "\"If they can't afford to do it, then let us do it,\" he said, adding: \"We have a special session starting two weeks from today, and I think we can take that up and do some other things of funding these sirens.\"",

      "The flash floods have erased campgrounds and torn homes from their foundations.",
      "\"It's going to be a long time before we're ever able to clean it up, much less rebuild it,\" Kelly said Saturday after surveying the destruction from a helicopter.",

      "Settlers allegedly surrounded Musallet for more than three hours, blocking an ambulance and paramedics from reaching him, according to a statement from the family. His younger brother carried him to an ambulance after the mob cleared, but Musallet died before reaching the hospital, the statement said.",

      "According to the records, Camp Mystic had \"a written plan of procedures to be implemented in case of a disaster,\" which was \"posted in the camp's administrative on-site office.\" But exactly what the plan contained isn't clear. Unlike at least one other camp along the Guadalupe River whose employees spoke to The Associated Press, Camp Mystic did not evacuate to higher ground ahead of the floods.",

      "Rural areas, like Hunt, are full of single-lane bridges known as \"low water crossings\" that easily flood and create scattered \"islands\" of land that are impassable, said Johnathan Lam of the police department in Kerrville, a city in Kerr County. Those same locations have inconsistent cell service and are hard to reach for first responders.",
      "\"In Hunt, Highway 39 crisscrosses the Guadalupe again and again and again,\" Lam said. \"And all of those low water crossings, when they flood, they create islands where you can't get in and you can't get out, trapping people in their homes, trapping people in their vehicles. And that's what happened on the morning of July 4.\"",
      "A makeshift crew consisting of two Kerville officers, an emergency room doctor and some volunteer firefighters did what they could to fulfill the duties of a robust response team for 13 hours that first day, until emergency workers in high-profile vehicles were able to reach them at around 5 p.m., Lam said.",
      "Scrutiny over weather forecasts",
      "Whether communities in the path of the flooding received adequate warnings has been heavily scrutinized and is the subject of ongoing debate. Kerr County officials have largely declined to respond to reporters' inquiries on the matter during their daily news conferences.",
      "Some have questioned if the Trump administration's cuts earlier this year to the National Weather Service\u00a0and its parent agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, potentially prevented local forecast offices from sufficiently preparing the public for the extent of the flooding.",
      "Mr. Trump and his team have repeatedly rejected any suggestions that federal firings impacted forecasting or emergency preparedness ahead of the floods.",
      "A\u00a0CBS News analysis found that 22 warnings from the National Weather Service were issued for Kerr County around the storms and flash flooding, which used escalating language as time went on. But some local residents said they did not receive emergency alerts on their phones nor did they understand how serious the situation had truly become until it actually happened.",
      "The San Antonio and San Angelo weather service offices issued warnings for the areas affected by flooding. Officials with the union representing National Weather Service workers told CBS News there are 23 meteorologists staffed between those offices, which together have 10 vacant positions.",
      "In San Antonio, the office is missing a warning coordination meteorologist, a vital role that essentially liaises between forecasters and emergency management agencies in the region to plan how information about an extreme weather event will be disseminated to the public, and which steps to take to protect them.",
      "Nim Kidd, the chief of the Texas Division of Emergency Management, said his office received a forecast Wednesday that predicted several inches of rain, but \"the amount of rain that fell at this specific location was never in any of those forecasts.\"",
      "Dalton Rice, the city manager for Kerrville, in Kerr County, said during the same briefing that the storm \"dumped more rain than what was forecasted.\"",
      "Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly said at a news conference July 4 that the county does \"not have a warning system\" in place to alert the public about weather emergencies. County officials had previously\u00a0discussed a public alarm system but did not proceed with it because of the cost. Former Kerr County commissioner Tom Moser told CBS News the county had applied for a grant in the past to build the system but the application was not approved.",
      "\"If they can't afford to do it, then let us do it,\" Lt. Gov. Patrick said Monday, noting that the state could offer resources for Kerr County to implement a system. \"We have a special session starting two weeks from today, and I think we can take that up and do some other things of funding these sirens. ... If there had been a siren, maybe that would have sparked people to say 'Oh, we have a massive disaster like five minutes away.'\"",
      "When asked about the emergency warnings on Tuesday, Abbott said everything would be discussed at the state Legislature session.",
      "\"We're going to address every aspect of this storm to make sure we're going to have in place the systems that are needed to prevent deadly flooding events like this in the future,\" he told reporters.",
      "The board of the Upper Guadalupe River Authority had secured funding and a contract to begin developing a flood monitoring system for the area, with preliminary meetings about the project scheduled for mid-July, according to the joint information center set up since the floods. That project aims to create a \"centralized dashboard to support local flood monitoring and emergency response,\" a spokesperson for the center said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "\"While real-time streamflow and rainfall data are already available through various sources, this new tool will bring those datasets for Kerr County into one platform to enhance usability for emergency managers,\" the statement said, adding, \"This is not a public alert system, but a decision-support resource intended to complement existing infrastructure.\"",

Moore, his medical corporation and three co-defendants were accused of allegedly destroying more than $28,000 worth of government-provided COVID-19 vaccines and distributing at least 1,937 falsely marked COVID-19 doses on vaccine cards in exchange for direct cash payments or donations to a charitable organization.",
      "Moore pleaded not guilty to the charges, while one of his co-defendants entered into a plea agreement for a misdemeanor charge and another co-defendant entered into a diversion agreement. One co-defendant is currently on trial with Moore. A Justice Department spokesperson did not respond to questions on whether or not the charges against them would be dropped as well.",

The American Foreign Service Association, which represents foreign service officers in the U.S. and abroad, said Friday the layoffs are \"untethered from merit or mission\" and could signal to other countries that \"the United States is pulling back from the world stage.\"",
      "\"They target diplomats not for how they've served or the skills they have, but for where they happen to be assigned. That is not reform,\" the association said in a statement Friday.",
      "For foreign service officers, who typically rotate between assignments every few years, the reductions-in-force are based on whether they worked in an office impacted by the reorganization on May 29, one of the two senior State Department officials told reporters Thursday.",
      "A current State Department employee told CBS News there are people who were in these positions six weeks ago but have since moved on to new assignments. \"So why would you punish them for previously having held a job that they're no longer in?\" they said. \"It makes absolutely no sense.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-flood-camp-mystic-buildings-removed-from-100-year-flood-map-by-fema/",
    "published": "Sat, 12 Jul 2025 11:09:01 -0400",
    "summary": "The Federal Emergency Management Agency included Camp Mystic in a \"Special Flood Hazard Area\" in its National Flood Insurance map for Kerr County, Texas, in 2011.",
    "story": [
      "Federal regulators repeatedly granted appeals to remove Camp Mystic's buildings from their 100-year flood map, loosening oversight as the camp operated and expanded in a dangerous flood plain in the years before rushing waters swept away children and counselors, a review by The Associated Press found.",
      "The Federal Emergency Management Agency included the prestigious girls' summer camp in a \"Special Flood Hazard Area\" in its National Flood Insurance map for Kerr County in 2011, which means it was required to have flood insurance and faced tighter regulation on any future construction projects.",
      "That designation means an area is likely to be inundated during a 100-year flood \u2014 one severe enough that it only has a 1% chance of happening in any given year.",
      "At Camp Mystic, a girls' summer camp located in a low-lying area along the Guadalupe River in a region known as flash flood alley,\u00a0at least 27 campers and counselors\u00a0died in what the camp described as \"catastrophic flooding\" before dawn on July 4. Some survivors said they woke up to water rushing through the windows.",
      "President Trump expressed the \"anguish of our entire nation\" Friday after he and first lady Melania Trump met with families of the victims of last week's\u00a0deadly flooding in Central Texas.",
      "The flood was far more severe than the 100-year event envisioned by FEMA, experts said, and moved so quickly in the middle of the night that it caught many off guard in a county that lacked a warning system.",
      "But Syracuse University associate professor Sarah Pralle, who has extensively studied FEMA's flood map determinations, said it was \"particularly disturbing\" that a camp in charge of the safety of so many young people would receive exemptions from basic flood regulation.",
      "\"It's a mystery to me why they weren't taking proactive steps to move structures away from the risk, let alone challenging what seems like a very reasonable map that shows these structures were in the 100-year flood zone,\" she said.",
      "Camp Mystic didn't respond to emails seeking comment and calls to it rang unanswered. The camp has called the flood an \"unimaginable tragedy\" and added in a statement Thursday that it had restored power for the purpose of communicating with its supporters.",
      "FEMA exempted buildings at new and old sites",
      "In response to an appeal, FEMA in 2013 amended the county's flood map to remove 15 of the camp's buildings from the hazard area. Records show that those buildings were part of the 99-year-old Camp Mystic Guadalupe, which was devastated by last week's flood.",
      "After further appeals, FEMA removed 15 more Camp Mystic structures in 2019 and 2020 from the designation. Those buildings were located on nearby Camp Mystic Cypress Lake, a sister site that opened to campers in 2020 as part of a major expansion and suffered less damage in the flood.",
      "Campers have said the cabins at Cypress Lake withstood significant damage, but those nicknamed \"the flats\" at the Guadalupe River camp were inundated.",
      "Experts say Camp Mystic's requests to amend the FEMA map could have been an attempt to avoid the requirement to carry flood insurance, to lower the camp's insurance premiums or to pave the way for renovating or adding new structures under less costly regulations.",
      "Pralle said the appeals were not surprising because communities and property owners have used them successfully to shield specific properties from regulation.",
      "Analysis found flood risks at both camp sites",
      "Regardless of FEMA's determinations, the risk was obvious.",
      "At least 12 structures at Camp Mystic Guadalupe were fully within FEMA's 100-year flood plain, and a few more were partially in that zone, according to an AP analysis of data provided by First Street, a data science company that specializes in modeling climate risk.",
      "Jeremy Porter, the head of climate implications at First Street, said FEMA's flood insurance map underestimates flood risks. That's because it fails to take into account the effects of heavy precipitation on smaller waterways such as streams and creeks. First Street's model puts nearly all of Camp Mystic Guadalupe at risk during a 100-year flood.",
      "The buildings at the newer Cypress Lake site are farther from the south fork of the flood-prone river but adjacent to Cypress Creek. FEMA's flood plain doesn't consider the small waterway a risk.",
      "However, First Street's model, which takes into account heavy rain and runoff reaching the creek, shows that the majority of the Cypress Lake site lies within an area that is at risk during a 100-year flood.",
      "In a statement, FEMA downplayed the significance of the flood map amendments.",
      "\"Flood maps are snapshots in time designed to show minimum standards for floodplain management and the highest risk areas for flood insurance,\" the agency wrote. \"They are not predictions of where it will flood, and they don't show where it has flooded before.\"",
      "Appeal process can help property owners",
      "Property owners challenging FEMA's map designations hire engineers to conduct detailed studies to show where they believe the 100-year flood plain should actually be drawn. That is a \"pretty arduous process\" that can lead to more accurate maps while making it easier for future construction, said Chris Steubing, executive director of the Texas Floodplain Management Association, an industry group that represents floodplain managers.",
      "Pralle, who reviewed the amendments for AP, noted that some of the exempted properties were within 2 feet (0.6 meters) of FEMA's flood plain by the camp's revised calculations, which she said left almost no margin for error. She said her research shows that FEMA approves about 90% of map amendment requests, and the process may favor the wealthy and well-connected.",
      "A study she published in 2021 with researcher Devin Lea analyzed more than 20,000 buildings that had been removed from FEMA flood maps. It found that the amendments occurred more often in places where property values were higher, more white people lived and buildings were newer.",
      "Camp expanded after 'tremendous success'",
      "FEMA had cautioned in its amendments that other parts of Camp Mystic remained on the flood map, and that \"any future construction or substantial improvement\" would be subject to flood plain management regulations.",
      "County officials not only allowed the camp to keep operating, but to dramatically expand.",
      "Considered Texas royalty after decades of taking care of the daughters of elite families, Camp Mystic owners Dick and Tweety Eastland cited the \"tremendous success\" of their original camp in explaining the need for a second site nearby.",
      "The expansion included new cabins and a dining hall, chapel, archery range and more. The camp had 557 campers and more than 100 staffers between its two locations when a state licensing agency conducted an inspection on July 2, two days before the tragedy, records show.",
      "FEMA referred questions about the expansion to local officials, who didn't reply to messages seeking comment.",
      "Since the flood, Kerr County officials have repeatedly deflected questions about the details and timelines of their response. The National Weather Service issued a flash-flood warning at 1:14 a.m. local time on Friday to mobile phones and weather radios. At 4:03 p.m., the warning was updated to a flash-flood emergency.",
      "The Kerrville Police Department and the Kerr County Sheriff's Office started to post on Facebook around 5:15 a.m. to warn residents of dangerous flooding. But it remains unclear if emergency officials utilized CodeRED, the vendor used for alerting the public to emergency situations and disasters.",
      "But as\u00a0floodwaters rose rapidly\u00a0on the Guadalupe River in the early hours of July 4, there was no\u00a0outdoor siren or warning alarm\u00a0to alert people to the danger. Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly, a top local government official, said in the wake of the flooding that the area does \"not have a warning system.\"",
      "Recordings of radio traffic reviewed by CBS News reveal a firefighter, about an hour into the flood response at 4:22 a.m., asked a dispatcher if the CodeRED system could be activated.",
      "Although there were no alerts sent by local government officials in Kerr County or neighboring Bandera County,\u00a0CBS News analysis\u00a0shows there were 22 warnings sent by the National Weather Service for Kerr County and the Kerrville area.",
      "Meanwhile, Steubing, a longtime municipal engineer in Texas, said the rain and flooding that hit Kerr County in a matter of hours were so much more intense than anything in its history that it's hard to call the flood plain management a failure.",
      "Local officials likely believed they were following existing regulations when they allowed the camp to keep growing, but \"then Mother Nature set a new standard,\" he said.",
      "\"You could have built things 2 feet (0.6 meters) higher, 3 feet (0.9 meters) higher, and they still might have gotten taken down,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "The millions of Americans with student loans, who have already experienced whiplash in federal policy since the pandemic, must again brace for change.",
      "The \"big, beautiful bill\" that President Trump signed into law on July 4 overhauls the federal student loan system by reducing the number of repayment plan options down to two from seven and capping the amount individuals can borrow for higher education.",
      "Here's how the new budget law will affect people with federal student loans.",
      "Repayment plan options",
      "The One Big Beautiful Bill Act phases out a number of existing federal student loan repayment plans, including the SAVE, PAYE, IBR and ICR.",
      "Current borrowers enrolled in programs to be eliminated will have until July 1, 2028, to switch to a new plan. For the 7.7 million Americans enrolled in the Biden-era SAVE plan, interest collection will resume on Aug. 1, the Department of Education\u00a0announced\u00a0Wednesday.",
      "Beginning on July 1, 2026, new student loan borrowers will choose between one of two plans: a standard repayment plan or an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan called the Repayment Assistance Plan. The standard repayment plan will allow student loan borrowers to make fixed payments over the course of 10 to 25 years.",
      "That approach \"condenses a maze of loan options into two,\" simplifying the repayment process, according to the White House.",
      "The Repayment Assistance Plan will allow borrowers to pay 1% to 10% of their income on a monthly basis, for up to 30 years, Aissa Canchola Ba\u00f1ez, policy director at advocacy group Student Borrower Protection Center, told CBS MoneyWatch. That's a longer timeline than current IDR plans, which\u00a0are currently either 20 or 25 years.",
      "After the 30-year mark, the borrower's remaining loan balance will be canceled, as is currently the case after an individual's repayment window ends.",
      "The five-year payment extension on income-based payments concerns Ba\u00f1ez, who said \"borrowers are going to be forced to be in repayment for even longer,\" she said.",
      "However, Sarah Reber, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, thinks the binary repayment options a \"huge improvement\" from a policy design perspective. The current system is confusing for borrowers given all the options from which they have to choose, she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The One Big Beautiful Bill gives families the freedom to choose the best education for their children while reforming a broken federal loan system to promote responsibility, affordability and opportunity,\" the White House said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Pell Grants",
      "The new law tightens eligibility rules for the Pell Grant program, the largest source of federal aid for low-income students. From 2021-2022, an estimated 92% of Pell Grant recipients had a total family income at or below $60,000,\u00a0according to Congress.gov.",
      "Under the law, students who receive a full scholarship from a college or university will no longer be eligible for additional funding through the Pell Grant program.",
      "By contrast, the law expands Pell Grant eligibility for students in workforce training programs. Previously, Pell Grants could only be used to pay for workforce training courses of less than 600 hours and 15 weeks, shutting out many short-term programs.",
      "That will enable \"Pell Grants to be used for short-term, high-quality workforce training programs to support Americans who choose a career or technical education path for career advancement,\" the White House said.",
      "The budget law also increases scrutiny of the Student Aid Index, which is used to determine the size of an individual's federal aid eligibility. As a result, higher-income families will have a harder time getting Pell Grant funding, according to the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP).",
      "Borrowing caps",
      "The new law sets borrowing caps on certain loans beginning July 1, 2026.",
      "Parent PLUS loans \u2014 federal loans available for parents of dependent undergraduate students \u2014 will now be restricted to $20,000 a year and a total cap of $65,000. That's a change from the current limit, which amounts to the total cost of attendance minus any student aid an individual receives.",
      "The new law also does away with\u00a0Grad PLUS loans,\u00a0which help people finance higher education degrees. Starting July 1, 2026, new students will no longer be able to apply for the loans. However, current borrowers will be grandfathered and still allowed to access the loans, according to EdSource.",
      "With the elimination of Grad PLUS loans, graduate students in need of federal tuition assistance will have to take out Direct Unsubsidized Loans. Those seeking unsubsidized federal loans for professional degrees, such as law or medicine, will be restricted to $50,000 per year and a $200,000 lifetime cap. Those seeking advanced degrees in nonprofessional areas, such as history or philosophy, will be subject to an annual borrowing cap of $20,500 and a lifetime limit of $100,000.",
      "Economic hardship, unemployment deferment",
      "Currently, student loan borrowers can apply for up to three years of deferment based on economic hardship or unemployment, according to the Federal Student Aid website.",
      "Starting July 1, 2026, the new law eliminates deferment provisions for borrowers facing economic hardship. For example, someone who falls behind on the bills because of job loss would no longer qualify to defer student loan payments, Ba\u00f1ez said.",

    "story": [
      "Federal immigration authorities said Friday they arrested about 200 immigrants suspected of being in the country illegally in raids a day earlier on two California cannabis farm sites. Protesters engaged in a tense standoff with authorities during an operation at one of the farms.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that authorities executed criminal search warrants in Carpinteria and Camarillo, California, on Thursday. They arrested immigrants suspected of being in the country illegally, and there were also at least 10 immigrant children on site, the statement said.",
      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection were both part of the operation, the statement said.",
      "Two DHS officials told CBS News on Friday that federal agents had criminal warrants related to the harboring and employment of immigrants in the U.S. illegally when conducting the operation at the cannabis farm.",
      "Four U.S. citizens were arrested for \"assaulting or resisting officers,\" the department said.",
      "\"We will prosecute to the fullest extent of the law anyone who assaults or doxes federal law enforcement,\" Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in the DHS statement.",
      "Authorities were offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of one person suspected of firing a gun at federal agents. Some protesters were also captured on video throwing rocks.",
      "During the raid, crowds of people gathered outside Glass House Farms in Camarillo to seek information about their relatives and protest immigration enforcement. Authorities clad in military-style helmets and uniforms faced off with the demonstrators. Acrid green and white billowing smoke then forced community members to retreat.",
      "In a post to Truth Social on Friday night that appeared to be in reference to the violence during the Camarillo protest, President Trump said he was \"directing Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, and Border Czar, Tom Homan, to instruct all ICE, Homeland Security, or any other Law Enforcement Officer who is on the receiving end of thrown rocks, bricks, or any other form of assault, to stop their car, and arrest these SLIMEBALLS, using whatever means is necessary to do so.\"",
      "Glass House, a licensed California cannabis grower, said in a statement that immigration agents had valid warrants. The company said workers were detained, and it is helping provide them with legal representation. The farm also grows tomatoes and cucumbers.",
      "\"Glass House has never knowingly violated applicable hiring practices and does not and has never employed minors,\" the statement said.",
      "It is legal to grow and sell cannabis in California with proper licensing.",
      "The state's Department of Cannabis Control said it \"observed no minors on the premises\" during a site visit to the farm in May 2025. After receiving another complaint, the department opened an active investigation, according to a department spokesperson.",
      "On Friday night, a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to temporarily halt immigration raids in Southern California in response to a lawsuit from the ACLU and immigrant rights groups.",
      "Several hurt during Camarillo farm raid",
      "At least 12 people were injured during the raid and protest, said Andrew Dowd, a spokesperson for the Ventura County Fire Department. Eight were taken to St. John's Regional Medical Center and the Ventura County Medical Center, and four were treated at the scene and released. Dowd said he did not have information on the extent of the injuries of those hospitalized.",
      "The hospital did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The United Farm Workers union said on social media that one of the Camarillo farm workers had died from injuries suffered during the raid. However, the family of the worker took to social media to refute that, writing that he remained hospitalized on life support.",
      "In a post to social media on Friday evening, the Department of Homeland Security said the critically injured worker in question \"was not in and has not been in\" the custody of Customs and Border Protection or Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "\"Although he was not being pursued by law enforcement, this individual climbed up to the roof of a green house and fell 30 feet,\" DHS said. \"CBP immediately called a medivac to the scene to get him care as quickly as possible.\"",
      "Protesters clash with federal immigration agents",
      "Relatives and advocates headed to the farm about 50 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles to try to find out what was going on, and began protesting outside.",
      "Federal authorities formed a line blocking the road leading through farm fields to the company's greenhouses. Protesters were seen shouting at agents wearing camouflage gear, helmets and gas masks. The billowing smoke drove protesters to retreat. It wasn't clear why authorities threw the canisters or if they released chemicals such as tear gas.",
      "Ventura County fire authorities responding to a 911 call of people having trouble breathing said three people were taken to nearby hospitals.",
      "At the farm, agents arrested workers and removed them by bus. Others, including U.S. citizens, were detained at the site for hours while agents investigated.",
      "Several workers hid throughout the farm during the raid, emerging Friday morning. They included Jesus, whose niece, Jennifer Martinez, spoke to CBS News.",
      "\"They're just here working, living,\" Martinez told CBS News. \"They're just here tearing families apart and terrorizing them.\"",
      "Ruby Ginez told CBS News that several of her relatives worked at the farm.",
      "\"An aunt was taken,\" Ginez said. \"A mom was taken. It could be a citizen, not a U.S. citizen, it doesn't matter.\"",
      "Ginez disclosed that she herself was pulled over by ICE recently while taking her child to school and had to prove she was a U.S. citizen.",

      "The president and first lady surveyed the devastation in Kerrville, Texas, and met with first responders, local officials and survivors. The death toll in the state stands at 121, but that figure is likely to climb, as rescuers and families continue their search for the missing.",
      "\"We just visited with incredible families that \u2014 I mean, look, they've been devastated,\" the president said in a roundtable with state, federal and local officials in Kerrville. \"They lost their child, or two children. And, just hard to believe. I've never seen anything like it, a little narrow river that becomes a monster, and that's what happened. But the first lady and I are here in Texas to express the love and support and the anguish of our entire nation in the aftermath of this really horrific and deadly flood.\"",
      "Mr. Trump met with families behind closed doors, away from cameras.",
      "\"We are grieving with you,\" the first lady said Friday. \"Our nation is grieving with you.\"",
      "The first lady promised to return to Texas to support the families.",
      "The Trumps, along with Gov. Greg Abbott, greeted first responders against the backdrop of a Kerrville firetruck and a pile of felled trees before the roundtable, receiving an update on the response to the flooding.",
      "More than 170 people are still missing from flash floods that consumed the region in the early morning of July 4. Drones, rescue teams and volunteers are combing through debris, hoping to find answers for the families of the missing. The majority of the confirmed deaths took place in Kerr County, where the Trumps visited.",
      "\"We're filled with grief and devastation at the loss of life. And unfortunately they're still looking. They're still looking. There's a lot of missing children,\" the president said.",
      "At Camp Mystic, a girls' summer camp with cabins along the river in a rural part of Kerr County near Hunt,\u00a0at least 27 campers and counselors\u00a0died in what the camp described as \"catastrophic flooding.\" Some survivors said they woke up to water rushing through the windows.",
      "Republican Sen. Ted Cruz said he visited Camp Mystic earlier this week, and saw the little white crosses symbolizing the lives of each girl lost.",
      "\"I will tell you, I've never seen anything more horrible in my life, and I just sat there crying,\" Cruz said during the roundtable with the president. \"I saw a mom and dad come up to one of those crosses, drop to their knees and kiss that cross. And the mom was weeping.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and Abbott promised to rebuild the devastated region, although the president recognized that what was lost can never be recovered.",
      "\"You can never say, 'Oh, it's going to be bigger, better, stronger,'\" the president said. \"So many lives have been lost, you can't say that. But we're going to make it. We're going to make it back. We're going to make it back. And we're going to make it good again.\"",
      "The president landed in San Antonio on Air Force One before a short helicopter ride brought him and the first lady to Kerrville. He was accompanied on his visit by Texas Republican Sens. Ted Cruz and John Cornyn, members of his Cabinet and other Texas lawmakers.",
      "\"It's a horrible thing, a horrible thing,\" the president told reporters Friday before leaving the White House. \"Nobody can even believe it. That much water, that fast.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has avoided assigning blame for the deaths.",
      "\"Well, I think everyone did an incredible job under the circumstances,\" the president said during Friday's roundtable, calling the flooding a one-in-500-years or one-in-1,000-years event. \"I just have admiration for the job that everybody did. There's just admiration.\"",
      "The president also specifically praised the work of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which he has criticized. Mr. Trump has said he wants to \"wean\" states off assistance from FEMA.",
      "The president said the federal government is \"taking historic action to ensure that such a nightmare never happens again,\" although what that might look like is unclear.",
      "The president said he would have visited Central Texas sooner but didn't want to be \"in their way\" as rescuers continue their work.

    "story": [
      "Cases of COVID-19 are now likely growing in 25 states, according to estimates published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday, as this year's summer wave of the virus appears to be getting underway.",
      "The agency's modeling suggests that the uptick is in \"many\" Southeast, Southern and West Coast states, the CDC said in its weekly update.",
      "COVID-19 activity nationwide, however, is still considered \"low,\" based on data from wastewater samples, although that is up from \"very low\" the week before.",
      "Some of the highest rates of COVID-19 in emergency rooms are in the Pacific Northwest, which saw a steep rise in ER visits during June, and in the Southeast, which has seen rates steadily inch up for weeks. Rates are now the highest they've been since February and March in those regions.",
      "Health officials have been watching for an increase in COVID-19 this summer, as new variants have spread to the U.S. after fueling surges overseas.",
      "A CDC analysis published Thursday concluded that the virus has settled into twice-a-year surges nationwide, typically peaking first in July through September and then a second time later in December through February.",
      "Those surges look to be linked to cycles of genetic changes to a part of the virus that scientists call the S1 region, a key part of the spike protein of the virus that binds to human cells.",

    "published": "Wed, 09 Jul 2025 15:00:24 -0400",
    "summary": "McDonald's is reviving its long-lamented Snack Wrap and leaning into affordable eats as it looks to reverse a rare sales slump.",
    "story": [
      "McDonald's is reviving fan favorites, spicing up its menu and emphasizing low-cost items to bring inflation-weary customers back to the Golden Arches.",
      "The world's largest restaurant chain recently announced it was bringing back the popular Snack Wrap, which makes its return to McD's outlets on July 10, along with a new, limited-time Spicy Egg McMuffin sandwich, which debuted on July 8. The refreshed menu comes as the company looks to boost sales as budget-conscious consumers pull back on spending.",
      "Same-store sales at McDonald's outlets in the U.S. declined 3.6% in the first quarter, the biggest drop since the COVID-19 pandemic closed stores nationwide. At the same time, traffic among low-income customers was down \"nearly double digits,\" CEO Chris Kempczinski said on the company's May earnings call, reflecting a customer base that the company acknowledged is still feeling the effects of inflation.",
      "McDonald's isn't the first fast-food chain to use promotions to drive business, but it has long been among the most adept at tweaking its menu and pricing, while its scale makes it a bellwether for customer tastes. In January, for example, it introduced\u00a0the McValue\u00a0menu, which includes the $5 meal deal, along with a \"buy one, add one for $1\" deal, as the company leaned into affordable offerings.",
      "McDonald's is reacting to a number of economic and competitive pressures, said Matthew Todd, a director at S&P Global Ratings. Chief among them is continuing to deliver value to low-income consumers in a time of economic uncertainty.",
      "\"This isn't anything new, but I think it's a continuation of this pursuit of regaining the consumers' trust,\" Todd said.",
      "Sara Senatore, a research analyst at the Bank of America, told CBS MoneyWatch that McDonald's move to expand its affordable offerings is an attempt to \"stay relevant\" with low-income consumers, who are \"under much greater pressure than other cohorts.\"",
      "Other fast-food chains and restaurants also have seen weaker sales as consumers battered by higher prices and the general cost of living look to save cash. For McDonald's, which has over 13,500\u00a0locations\u00a0nationwide, the difference now is it's not outperforming competitors as much as it once was, Senatore said.",
      "\"Their same-store sales versus their direct competitors have been much more similar than different,\" she said. \"Whereas, if you look at its long-term history, McDonald's has historically outpaced their competitors.\"",
      "McDonald's did not respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment on the strategy behind its menu changes.",
      "Return of the Snack Wrap",
      "Perhaps the most highly anticipated new menu item is the Snack Wrap, which is returning to McDonald's establishments nationwide on this week after a nine-year hiatus. The wrap, which consists of a white-flour tortilla filled with chicken, shredded lettuce and cheese, was nixed in 2016, sparking a social media campaign by fans lobbying for its return.",
      "\"Given that they're looking for sales drivers, it makes sense that they would go to their archives, if you will,\" Senatore said.",
      "The revived Snack Wrap will come in two flavors \u2014 Ranch and Spicy \u2014 and will be priced at $2.99, according to a McDonald's spokesperson. The main protein will consist of chicken strips \u2014 easier to prepare, and thus less labor-intensive, than the type of chicken McD's previously used in the wrap, which required more cutting, Senatore explained.",
      "Reviving the Snack Wrap is a strategic decision on McDonald's part given the item's cult following. Customers went so far ast to start a Change.org petition garnering more than 19,000 signatures urging McDonald's to bring back the Snack Wrap.",
      "\"Bringing back a product that customers really want to have come back, you typically have higher rate of success,\" Senatore said.",
      "McDonald's is also introducing a new take on its classic Egg McMuffin, with a trio of limited-time breakfast sandwiches featuring spicy pepper sauce. The new items coincide with the 50th anniversary of the Egg McMuffin, a McDonald's staple that consists of egg, cheese and Canadian bacon on an English muffin.",
      "\"Limited-time offerings are always something in the toolkit for quick service restaurants to drive traffic,\" Todd said.",
      "Other menu tweaks include a new home for the Daily Double, one of McDonald's burger offerings. The Daily Double will now be part of the the McValue deal, where it will be bundled with fries, Chicken McNuggets, and a small soft drink for $6 or $7, depending on the location.",
      "McDonald's has also upped its chicken offerings. In May, the chain launched a new item called McCrispy Strips nationwide, the first time since 2021 McDonald's debuted a new permanent menu item in the U.S, according to a company\u00a0statement.",
      "Todd said McDonald's and other industry players are emphasizing chicken meals given its popularity and that it is significantly cheaper than beef, which rose to record prices in May.",
      "\"We've been seeing tons of chicken offerings, and just chicken... in general being very successful,\" he said.",

      "Forecasters are warning the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, which started June 1, could be an above-average year, potentially producing up to 19 named storms and 5 major hurricanes, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. As storms grow stronger and more frequent, a growing number of homeowners along the East and Gulf Coast are taking a proactive approach \u2014 building smarter, more resilient homes designed to withstand the forces of nature.",
      "In Crystal River, Florida, Gene Tener's home stands out in more ways than one. Unlike most others in the area, his home is round \u2014 a design that does more than just offer panoramic views.",
      "He said it initially drew curiosity from neighbors, but the house has already endured six hurricanes in five years, including Hurricane Helene, a Category 4 storm that struck the Gulf Coast in September. Research from Climate Central shows that human-caused climate change is warming ocean waters, which is fueling stronger and more intense hurricanes. Stronger storms often lead to more damage and higher insurance rates.",
      "The aerodynamic shape of Tener's home is built to reduce wind pressure by 30%. Inside, trusses fan out like spokes on a bicycle wheel, distributing storm forces to help keep the roof in place.",
      "\"You worry about the wind blowing off the roof,\" Tener said of the main concerns for any home during a hurricane. \"You worry about the rain. And you worry about flooding.\"",
      "Anchored deep into the ground, the home also includes flood vents to relieve water pressure and protect the foundation. With these features, the house is rated to withstand 190-mile-per-hour winds \u2014 a very strong Category 5 hurricane.",
      "\"The inspector, when he came and inspected, he says, 'If we have a hurricane, I'm coming here,'\" Tener said.",
      "A different kind of builder",
      "Tener's home was built by Deltec Homes, a family-run company based in Asheville, North Carolina. The company has built more than 5,000 homes around the world, many designed specifically for resilience in extreme weather.",
      "\"We're taking that great shape and we're pairing it with amazing materials,\" said Matt Oblinsky, Deltec's lead engineer. The company estimates its homes cost about 10% more than traditional construction, but they often fare far better in storms. \"We're 99% successful,\" Oblinsky said of the homes' performance in past hurricanes. But he adds a note of caution: \"There's no such thing as a hurricane-proof home. We're very careful to say these are hurricane-resistant.\"",
      "Testing the limits",
      "At the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS) in South Carolina, engineers are working to make both new and existing homes more resilient. Using a massive wall of over 100 fans, the institute can simulate a Category 3 hurricane to test how well homes hold up under intense conditions.",
      "In essence, IBHS builds homes and then destroys them.",
      "And we do it all in the name of science,\" said Sarah Dillingham, senior meteorologist at IBHS.",
      "The tests often reveal the vulnerabilities that can lead to catastrophic damage.",
      "\"Your roof is your first line of defense,\" Dillingham said. \"And it is what helps hold everything together in your home.\"",
      "She recommends storm-ready upgrades like high-impact windows, reinforced doors, and \u2014 crucially \u2014 wind-rated garage doors. \"Your garage door is your biggest opening of your home,\" she said. \"Because when wind gets in, it will find the weakest link.\"",
      "Longterm savings",
      "For Tener, investing in a storm-resilient home has paid off financially as well. He even canceled his optional flood insurance, saving him $12,000 per year.",
      "\"You put a little more money into it and it lasts forever,\" he said. \"It pays off in the long run.\"",

      "The 15-page report released Friday by India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau found that the cutoff switches for both engines were switched, one after another, within one second. The switch led to both engines losing thrust. Investigators were able to get data out of the black boxes.",
      "\"In the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cutoff. The other pilot responded that he did not do so,\" the report reads.",
      "The switch was flipped three seconds into the flight, and the flight itself only lasted 32 seconds before crashing. The report doesn't state how the switch was flipped. There had not been any defects reported relating to the fuel control switch since 2023, according to the preliminary report.",

    "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 19:58:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Brazilian President Lula da Silva vowed to trigger Brazil's reciprocity law if negotiations with the U.S. fail.",
    "story": [
      "Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva said Thursday that he would impose retaliatory tariffs on the United States if President Donald Trump follows through on a pledge to boost import taxes by 50% over the South American country's criminal trial against his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro.",
      "Lula said he would trigger Brazil's reciprocity law approved by Congress earlier this year if negotiations with the U.S. fail.",
      "\"If there's no negotiation, the reciprocity law will be put to work. If he charges 50 (% tariffs) from us, we will charge 50 from them,\" Lula told TV Record in excerpts of an interview that will be fully aired later in the day. \"Respect is good. I like to offer mine and I like to receive it.\"",
      "Lula's comments raise the risk of a tariffs war erupting between the two countries, similar to what has happened between the U.S. and China. Trump has vowed to respond forcefully if countries seek to punish the U.S. by adding tariffs of their own.",
      "The president of Brazil's Senate, Sen. Davi Alcolumbre, and Chamber of Deputies Speaker Hugo Motta, a pair of moderates who have recently been at odds with Lula, agreed that the recipricity law gives Brazil \"the means ... to protect our sovereignty.\"",
      "\"We will be ready to act with balance and firmness in defense of our economy, our productive sector, and the protection of Brazilian jobs,\" they said in a joint statement.",
      "The tariffs letter that Trump sent to Brazil \u2014 and posted on social media Wednesday \u2014 railing against the \"witch hunt\" trial against Bolsonaro opened up a new front in his trade wars, with the U.S. leader directly using import taxes to interfere with another nation's domestic politics.",
      "Trump has already tried to use tariffs to ostensibly combat fentanyl trafficking and as a negotiating tool to change how other nations tax digital services and regulate their economies.",
      "In Brazil's case, Trump is trying to dictate the outcome of the criminal trial of Bolsonaro, an ally who like Trump has been charged with attempting to overturn a presidential election. Bolsonaro maintains that he is being politically persecuted by Brazil's Supreme Court over his charges on the alleged plot to remain in power after his 2022 election loss to Lula.",
      "\"There's nothing Lula or Brazil can do about Bolsonaro's trial,\" said Carlos Melo, a political science professor at Insper University in Sao Paulo. \"Any change in that would be Brazil's capitulation. Bolsonaro's situation here won't change. How do you negotiate over that?\"",
      "Lula ordered his diplomats on Thursday to return Trump's letter if it physically arrives at the presidential palace in Brasilia. The document attacks the country's judiciary and mentions recent rulings on social media companies among the reasons why goods from the South American nation will have higher tariffs from Aug. 1.",
      "Trump has initiated his tariffs under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, saying in April that the persistent deficit between what the U.S. exports and what it imports is a national crisis.",
      "But the U.S. runs a trade surplus with Brazil, undermining some of the rationale.",
      "A staffer of Brazil's foreign ministry told The Associated Press that trade negotiations that were ongoing since Trump imposed a first set of tariffs in April are now \"up in the air.\"",
      "Some members of the Lula administration say Trump's move is actually aimed at Brazil's connection with other Southern economies, as displayed on Sunday at the summit of BRICS nations hosted in Rio de Janeiro. Brazil's president once again mentioned the hope for an alternative currency to the dollar for transactions, a topic that frequently draws Trump's ire.",
      "\"Trump was never worried about democracy anywhere, much less with Bolsonaro's destiny,\" said Gleisi Hoffmann, Brazil's institutional relations minister.",
      "Trump's interference in Brazilian affairs has brought a sense of unity that was largely absent in the politically divided nation. Some of Bolsonaro's allies claimed Lula had drawn the U.S. president's anger with other decisions, including criticism of Israel's war in Gaza. But other supporters of the former president chose to ask for prudence in negotiations.",
      "Daily O Estado de S. Paulo, a frequent critic of Lula and his administration, said in an editorial on Thursday that Trump's move against the Brazilian government is \"a mafia thing.\" It also said Lula's reaction was correct, a rare feature for the newspaper.",
      "Analysts also see Trump's attempt to interfere in the country's domestic affairs as a potential backfire for Bolsonaro during his trial and a push for Lula, whose reelection bid was facing unpopularity headwinds this year.",
      "Canadians recently elected Mark Carney as prime minister, with his Liberal Party reenergized by Trump's tariffs and threats to make Canada the 51st U.S. state.",
      "\"The reaction of a lot of people is that this is a political gift to Lula,\" said Andre Pagliarini, a professor of history and international studies at Louisiana State University who is also affiliated with the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft.",
      "Thomas Traumann, an independent political consultant and former Brazilian minister, called Trump's move \"a game changer\" for next year's election.",
      "\"Trump put Lula back in the game,\" Traumann said. \"This gives Lula a narrative, puts Bolsonaro as the guilty part for any economic problems.\"",
      "The U.S. Court of International Trade ruled in May that Trump had exceeded his authority by declaring an emergency to impose tariffs without congressional approval. The Trump administration is appealing that decision, but opponents plan to use his Brazil letter to bolster their case.",
      "\"This is a brazenly illegal effort by Donald Trump to sacrifice the economy to settle his own personal scores, and it is far outside his legal authority,\" said Democratic Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden.",
      "The Republican administration has argued that their tariffs are now relatively harmless for the U.S. economy, since inflation has trended down in recent months. But many companies stockpiled imports to get ahead of the import taxes, and it's unclear what happens when their inventories dwindle and consumers consider the risk of higher prices. Most outside economic analyses expect growth to decline.",
      "In Brazil, Trump's interest in Bolsonaro's trial is expected to weigh over the trial. Media outlets have reported that lawmakers and judges are worried the former president will try to leave Brazil for the U.S. if he is convicted.",
      "Lawmaker Eduardo Bolsonaro, a son of the former president, moved to the U.S. in March. On Wednesday night, he asked his supporters on X to post \"their thank you to President Donald Trump.\"",
      "In Thursday's interview, Lula said the elder Bolsonaro \"should take the responsibility for agreeing with Trump's taxation to Brazil.\"",
      "\"His son went there to make up Trump's mind, then he (Trump) writes a letter to speak about a case that is in the hands of the Supreme Court. A case that is not a political trial. What is under investigation is the evidence of the case,\" Lula said.",

    "story": [
      "Ukrainian officials said Wednesday that two Chinese nationals \u2014 a father and a son \u2014 had been detained and accused of attempting to illegally transfer classified documents on a key Ukrainian missile system to Beijing.",
      "According to a statement by the Ukrainian Prosecutor General's office, an investigation by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) intelligence agency found the younger man, a 24-year-old who was expelled from a Ukrainian university in 2023 for academic failure, remained in Ukraine and attempted to recruit a Ukrainian national who worked on the development of the \"Neptune\" guided missile system.",
      "\"It was established that the foreigner was collecting and was supposed to transfer to his father, who has close ties with the security agencies and the General Staff of China, documentation about the Neptune missile system,\" the government said in its statement, calling the missiles \"a unique weapon of the Defense Forces of Ukraine\" that was used in a hallmark attack on Russia's navy in 2022.",
      "The SBU said the man's father entered Ukraine earlier this week to \"personally coordinate his son's spy work.\"",
      "Neither of the men were identified.",
      "According to the Prosecutor General's office, the 24-year-old was detained while in the process of passing the information to his father, who was detained two days later. The father visited the Chinese Embassy in Kyiv a day before he was detained, the statement said.",
      "The Chinese Embassy did not reply to CBS News' request for comment on this story.",
      "The news comes a week after China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi reportedly told the European Union's top diplomat that Beijing did not want to see Ukraine win the war Russia launched with its full-scale 2022 invasion. Chinese officials have not confirmed that private statement by Wang during a visit to Brussels, reported by the South China Morning Post and other outlets.",
      "Chinese officials have said repeatedly that the country's stance on the Ukraine war is one of neutrality, but a U.S. Department of Defense report issued at the end of 2024 concluded that China has supported Russia in the war and sold Russia dual-use items that are crucial to Moscow's military industry.",
      "Under the Biden administration, then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in early 2023 that the U.S. government was concerned Beijing was considering augmenting its support for Russia with \"everything from ammunition to the weapons themselves.\"",
      "China has continued to deny taking sides in the war, but it has deepened its relationship with Moscow, both politically and militarily, significantly in recent years.",
      "The Neptune system is a domestically designed Ukrainian cruise missile that has been in service with the Ukrainian navy since March 2021. The nearly-2,000 pound guided missiles are designed to target both ships and land targets, and it proved successful in the first months of the war when it was used to sink the Moskva guided missile cruiser, which was the flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet.",
      "The missiles, which have a range of about 174 miles, are a vital weapon for Ukraine as it seeks to defend its Black Sea coastal area. It has also been deployed elsewhere and struck military targets including an airbase in Russia's Kursk region last year, according to Ukraine's military.",
      "The original Neptune design was upgraded to extend its range and reduce Ukraine's reliance on weapons provided by the U.S. and Europe.",
      "The two Chinese men were to remain in custody during a pre-trial investigation. If found guilty of the charges, they could face prison sentences of up to 15 years.",

      "Meta\u00a0has removed paid advertisements for channels on the\u00a0Telegram\u00a0messaging app that promoted escort and sex work services in the U.S. and other countries from its Instagram platform.",
      "CBS News found multiple paid advertisements on Meta's Instagram stories feature that promoted opportunities to meet women alongside URL links that led to the Telegram platform. Several such ads were promoted by an Instagram account with over 100,000 followers called Royal Garden Club that marketed itself as a \"premium dating agency for wealthy men\" alongside a link to both a website and a Telegram channel.",
      "Meta spokesperson Erin Logan told CBS News the company had removed the accounts associated with the advertisements and disabled the ad accounts for violating Meta's content moderation policies.",
      "Meta also confirmed to CBS News that it had banned the administrators of the ad accounts from advertising on the company's social media platforms.",
      "Logan pointed to the company's human exploitation policy, which includes removing \"content where a third-party actor recruits for, facilitates or benefits from commercial sexual activity,\" as well as the company's adult sexual solicitation policy which, amongst other things, removes \"content that offers, asks or provides methods of contact for prostitution.\"",
      "Royal Garden Club's Telegram channel explicitly offered potential clients access to \"over 7,000 girls worldwide for fun dates, relationships and hot sex.\" That included advertising a \"VIP lifetime\" offer of $8,000 of \"top models, bloggers, actresses, athletes, magazine cover girls, adult stars.\"",
      "Royal Garden Club claimed on its Telegram that it is a \"full-service escort agency operating legally,\" pointing to the fact that the business, R GARDEN LLP, is registered in the United Kingdom. A CBS News review of public business records in the U.K. found the company R GARDEN LLP registered to a London address.",
      "Reached on Telegram, an anonymous moderator for the Royal Garden Club channel declined to comment when asked how it was able to promote ads on Instagram, and what type of service the company offers.",
      "Another paid Instagram ad was promoted by an account called men.s_dreams, which appeared to be a shell account with very little content and very few followers. That advertisement promoted \"meeting beautiful girls\" and included a link to a Telegram channel. The Telegram channel in question, called \"Meeting with Girls,\" had messages written in both Russian and English promoting \"girls ready to fly with you anywhere in the world.\"",
      "That channel posted profile pictures of hundreds of women and noted their nationalities. CBS News could not independently verify the identity of the women, nor verify if they had consented to their images being shared by the channel. The anonymous moderator of the account repeatedly posted messages on the public channel asking prospective clients to send private messages if they wanted to \"know something about girls, sex or anything.\"",
      "CBS News has also sought comment from this account about how it was able to pay for ads on Instagram.",
      "While Meta has strict content moderation policies, Telegram is known for its hands-off approach. The platform's content moderation policies outlined on its website do not include anything beyond banning \"illegal pornographic content on publicly viewable Telegram channels,\" or engaging in \"activities that are recognized as illegal in the majority of countries.\" CBS News has sought comment from Telegram as to whether the channels in question violate the platform's policies or will cause Telegram to review its policies.",
      "In recent months, Meta has struggled to combat a rise in sexualized paid advertisements appearing for some users, despite such ads violating its terms of use. A CBS News investigation last month\u00a0uncovered hundreds of ads\u00a0on its platforms promoting \"nudify\" apps \u2014 AI tools used to create sexually explicit deepfake images of real people.",
      "Many of these ads targeted male users between the ages of 18 and 65, in the United States and the European Union.",
      "Later in June, Meta sued one of the most prominent nudify app makers, filing a lawsuit in Hong Kong against Joy Timeline HK Limited, the entity behind the app \"CrushAI,\" to prevent it from advertising the app on Meta platforms.",

      "Illustration of where swappable EV batteries are placed in a vehicle\u00a0 (CATL)",
      "CATL swappable EV batteries offer high-efficiency and safe chemistry",
      "The battery uses a blend of lithium iron phosphate and nickel manganese cobalt. This mix offers a balance of performance and safety, with an energy density of more than 160 Wh/kg and 325 Wh/L. The first car to launch with a Choco-SEB swappable EV battery is the Changan Oshan 520. It starts at around 166,800 yuan, or roughly $23,100. The vehicle offers a 320-mile range and is already gaining traction. Changan has delivered over 1,000 units and has received more than 15,000 orders.",

      "Battery swapping stations are expanding across China",
      "CATL is actively building a network of battery swap stations across China. As of now, 34 stations are operating in Chongqing. More than 50 are expected by the end of the year.",
      "By the end of 2025, CATL plans to have 1,000 stations across 31 cities. Each station is compact, requiring the space of just three parking spots, and they can hold up to 48 swappable EV batteries.",
      "CATL is working with major automakers, including GAC, Chery, NIO, FAW and BAIC. The company holds almost 29% of the global EV battery market. With the addition of swappable EV batteries, it is strengthening its position as a leader in the industry.",
      "EV battery swapping station\u00a0 (CATL)",
      "Why swappable EV batteries could change the industry",
      "Swappable EV batteries address one of the biggest challenges facing electric vehicles: long charging times. Instead of waiting 30 minutes or more, drivers can swap batteries in minutes and get back on the road with the ease of a gas-powered car.",
      "The concept is gaining traction in Asian markets and holds promise for global expansion. In the U.S., however, challenges such as vehicle compatibility, automaker collaboration, infrastructure needs and consumer acceptance remain significant.",
      "Some U.S.-based pilots and partnerships, including Stellantis collaborating with Ample for a fleet in Spain, point to growing interest. Still, CATL's Choco-SEB battery swap system has not been announced for rollout in the U.S.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "CATL's goal is to make electric vehicle ownership easier and more appealing. Swappable EV batteries give drivers the flexibility to power up without plugging in. With more stations on the way and compatibility across a wide range of cars, this system could redefine what it means to drive electric. While this technology isn't coming to the U.S. just yet, American EV manufacturers may want to take note, as swappable battery tech could be the game-changer drivers have been waiting for.",

      "What is the Secure Boot vulnerability in Windows 11?",
      "The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-3052, was discovered by firmware security firm Binarly. They found that a legitimate BIOS update tool signed by Microsoft could be abused to tamper with the Windows boot process. Once exploited, the flaw allows attackers to shut off Secure Boot entirely. In the wrong hands, this vulnerability could lead to a new generation of malware. These threats could bypass even the most advanced antivirus or detection software.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Hackers can abuse Microsoft-signed tools to shut down Secure Boot",
      "At the center of the issue is a BIOS-flashing utility built for rugged tablets. Microsoft signed it using its UEFI CA 2011 certificate. Because that certificate is trusted on nearly every Secure Boot-enabled system, the tool can run without raising alarms. The danger lies in how the tool handles a specific NVRAM variable. Binarly's researchers found that it reads this variable blindly, without checking what's inside. That small oversight opens the door to a serious exploit.",
      "In a demonstration, Binarly used a proof-of-concept attack to change this variable's value. By setting it to zero, they were able to overwrite a global setting critical to enforcing Secure Boot. That action completely disabled Secure Boot protections. Once that happens, unsigned UEFI modules can run freely. Attackers can then install stealthy, low-level malware known as bootkits, malware that operates below the Windows operating system itself. For hackers, this method offers the ultimate persistence.",

The same vulnerability affected 14 modules signed with the same trusted certificate. Microsoft responded in June 2025 by revoking the cryptographic hashes of all 14 affected modules. These hashes were added to the Secure Boot revocation list, known as the dbx. This prevents the modules from running during startup. However, this protection is not automatic. Unless users or organizations manually apply the updated dbx, their systems remain vulnerable, even with other patches installed.",

      "Protecting your PC doesn't have to be complicated. Just follow these simple steps to keep hackers at bay and your information safe.",
      "1. Keep your computer updated:\u00a0Software updates aren\u2019t just about new features. They fix serious security issues. In this case, Microsoft has already released a fix for the Secure Boot vulnerability, but it only works if your system is fully updated. Just head to your settings, open Windows Update, and make sure everything is installed. A lot of people delay updates for weeks, but these patches are the first line of defense against threats like this.",
      "2. Don\u2019t install tools you don\u2019t fully understand:\u00a0It might be tempting to download apps that claim to speed up your computer or fix problems, especially ones recommended in YouTube videos or tech forums. But that\u2019s exactly how a lot of threats sneak in. This particular vulnerability came from a legitimate-looking tool that was misused. So, if you\u2019re not sure what something does or if it asks for permission to change how your system boots up, skip it. Or ask someone who knows more, before you click anything.",
      "3. Use strong antivirus software and leave it running:\u00a0Even though this new threat targets something deep inside the system, having strong antivirus protection still helps catch related malware. If you're on Windows, Defender is already built in and does a decent job. But if you don\u2019t want to rely on Windows\u2019 built-in tools, use a third-party antivirus.",

      "4. Restart your computer every now and then:\u00a0This one sounds basic, but it matters. A lot of updates don\u2019t fully apply until after a restart. If you keep putting your computer to sleep or hibernating it for days at a time, your system might still be stuck in an unsafe state. Try to restart it at least every couple of days, or whenever an update asks for it.",
      "5. Don\u2019t ignore warnings from Windows or your antivirus:\u00a0If something pops up telling you a file looks dangerous or that an update is needed, pay attention. It\u2019s easy to get into the habit of closing these messages without reading them, but that\u2019s how problems get missed. If a warning looks confusing or too technical, take a screenshot or a photo, and ask someone for help. The important thing is not to ignore it and move on.",
      "6. Remove your personal data from people-search sites:\u00a0Even if hackers don't directly target you through the Secure Boot flaw, many cyberattacks begin by gathering personal information that's easily found online. This can include your full name, address, phone number and even the names of your relatives. Data broker websites collect and publish this information without your consent, putting you at greater risk. Using a personal data removal service helps you reduce your online exposure and make it harder for bad actors to target you.",

      "PARALYZED MAN SPEAKS AND SINGS WITH AI BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE",
      "A woman wearing non-invasive brain technology\u00a0 (Carnegie Mellon University)",
      "How noninvasive brain tech turns thought into action",
      "Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have made significant progress with noninvasive brain technology. They use electroencephalography (EEG) to detect the brain's electrical activity when someone thinks about moving a finger. Artificial intelligence, specifically deep learning algorithms, then decodes these signals and translates them into commands for a robotic hand. In their study, participants managed to move two or even three robotic fingers at once, just by imagining the motion. The system achieved over 80% accuracy for two-finger tasks. For three-finger tasks, accuracy was over 60%. All of this happened in real time.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Meeting the challenge of finger-level control",
      "Achieving separate movement for each robotic finger is a real challenge. The brain areas responsible for finger movement are small. Their signals often overlap, which makes it hard to distinguish between them. However, advances in noninvasive brain technology and deep learning have made it possible to pick up on these subtle differences.",
      "The research team used a neural network called EEGNet. They fine-tuned it for each participant. Because of this, the system allowed for smooth, natural control of the robotic fingers. The movements closely matched how a real hand works.",
      "A robotic finger being controlled by non-invasive brain technology\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why noninvasive brain tech matters for everyday life",
      "For people with limited hand function, even small improvements can make a huge difference. Noninvasive brain technology eliminates the need for surgery because the system is external and easy to use. In addition, this technology provides natural and intuitive control. It enables a person to move a robotic hand by simply thinking about the corresponding finger movements.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "The accessibility of noninvasive brain technology means it can be used in clinics and homes and by a wide range of people. For example, it enables participation in everyday tasks, such as typing or picking up small objects that might otherwise be difficult or impossible to perform. This approach can benefit stroke survivors and people with spinal cord injuries. It can also help anyone interested in enhancing their abilities.",
      "What's next for noninvasive brain tech?",
      "While the progress is exciting, there are still challenges ahead. Noninvasive brain technology needs to improve even further at filtering out noise and adapting to individual differences. However, with ongoing advances in deep learning and sensor technology, these systems are becoming more reliable and easier to use. Researchers are already working to expand the technology for more complex tasks.",
      "As a result, assistive robotics could soon become a part of more homes and workplaces.",
      "Illustration of how the noninvasive brain technology works\u00a0 (Carnegie Mellon University)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Noninvasive brain technology is opening up possibilities that once seemed out of reach. The idea of moving a robotic hand just by thinking about it could make daily life easier and more independent for many people. As researchers continue to improve these systems, it will be interesting to see how this technology shapes the way we interact with the world around us.",

      "Illustration of a woman using MFA. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is multi-factor authentication?",
      "Multi-factor authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection to your accounts. Instead of relying only on a password, MFA requires you to verify your identity using two or more methods. These can include SMS codes, authenticator apps, or physical security keys.",
      "MFA vs. two-factor authentication",
      "Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a type of MFA that uses exactly two verification methods. MFA, on the other hand, can involve two or more factors. For example, logging into your bank might require a password and a code from an app-this is MFA in action.",
      "Which multi-Factor authentication method is best?",
      "Not all websites and apps support every type of MFA, so your choice may depend on what's available. Here's how the main options compare:",
      "Physical security keys: These offer the highest security and are resistant to phishing and malware. However, they're less convenient and not universally supported. If you lose your key, you'll need a backup method.SMS text messages: SMS is easy to use and widely supported, but it's the least secure. Hackers can intercept or redirect text messages, making this method vulnerable.Authenticator apps: These apps strike a balance between security and convenience. They're less likely to be hacked and work on most smartphones. However, not every service supports them, and you may need internet or cell service to use some features.",

      "Is there a one-size-fits-all solution?",
      "Unfortunately, there's no universal MFA solution for every account. The best approach is to use the strongest MFA method each service supports. Whenever possible, choose an authenticator app or a physical security key over SMS.",
      "Top multi-factor authentication apps",
      "Using a\u00a0multi-factor authentication app is one of the best ways to protect your online identity. Here are some of the top-rated options available for iPhone and Android:",
      "Microsoft Authenticator app. (Microsoft)",
      "The Microsoft Authenticator app gives you an easy, secure sign-in experience for all your accounts and gives you additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work, and school accounts. It can use multi-factor authentication with a one-time passcode, can go password-less by using your phone instead of a password to log in, or can use autofill passwords for you. It's easy to use and can keep multiple accounts safe and secure for you.",
      "Twilio Authy app. (Authy)",
      "Twilio Authy is another great app that you can use for all your accounts, including Facebook, Dropbox, Amazon, Gmail, and thousands more. It provides secure cloud-encrypted backups so that you will never lose access to your accounts, even if you lose your device. The app uses the same algorithms as many banks and the NSA use to protect their information, so you can pretty much guarantee that you'll be safe. Plus, you can even use it if you're offline or in airplane mode.",
      "Google Authentication app. (Google)",
      "The Google Authenticator app will give you an extra layer of security for your online apps. You can sync your authenticator codes to your Google Account and across your devices. It offers support for multiple accounts, and you can transfer accounts between devices by using a QR code. Plus, you can choose the type of code generation used that best suits your needs, and it works without a network or cellular connection.",
      "Aegis Authenticator ap. (Aegis)",
      "The Aegis Authenticator app is a free option for Android users. It is a great app to protect your online accounts from hackers and phishing. It adds an extra layer of security by generating one-time codes that you need to enter alone with your password. This way, even if a hacker steals your password, they won\u2019t be able to access your account with your phone. The Aegis Authenticator app also lets you customize and organize your accounts, backup and restore your data, and use it offline.",
      "Why you should also use a password manager",
      "While multi-factor authentication adds critical protection, it works best when combined with strong, unique passwords for every account. That\u2019s where a password manager comes in. Instead of trying to memorize dozens of complex passwords, a password manager securely stores them for you and automatically fills them in when needed. It can generate strong, random passwords, store them in an encrypted vault, and sync across your devices so you always have access. Using NordPass along with multi-factor authentication is one of the best strategies to keep your accounts and personal data safe from hackers.",

      "A doctor\u2019s hand pointing at a brain scan. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The secret to how fast we age is in the brain",
      "The DunedinPACNI was named after the Dunedin Study, which followed over 1,000 people since their birth in the 1970s. Researchers analyzed decades of data, looking at factors like blood pressure, BMI, cholesterol, glucose, kidney function, and even dental health, to come up with a unique \"aging score\" for each participant. The new MRI-based AI brain scan can predict this score with surprising accuracy from a scan taken at age 45.",
      "Brain aging predicts both physical and mental decline",
      "Participants whose aging scores were faster showed early signs of memory-related brain changes, such as shrinkage of the hippocampus. Follow-up studies of people aged between 52 and 89 showed that those aging rapidly were 60% more likely to develop dementia, 18% more likely to be diagnosed with chronic illnesses, and 40% more likely to die within the same period compared to those who were aging at a slower pace. This data shows that brain aging and overall physical decline are closely linked.",

      "DunedinPACNI is the future of preventative healthcare",
      "The team believes DunedinPACNI could change the landscape of preventive medicine. If it were possible to spot health risks early through an AI brain scan, at-risk individuals might be motivated to make healthier lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, and stress management). It could also help healthcare providers evaluate the effectiveness of treatment and slow the progression of age-related diseases.",

      "Scientific evidence: Emojis boost closeness and responsiveness",
      "A recent study led by Eun Huh at The University of Texas at Austin put this idea to the test. Researchers asked 260 adults to read text conversations that were identical except for one thing: the presence of emojis. Participants then rated how responsive and engaged their conversation partner appeared to be.",
      "The results? Messages with emojis made people feel their partners were more attentive and emotionally engaged. This perceived responsiveness led to greater feelings of closeness, higher relationship satisfaction, and even increased likability. And it didn't matter whether the emoji was a smiley face or a simple object; what mattered was that it matched the tone of the message.",

      "Why emojis strengthen relationships in digital communication",
      "Emojis act as digital body language. In face-to-face conversations, we rely on tone, facial expressions, and gestures to show we care. In texts, emojis fill that gap by adding emotional nuance and clarity. They can make your intentions clear, reduce misunderstandings, and help your messages feel more personal and warm.",
      "Emojis signal attentiveness:\u00a0Dropping an emoji in your reply shows you're not just skimming the conversation, you're engaged.They add emotional context: Whether it's a heart, a laughing face, or a thumbs-up, emojis help convey your feelings instantly.They work for everyone: The study found that age, gender, and even how often you use emojis don't change their positive effect, as long as the emoji fits the message.",

      "Do all emojis equally enhance relationship closeness?",
      "Interestingly, the type of emoji, whether a smiling face or a random object, didn't make a difference in how responsive the sender seemed. What matters most is that the emoji is emotionally consistent with your message. So, don't stress over picking the \"perfect\" emoji; just make sure it fits the mood of your text.",
      "A woman using emojis in a text exchange with a frien. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Emojis in texts: More than just fun, a tool for connection",
      "While emojis can sometimes be ambiguous or misunderstood, especially in sarcastic or complex conversations, their overall impact is positive. They're a modern twist on age-old ways of adding nonverbal cues to written messages, like underlining or using exclamation marks. And with billions of emojis sent every day, they're clearly here to stay.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "In a world where so much of our communication happens through screens, finding ways to stay emotionally connected is more important than ever. Emojis offer a simple, effective way to show attentiveness and warmth, making your texts and your relationships stronger.",

      "Google has taken a major step toward the future of clean energy by partnering with Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), an MIT spin-out working to build one of the world\u2019s first commercial fusion reactors. This Google fusion deal marks a pivotal moment for the tech giant as it looks to secure reliable, carbon-free power for its growing AI operations.",

      "A person browses Google on a laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Inside Google\u2019s historic fusion power deal",
      "Google will purchase 200 megawatts (MW) of electricity from CFS\u2019s planned ARC fusion power plant in Chesterfield County, Virginia. This amount of power could support roughly 150,000 to 200,000 homes. More likely, it will help run Google\u2019s expanding network of AI data centers. The actual usage will depend on how Google allocates the electricity.",
      "This is Google\u2019s first energy deal involving fusion technology. It is also the largest fusion power purchase agreement signed so far. The ARC plant is projected to begin operations in the early 2030s, though fusion projects often face delays. While the electricity does not yet exist, the deal highlights growing demand for long-term, clean energy solutions.",
      "Steam rises from cooling towers at a nuclear facility. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How nuclear fusion works and why it matters for clean energy",
      "Fusion is the same process that powers the sun. Instead of splitting atoms like traditional nuclear power, fusion forces hydrogen atoms to fuse together at extremely high temperatures. This reaction releases enormous amounts of energy. It does not produce greenhouse gases or long-lived radioactive waste.",
      "Scientists have worked on fusion for decades, but no one has produced fusion power at commercial scale yet. CFS aims to change that with its SPARC demonstration reactor, now under construction in Massachusetts. The larger ARC plant is planned to deliver commercial fusion energy.",
      "Hands framing the sun during a bright orange sunset. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Google invests in fusion to meet rising AI energy demands",
      "Google\u2019s energy needs are growing quickly as it scales up artificial intelligence models and data infrastructure. Since 2010, the company has invested in renewable sources like wind, solar, and geothermal. However, these sources are not always available when needed.",
      "Fusion could solve this problem by providing round-the-clock clean energy. By signing this agreement, Google is securing future power and helping to speed up fusion technology development. The company has also expanded its investment in CFS to support the ARC project.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Google\u2019s new partnership with CFS is the largest fusion energy deal ever signed. The company will purchase 200 MW of clean power from a future reactor in Virginia. The ARC plant is expected to come online in the early 2030s. Google is the first major company to sign on as a customer for commercial fusion energy. Unlike traditional nuclear power, fusion produces no carbon emissions and no long-lived radioactive waste. It also offers consistent, 24/7 electricity. As Google\u2019s AI systems drive up energy demand, this deal shows how tech companies are looking beyond wind and solar for scalable, future-proof solutions. If CFS delivers, fusion could finally move from science experiment to real-world power source.",

      "Qantas confirmed that hackers did not access credit card details, financial information, or passport data. The airline quickly stopped the breach and began telling affected customers. We reached out to Qantas for comment. They referred us to their official update, which says the system remains secure. No one compromised frequent flyer accounts or passwords.

It provides storm-based alerts, including tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, thunderstorms, and winter storms, through voice and push notifications that can wake your device even if it is locked or on silent. The app uses location-based alerts to reduce false alarms by notifying you only when severe weather impacts your exact location within a county.",
      "Another excellent option is the American Red Cross Emergency app, available for both iPhone and Android devices. This app allows you to customize NOAA alerts for a wide range of hazards, including tornadoes, floods, and hurricanes. You can set unique alert sounds for different types of emergencies and choose which locations you want to monitor, making it perfect for keeping tabs on loved ones or property in various places. However, keep in mind that while this app provides timely notifications, it may not always override Do Not Disturb mode in the same way that Wireless Emergency Alerts can.",
      "Tornado and severe lightning. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why a separate NOAA Weather Radio is still essential",
      "NOAA Weather Radio is a nationwide network of radio stations operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It continuously broadcasts official weather information and emergency alerts directly from the National Weather Service. These broadcasts provide vital, real-time warnings about severe weather events such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and other natural disasters. These work even if your cellular connection goes down or your phone fails to emit a warning.",
      "To receive these alerts clearly and loudly, a dedicated NOAA Weather Radio device is essential. One highly recommended option is the Raynic Emergency Weather Radio. This portable, multi-functional device tunes into all seven NOAA weather channels and automatically announces loud alerts when threatening weather conditions arise.

That's exactly what researchers in Australia are doing: turning leftover coffee grounds into bricks. These bricks from recycled coffee grounds aren't just a quirky experiment. They're strong, sustainable, and could seriously cut down on construction emissions and costs. Here's how your daily brew is becoming the foundation for greener buildings.",

      "Firing bricks made from coffee waste. (Swinburne University)",
      "Bricks from recycled coffee grounds are cheaper and greener to make",
      "At Swinburne University of Technology, researchers found a creative way to cut both construction emissions and material costs by making bricks from recycled coffee grounds. Instead of letting all that coffee waste go to landfills, they partnered with local coffee shops to collect spent grounds straight from espresso machines. Then, by blending the coffee waste with natural clay and an alkali activator, they developed a recipe for low-emission bricks that are not only more sustainable but also faster and cheaper to produce than traditional clay ones.",
      "Coffee grounds from an espresso machine. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why bricks from recycled coffee grounds are a smarter use of waste",
      "Coffee is the world\u2019s second most popular beverage, beaten only by tea. As such, there are approximately two and a quarter billion cups of coffee consumed daily. If you average out the espressos, cappuccinos, and americanos, then each cup brews using roughly eleven grams of freshly ground coffee. However, that leads to over nine million tonnes of coffee bean grounds. In turn, this generates an estimated eighteen million tonnes of damp, burnt byproduct dumped into landfills every single year. So, there is an abundance of supply, but how can coffee grounds be more efficient than traditional clay bricks?",
      "How bricks from recycled coffee grounds cut construction costs",
      "This innovative method of using spent coffee grounds drastically reduces the energy needed to mold bricks. Even low-quality traditional clay bricks must be baked in a kiln at over 900 degrees Celsius. These new coffee bricks only need to be cooked at 200 degrees Celsius. That\u2019s an 80 percent reduction in energy usage, meaning that these bricks are significantly more efficient for both the environment and manufacturing costs.",
      "The lead scientist, Dr. Wong, claimed,\u00a0\"It\u2019s lighter on energy, faster to produce, and designed to reduce electricity-related CO\u2082 emissions by up to 80 percent per unit.\"",
      "Not only are the manufacturing costs lower, but experts claim these coffee bricks are remarkably durable. According to Green Brick, they double \"the Australian minimum standard for strength.\"",
      "Analysis of spent coffee grounds. (Swinburne University)",
      "Bricks from recycled coffee grounds offer sustainable building solutions",
      "In June, Swinburne University of Technology took a major step forward by signing an IP licensing deal with Australian company Green Brick. This partnership paves the way for using bricks made from recycled coffee grounds in real-world construction projects. Green Brick founder Philip Ng explained,\u00a0\"For the last century, materials have been judged by one thing: cost per square meter. But in the next chapter, we'll judge them by carbon, transparency, and circularity, and those metrics favor a new product.\"",
      "While Swinburne's team is transforming coffee waste, others around the world are exploring similar paths. In London, a group of researchers has developed \"sugarcrete,\" a bio-brick made from sugarcane waste. As these kinds of innovations gain traction, recycled organic materials are starting to look like a practical and scalable alternative for the construction industry.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "It turns out your coffee habit might be more powerful than you think, not just for waking you up, but for building a cleaner future. Bricks from recycled coffee grounds are a creative solution to two big problems: construction pollution and coffee waste. As more researchers and companies get behind ideas like this, the future of sustainable building is looking a lot more grounded and a little more caffeinated.",

      "ChatGPT app on a smartphone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How AI changes the learning experience",
      "AI-powered platforms can personalize education by adapting to each learner's pace, style, and needs. This tailored approach is credited with boosting engagement and, in some cases, improving retention rates by up to 30%. Features like adaptive quizzes, intelligent tutoring, and spaced repetition are designed to reinforce memory and help information stick. For students who struggle with traditional methods, AI can break down barriers, making learning more accessible and inclusive.",
      "The double-edged sword: Convenience vs. deep learning",
      "However, recent research suggests that the very convenience AI offers may undermine long-term learning retention. In a series of experiments at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, participants who used LLMs like ChatGPT to research topics showed weaker understanding and produced less original insights compared to those who used traditional search engines. The reason? AI often delivers concise, ready-made answers, reducing the need for active engagement, critical thinking, and synthesis-key ingredients for lasting learning.",
      "A similar pattern emerged in a 2024 study involving high school students: those who relied on AI tools performed better on immediate assignments but scored lower on later tests that required recall and understanding without AI assistance. The researchers found that passive use of AI, simply asking for answers, can lead to superficial learning, where information is quickly forgotten.",
      "ChatGPT being used on a laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why AI affects learning retention more than you think",
      "Experts point to a \"motivation problem.\" When learners believe AI is smarter than they are, they may stop putting in effort, leading to shallower processing and weaker retention. Over-reliance on AI can also reduce opportunities to practice critical thinking and problem-solving, skills that are essential for deep, durable learning.",
      "Finding the right balance with AI and learning retention",
      "Despite these concerns, AI is not inherently bad for learning. When used thoughtfully, such as prompting students to critique AI-generated drafts or ask probing questions, AI can encourage deeper engagement and support retention. The key is to integrate AI as a supplement, not a substitute, for active learning and human guidance.",
      "Educators play a vital role in this balance. By designing lessons that require students to interact with AI critically and reflect on what they learn, teachers can harness AI's benefits while minimizing its drawbacks.",
      "ChatGPT running on a smartphone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "If you eat a bunch of candy all the time, you are likely going to gain weight and help your dentist with a car payment when cavities show up. AI is a lot like candy.\u00a0 Moderation is the name of the game. Using AI in smart ways rather than in abundance replacing your own critical thinking can be bad for your health.",
      "AI is reshaping education, offering unprecedented personalization and accessibility. Yet, when it comes to learning retention, the way we use AI matters as much as the technology itself. Passive reliance on AI tools can erode deep understanding, but strategic, active engagement can turn AI into a powerful ally for lasting learning. As AI continues to evolve, fostering critical thinking and self-directed learning will be essential to ensure that knowledge doesn't just come quickly-but sticks for the long haul.",

      "How researchers turn smartphones into low-cost data centers",
      "Turning old smartphones into data centers is surprisingly affordable. Researchers removed the batteries (to prevent chemical leaks) and used external power sources. They then connected the phones, placed them in 3D-printed holders, and created a working prototype. These mini-data centers have already been tested in real-world scenarios, like monitoring marine life underwater tasks that would normally require expensive equipment.",

      "Artificial intelligence and robotics may help with nursing shortage.",
      "A breakthrough in medical technology could soon change how sinus infections are treated. Scientists have created micro-robots for sinus infection treatment that can enter the nasal cavity, eliminate bacteria directly at the source, and exit without harming surrounding tissue.

      "A woman with a sinus infection. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What are micro-robots for sinus infection treatment?",
      "These microscopic robots are smaller than a speck of dust. They are made of magnetic particles enhanced with copper atoms. Doctors insert them through a narrow duct in the nostril. Once inside, the micro-robots are guided by magnetic fields to reach the infected area.",
      "At that point, a fiber optic light heats the particles and triggers a chemical reaction. This reaction breaks through thick mucus and destroys harmful bacteria at the infection site. As a result, treatment becomes faster, more precise, and far less invasive.",
      "This latest advancement comes from a collaboration of researchers at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, along with universities in Guangxi, Shenzhen, Jiangsu, Yangzhou, and Macau. Their work, published in\u00a0\"Science Robotics,\" has helped move micro-robotic medical technology closer to real-world applications.",
      "Why use micro-robots instead of antibiotics?",
      "Traditional antibiotics circulate throughout the entire body. In contrast, micro-robots target only the infected area. This reduces side effects and lowers the risk of antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, patients may recover faster because the treatment goes straight to the source.",
      "A woman with a sinus infection. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Are micro-robots safe?",
      "So far, animal trials have shown promising results. Micro-robots successfully cleared infections in pig sinuses and live rabbits, without causing tissue damage. However, scientists still need to ensure that every robot exits the body after treatment. Leftover particles could pose long-term risks.",
      "In addition, public acceptance remains a challenge. The idea of tiny machines inside the body makes some people uncomfortable. Nevertheless, experts believe those fears will fade over time.",
      "What other uses are possible?",
      "Researchers are already exploring how micro-robots could treat infections in the bladder, stomach, intestines, and bloodstream. Several teams around the world are working to make the technology more advanced and adaptable for deep internal use. If successful, these innovations could revolutionize the way we fight bacteria in the human body.",

    "story": [
      "Kurt the CyberGuy addresses virtual private network blocks.",
      "Your personal data is a highly valuable commodity. Companies often treat it like a resource to be mined and traded. In practice, this means that everything you do on the Internet, what you search, what you click, where you shop, feeds a vast industry. Many people feel they have little control over this.",
      "In fact, a Pew Research survey found that roughly six in ten Americans say it's not possible to go through daily life without having data collected about them. We may use \"free\" services, but we usually pay in data. As the U.S. Federal Trade Commission explains,\u00a0\"The things we do throughout the course of our day give businesses access to information about our habits, tastes, and activities. Some might use it to deliver targeted ads to you... Others might sell or share that information\".",

      "A person working on a laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How does your data get collected",
      "Almost everything we do online or even offline can generate data. Here are some common sources:",
      "1) Social media platforms:\u00a0Social networks like Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter collect a wide array of data from your posts, likes, location check-ins, connections, and more. Social media companies harvest sensitive data about individuals' activities, interests, personal characteristics, and purchasing habits. In short, even casual sharing on these sites adds to a detailed profile about you.",
      "2) Online shopping and loyalty programs:\u00a0Every time you shop online or use a store loyalty card, data about your purchases is recorded. Retailers track what you buy, when, and how (with coupon or card). Even offline purchases using a rewards card feed into databases. Over time, this builds a detailed purchasing history linked to your identity.",
      "3) Browser fingerprinting: This technique collects bits of information about your browser and device (such as which plugins you have, screen size, time zone, etc.) to create a unique \"fingerprint.\" That fingerprint can identify you uniquely across sites, even without cookies.",
      "4) Mobile app identifiers and SDKs:\u00a0On phones, each app often reports usage data back to its developer or advertising partners. For example, iOS and Android assign a unique advertising ID to your device, and apps can read that ID and log your activity. Many apps also include third-party SDKs (software development kits) from analytics or ad companies that silently collect data on your in-app behavior and send it off for profiling.",
      "5) Cookies and tracking pixels:\u00a0A cookie is a small file your browser saves from a website. It lets the site recognize your device later. A tracking pixel (also called a web beacon) is a tiny, invisible image embedded in a webpage or email that reports back when you view it. Together, cookies and pixels allow companies to \"remember\" your visits, log which pages you view, and build a record of your browsing even after you leave a site.",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What data brokers are and how hey sell your information",
      "Data brokers are companies whose entire business is buying, aggregating, and reselling personal information. They collect data about you from many places and bundle it into profiles. This industry is massive (estimated at around $200 billion per year) with thousands of firms globally. Big-name brokers include companies like Experian, Acxiom, Epsilon, and many lesser-known \"people search\" sites.",
      "Using sources like public records, social media, data breaches, and data brokers assemble extensive dossiers on individuals. They collect ordinary details such as names, addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, as well as sensitive traits: gender, marital status, education level, occupation, income range, hobbies, and interests. Brokers may even buy data about your health (like what drugs you purchase) or political views gathered from public voter records or social media activity.",
      "After building these profiles, brokers sell or license them to anyone who will pay. Typical customers include Marketers and Advertisers, Insurers and Lenders, People Search and Data Services, Employers and Background Checkers, and more.",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What happens to your data after it\u2019s sold",
      "Once your data is in the hands of others, it\u2019s used to profile and segment people in ways that can affect what we see and the opportunities we receive. Profiling simply means grouping people by common traits or habits, such as \"young urban pet owners\" or \"people likely to buy a new car this year.\" These profiles are then used to serve you targeted ads and offers.",
      "Targeted advertising can feel creepy or manipulative. For example, you might notice ads for products you only briefly mentioned in a private message or web search, because your data was shared with dozens of advertisers behind the scenes. Every time you load a page with ads, your data profile is broadcast to companies through automated ad auctions, and they bid to show you ads.",
      "Beyond advertising, there can be more serious consequences such as identity theft and stalking. Broader profiles mean more tempting targets for criminals. People-search websites, which get data from brokers, can show your address, phone number, family members\u2019 names, and even your Social Security number. This information can be used to steal your identity or harass you.",
      "How you can take back control",
      "There are many ways to take control of your personal data, several of which are listed in the section below, but the most effective is to consider a data removal service.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",
      "A personal data removal service can help you remove all this personal information from the internet. It has a very clean interface and will scan 195 websites for your information and remove it and keep it removed.",

      "4 ways additional ways to protect your data",
      "You can take steps to reclaim some control over your data, and you don\u2019t have to be a tech expert to do it. Here are some practical tips and resources:",
      "1) Review privacy settings: Take a few minutes to explore the privacy and security settings on the services you use. For example, limit who can see your social media posts, disable unnecessary location-sharing on your phone, and consider turning off ad personalization on accounts like Google and Facebook. Most browsers let you block third-party cookies or clear tracking data. The FTC suggests comparing the privacy notices of different sites and apps and choosing ones that let you opt out of sharing when possible.",
      "2) Use privacy-friendly tools: Install browser extensions or plugins that block ads and trackers. You might switch to a more private search engine (like DuckDuckGo or Brave) that doesn\u2019t log your queries. Consider using a browser\u2019s \"incognito\" or private mode when you don\u2019t want your history saved. Even small habits, like logging out of accounts when not in use or using a password manager, make you less trackable.",
      "3) Be cautious with personal data: Think twice before sharing extra details. Don\u2019t fill out online surveys or quizzes that ask for personal or financial information unless you trust the source. Create separate email addresses for sign-ups (so marketing emails don\u2019t go to your main inbox). Only download apps from official stores, and check app permissions.",
      "4) Opt out of data broker lists: Many data brokers offer ways to opt out or delete your information, though it can be a tedious process. For example, there are sites like Privacy Rights Clearinghouse or the Whitepages opt-out page that list popular brokers and their opt-out procedures. The FTC\u2019s consumer guide \"Your Guide to Protecting Your Privacy Online\" includes tips on opting out of targeted ads and removing yourself from people-search databases. (Keep in mind you may have to repeat this every few months.)",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "You may not be able to completely escape the data economy, but you can limit its impact on your life. By using privacy tools, being mindful of what you share, and demanding transparency, you make it harder for companies to treat your personal information as a free-for-all. Each small step, whether it's tweaking settings, clicking \"opt out,\" or simply pausing before hitting \"submit\" on a form, helps you regain control. Ultimately, pushing for accountability from businesses and lawmakers is also part of the solution. After all, privacy is a fundamental right that deserves strong safeguards for everyone.",

      "The robots are part of a bigger innovation plan",
      "These robots are part of a larger effort to modernize how the U.K. manages its aging water infrastructure. The initiative isn't just a university research project-it's supported by the U.K.'s water regulator, OFWAT (the Water Services Regulation Authority), and involves several collaborative projects.",
      "One of these projects focuses on using Pipebots to inspect live, pressurized wastewater pipes, also known as raising mains. The goal is to catch problems early and make repairs before leaks cause pollution.",
      "Another project, called \"no dig leak repair,\" is working on ways to fix leaks from inside the water mains themselves, completely avoiding the need for disruptive roadwork.",

      "These little robots could be exactly what countries everywhere need to keep their water systems running smoothly. They have the potential to make maintenance cleaner, more affordable, and way more efficient. That's especially important for developing countries where budgets are tight and infrastructure is aging or incomplete. As the pressure to conserve water grows, tools like Pipebots could make a real difference in helping us manage this vital resource more wisely.",

Once jailed by Hamas on charges of theft and corruption, he now commands groups of armed men in Gaza's Rafah who patrol and protect aid convoys while openly challenging Hamas's power. \"We are not a militia,\" he insisted in an interview with Israeli outlet Ynet. \"Call us counter-terror forces. Our goal is to protect Palestinian human rights from Hamas terrorism.\"",
      "Abu Shabab\u2019s group, known as the \"Popular Forces,\" began forming in early 2024 after the IDF entered Rafah, and Hamas lost control of the area. Allegedly under Israeli protection, his men now escort aid trucks, distribute supplies, and assert control over parts of eastern Rafah.",

      "\"The main goal is to provide, for the first time, a comprehensive framework,\u00a0based on all the available information, that has been analyzed and cross-checked from a legal perspective to prove that sexual violence was indeed used as a weapon of war by Hamas on October 7,\" Professor Ruth Halperin-Kaddari, director of the Rackman Center for the Advancement of the Status of Women at Bar-Ilan University, which oversees the Dinah Project, told Fox News Digital.",

      "While accounts of sexual violence, including rape, gang-rape and genital mutilation, emerged quickly following Hamas\u2019 brutal attack that sparked 20 months of\u00a0war in Gaza, some in the international community \u2013 including multiple women\u2019s rights groups \u2013 cast doubt on the reports due to a lack of physical evidence or of victims.",

      "\"Today UANI is exposing the individuals and entities in Iran hiding behind religion to foment terrorism abroad. Threats against the president of the United States and other Americans are a federal crime. Each of these individuals and entities should be sanctioned, indicted, and banned from travel, along with their families, to the United States and its allies,\" a joint statement by former Gov.

      "Johnson has suggested that beneficiaries include able-bodied people who won\u2019t work and are thus \u201cdefrauding the system.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a moral component to what we\u2019re doing. And when you make young men work, it\u2019s good for them, it\u2019s good for their dignity, it\u2019s good for their self-worth, and it\u2019s good for the community that they live in,\u201d he said in May.",
      "That justification rings true to many in his home state, who believe that federal benefits more broadly are going to the wrong people.",
      "Jason Wallace, 37, an accountant working a \u201cNibbles and Noshes\u201d stand at the Walker festival, said that when it comes to Medicaid, \u201cSome of the stuff I\u2019ve heard about [the new law is that it is] trying to keep illegals from taking advantage of our benefits that they don\u2019t pay into at all.\u201d",
      "A common belief is that taxpaying citizens are getting shortchanged, giving rise to feelings of umbrage that Trump has managed to harness.",
      "The new law also makes cuts to a food assistance program known as SNAP. Along with Medicaid, Congress pared back SNAP benefits to create savings that would help offset the cost of extending the tax cuts Trump signed in his first term.",
      "\u201cYou go stand in line and the lady in front of me has her nails done, her hair done and she\u2019s got food stamps. I work too hard for what I get,\u201d said Charles Gennaro, 78, who was among those on the Lake Pontchartrain shoreline in Mandeville on July 4 as a bluegrass band played on an outdoor stage.",
      "\u201cPeople come into this country for no reason and get things that they shouldn\u2019t get,\u201d he added.",
      "Nancy Adams, 50, who also turned out for the celebration in Mandeville, said: \u201cI\u2019m a single mom. I raised my daughter, struggling every day. And yet these illegals come in and they can get everything. I\u2019m paying for them. But I\u2019m struggling to raise my daughter and I don\u2019t qualify for food stamps or anything.\u201d",
      "Independent analyses of the Medicaid program show that most recipients are already employed. KFF released a report in May showing that in 2023, nearly two-thirds of those under 65 receiving Medicaid and not other forms of federal aid were working full or part time. Those who lacked jobs cited reasons that included school attendance, care-giving duties, illness, disability or other causes.",
      "A separate KFF report that month showed that 95% of Medicaid payments last year were made properly, while the vast majority of improper payments sprang from paperwork errors or administrative actions.",
      "Robin Rudowitz, director of KFF\u2019s program on Medicaid and the uninsured, cited government estimates that 10 million people could lose health insurance coverage under the new law.",
      "\u201cThese are not people who were fraudulently on the program,\u201d she said.",
      "Heading toward DeRidder in the western part of the state, a driver sees billboards advertising legal services for those who\u2019ve endured car wrecks or injury or are in bankruptcy. A city of about 10,000, DeRidder is part of Johnson\u2019s congressional district.",
      "A Walmart in the city was doing brisk business last Sunday, with people stocking up on groceries and supplies. Some customers of varying ages weren\u2019t ambulatory and used motorized carts. Outside the store, Don Heston, 41, who works in the oil and gas industry, described Medicaid as a \u201cgreat idea,\u201d but one that \u201cneeds serious rework.\u201d",
      "\u201cLots of people who are on it shouldn\u2019t be. You have people that have paid into it their entire life. They\u2019re physically messed up. They can\u2019t work any more and they can\u2019t get it. But you have people who have never worked a job with any meaning and they\u2019re getting it that quick\u201d he said, snapping his fingers, \u201cbecause they know the ins and outs of the system.\u201d",
      "Weeding out those who are abusing the program might be a worthy goal, but Medicaid advocates worry that cuts won\u2019t be made with such precision. Those who truly need the help may get caught up in the purge, according to Keith Liederman, CEO of Clover, the organization that serves Alyssa Custard\u2019s mother.",
      "\u201cIn the state of Louisiana, it\u2019s many of the same staunch supporters of our president who are going to suffer as a result of this bill, and especially in rural areas of our state, of which there are many, many struggling individuals and families, many of whom are supporters of the president,\u201d Liederman said.",
      "Clover is bracing for severe cuts that could cause it to shutter its adult day care service entirely, Liederman added.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s confounding to me how so many people throughout our country, when they think about people who are economically poor and struggling, think that there\u2019s something wrong with them, that they\u2019re not trying hard enough, that they\u2019re not working hard enough, that they\u2019re shirkers trying to abuse the system,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThat couldn\u2019t be further from the truth based on my direct experience in working with thousands of people who are in these positions. I\u2019ve never seen people who work harder and who are trying harder to get out of poverty than the people that we serve and so many others in our community.\u201d",
      "If health centers that rely on Medicaid patients are forced to close, it will affect patients with other forms of health insurance as well, who also rely on those providers in their community.",
      "At the David Raines Community Health Centers in northwest Louisiana, which includes several clinics in Johnson\u2019s district, officials are preparing to make cuts to their services as they anticipate a significant drop-off in the number of their patients with health insurance as a result of changes in the bill, David Raines CEO Willie White said.",
      "\u201cIt really is going to be devastating, to say the least, for the patients that we serve and for other community health centers as a whole, as to how we\u2019re going to be able to continue to provide the level of access that we currently provide,\u201d White said. \u201cI\u2019m just not sure how it\u2019s going to work.\u201d",
      "Clocking in at nearly 900 pages, the act brims with policy changes that will take time for voters across the country to digest. Trump directed Republican lawmakers to pass it by July 4, and they complied. So far, the bulk of this pro-Trump state seems pleased that they did. But some who voted for Trump are waiting and watching. They know the new law is big; they\u2019re just not sure yet whether it\u2019s beautiful.",
      "Jennifer Bonano, 52, is a retail clerk who came to the festival in Walker. Sitting in her folding chair, she said she voted for Trump but isn\u2019t persuaded yet that the new law is all that was advertised.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t want the people that need the Medicaid and that need the food assistance to be suffering,\u201d she said.",
      "As for the vote she cast back in November, she said: \u201cI\u2019m still wondering.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t know just yet what the outcome is going to be, because with Trump he doesn\u2019t know when to hush,\u201d Bonano said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to be good outcome or a bad outcome, anything he does.\u201d"

In some posts, Grok appeared to respond in the voice of Musk.",

      "Even for these superwealthy teams, every little bit helps.",
      "Here are some key storylines to focus on ahead of the final, as Luis Enrique\u2019s PSG is the clear favorite over Enzo Maresca\u2019s Chelsea.",
      "Engrossing midfield battle awaits",
      "PSG has the best midfield in the world. Fabian Ruiz, Jo\u00e3o Neves and Vitinha are cohesive, press in a pack and, when they win it back, are very good at keeping the ball and keeping the pressure on. Chelsea has Moises Caicedo and Enzo Fernandez, a combative duo adept at breaking up the rhythm and flow of an opposition\u2019s midfielders \u2014 but there are only two of them against PSG\u2019s whirling dervish of a midfield.",
      "PSG\u2019s midfield trio makes it tick and sets off everything else. However, if it doesn\u2019t win the ball back quickly enough, then the three attackers of Ousmane Dembele, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and Desire Doue can\u2019t stay high and be a constant threat to Chelsea\u2019s defense, and they become more isolated despite their incredible work rate. Chelsea\u2019s Caicedo has been in sensational form for some time and will relish his role as the chief disruptor. PSG will do its best to try and smother Fernandez. It will be intriguing to see if Maresca starts with another more defensive midfielder to match up with PSG\u2019s trio, or sticks with his fluid 4-2-3-1 system and asks Cole Palmer to drop deeper from his No. 10 role to occupy one of PSG\u2019s midfielders and impact its incredible rhythm.",
      "Adding extra intrigue to this area of the pitch is the fact that both PSG and Chelsea love to invert their full-backs, with Achraf Hakimi and Nuno Mendes often popping up in midfield and central areas, and Chelsea\u2019s Marc Cucurella and Malo Gusto or Reece James doing the same thing. That makes a crucial area of the pitch even more clogged and unpredictable. Bring on the chaos.",
      "More from Sports",
      "Chargers running back Najee Harris injured in fireworks \u2018mishap\u2019 on Fourth of JulyNovak Djokovic\u2019s Grand Slam title drought continues after Wimbledon semifinal lossClub World Cup tests U.S. readiness to host next year\u2019s mega-event",

      "Novak Djokovic\u2019s Grand Slam title drought continues after Wimbledon semifinal loss",
      "Club World Cup tests U.S. readiness to host next year\u2019s mega-event",
      "Will Ousmane Dembele or Jo\u00e3o Pedro be the goal-scoring hero?",
      "Both teams have received a big boost during this tournament: the arrival of attackers who can be clinical and provide a crucial cutting edge. Ousmane Dembele returned from injury during the knockout rounds and has made a huge difference. His manager is calling for him to win the Ballon d\u2019Or (the award handed to the best player on the planet) as Dembele\u2019s goals, assists, movement and pressing sum up everything great about this PSG side. But Chelsea received its own massive confidence boost with the signing of Jo\u00e3o Pedro, who has made a huge impact right away.",
      "The Brazilian international came off the bench in his debut and played a big role in Chelsea beating Palmeiras in the quarterfinal. Then, in his first start, he scored two beauties against his boyhood club Fluminense to send Chelsea to this final. Jo\u00e3o Pedro had recently been on the beach relaxing, enjoying his offseason break. Yet just days after signing with Chelsea, he looks set to lead its attack in the FIFA Club World Cup final.",
      "Both PSG and Chelsea get goals from all over their attacking lines, but having Dembele back and Jo\u00e3o Pedro on board now gives them both a dynamic, clinical spearhead to their attack. Of course, Kvaratskhelia and Palmer are mercurial talents for PSG and Chelsea, respectively, and can win any game in a split second with a majestic run, dazzling finish or clever flick. But Ousmane, Dembele and Jo\u00e3o Pedro provide the driving runs and hold-up play to knit everything together, and they have that crucial ruthlessness in front of the goal.",
      "Chelsea may have the deeper squad",
      "After a grueling six-game run to get to the Club World Cup final after an even more exhausting 10-month 2024-25 season that has seen both teams play more than 60 games, this final will likely be decided by which team uses its bench and squad better. And Chelsea has the deeper team with more options, especially in attack.",
      "PSG\u2019s starting lineup is very settled, and off the bench it usually brings in Bradley Barcola to have an impact. After that, it has some talented young midfielders and striker Goncalo Ramos to play cameo roles. Chelsea has an entire attacking unit full of international stars it can bring on to change things and try to turn the game in its favor. Liam Delap, Nicolas Jackson and Noni Madueke would start for plenty of big clubs but will likely be available off the bench in the second half. Captain Reece James could start on the bench too but may be crucial as a hybrid midfielder/full-back as both he and Andrey Santos could come on to give Chelsea an extra boost when it needs it most. Chelsea will aim to keep it tight and stop PSG from dominating the tempo of the game, then look to its bench to see who can provide that extra little spark that could crown it the champion of the world."

In some posts, Grok appeared to respond in the voice of Musk.",
      "After the incident, Grok said in an X post that it was \u201cactively working to remove the inappropriate posts.\u201d On Wednesday, Musk said the issues were \u201cbeing addressed.\u201d",

      "\u201cBecause of the fact that Rosie O\u2019Donnell is not in the best interests of our Great Country, I am giving serious consideration to taking away her Citizenship. She is a Threat to Humanity, and should remain in the wonderful Country of Ireland, if they want her. GOD BLESS AMERICA!\u201d Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social on Saturday.",
      "Constitutionally, the U.S. president doesn\u2019t legally have the power to \u201ctake away\u201d one\u2019s citizenship, as Trump is threatening to do. The 14th Amendment guarantees citizenship to anyone born in the United States. O\u2019Donnell was born in Commack, New York, according to IMDb.",
      "Trump\u2019s post on Saturday comes as his administration has sought to revoke birthright citizenship from the children of parents who are not U.S. citizens, but that has stalled in court.",
      "The president has also threatened to \u201clook\u201d at whether New York City\u2019s Democratic nominee for mayor, Zohran Mamdani, is in the U.S. illegally. There is no evidence that Mamdani is in the U.S. illegally. Mamdani, who was born in Uganda, became a naturalized citizen in 2018.",
      "In a post on Instagram later Saturday, O\u2019Donnell responded to Trump\u2019s Truth Social post, writing, \u201chey donald \u2014 you\u2019re rattled again? 18 years later and I still live rent-free in that collapsing brain of yours.\u201d",

      "The Instagram caption did not mention Jeffrey Epstein \u2014 the disgraced financier who died in 2019 after allegations of sex trafficking \u2014 but the photo O\u2019Donnell posted alongside her caption was one of Trump with his arm around Epstein.",
      "The Trump administration faced criticism from conservative media figures this week after claiming that an \u201cexhaustive review\u201d of files related to Epstein turned up no \u201cincriminating client list\u201d belonging to Epstein.",
      "In her caption, O\u2019Donnell also addressed Trump\u2019s threats to revoke her citizenship, comparing him to the fictional King Joffrey from the popular book series and HBO show \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou want to revoke my citizenship?\u201d O\u2019Donnell wrote.\u2028\u201cGo ahead and try, king joffrey with a tangerine spray tan. i\u2019m not yours to silence\u2028i never was.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s latest attacks against O\u2019Donnell came after she revealed in a March 2025 TikTok post that she had moved to Ireland in January, saying, \u201cWhen it\u2019s safe for all citizens to have equal rights there, in America, that\u2019s when we\u2019ll consider coming back.\u201d",
      "In that same video, O\u2019Donnell also said she was in the process of getting her Irish citizenship, as she has Irish grandparents. The U.S. allows dual citizenship.",
      "In March, during a visit to the White House from Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin, Trump addressed O\u2019Donnell\u2019s move to Ireland.",

      "Trump and O\u2019Donnell have lobbed insults at each other for almost two decades, beginning in 2006 when O\u2019Donnell, then a co-host of \u201cThe View,\u201d was critical of Trump\u2019s decisions regarding a Miss USA winner.",
      "The two exchanged jabs for years after that, but the spat drew headlines again when Trump ran for president in 2015.",
      "He invoked O\u2019Donnell\u2019s name on the debate stage in 2015, when he was asked about his use of the terms \u201cfat pigs,\u201d \u201cdogs,\u201d \u201cslobs\u201d and \u201cdisgusting animals\u201d to describe some women."

      "The musician continued that she cannot take on these projects right now because she has \u201cso many other things\u201d and she \u201ccan\u2019t afford the luxury of getting that emotional right now.\u201d Parton said she will write other songs if they come to her, adding that songwriting is her \u201cjoy\u201d that also happens to be her job.",
      "Dean, a Nashville businessman, and Parton were married in 1966 after meeting two years prior, and kept their relationship out of the public eye.",
      "\u201cCarl and I spent many wonderful years together. Words can\u2019t do justice to the love we shared for over 60 years,\u201d Parton said in a statement shared following his death. \u201cThank you for your prayers and sympathy.\u201d",

      "The decision by a panel of the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., undoes an attempt to wrap up more than two decades of military prosecution beset by legal and logistical troubles. It signals there will be no quick end to the long struggle by the U.S. military and successive administrations to bring to justice the man charged with planning one of the deadliest attacks ever on the United States.",
      "The deal, negotiated over two years and approved by military prosecutors and the Pentagon\u2019s senior official for Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, a year ago, stipulated life sentences without parole for Mohammed and two co-defendants.",

      "Relatives of the Sept. 11 victims were split on the plea deal.

      "Attorneys for the defendants had argued that the agreement was already legally in effect and that Austin, who served under President Joe Biden, acted too late to try to throw it out. A military judge at Guantanamo and a military appeals panel agreed with the defense lawyers.",
      "But, by a 2-1 vote, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found Austin acted within his authority and faulted the military judge\u2019s ruling.",
      "The panel had previously put the agreement on hold while it considered the appeal, first filed by the Biden administration and then continued under President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cHaving properly assumed the convening authority, the Secretary determined that the \u2018families and the American public deserve the opportunity to see military commission trials carried out.\u2019 The Secretary acted within the bounds of his legal authority, and we decline to second-guess his judgment,\u201d judges Patricia Millett and Neomi Rao wrote.",
      "Millett was an appointee of President Barack Obama while Rao was appointed by Trump.",
      "In a dissent, Judge Robert Wilkins, an Obama appointee, wrote, \u201cThe government has not come within a country mile of proving clearly and indisputably that the Military Judge erred.\u201d",
      "Brett Eagleson, who was among the family members who objected to the deal, called Friday\u2019s appellate ruling \u201ca good win, for now.\u201d",
      "\u201cA plea deal allows this to be tucked away into a nice, pretty package, wrapped into a bow and put on a shelf and forgotten about,\u201d said Eagleson, who was 15 when his father, shopping center executive John Bruce Eagleson, was killed in the attacks.",
      "Brett Eagleson was unmoved by the deal\u2019s provisions for the defendants to answer Sept. 11 families\u2019 questions; he wonders how truthful the men would be. In his view, \u201cthe only valid way to get answers and seek the truth is through a trial\u201d and pretrial fact-finding.",
      "Elizabeth Miller, who was 6 when the attacks killed her father, firefighter Douglas Miller, was among those who supported the deal.",
      "\u201cOf course, growing up, a trial would have been great initially,\u201d she said. But \u201cwe\u2019re in 2025, and we\u2019re still at the pretrial stage.\u201d",
      "\u201cI just really don\u2019t think a trial is possible,\u201d said Miller, who also favored the deal because of her opposition to the death penalty in general."

      "Still, the details of whose jobs would be cut remained closely held, and many were shocked to find they were a part of the 15% cut to domestic agency staff. Several career employees who unexpectedly found themselves with pink slips told NBC News they were asked to write speeches and prepare talking points for political appointees on critical issues just days before.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so hard to work somewhere your entire life and then get treated this way,\u201d one veteran civil servant with more than 30 years working at the department told NBC News. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you treat people this way. I really don\u2019t.\u201d",

      "The long lines of applause spilled onto the front step outside of the building, where dozens of former career and political diplomats stood among other demonstrators with signs reading, \u201cThank you America\u2019s diplomats.\u201d",
      "Democracy, human rights and labor",
      "\u201cOur entire office is just ... gone,\u201d said a senior civil service officer from the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor standing in front of the department late Friday as fired employees left the building. He spoke anonymously as one of the more than 1,500 State Department employees who have chosen to take deferred retirement.",
      "The employee described the devastation felt by his colleagues, including one who is just about to have a baby and another who provides the sole income for their household.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s just on the personal side. I\u2019m not even talking yet about the way this is going to disrupt foreign policy,\u201d he said.",
      "Under the new structure of the State Department, the DRL bureau will be greatly reduced and the few remaining offices will be placed under a new deputy assistant secretary for democracy and Western values. One of the more acute changes will be the elimination of the many dedicated human rights positions for different regions of the world.",
      "\u201cThere are specialties. You had a cadre of people that were experts at good governance and human rights and international labor affairs,\u201d the DRL official said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a group of people that don\u2019t know the region trying to make human rights policy for that specific region, because they won\u2019t get it and they won\u2019t advocate for it when more important issues come into play.\u201d",
      "Enrique Roig, a former deputy assistant secretary in the DRL bureau, said he agreed. Roig, who served in the Biden administration, was one of a handful of former democratic political appointees speaking in front of the department as diplomats filed out.",
      "\u201cIt will allow authoritarians around the globe, both on the left and the right, to continue to abuse civic space, to jail and to lock up journalists and civic activists and increase the number of political prisoners we see around the world that my bureau was helping to release,\u201d Roig said.",
      "Science and research",
      "A group of women laid off from the State Department\u2019s Office of Science and Technology Cooperation walked out wearing T-shirts over their office clothes with the message, \u201cScience is Diplomacy. Diplomacy is Science.\u201d The women cried and hugged each other as they exited the building in front of the gathered crowd. Their office is one of over 300 offices or bureaus being eliminated or merged under the sweeping reorganization.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s clear is that the Department of State doesn\u2019t care about science and research,\u201d said one of the women, a foreign service officer who was laid off from the office as part of the cuts.",
      "She described the office as having some of the best emerging tech professionals \u201cin whole of government, not just in the Department of State,\u201d and called it a travesty that the talent would be lost.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to supporting research, basic research, the research that helps us have things like iPhones, have pacemakers, we have no expertise in this building right now because of the layoffs of our staff and other offices like ours,\u201d she said, adding that they had just found out the officials who they thought would be taking over their important work had also been laid off. \u201cIt\u2019s shocking, and it\u2019s baffling that the government doesn\u2019t seem to care about keeping that kind of expertise.\u201d",
      "\u201cDiplomacy is not a short-term gain. It\u2019s a long-term gain,\u201d another laid-off official from the office said, summing up the damage caused by the cuts. \u201cThe connections we make now in our youth are with those officials who will be world leaders one day. Now those connections will be lost.\u201d"

The military has acknowledged firing warning shots at Palestinians who it says approached its forces in a suspicious manner.",

      "President Donald Trump on Saturday threatened a significant tariff hike on the European Union and Mexico, two of the largest U.S. trade partners.",
      "In separate letters published on his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump wrote that each country will face a blanket tariff rate of 30% on all goods exported to the U.S. starting Aug. 1.",
      "Trump threatened even higher tariffs if either the E.U. or Mexico retaliate against his new levy.",
      "Writing to Mexico's president, Trump also focused on border security, saying that \"Mexico has been helping me secure the border, BUT, what Mexico has done, is not enough.\"",
      "\"Mexico still has not stopped the Cartels who are trying to turn all of North America into a Narco-Trafficking Playground,\" he added.",
      "Trump has spent the past week bringing his trade war back to a roaring boil. He kicked it off by issuing dozens of letters announcing unilateral tariffs, then said he planned to impose 50% duties on copper goods, sending prices of the raw metal to all-time highs. Late Thursday, he announced he would apply a blanket tariff of up to 20% on all imports, as well as a 35% tariff on some, and perhaps all, Canadian imports starting next month.",
      "The letters come as the many trade deals that Trump administration officials had said would be signed have failed to materialize, leaving Trump with little to show for weeks of negotiations.",
      "While Mexico was spared from Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariff rollout on April 2, the 30% rate for the E.U. is 10% higher than what the president said he would apply to America's largest trading partner in April but lower than his mid-May threat of 50%.",
      "The 27-member European Union is the United States\u2019 largest trading partner \u2014 its $605 billion worth of imports into the U.S. surpassing Mexico, Canada and even China. The most valuable category was drugs and pharmaceuticals, followed by autos and aircraft and other heavy machinery. Trump has already threatened to impose a 200% tariff on any drugs imported into the U.S., though it would not be applied for at least 18 months.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen responded to Trump's letter, saying in a statement that \"few economies in the world match the European Union's level of openness and adherence to fair trading practices.\"",
      "But von der Leyen said she \"will take all necessary steps to safeguard EU interests,\" including retaliatory tariffs \"if required.\"",
      "Mexico meanwhile is another one of the United States' most important trading partners, with more than $505 billion worth of goods imported by American consumers and companies in 2024.",
      "Mexico made up 69% of U.S. vegetable imports and 51% of U.S. fresh fruit imports in recent years, according to U.S. Agriculture Department data. With short shelf lives, produce could see price hikes faster than other goods.",
      "Markets had spent most of the week brushing off the earlier escalations, leaving stocks largely at the record highs they\u2019d regained thanks largely to recent weeks\u2019 trade-war lull. Trump himself touted the gains in an exclusive interview with NBC News.",
      "But on Friday, major indexes closed lower on the heels of Trump vowing to hit Brazil, a key source of commodities like coffee and orange juice, with a 50% tariff. Trump said the tariff was so high because of \"unsustainable Trade Deficits\" even though the U.S. currently runs at a surplus in its trade with Brazil.",
      "Trump also said \"the way Brazil has treated former President Bolsonaro ... is an international disgrace.\"",
      "In the case of the E.U., the bloc currently has more than $100 billion of retaliatory tariffs on standby that can be quickly implemented. Some of those retaliatory duties target goods made in Republican-represented states, such as soybeans from House Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s home state of Louisiana and bourbon from Kentucky, which is represented in the House and Senate by a nearly all-Republican delegation.",
      "Other retaliatory tariffs could target Boeing planes and U.S.-built vehicles.",
      "Analysts say the new tariff onslaught adds further risk to an inflation outlook that has already been teetering on edge.",
      "\u201cHigher tariffs going into effect in August also could mean that inflationary effects come through later this year or even into next year, extending the timeline on higher inflation,\u201d analysts with Citi wrote in a note to clients published Friday.",
      "The European Commission, the executive arm of the E.U., has been furiously negotiating toward an \u201cagreement in principle\u201d in order to avoid the outcome of getting hit with one of Trump\u2019s tariff letters.",
      "Speaking on Wednesday before the European Parliament, the E.U.\u2019s top trade official, Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, said negotiations were happening \u201cevery single day\u201d between the two sides. \u201cCrucially, while other nations faced increased tariffs from United States, the result of the letters that President Trump sent out on Monday, our negotiations have spared the E.U. from facing higher tariffs.\u201d",
      "However, \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d noted that the U.S. had \u201cdiffering perspectives\u201d about the international trading relationship.",
      "In the hour leading up to Trump\u2019s announcement, an E.U. official said that while the bloc was \u201cfully locked and loaded to conclude an agreement in principle,\u201d it didn\u2019t \u201chave any update to indicate that that is going to happen imminently.\u201d"

      "It\u2019s Day 3 of his week-long co-hosting gig on TODAY with Jenna & Friends, and he\u2019s escorted into the building by a single security guard. It\u2019s still too early for the tourists, so the atrium near Studio 1A is silent and empty.",
      "Soon it\u2019ll be filled with show guests booked on TODAY for July 9, like \u201cSuperman\u201d stars David Corenswet and Rachel Brosnahan and WWE\u2019s Nikki Bella, as well as onlookers from the TODAY plaza, peeking through the windows, hoping to get a glimpse of some of their favorite personalities.",
      "Though it\u2019s an early roll call, Wade shows up with a warm smile on his face and he bends his 6\u20194\u201d frame down for a hug. There\u2019s no trace of anxiety over the long day ahead.",
      "As one of the most decorated shooting guards in NBA history, combating nerves is familiar territory \u2014 and if he\u2019s got them today, he isn't letting on.",
      "It\u2019s Wade\u2019s second time co-hosting with Jenna Bush Hager. So, while he\u2019s not a seasoned pro quite yet, it\u2019s not his first rodeo either. The NBA hall of famer co-hosted for a week earlier this year in March, stepping in as one of the many co-hosts that have joined the show since Hoda Kotb\u2019s departure in January.",
      "And even though he doesn\u2019t need to show up as early as he does, it\u2019s part of his routine.",
      "\u201cI get here at 6:30 a.m. to give myself time to do all the things I need to do. I do not like rushing,\u201d he says.",
      "From the live show at 10 a.m. to a variety of segment tapings in between, Wade has a full schedule of events ahead, and he invites TODAY.com to go behind the scenes with him for the day, to find out what it\u2019s really like to be a co-host for Jenna & Friends.",
      "6:30 AM: Getting in the Zone",
      "By the time Wade walks into his green room, the vibe has already been set.",
      "Donato Smith and Sam Fine, Wade\u2019s barber and makeup artist, respectively, have been preparing for his arrival. There\u2019s a candle on the vanity, along with an assortment of items neatly spread out including eye drops, razors, a music speaker and medicine for the toothache he\u2019s been battling.",
      "\u201cIt just showed up on Monday,\u201d Wade says of the unexpected setback. \u201cIt was about seven hours of throbbing, and I was like, \u2018I\u2019m going to have to call out tomorrow, but that\u2019s not going to be good.\u2019\u201d",
      "Fortunately, a prescription of antibiotics has helped take the edge off, and the sick day is averted. But once the week is over, he\u2019ll need to see his dentist. Stat.",
      "Sitting on a nearby couch is Wade\u2019s cousin, Kenny Kinder. According to Kinder, he\u2019s Wade\u2019s housekeeper but not in the traditional sense. Rather, he\u2019s someone who\u2019s been invited in to help out and is a trusted part of the family.",
      "So much so, that he, Wade, and four other members of their inner circle share the same rose tattoo, calling themselves the \u201cRose Boys.\u201d",
      "While Wade and Kinder chat, Fine sticks on a couple of eye patches. They seem unnecessary since it doesn\u2019t appear like Wade has any morning bags, but since he\u2019s going to be on live television, it can\u2019t hurt."

      "Perhaps no challenge strikes more fear into Islanders\u2019 hearts than \u201cMovie Night,\u201d a tradition in both versions that turns the villa into a theater of relationship horrors. Contestants gather around to watch clips from the season, often featuring their own partners engaging in flirtatious behavior or having revealing conversations they never knew about. Some contestants will watch their relationships implode in real time while everyone else gets front-row seats to the destruction.",

    "story": [
      "Taylor Williams and Clarke Carraway may have been voted out of the \"Love Island USA\" villa, but they say that hasn't impacted the status of their relationship.",
      "\"We're still the same as we were in the villa,\" Taylor tells TODAY.com. \"That's why I used the word exclusive instead of closed off. Closed off is a villa term. You're not in the outside world saying, 'We're closed off.'\"",
      "Before choosing to become exclusive in Episode 32, Taylor and Clarke met in Episode 19, when the girls on the show were sequestered in Casa Amor and five new female bombshells, including Clarke, entered the villa. While Clarke was initially coupled up with Taylor's friend Nic Vansteenberghe, during Episode 20's recoupling, Clarke and Taylor chose to give their connection a chance.",
      "Taylor tells TODAY.com he realized he was serious about exploring his relationship with Clarke by their second conversation.",
      "\"We had a conversation, and she pulled me to talk to me and was like, 'I want to let you know that I'm interested in you, that I like, you know, I want to get to know you,'\" Taylor recalls. \"And I was like, 'OK, cool, after we get ready.'",
      "\"And then we ended up talking like the rest of the morning. I was like, 'What the hell? I haven't gotten ready yet,'\" he adds.",
      "Clarke says after meeting Taylor, \"the conversation just flowed.\" She describes one moment when she, Taylor as well as Casa couple Ace Green and Courtney \u201cCoco\u201d Watson had a \"therapy session.\" During this exercise, Ace and Coco asked them about their connection and their plans for the future before swapping.",
      "\"That was fun, and then I was like, 'My feet hurt,' and then he took my shoes off for me,\" she adds with a laugh.",
      "What Happened Between Taylor and Olandria?",
      "Before Casa, Taylor had been coupled with Olandria Carthen since Day 1 in the villa. But while in Casa, she was temporarily voted off the show after she wasn't selected for a couple by the group of boy bombshells. At the same time, Nic was dumped from the villa.",
      "Or, so they thought.",
      "Episode 20 ended on a massive cliffhanger. As Nic left the villa, suitcase in hand, a black SUV pulled up, with Olandria inside. In the next episode, they were whisked off to a date and given the option to leave the show or couple up.",
      "At the same time as Nic and Olandria became the villa's newest couple, Taylor was pursuing his connection with Clarke. Taylor confirms Nic had expressed interest in Olandria before they were officially coupled up.",
      "\"He's always told me he's super attracted to her, but he never tried to explore it,\" Taylor says, citing Nic's first connection with Belle-A Walker, followed by Cierra Ortega. (Nic and Cierra chose to close off their relationship in Episode 25, then Cierra left the villa in Episode 30 after viewers resurfaced old posts in which she used racial slurs. Cierra apologized via a video she shared to social media July 9.)",
      "Taylor adds that Nic had a conversation with him about being coupled with Olandria.",
      "\"They came back, and we're sitting in the room. I was sitting next to him, and he asked me if I cared if he explored Olandria,\" Taylor says. \"I was like, 'No, go ahead. I can't get mad if you're exploring Olandria and I'm exploring Clarke.'\"",
      "When the girls came back from Casa, there was yet another recoupling, and Taylor had to choose between Olandria and Clarke. Taylor ended up choosing Clarke, citing the different feeling she gave him.",
      "Olandria was left single, before coupling up with Nic again in Episode 30 after Cierra left the villa. Clarke and Taylor meanwhile continued to grow their relationship, from having a picnic date to an energetic proposal for exclusivity.",
      "When asked for her favorite moment in the villa, Clarke makes Taylor guess.",
      "\"The cheer?\" Taylor says, as Clarke confirms with a laugh.",
      "In Episode 32, after the guys had a day of playing 3 v. 3 basketball, Taylor enlisted his fellow Islanders to help him ask Clarke to be exclusive via a cheer that involved spelling out her name. It started with Taylor opting to give that night's toast, and Clarke remembers thinking, \"I've never seen you do a toast, this is going to be fun.\"",
      "\"And then they start spelling everything out, and it gets to C-L, and I'm like, 'Oh my god, is this about to say my name right now?'\" Clarke says. \"I was just like speechless. I could not stop laughing. And they're doing cartwheels and flips ... I loved it.\"",
      "That night, the couple was dumped from the villa after receiving the fewest amount of fan votes. Taylor says he wasn't surprised. A viewer poll from Episode 27 consistently resulted in Clarke and Taylor coming last in categories like \"most genuine\" and \"best boyfriend material.\"",
      "\"Everything happens for a reason, so I can't be mad at it,\" he says. \"You know I could be upset, but it's like I can't be absolutely mad because this happened for a reason.\"",
      "But is there anything they would have done differently in the villa?",
      "\"Not for me,\" Clarke says.",
      "\"Yeah, no, I would have rocked out the same way I did, to be honest,\" Taylor agrees. \"I had a hell of a time in there. If I could do it again, I would do it the same way.\"",
      "What's Next for Clarke and Taylor?",
      "Taylor says their exclusive relationship is \"something that I see on the outside world and something that I want to keep growing on the outside world.\"",
      "But the two have quite the distance between them. Taylor is from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, while Clarke is from Charlotte, North Carolina.",
      "Clarke confirms they have plans to maintain a long-distance relationship.",
      "\"I'm going to go to Oklahoma and do the rodeo situation, and then he's going to come visit me in Charlotte,\" she says. \"Definitely, like a lot of traveling, but things to look forward to.\"",
      "Taylor says he's excited to introduce Clarke to \"rodeo world,\" \"horses\" and \"country life.\"",
      "Meanwhile Clarke says she wants to introduce Taylor to \"city life,\" such as \"fine dining.\"",
      "\"You make it seem like I eat bugs for a living,\" he jokes through laughter. \"I've got that s---, too.\""

    "story": [
      "Nara Smith quickly became one of the faces of the tradwife movement when she launched her illustrious social media career. Now, the 23-year-old model and content creator is speaking out about the viral moment and explaining why she and her husband, Lucky Smith, don't consider themselves a \"traditional\" couple.",
      "The term tradwife, shortened from traditional wife, refers to a woman who follows traditional norms set by society. For many, a traditional wife involves getting married and having kids at a young age.",
      "This is the case for Smith, who married Lucky at 18 and had her first child at 19. Amid her growing popularity on social media for posting videos where she makes elaborate meals from scratch for her family while decked out in formal attire, Smith was labeled a tradwife by social media users. Some criticized Smith\u2019s decisions to follow a traditional path of life, including being a young mom and serving her husband as a traditional homemaker.",
      "In an interview on the Jay Shetty Podcast, the mom of three, who is expecting her fourth child, revealed what she really thinks about the tradwife label she's been given.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing truly traditional about us as a couple, apart from maybe that we chose to have kids young and get married young. But apart from that, we split chores 50/50,\u201d Smith said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s things that Lucky does that I guess traditional men wouldn\u2019t do,\" she continued. \"Like do the dishes or get the kids dressed or do their hair, or whatever it may be that people don\u2019t associate with a traditional man.\u201d",
      "Smith added that there are a lot misconceptions about her role as a young mom and wife.",
      "\u201cAnd there\u2019s things that I do, like having a full-time career and having Lucky be home watching the children while I travel for two weeks. Which is, I guess, not traditional in their mind,\u201d she explained.",
      "Smith told Shetty that the traditional wife role never crossed her mind until she started posting content on her social media accounts, where she met many critics.",
      "\u201cI feel like they\u2019re projecting how they want their life onto me,\u201d Smith shared.",
      "\u201cI think judging someone based on their timing of having kids or timing of getting married or whatever it may be is such an odd concept to me,\u201d she said.",
      "Smith also shared some insights into her early life when she first started dating Lucky. When her now husband initially asked the model to start dating, Smith said she made her intentions very clear.",
      "\u201cI take this very serious,\u201d Smith told Shetty, recalling what she told her now husband.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s either gonna end in marriage or we\u2019re just gonna be done now, because I\u2019m not gonna invest my time in you if that\u2019s not the ultimate goal, and we were aligned,\u201d she said.",
      "Despite what people have said about her, Smith said that the life she lives now had always been in mind, contrasting herself from her friends and peers.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always felt a little bit more mature for my age than a person at my age would be, and I always wanted different things in life than other people,\u201d Smith said.",
      "\u201cI always wanted to start a family, I wanted to have a slower life, I wanted to get married younger, I wanted to work and build something for my kids. My priorities were never in partying, or going out, or dating around, or going on fun vacations,\u201d she shared.",
      "Through all the criticism and online chatter about her life and decisions, Smith said that she\u2019ll continue to move forward with her style of content, regardless of the opinions of others.",
      "\u201cI feel like people see that side of my life, and I voice that side of my life, but they still don\u2019t want to accept it,\u201d Smith shared.",
      "\u201cSo I\u2019ve just kind of learned \u2026 [I\u2019m] gonna do me and whoever resonates with that, great. If they don\u2019t, then there\u2019s nothing really I can do to change their minds,\u201d she said."

    "story": [
      "A balsamic-drizzled controversy involving neighbors, a July 4th party and an antipasto salad has spread from the block to the world, thanks to TikTok.",
      "On July 4, Nicole (@folkmedicineremedies on TikTok) retold her experience attending \u2014 or at least, trying to attend \u2014 an Independence Day party she was invited to by the mom of her son\u2019s best friend, Samantha, hosted by her extended family.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t normally post things like this, but I am absolutely humiliated,\u201d Nicole says through tears at the start of the video.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m new to this area, I just moved 1,000 miles away to be here,\u201d Nicole says. \u201cAnd so I made an antipasto salad, like this big, gorgeous salad.\u201d",
      "She shows the salad she made: Slices of salami, tomato, mozzarella, basil, oregano and pepperoncini are carefully arranged in a sheet pan.",
      "Nicole says that when she walked into the party \u2014 hosted by a local couple, Stasia and Jake Hicks \u2014 she was immediately greeted with hostility from Jake.",
      "Less than five minutes later, she says, another woman walked into the house and confronted her, saying, \u2018It\u2019s really rude to walk into somebody\u2019s house and not introduce yourself. He\u2019s absolutely flipping out outside about some stranger.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd I was, like, so confused. I look like a deer caught in headlights because I thought I was invited,\u201d she says, adding that Samantha was also befuddled at the situation.",
      "\u201cI was like, I\u2019m really sorry. I don\u2019t even know whose house this is,\u201d Nicole says, \u201cAnd the girl goes, \u2018Exactly, you shouldn\u2019t be in here.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018OK,\u2019 so I walk outside.\u2019\u201d",
      "Nicole claims that some partygoers wouldn\u2019t even look at her, and others were \u201cangrily looking\u201d at her in a \u201cnasty\u201d way.",
      "\u201cI was totally distraught,\u201d she says before revealing the saddest part of the whole saga \u2014 she left the salad behind.",
      "\u201cLike, I\u2019ve never been treated like that,\u201d she says, \u201cIt was like, probably a $40 salad. I used all the really nice salami and cut meats and all the vegetables from my yard. I just wanted to make a good impression.\u201d",
      "She ends the video on a pessimistic note: \u201cThis is why you don\u2019t make friends in your 30s.\u201d",
      "TikTok unites in support of Nicole",
      "In response, Nicole received an outpouring of support: The video garnered more than 33 million views and 100,000 comments, largely supportive.",
      "\u201cFIRST THAT SALAD WAS GORGEOUS?!?\u201d wrote one TikTok user. \u201cAnd how are they gonna ignore you and gonna be like \u2018are you gonna introduce yourself\u2019 when you literally just introduced yourself.\u201d",
      "\u201cA good party is prepared for extras. They don\u2019t know how to host,\u201d added another.",
      "\u201cThey did not deserve you or your antipasto!\u201d commented one more. \u201cTheir behavior was bizarre. I guarantee there was something else going on.\u201d",
      "Because the internet loves fresh drama and mozzarella, TikTok has been flooded with Antipasto-gate recaps and reactions from people living on both sides of the Mason-Dixon Line.",
      "\u201cI have never seen TikTok this united over anything,\u201d said one TikToker in her recap.",
      "\u201cYou bring me an antipasto salad, I\u2019m not kicking you out, I\u2019m not just letting you in, I\u2019ma kiss you on the lips,\u201d says influencer William Spreck in his reaction video.",
      "\u201cNicole is the heroine of the story,\u201d says one TikToker, who used a dry erase board to chart out the drama for those out of the loop.",
      "The Hicks respond to the backlash",
      "And then the aforementioned Stasia took to TikTok to share her side of the story.",
      "\u201cWe are not mean people,\u201d she says in a now-deleted video. \u201cLet\u2019s clarify. This was not a party. This was a get together of people who knew each other, OK? And just because we didn\u2019t know her doesn\u2019t mean that she couldn\u2019t have stayed and hung out. We just didn\u2019t want her in our house, OK?\u201d",
      "OK!",
      "Stasia says her husband Jake, mother-in-law and she are getting mean messages on social media but they \u201cdon\u2019t care.\u201d She deleted the video after backlash, but, because the internet is forever, it was saved by other TikTokers.",
      "She also says Jake called Nicole directly to offer an apology, but it wasn\u2019t accepted.",
      "In a follow-up video thanking people for their support, Nicole shares a text exchange with Samantha, the mom who invited her, in which she apologized for her family\u2019s behavior. She also said she told Stasia and Jake she invited Nicole \u2014 and texted them a photo of the antipasto salad.",
      "Nicole also posted the recording of her phone call with Jake. He starts out by saying he didn\u2019t know who she was or that she was coming. Eventually, he admits he knew about her all along, but only expected her son to come.",
      "Stasia reportedly posted footage of the event recorded by a Ring camera, but promptly deleted it after more backlash.",
      "Jake\u2019s mother also posted a defensive TikTok, noting in her video that the event \u201cwas not a party\u201d but a \u201ccookout for the neighbors,\u201d and Nicole must have been \u201cmisinformed.\u201d She has since made her TikTok account private.",
      "Nicole shares her antipasto salad recipe",
      "Nicole has continued to share updates on her account \u2014 including a highly requested tutorial for the antipasto salad.",
      "She thoughtfully layers cured meats, sliced tomatoes, sliced mozzarella and basil leaves, adds pickled garlic scapes and peppers and onions from her garden, sprinkles some black pepper and drizzles olive oil and \u201ca liberal amount\u201d of balsamic glaze for a \u201csweet bite.\u201d",
      "\u201cI gotta admit I\u2019m kind of shocked that people really wanted the recipe for this,\u201d she says in the video. \u201cBut it\u2019s really simple, and I really hope you guys try it and enjoy it.\u201d",
      "Then she adds, \u201cIt\u2019s something you can bring to any gathering.\u201d"

      "Famously, the character was pulled from the pages of \u201cSex and the City\u201d creator Candace Bushnell\u2019s real life. Bushnell first introduced Big in her column for The New York Observer, a thinly veiled portrait of her experiences in New York City. In the years since, the author hasn\u2019t shied away from admitting that Big was, at least in part, based on \u201890s media executive Ronald Galotti.",

      "She also said he was \u201cmuch more of a well-rounded person\u201d than many believed him to be at the time. \u201cHe cooks, he gardens. In some ways, he\u2019d prefer to be at home to going out on the town,\u201d she said.",

      "The \u201cDance Moms\u201d alum began teasing the song\u2019s release on July 8 when posted a clip of herself singing it on TikTok, dressed in a 1950\u2019s style outfit and new blond hairdo.",
      "She posted a second clip of the cover again a day later, testing the waters for a potential release of the song.",

      "The pair\u2019s relationship came as a surprise to fans, as Siwa, who was dating Australian podcast host Kath Ebbs when she left for \"Big Brother,\" came out as a lesbian in 2021. She later said she was \"technically pansexual\" and on \"Big Brother,\" said she identified more as \"queer.\"",
      "Siwa\u2019s cover of the song has sparked controversy among listeners, who turned to the comments to criticize the singer\u2019s raspy rendition of the track.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t release it! Hope that helps,\u201d one user commented on Siwa\u2019s TikTok.",

      "Another made a TikTok that said, \u201cThe Jojo Siwa hate for this song is so unnecessary.\u201d",
      "Why \"Bette Davis Eyes\"? Why now? Here's what to know about the song's origin story and where Siwa fits in.",
      "What is the meaning behind \u2018Bette Davis Eyes?\u2019",
      "\u201cBette Davis Eyes,\u201d which was co-written by Jackie DeShannon and Donna Weiss, was recorded by Kim Carnes and released in 1981.",
      "The song references American actor Bette Davis, known for her legendary career and image as a Hollywood star through films such as \u201cAll About Eve\" (1950), \u201cNow, Voyager\u201d (1942) and \u201cWhat Ever Happened to Baby Jane?\" (1962). Davis was about 73 when the song came out.",
      "A hit both on the charts and critically, the song won Grammy Awards for song of the year and record of the year in 1982, and even gained approval from Davis herself, DeShannon told The Tennessean.",
      "Since then, the song has been reinterpreted by many different artists since its release. For example, the track was covered by Taylor Swift in 2011, Kylie Minogue in 2014 and Ethel Cain earlier this year. Oh, and Gwyneth Paltrow sang in the movie \u201cDuets.\u201d",
      "But what is \"Bette Davis Eyes\" about, exactly? The song\u2019s lyrics pay homage to someone with Davis' physical attributes, describing her \u201cHarlow gold\u201d hair, \u201clips sweet surprise\u201d and, of course, her \u201cBette Davis eyes.\u201d DeShannon said in interview that she and Weiss both loved Davis: \u201cWe were always talking about what great movies and how we love her.\u201d",
      "She may have inspired it, but the song isn't about Davis herself. Go a little deeper and it\u2019s clear the lyrics describe a multifaceted women with allure who isn\u2019t Davis, but has her magnetism. She\u2019s a femme fatale \u2014 drawing people in then moving on.",
      "A recent Vulture article makes the argument that \u201cBette Davis\u201d is a queer anthem. It all comes down the perspective: It\u2019s easy to imagine the song is about a woman, sung by the woman enamored by her.",
      "The song's queer subtext dawns on people.",
      "As a 2019 tweet cheekily reads, How.....in the world.....was Bette Davis Eyes NOT intended to be a gay song?\u201d",
      "Or another: \u201chow am i just realizing after almost 27 years on this earth that the song bette davis eyes is like... REALLY gay\u201d",
      "While Siwa has opened in the past about her sexuality, she's subverting expectations by substituting \"Bette Davis eyes\" for \"Chris Hughes eyes.\"",
      "Siwa is singing a song about attraction \u2014 but not to someone who looks like Bette Davis, ushering in a new era for her as a queer singer and perhaps for the song."

      "President Donald Trump on Saturday threatened a significant tariff hike on the European Union and Mexico, two of the largest U.S. trade partners.",
      "In separate letters published on his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump wrote that each country will face a blanket tariff rate of 30% on all goods exported to the U.S. starting Aug. 1.",
      "Trump threatened even higher tariffs if either the E.U. or Mexico retaliate against his new levy.",
      "Writing to Mexico's president, Trump also focused on border security, saying that \"Mexico has been helping me secure the border, BUT, what Mexico has done, is not enough.\"",
      "\"Mexico still has not stopped the Cartels who are trying to turn all of North America into a Narco-Trafficking Playground,\" he added.",
      "Trump has spent the past week bringing his trade war back to a roaring boil. He kicked it off by issuing dozens of letters announcing unilateral tariffs, then said he planned to impose 50% duties on copper goods, sending prices of the raw metal to all-time highs. Late Thursday, he announced he would apply a blanket tariff of up to 20% on all imports, as well as a 35% tariff on some, and perhaps all, Canadian imports starting next month.",
      "The letters come as the many trade deals that Trump administration officials had said would be signed have failed to materialize, leaving Trump with little to show for weeks of negotiations.",
      "While Mexico was spared from Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariff rollout on April 2, the 30% rate for the E.U. is 10% higher than what the president said he would apply to America's largest trading partner in April but lower than his mid-May threat of 50%.",
      "The 27-member European Union is the United States\u2019 largest trading partner \u2014 its $605 billion worth of imports into the U.S. surpassing Mexico, Canada and even China. The most valuable category was drugs and pharmaceuticals, followed by autos and aircraft and other heavy machinery. Trump has already threatened to impose a 200% tariff on any drugs imported into the U.S., though it would not be applied for at least 18 months.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen responded to Trump's letter, saying in a statement that \"few economies in the world match the European Union's level of openness and adherence to fair trading practices.\"",
      "But von der Leyen said she \"will take all necessary steps to safeguard EU interests,\" including retaliatory tariffs \"if required.\"",
      "Mexico meanwhile is another one of the United States' most important trading partners, with more than $505 billion worth of goods imported by American consumers and companies in 2024.",
      "Mexico made up 69% of U.S. vegetable imports and 51% of U.S. fresh fruit imports in recent years, according to U.S. Agriculture Department data. With short shelf lives, produce could see price hikes faster than other goods.",
      "Markets had spent most of the week brushing off the earlier escalations, leaving stocks largely at the record highs they\u2019d regained thanks largely to recent weeks\u2019 trade-war lull. Trump himself touted the gains in an exclusive interview with NBC News.",
      "But on Friday, major indexes closed lower on the heels of Trump vowing to hit Brazil, a key source of commodities like coffee and orange juice, with a 50% tariff. Trump said the tariff was so high because of \"unsustainable Trade Deficits\" even though the U.S. currently runs at a surplus in its trade with Brazil.",
      "Trump also said \"the way Brazil has treated former President Bolsonaro ... is an international disgrace.\"",
      "In the case of the E.U., the bloc currently has more than $100 billion of retaliatory tariffs on standby that can be quickly implemented. Some of those retaliatory duties target goods made in Republican-represented states, such as soybeans from House Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s home state of Louisiana and bourbon from Kentucky, which is represented in the House and Senate by a nearly all-Republican delegation.",
      "Other retaliatory tariffs could target Boeing planes and U.S.-built vehicles.",
      "Analysts say the new tariff onslaught adds further risk to an inflation outlook that has already been teetering on edge.",

      "Walking down a row of incubators in the neonatal unit of Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, Dr. Ahmad Al-Farra, head of the facility's pediatric unit, shared each baby's story one by one.",
      "\"This baby is a full-term baby,\" he told NBC News' crew on the ground Thursday, gesturing at a tiny figure tucked into an incubator, wrapped in only his diaper and with an oxygen tube fixed to his nose with surgical tape.",
      "\"As you can see, he is depending on the mechanical ventilation,\" Al-Farra said. \"If the electricity was cut off ... this baby will not survive.\"",
      "His warning evokes memories of early on in the war, when a number of infants died at hospitals in northern Gaza after repeated warnings that a military assault in the area would end up being fatal for the babies.",
      "Nasser Hospital is just one of several facilities in Gaza facing \"imminent shutdown\" as fuel stocks in the enclave run out, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs warned Wednesday. The closure of vital units would most likely result in patients' deaths, including in the intensive care and neonatal units, it said.",
      "OCHA added that the \"total ban on fuel entry\" enforced by Israel for around 130 days was to blame for the shortages, which it said has also severely impacted water, sanitation and hygiene services.",
      "While Israel in May lifted a blockade that prevented the entry of food, medical supplies and other vital items, it has only allowed in a limited amount of aid, including \"basic\" food supplies.",

      "\"They hijack fuel for terror, not hospitals,\" he said.",
      "Mencer did not answer the question as to whether more fuel would be allowed to reach hospitals in Gaza in the near future.",
      "COGAT, the Israeli military's liaison with the Palestinians, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Dr. Mohammad Saqer, director of nursing at Nasser Hospital, told NBC News that the facility only had around 3,000 liters (790 gallons) of diesel left. He said it needed 4,500 liters (1,190 gallons) daily to operate all departments effectively. Already, he said, the hospital had turned off electricity for some departments, funneling power to only the most vital units.",
      "\"The situation is very catastrophic because the electricity will abruptly go off within 24 hours,\" Saqer said. \"This means that a lot of patients, especially in the ICU in addition to other departments, are subject to inevitable death.\"",
      "Hospitals across the enclave have struggled to operate throughout the war, after being hit hard in Israel's offensive. Of the territory's 36 hospitals, none are fully functioning; 18 are providing partial services and 18 are not working at all, according to World Health Organization data last updated Monday.",
      "Saqer, meanwhile, called on the international community to step in and help get fuel to Gaza's hospitals in order to \"save the lives of the children.\"",
      "His call came as the European Union foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said in a post on X on Thursday that E.U. officials had reached a new deal with Israel to allow much-needed food and fuel into the enclave.",

A woman placed a glitter tulle clip into the wispy hair of the girl in the princess dress, her chubby face still smeared with blood. A mortuary technician tidied another girl's curls that were clumped by blood, the child still in her green T-shirt printed with a cartoon panda.",
      "Several people tended to an inconsolable woman and a man doubled over as he wept into the pavement. Another woman cried about the senselessness of the killings, \u201cWhat have those children done? What is the guilt of this child to die?\u201d They were starving and just trying to get formula at the clinic, she said.",
      "According to UNICEF, which issued a statement on the strike Thursday, the 1-year-old who was killed had just spoken his first word hours earlier. His mother was injured in the blast and now lies in a hospital bed, clutching her dead baby's shoe.",
      "\u201cNo parent should have to face such tragedy,\u201d UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said in the statement. \u201cThis is the cruel reality confronting many in Gaza today after months of insufficient aid being allowed into the territory, and parties to the conflict failing to uphold basic responsibilities to protect civilians.\u201d",
      "She called on Israel to \u201curgently review its rules of engagement to ensure full compliance with international humanitarian law, notably the protection of civilians, including children.\u201d",

More than 50,000 of those killed and injured have been children, Edouard Beigbeder, UNICEF\u2019s regional director for the Middle East and Africa, said in May.",
      "Dua al-Hazarin, a local journalist who captured the immediate aftermath of Thursday's strike on video, told NBC News that she had been on her way to an assignment when the attack \"happened right in front of me.\"",
      "\"Shrapnel was flying. People were torn apart and the dust from the missile filled the entire area,\" she said.",
      "Later outside Al-Aqsa Hospital, men prayed over shrouded bodies and, in a scene now familiar, if no less heartbreaking after 20 months of war, one of them picked up a tiny white bundle to carry the child to the cemetery."

      "During an official appearance in Windsor, England, Catherine, Princess of Wales, wore a tiara for the first time since 2023.",
      "The 43-year-old was photographed on July 8 arriving at a state banquet at Windsor Castle with her husband, Prince William, by her side. For her appearance, the royal wore the classic Queen Mary\u2019s Lover\u2019s Knot Tiara, one of her more frequently worn tiaras, along with a dark red Givenchy by Sarah Burton gown (Burton was also the designer behind the princess\u2019 iconic wedding dress).",
      "The renowned piece of jewelry is identifiable by its multiple drop-shaped pearls.",
      "The banquet was held in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Macron, first lady of France, who marked France\u2019s first state visit to the U.K. since Brexit. During his visit, President Macron is also expected to address parliament and visit Imperial College London.",
      "The banquet, hosted by King Charles III and Queen Camilla, is Kate\u2019s first tiara moment since sharing her cancer diagnosis in March 2024.",
      "Before her latest appearance, Kate wore a tiara at Buckingham Palace in December 2023, according to People.com. For the occasion, she wore the Lover\u2019s Knot. That same month marked her last public appearance before being diagnosed with cancer.",
      "Significance of the Lover\u2019s Knot Tiara",
      "Though closely associated with Kate, who has made the Lover\u2019s Knot Tiara one of the most recognizable pieces of jewelry to be worn by the British royal family, the tiara goes further back in history. According to previous TODAY.com reporting, the diadem was commissioned by Queen Mary around 1914 and was frequently worn by Princess Diana. The tiara was gifted to Diana for her 1981 wedding to Prince Charles by the late Queen Elizabeth II. Diana is said to have often complained about the weight of the tiara, attributing headaches to the weight of the piece."

      "A 20-year-old American from Florida was beaten to death by Israeli settlers on Friday while visiting relatives in the occupied West Bank, according to his family and the Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.",
      "Sayfollah Musallet, known as Saif, was \u201cbrutally beaten to death\u201d in the town of al-Mazra\u2019a ash-Sharqiya, north of Ramallah, the family said in a statement on social media and confirmed to NBC News. According to the family, a group of settlers blocked an ambulance from reaching Musallet for about three hours.",
      "After the settlers cleared, Musallet\u2019s brother was able to reach him and carry him to the ambulance, according to the statement. However, \u201cSaif died before reaching the hospital.\u201d",
      "A second man, Mohammed al-Shalabi, 23, was also killed in the same incident, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of Israeli settlers live in developments built in Palestinian territories that are widely considered illegal by the international community. Since October 2023, when Hamas attacked southern Israel, sparking the war in Gaza, violence perpetrated by settlers in the West Bank has surged, often aided or abetted by Israeli security forces.",
      "Settler attacks include raids on villages, arson targeting homes and farmland, and physical assaults on residents that have regularly turned deadly.",
      "It is currently unclear why the confrontation that killed Musallet and al-Shalabi began.",
      "In response to a request for comment from NBC News, a State Department spokesperson said it was \u201caware of reports of the death of a U.S. citizen in the West Bank,\u201d adding the department had no further comment \u201cout of respect for the privacy of the family and loved ones\u201d of the reported victim.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said Friday it was \u201caware of reports regarding a Palestinian civilian killed and a number of injured Palestinians as a result of the confrontation, and they are being looked into by the ISA and Israel Police.\u201d",
      "The Israel Police did not immediately respond to NBC News\u2019 request for information on the incident or the settlers involved.",
      "Saif\u2019s cousin Fatmah Muhammed told NBC News on Saturday that Musallet worked in an ice cream shop run by his father in Tampa, Florida. He traveled to the West Bank in June to visit his mother, brother and sister.  Musallet\u2019s father was en route to the West Bank from Florida for his funeral, to be held on Sunday.",
      "\u201cThis news has been devastating for the entire family,\u201d Muhammed said.",
      "Nizar Milbes, a close family friend currently visiting the West Bank from California, told NBC News that many residents of al-Mazra\u2019a ash-Sharqiya are Americans.",
      "The town is known for its olive trees and rolling hills, where many modern Palestinian homes are built, including some of the West Bank\u2019s more opulent houses. Families gathered to barbecue and relax, many of them traveling from the U.S. for vacation, but Milbes said growing settler violence has transformed the area.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing left over here for people to enjoy, the settlers have taken everything,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cPeople can\u2019t even go there anymore. The settlers have burned the vacation homes, they\u2019ve encroached and put their stuff there.\u201d",
      "In March, a United Nations report warned that settler violence had \u201cincreased in a climate of continuing impunity.\u201d",
      "Yesh Din, an Israeli human rights group, said settlers rarely face legal consequences for violence perpetrated against Palestinians. Between 2005 and 2023, more than 93% of all investigations were closed without an indictment and only 3% of investigations led to a conviction, according to a report by the organization.",
      "\u201cThe low conviction rate sends the message that the law enforcement system, in its entirety, does not consider settler violence to be a serious issue, contributing to the perpetrators\u2019 sense of immunity,\u201d the report said.",
      "Since October 2023, 961 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank, according to a database maintained by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, a sharp rise from previous years.",
      "CAIR-Florida, the Florida chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a nationwide Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, condemned Israeli settlers, \u201cbacked and enabled by the Israeli government,\u201d for Musallet\u2019s death, and called on President Donald Trump to \u201cput America first.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis murder is only the latest killing of an American citizen by illegal Israeli settlers or soldiers,\u201d the statement said. \u201cEvery other murder of an American citizen has gone unpunished by the American government, which is why the Israeli government keeps wantonly killing American Palestinians and, of course, other Palestinians.\u201d",
      "In April, 14-year-old American Amer Rabee was shot and killed by Israeli soldiers. His family said he was picking almonds, the IDF said he was throwing rocks. In September 2024, Turkish-American activist Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, 26, was shot dead by an Israeli soldier during a demonstration against West Bank settlements.",
      "American citizens Mohammad Ahmed Mohammad Khdour and Tawfic Hafeth Abdel Jabbar, both 17, were killed by Israeli fire in separate incidents in February and January 2024."

      "Relations between Russia and North Korea have been flourishing in recent years, with North Korea supplying troops and ammunitions to support Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine in return for military and economic assistance. That has raised concerns among South Korea, the U.S. and others that Russia might also transfer to North Korea sensitive technologies that can increase the danger of its nuclear and missile programs.",
      "After a meeting with Choe on Saturday, Lavrov accused the U.S., South Korea and Japan of what he called their military buildups around North Korea.",
      "\u201cWe warn against exploiting these ties to build alliances directed against anyone, including North Korea and, of course, Russia,\u201d he told reporters, according to Russia\u2019s state Tass news agency.",
      "The U.S., South Korea and Japan have been expanding or restoring their trilateral military exercises in response to North Korea\u2019s advancing nuclear program. On Friday, the three countries held a joint air drill involving U.S. nuclear-capable bombers near the Korean Peninsula, as their top military officers met in Seoul and urged North Korea to cease all unlawful activities that threaten regional security.",
      "North Korea views major U.S.-led military drills as invasion rehearsals. It has long argued that it\u2019s forced to develop nuclear weapons to defend itself from U.S. military threats.",
      "Lavrov said Russia understands North Korea\u2019s decision to seek nuclear weapons.",
      "\u201cThe technologies used by North Korea are the result of the work of its own scientists. We respect North Korea\u2019s aspirations and understand the reasons why it is pursuing a nuclear development,\u201d Lavrov said.",
      "During their meeting, Choe reiterated that North Korea \u201cunconditionally\u201d supports Russia\u2019s fight against Ukraine. She described ties between North Korea and Russia as \u201cthe invincible alliance.\u201d",
      "Lavrov said he repeated Russia\u2019s gratitude for the contribution that North Korean troops made in efforts to repel a Ukrainian incursion into Russia\u2019s Kursk border region.",
      "Wonsan city, the meeting venue, is where North Korea recently opened a mammoth beach resort that it says can accommodate nearly 20,000 people.",
      "In his comments at the start of his meeting with Choe, Lavrov said that \u201cI am sure that Russian tourists will be increasingly eager to come here. We will do everything we can to facilitate this, creating conditions for this, including air travel,\u201d according to the Russian Foreign Ministry.",
      "The Wonsan-Kalma tourist zone is at the center of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s push to boost tourism as a way to improve his country\u2019s troubled economy. But prospects for the biggest tourist complex in North Korea aren\u2019t clear, as the country appears unlikely to fully reopen its borders and embrace Western tourists anytime soon."

      "Russia launched more aerial attacks on Ukraine in June than in any other month of the war so far, causing the highest number of civilians killed or wounded since the conflict broke out more than three years ago, according to a tally by the United Nations and independent researchers.",
      "The onslaught of armed drones, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles raining down on Ukrainian towns and cities has underscored Russia\u2019s determination to press on with its war against Ukraine despite President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to halt the bloodshed.",
      "The Russian aerial attacks have been steadily increasing since July 2024, with the number of strikes exceeding 2,500 in each of the first six months of this year, according to the nonprofit Institute for the Study of War, which cited figures from Ukraine\u2019s defense ministry.",
      "The difference over the same period last year is stark.",
      "Between January and June, Russian drone and missile attacks numbered 23,245, a roughly 605 % increase compared to the same period last year when there were 3,300, according to the Washington-based institute.",
      "The expansion was driven by a massive increase in drone assaults, which jumped from 2,264 in the first half of 2024 to 22,495 in the first half of 2025, according to the tally.",
      "As a result of those aerial attacks, the toll of civilians killed and wounded increased to 6,719, up about 53% from the same period in 2024, according to U.N. monitors. The civilian toll included 1,091 deaths and 5,628 wounded.",
      "\u201cCivilians across Ukraine are facing levels of suffering we have not seen in over three years,\u201d Danielle Bell, head of the U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, said in a statement. \u201cThe surge in long-range missile and drone strikes across the country has brought even more death and destruction to civilians far away from the frontline.\u201d",
      "June marked the highest monthly civilian casualty toll in three years, with 232 killed and 1,343 wounded, according to the United Nations.",
      "In the month of June, Russian forces fired 5,681 drones and missiles on Ukraine \u2013 the highest number since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in February 2022. The aerial assault included 5,438 drones and 243 missiles, according to the Institute for the Study of War.",
      "Russia has kept up the tempo of drone and missile attacks in July, forcing Ukrainians in cities to seek shelter underground in subway stations. Smoke rose over Kyiv on Wednesday and Thursday night from Russian drone and missile strikes that ignited fires and destroyed apartment buildings, NBC News and The Associated Press reported from the capital.",
      "On Wednesday night, Russia fired more than 700 attack and decoy drones on Ukraine, along with missiles. On Thursday night, 397 Iranian-designed Shahed and decoy drones were launched against Kyiv and other regions, according to Ukrainian officials.",
      "With Russian troops unable to score a breakthrough on the ground despite a significant manpower advantage, Moscow has stepped up its missile and drone attacks on the country\u2019s cities to try to overwhelm air defenses, undermine the resolve of the government in Kyiv before any peace talks, and break the will of the wider population, current and former Western diplomats say.",
      "\u201cThese attacks are on civilian targets, so it\u2019s an attempt to demoralize Ukrainians, to convince Ukrainians that they can\u2019t win,\u201d said William Taylor, a former career U.S. diplomat who served in Kyiv.",
      "Christina Harward, a Russian analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, said previous attempts by Russia to damage morale have failed. The air attacks also indicated Russia\u2019s weapons production and stockpiles had increased, especially long-range drones, Harward said.",
      "\u201cRussia may also be trying to distract from the battlefield, where Russian gains on the front are still relatively slow and are coming at huge personnel costs,\u201d she said.",
      "Before he took office in January, Trump had pledged to end the war in \u201ca day.\u201d He initially suggested that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his government were the main obstacle to bringing an end to the conflict, which began with Russia\u2019s invasion of the Crimean peninsula in 2014 and its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "But in recent days, Trump\u2019s tone has shifted, with the president expressing impatience and frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin for offering what he called \u201cmeaningless\u201d moves toward peace."

      "Thrown into the water on Newfoundland\u2019s Bell Island, the bottle and its paper cargo traveled on wild Atlantic seas for more than 4,600 days, adrift during 11 iterations of iPhone, two Donald Trump elections and a global pandemic that came and went.",
      "That epic journey took it to the west coast of Ireland, where it was discovered this week.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a moment of pure joy,\u201d said Martha Farrell, chair of the Maharees Conservation Association, whose members found the bottle Monday. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s the impossibility and resilience of that glass bottle finding our beach all those years later \u2014 but also the resilience of the couple.\u201d",

      "Back then, the couple had been dating for a year and were in a long-distance relationship: he a police officer in British Columbia and she a trainee nurse in Newfoundland.",
      "\u201cToday we enjoyed dinner, this bottle of wine and each other on the edge of the island,\u201d she wrote in the message. \u201cIf you find this, please call us,\u201d she added, providing a number but never imagining somebody actually would.",
      "They had shared a precious picnic together on the tiny Bell Island, a 20-minute ferry ride from St. John's. \"I gave it everything I had,\" Brad Squires said of his attempt to launch the bottled missive into the waves below.",
      "They soon forgot about it. They got married in 2016, settling  down in Newfoundland. They have three children, Allie, 19, Gabe, 16, and Harrison, 5.",
      "In Scraggane Bay on Ireland's picturesque Dingle Peninsula, the bottle was found Monday by another couple, Kate and Jon Gay, members of the local charity Maharees Conservation Association, who were doing a beach cleanup.",
      "They kept it until the association's meeting later that night, smashing it open, toasting the unknown writers but failing to get an answer from the number provided. So Farrell posted an appeal on Facebook thinking it might yield an answer in weeks or months. One hour later, Anita Squires had got in touch to say she was the note's author.",
      "\"It was phenomenal,\" Farrell said.",
      "There is a doubly serendipitous side to this story, too.",
      "The Maharees, where the bottle was found, is a 3-mile isthmus of sand that has been battered and eroded by extreme weather and sea-level rises fueled by climate change. So too have parts of Newfoundland.",
      "The grassroots Maharees Conservation Association wants to use this story to link up with people in Newfoundland experiencing the same issues. And the author of the letter in the bottle is going to connect them.",
      "\"They have a soft coastline, they have a sand dune system, and they are also vulnerable to sea level rises,\" Farrell said. \"It's a somber enough affair when you're thinking: How can we actually prepare ourselves for what's to come? So to have this little moment of pure joy in the middle of that, it was very welcome.\"",
      "Anita Squires says that her \"love story is cute, but the work they are doing is so important,\" referring to the conservation group's attempts to protect and adapt their  coastlines to the climate crisis. So, linking these campaigners is \"the beautiful thing at the end of the story.\""

      "Dozens of Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants began handing over weapons in a ceremony in a cave in northern Iraq on Friday, officials said, marking a symbolic but significant step toward ending a decades-long insurgency against Turkey.",
      "Helicopters hovered above the mountain where the disarmament process got underway, with dozens of Iraqi Kurdish security forces surrounding the area, a Reuters witness said.",
      "The PKK, locked in conflict with the Turkish state and outlawed since 1984, decided in May to disband, disarm and end its separatist struggle after a public call to do so from its long-imprisoned leader Abdullah Ocalan.",
      "After a series of failed peace efforts, the new initiative could pave the way for Ankara to end an insurgency that has killed over 40,000 people, burdened the economy and wrought deep social and political divisions in Turkey and the wider region.",
      "The ceremony was held inside the Jasana cave in the town of Dukan, 37 miles northwest of Sulaymaniyah in the Kurdistan region of Iraq\u2018s north, according to an Iraqi security official and another regional government official.",
      "Around 40 PKK militants and one commander were to hand over their weapons, people familiar with the plan said. It was unclear when further handovers would take place.",
      "The PKK has been based in northern Iraq after being pushed well beyond Turkey\u2019s southeastern frontier in recent years. Turkey\u2019s military has regularly carried out operations and strikes on PKK bases in the region and established several military outposts there.",
      "No footage of the ceremony has been made available yet, but Turkish broadcasters have been showing the crowds gathered near Sulaymaniyah and landscapes of the mountainous region as part of their coverage of what they said was a historic moment.",
      "The arms are to be destroyed later in another ceremony attended by Turkish and Iraqi intelligence figures, officials of Iraq\u2018s Kurdistan regional government, and senior members of Turkey\u2019s pro-Kurdish DEM party \u2014 which also played a key role in facilitating the PKK\u2019s disarmament decision.",

      "In a rare online video published on Wednesday, Ocalan also urged Turkey\u2019s parliament to set up a commission to oversee disarmament and manage the broader peace process.",
      "Ankara has taken steps toward forming the commission, while the DEM and Ocalan have said that legal assurances and certain mechanisms were needed to smooth the PKK\u2019s transition into democratic politics.",
      "Omer Celik, a spokesman for Erdogan\u2019s AK Party, said the disarmament process should not be allowed to drag on longer than a few months to avoid it becoming subject to provocations.",
      "Erdogan has said the disarmament will enable the rebuilding of Turkey\u2019s southeast.",
      "Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek has said Turkey spent nearly $1.8 trillion over the past five decades combating terrorism, endorsing the peace steps as an economic boon.",
      "The end of NATO member Turkey\u2019s conflict with the PKK could have consequences across the region, including in neighboring Syria where the United States is allied with Syrian Kurdish forces that Ankara deems a PKK offshoot.",
      "Washington and Ankara want those Kurds to quickly integrate with Syria\u2019s security structure, which has been undergoing reconfiguration since the fall in December of autocratic President Bashar al-Assad. PKK disarmament could add to this pressure, analysts say."

      "UNITED NATIONS \u2014 The International Criminal Court believes war crimes and crimes against humanity are continuing to take place in Sudan's vast western Darfur region where civil war has raged for more than two years, the tribunal's deputy prosecutor said Thursday.",
      "Nazhat Shameem Khan told the U.N. Security Council that the depth of suffering and the humanitarian crisis in Darfur \"has reached an intolerable state,\" with famine escalating and hospitals, humanitarian convoys and other civilian infrastructure being targeted.",
      "\"People are being deprived of water and food,\" she said. \"Rape and sexual violence are being weaponized. Abductions for ransom or to bolster the ranks of armed groups have become common practice.\"",
      "\"And yet we should not be under any illusion,\" Shameem Khan warned the U.N.'s most powerful body. \"Things can still get worse.\"",
      "Sudan plunged into conflict in mid-April 2023, when long-simmering tensions between its military and paramilitary leaders broke out in the capital, Khartoum, and spread to other regions, including Darfur. Some 40,000 people have been killed and nearly 13 million displaced, including to other countries, according to U.N. agencies.",
      "ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan told the Security Council in January that there were grounds to believe both government forces and the paramilitary Rapid Support Force, may be committing war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide in Darfur.",
      "The Biden administration, just before it left office in January, determined that the RSF and its proxies were committing genocide.",
      "Karim Khan has stepped down temporarily as the ICC chief prosecutor pending the outcome of an investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct, which he categorically denies.",
      "Deputy prosecutor Shameem Khan, who is not related, said the ICC has closely tracked reports in recent weeks of the dire situation in North Darfur, whose capital El Fasher is besieged by RSF and their affiliates. The RSF, which controls the capitals of all other states in Darfur, has also attacked famine-hit Zamzam and other camps for displaced Sudanese in North Darfur.",
      "\"On the basis of our independent investigations, the position of our office is clear, we have reasonable grounds to believe that war crimes and crimes against humanity have been and are continuing to be committed in Darfur,\" Khan told the council.",
      "This conclusion, she said, is based on documentary, testimonial and digital evidence collected by ICC investigators during the past six months, including at refugee camps in neighboring Chad. Over 7,000 items of evidence have been collected to date, she said.",
      "Khan emphasized to the council and to victims that the ICC considers the situation in Darfur \"of the utmost importance\" and will not be deterred until justice is delivered to the perpetrators.",
      "Two decades ago, Darfur became synonymous with genocide and war crimes, particularly by the notorious Janjaweed Arab militias, against populations that identify as Central or East African. Up to 300,000 people were killed and 2.7 million were driven from their homes.",
      "Khan said those in Darfur now \"inflicting unimaginable atrocities on its population\" should know that while they may feel a sense of impunity, Janjaweed leader Ali Kushayb is currently on trial and the ICC hopes it will be the first of many.",
      "\"However, we also have a duty of confidentiality to the court,\" Khan said. \"I am not able to share more details of the nature of our progress or of specific outcomes hoped for. I can only assure you that the progress we have made is concrete, positive and significant.\""

    "story": [
      "European officials reached a new deal with Israel to allow desperately needed food and fuel into Gaza, the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief said Thursday, hours after an Israeli airstrike killed 15 people, including 10 children, waiting for help outside a medical clinic.",
      "The children\u2019s deaths drew outrage from humanitarian groups even as Israel allowed the first delivery of fuel to Gaza in more than four months, though still less than a day\u2019s supply, according to the United Nations.",
      "\u201cThe killing of families trying to access life-saving aid is unconscionable,\u201d UNICEF\u2019s chief, Catherine Russell, said. \u201cThese were mothers seeking a lifeline for their children after months of hunger and desperation.\u201d",
      "The Israeli military said it was targeting a militant when it struck near the clinic.",
      "Security camera footage outside the clinic in the central Gaza city of Deir al Balah showed about a dozen people squatting in front of the clinic when a projectile explodes a few meters (yards) away, leaving bodies scattered.",
      "Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu prepared to leave Washington after meetings with President Donald Trump, apparently without finalizing a temporary ceasefire advocated by the White House.",
      "The deal announced by European officials could result in \u201cmore crossings open, aid and food trucks entering Gaza, repair of vital infrastructure and protection of aid workers,\u201d said Kaja Kallas, the 27-member EU\u2019s top diplomat.",
      "\u201cWe count on Israel to implement every measure agreed,\u201d she said in a post on social media.",
      "Aid groups say Israeli military restrictions and recurring violence have made it difficult to deliver assistance in Gaza even after Israel eased its 2 1/2 month total blockade in May. Experts have warned the strip is at risk of famine, 21 months into the Israel-Hamas war.",
      "Kallas said the deal would reactivate aid corridors from Jordan and Egypt and reopen community bakeries and kitchens across Gaza.",
      "She said measures would be taken to prevent the militant Hamas group from diverting aid. Israel has long accused Hamas of stealing aid and selling it to finance militant activities. The U.N. says there is no evidence for widespread diversion.",
      "Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar acknowledged the deal while at a conference in Vienna, saying it followed \u201cour dialogue with the EU\u201d and that it includes \u201cmore trucks, more crossings and more routes for the humanitarian efforts.\u201d",
      "Neither Saar nor Kallas said whether the aid would go through the U.N.-run system or an alternative, U.S.- and Israeli-backed mechanism that has been marred by violence and controversy.",
      "The U.N. said Israel had permitted a team to bring 75,000 liters of fuel into Gaza, the first delivery allowed in 130 days. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric warned it wasn\u2019t enough to cover a single day\u2019s energy needs in the territory and that services would shut down without more shipments."

      "Thousands of people from Bosnia and around the world gathered in Srebrenica to mark the 30th anniversary of a 1995 massacre there of more than 8,000 Bosniak Muslim boys and men, which has been acknowledged as Europe's only genocide after the Holocaust.",
      "Seven newly identified victims of the massacre \u2014 including two 19-year-old men \u2014 will be laid to rest in a collective funeral at a vast, ever-expanding cemetery near Srebrenica Friday, next to more than 6,000 victims already buried there. Such funerals are held annually for the victims who are still being unearthed from dozens of mass graves around the town.",
      "Relatives of the victims, however, often can bury only partial remains of their loved ones as they are typically found in several different mass graves, sometimes miles apart. Such was the case of Mirzeta Karic, who was waiting to bury her father.",
      "\"Thirty years of search and we are burying a bone,\" she said, crying by her father's coffin which was wrapped in green cloth in accordance with Islamic tradition.",
      "\"I think it would be easier if I could bury all of him. What can I tell you, my father is one of the 50 (killed) from my entire family.\"",
      "July 11, 1995, is the day when the killings started after Bosnian Serb fighters overran the eastern Bosnian enclave in the final months of the interethnic war in the Balkan country.",
      "After taking control of the town that was a protected U.N. safe zone during the war, Bosnian Serb fighters separated Bosniak Muslim men and boys from their families and brutally executed them in just several days. The bodies were then dumped in mass graves around Srebrenica which they later dug up with bulldozers, scattering the remains among other burial sites to hide the evidence of their war crimes.",
      "The U.N. General Assembly last year adopted a resolution to commemorate the Srebrenica genocide on the July 11 anniversary. Scores of international officials and dignitaries are expected to attend the commemoration ceremonies and the funeral on Friday.",
      "On the eve of the anniversary, an exhibition was inaugurated displaying personal items belonging to the victims that were found in the mass graves over the years.",
      "The conflict in Bosnia erupted in 1992, when Bosnian Serbs took up arms in a rebellion against the country's independence from the former Yugoslavia and with an aim to create their own state and eventually unite with neighboring Serbia. More than 100,000 people were killed and millions displaced before a U.S.-brokered peace agreement was reached in 1995.",
      "Bosnia remains ethnically split while both Bosnian Serbs and neighboring Serbia refuse to acknowledge that the massacre in Srebrenica was a genocide despite rulings by two U.N. courts. Bosnian Serb political and military leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, along with many others, have been convicted and sentenced for genocide.",
      "Serbia's populist President Aleksandar Vucic expressed condolences on X while calling the Srebrenica massacre a \"terrible crime.\" Vucic added that \"we cannot change the past but we must change the future.\""

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Israel believes at least some of Iran\u2019s highly enriched uranium was buried beneath Iran\u2019s Isfahan facility by U.S. strikes and not destroyed or moved beforehand, a senior Israeli government official said in Washington on Wednesday night. But it is effectively unreachable, the official said, because Israel is watching, and if it believes Iran is trying to dig up the material, it will not hesitate to conduct new strikes.",
      "Asked about Israel\u2019s conclusion regarding the uranium at Isfahan, White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly told NBC News in a statement: \u201cAs President Trump has said many times, Operation Midnight Hammer totally obliterated Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities. The entire world is safer thanks to his decisive leadership.\u201d",
      "In a lengthy briefing with reporters Wednesday night, the senior Israeli government official said Israel decided to attack Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities because of intelligence it had that Tehran had begun rapidly and secretly proceeding to weaponize its enriched uranium after Israel\u2019s targeted assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in September.",
      "The official said that Israel had shared the intelligence with President Donald Trump but was preparing to strike with or without a green light or participation from the United States and that American support was not a condition for Israel\u2019s decision to strike Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities.",
      "The official would not specify the source of the intelligence.",
      "Iran denies that it wants to build a nuclear weapon. In an interview with NBC News a day before the U.S. strikes, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said every country has the right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes.",
      "\u201cThis is an achievement of our own scientists. It\u2019s a question of national pride and dignity,\u201d he said.",
      "Asked about National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s having testified before Congress in March that the U.S. intelligence community \u201ccontinues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader Khamenei has not authorized the nuclear weapons program he suspended in 2003,\u201d the Israeli official dismissed the question, viewing the assessment as not serious.",
      "According to the official, Israel believes Iran\u2019s nuclear program has now been set back up to two years.",
      "An initial assessment by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency leaked late last month found that the U.S. strikes on Isfahan and two other sites may have set back the program only several months.",
      "The question of how damaged Iran\u2019s nuclear program was \u2014 along with how much its timeline toward building a nuclear weapon should it ever decide to do so was delayed \u2014 has been a politically charged one. Trump and his administration have denounced the leak of the DIA assessment and the outlets that first reported it.",
      "The day after the initial DIA assessment was first reported, CIA Director John Ratcliffe said in a statement that \u201ca body of credible intelligence\u201d indicated the program was \u201cseverely damaged.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis includes new intelligence from an historically reliable and accurate source/method that several key Iranian nuclear facilities were destroyed and would have to be rebuilt over the course of years,\u201d he said."

      "As part of its \u201ccommitment to the success\u201d of ongoing peace talks, the militant group said in a news release Wednesday, it would free the captives, although it cautioned that the talks with Israel had been difficult. It did not say when the hostages would be freed.",
      "The announcement came as Netanyahu said discussions with President Donald Trump during two meetings in Washington had focused on freeing the hostages who remained held in Gaza. The latest data from Netanyahu's office published last month said 50 hostages remained in the enclave, 28 of whom were classified as dead.",
