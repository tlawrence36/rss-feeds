      "Born during the Great Depression with sun-kissed California looks, Robert Redford never failed to epitomize something quintessential and hopeful about the American character",
      "NEW YORK -- Born during the Great Depression with sun-kissed California looks, Robert Redford never failed to epitomize something quintessential and hopeful about the American character.",
      "Redford, who died Tuesday at the age of 89, left a movie trail etched into land. He seemed to reside as much across the American landscape as he did on movie screens. He was in the Rocky Mountains of \u201cJeremiah Johnson,\u201d the Wyoming grasslands of \u201cButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\u201d the Washington, D.C., alleyways of \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men\u201d and the Montana streams of \u201cA River Runs Through It.\u201d",
      "\u201cFrom the time I was just a kid, I was always trying to break free of the bounds that I was stuck with, and always wanted to go outside,\u201d Redford told The Associated Press in 2018.",
      "Redford, a movie-star paragon, was surely savvy with how he played with and used his all-American image. No one who starred in the baseball drama \u201cThe Natural\u201d (1984) and gave Bernard Malamud\u2019s novel a storybook ending couldn't have some sense of self-mythology. But it was one of Redford\u2019s greatest feats that, despite his fame, he remained innately connected to some aspirational American ideal. Redford, an open-air actor of easy, rugged charm, evoked the kind of regular guy decency that stars like Jimmy Stewart did before him \u2014 only Redford did it through an era of distrust and disillusionment.",
      "\u201cHe was to me a throwback to the actors that I was nuts about when I was growing up and going to movies: real, classical, traditional, old-fashioned movie stars who were very, very redolent of some kind of American essence,\u201d said Sydney Pollack, who directed Redford in \u201cJeremiah Johnson,\u201d \u201cThe Way We Were\u201d and \u201cThree Days of the Condor,\u201d in 1993. \u201cThey were very much a part of the American landscape and they were heroic in a kind of understated way.\u201d",
      "That was most true, perhaps, in Utah. Wanting to escape paved-over Los Angeles, Redford first began buying land there early in his career. In Utah, he would fight to protect both untrampled wilderness and a spirit of moviemaking that had grown increasingly difficult in Hollywood. As a longtime trustee of the Natural Resources Defense Council, a nonprofit environmental advocacy group, Redford was an outspoken environmentalist. In the 1970s, he successfully opposed a pair of rural Utah proposals: a six-lane highway and coal-fired power plant.",
      "In the Utah mountains, Redford also launched the Sundance Institute. Beyond Sundance's annual festival for independent film, the institute has been a lifeblood young filmmakers. Its year-round laboratory \u2014 the part of Sundance that Redford was most proud of \u2014 has helped nurture some of the most vital voices in American cinema for decades.",
      "\u201cFor me, the word to be underscored is \u2018independence,\u2019\u201d Redford once said of his legacy. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed in that word. That\u2019s what led to me eventually wanting to create a category that supported independent artists who weren\u2019t given a chance to be heard. The industry was pretty well controlled by the mainstream, which I was a part of. But I saw other stories out there that weren\u2019t having a chance to be told.\u201d",
      "That spirit of independence often infused his films, too. When Redford wanted to make \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d the seminal 1976 film directed by Alan Pakula about Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein\u2019s Watergate investigation, few in the film industry thought there was much drama to be found in a story that was then several years old.",
      "\u201cNixon had already resigned, and the held opinion (in Hollywood) was \u2018No one cares. No one wants to hear about this,\u2019\u201d Redford, who also co-produced the film, said in 2006. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018No, it\u2019s not about Nixon. It\u2019s about something else. It\u2019s about investigative journalism and hard work.\u2019\u201d",
      "If \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d one of the greatest newspaper movies, detailed the hard-earned revelations of Watergate, \u201cThree Days of the Condor\u201d \u2014 one of the greatest political thrillers \u2014 captured the paranoia and disillusionment that followed. If anyone was completely unfamiliar with why Redford was so good, \u201cThree Days of the Condor\u201d would be a good place to start.",

      "Not so different from his Woodward of \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d Redford is a fresh-faced novice thrown into a high-stakes scheme where few, including those in the government, can be trusted. No one has ever been better at playing the regular guy trying to think fast on his feet, and make sense of an ever-darker world.",
      "Though some called for him to, Redford never entered politics, himself. He remained outspoken \u2014 he's in some way the model for the modern Hollywood activist \u2014 on a wide range of issues, including Indigenous and LGBTQ+ rights. The closest he came to running for office was Michael Ritchie's 1972 satire \u201cThe Candidate,\u201d in which Redford played an idealistic lawyer enlisted to challenge a highly favored incumbent Republican senator. Redford\u2019s candidate ultimately wins, but not without sacrificing his principles and seeing much of what he stands for diluted.",
      "Redford\u2019s place, instead, was outside politics. The perfect bookend to his \u201970s movies is \u201cSneakers,\u201d Phil Alden Robinson\u2019s absurdly underrated 1992 caper starring Redford as a former \u201960s radical now living under a false moniker and leading a band of security specialists. They stumble into possession of a computer device that brings the attention of the NSA, CIA, FBI and many others, forcing Redford to, yet again, try to figure out what\u2019s moral in a dangerous (and now newly digital) America.",
      "The world that Redford\u2019s films often presciently depicted seemed to push him further into the wilderness, on screen and off. He largely retreated into retirement over the last decade. When Redford died, he was at his home in the Utah mountains, outside Provo. One of his last films was 2015's \u201cA Walk in the Woods,\u201d playing Bill Bryson ambling along the Appalachian Trail.",
      "The most fitting and elegiac swan song, though was J.C. Chandor\u2019s \u201cAll Is Lost,\u201d a near-wordless 2013 drama about an old man at sea. Redford plays a solo mariner whose sailboat collides with a shipping container. Though terse, the movie reverberates with economic and ecological metaphor. A visibly older and weathered Redford \u2014 no longer the golden, freckled face of his youth \u2014 suffers through increasingly rough and stormy seas, improvising his survival.",
      "For an actor who had covered so much ground, \u201cAll Is Lost\u201d was one last frontier. Redford's unnamed character was credited only as \u201cOur Man.\u201d",

      "Robert Redford, who died Tuesday at 89, transformed the film industry with the Sundance Institute and Film Festival",
      "Robert Redford was disillusioned with the Hollywood mainstream. The Sundance Kid, who died Tuesday at age 89, knew that there were more stories out there, ones that weren\u2019t getting made into films because of the rigidity of the business. So he made something different, founding Sundance Institute and the Sundance Film Festival as an alternative avenue for emerging filmmakers, where independence was a virtue, not a liability.",
      "Over the past four decades, the institute and the festival have given an early platform to countless young filmmakers, including Steven Soderbergh, Paul Thomas Anderson, Quentin Tarantino, Ryan Coogler, Chlo\u00e9 Zhao, Nicole Holofcener, Nia DaCosta, Taika Waititi, Ava DuVernay, Rian Johnson, Gina Prince-Bythewood, Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert and many more.",
      "\u201cFor me, the word to be underscored is \u2018independence.\u2019 I\u2019ve always believed in that word. That\u2019s what led to me eventually wanting to create a category that supported independent artists who weren\u2019t given a chance to be heard,\u201d Redford told The Associated Press in 2018. \u201cThe industry was pretty well controlled by the mainstream, which I was a part of. But I saw other stories out there that weren\u2019t having a chance to be told and I thought, \u2018Well, maybe I can commit my energies to giving those people a chance.\u2019 As I look back on it, I feel very good about that.\u201d",
      "In 2019, Redford said he intended to step back from his public facing role at the festival, though he remained the organization's president and founder until his death.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re at a point where I can move on to a different place, because the thing I\u2019ve missed over the years is being able to spend time with the films and with the filmmakers and to see their work and be part of their community,\u201d he said at the 2019 kickoff. \u201cI don\u2019t think the festival needs a whole lot of introduction now: It runs on its own course, and I\u2019m happy for that.\u201d",
      "Redford\u2019s love affair with Utah began much earlier, on a cross-country motorcycle road trip in 1961 when he bought 2 acres of land. By 1969, with more money in his pocket from his film successes, he\u2019d purchased 5,000 acres, some of which was a mountain resort but most of the land was for wilderness preserves. He named it Sundance, after his character in \u201cButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\u201d",
      "In 1981, the year he won best picture and director for \u201cOrdinary People,\u201d he established the Sundance Institute, a nonprofit organization and held the first filmmakers lab at the Sundance Mountain Resort, about 13 miles northeast of Provo. A few years later, in 1985, the institute took over what was then known as the U.S. Film Festival, which would later be renamed the Sundance Film Festival. The festival in the mid-80s hosted the Coen brothers \u201cBlood Simple\u201d and Jim Jarmusch\u2019s \u201cStranger Than Paradise.\u201d",
      "The festival was really put on the map when Soderbergh premiered \u201csex, lies and videotape\u201d in Park City in 1989. A true indie, the film went on to win the Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes and get an Oscar nomination, but it was its box office success that ignited a veritable indie film boom. And Sundance was where all the discoveries were happening. In 1991, the festival premiered \u201cDaughters of the Dust,\u201d \u201cParis is Burning\u201d and \u201cSlacker,\u201d in 1992, Tarantino\u2019s \u201cReservoir Dogs,\u201d in 1993, Wes Anderson brought \u201cBottle Rocket,\u201d and in 1994 \u201cHoop Dreams\u201d and \u201cClerks.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for Robert Redford, independent art houses might not have succeeded,\u201d said Gary Meyer, cofounder of Landmark Theatre, and a former festival director at Telluride who also worked with Redford. \u201cHaving the \u2018Sundance Kid\u2019 give his stamp of approval to independent features and documentaries brought audiences to our theaters, while helping launch the careers of dozens of filmmakers \u2026 He made it \u2018cool\u2019 to see adventurous movies when they came to commercial neighborhood theaters.\u201d",
      "In 1994, the Sundance Institute also made a commitment to Indigenous filmmakers by launching a festival program to showcase Native and Indigenous films that continues to this day.",
      "The festival might get the most headlines, but it\u2019s the year-round work of the Institute that has really left a mark on independent cinema. The screenwriting and directing labs have been just as, if not more, influential in helping to launch the first films of many of Hollywood\u2019s top filmmakers over the past 40 years, under the leadership of Michelle Satter, who has helped shepherd projects from \u201cHard Eight\u201d to \u201cFruitvale Station\u201d and \u201cLove & Basketball.\u201d",
      "\u201cSundance changed the trajectory of my career,\u201d filmmaker and labs adviser Gina Prince-Bythewood told the AP in 2023. \u201cHow many of these special projects would have never seen the light of day without Michelle, without Robert Redford\u2019s vision, without this incredible place? It\u2019s actually really scary to think about.\u201d",
      "Native filmmaker Sterlin Harjo (\u201cRez Ball\u201d) said that his career as a young man was defined by Redford\u2019s support for independent cinema and supporting Native storytelling.",

      "Redford had worried for years that the festival had outgrown Park City, Utah. In 1996, an estimated 15,504 attended the festival. In 2015, the number had ballooned to 46,100. It peaked in 2018 with 124,900 festivalgoers. The festival estimated that the 2025 edition had 85,472 in-person attendees, a 17% increase from 2024.",

      "There were already plans in the works to celebrate the vision of Redford. In the wake of his death, that tribute will be even more deeply felt.",
      "Former Sundance director John Cooper, a close friend of Redford\u2019s who led the festival from 2009 to 2020, told The Associated Press in an interview earlier this year that he felt like his role was \u201cto be a keeper of the flame for Robert Redford and his legacy.\u201d Now, Cooper, the artistic director of Sonoma's True West Film Center who is still a regular presence at Sundance said, that mission is more important than ever. It\u2019s \u201ca lot to process, going from a legacy that was alive in him to one we have to carry on,\u201d Cooper told the AP. That legacy, he said, centers on spreading the power of storytelling.",

      "Major League Baseball has canceled plans to play games in London next season due to scheduling conflicts with West Ham's Olympic Stadium and TV commitments",
      "NEW YORK -- Major League Baseball has abandoned plans to play two games in London next season because of scheduling issues with West Ham's Olympic Stadium and the sport's television partner.",
      "MLB had hoped to have the New York Yankees and Toronto Blue Jays meet in London on June 13 and 14, but West Ham is home for its Premier League finale against Leeds on May 24. That left too little time to convert the field to baseball, and MLB was unable to schedule games there for later in June because Fox lacked available broadcast slots due to World Cup commitments.",
      "Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said Tuesday after his question-and-answer session at Front Office Sports' \u201cTuned In\u201d event that the London games were definitely off.",
      "MLB played in London for the first time in 2019 when the New York Yankees swept two games from the Boston Red Sox. A planned two-game series between the St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs in 2020 was canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic, and series were split there by the Cardinals and Cubs in 2023 and the New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies in 2024.",

      "\u201cWe remain interested in Europe. We think London is an important jumping off point for us,\u201d Manfred said during his Q&A session. \u201cWe have a facility that has come a long way since the first Yankee-Red Sox game. It\u2019s a much better ballpark now than it was due to their willingness to make investments in that. We continue to believe that there\u2019s an opportunity there and that we can get at the developed economies in Europe through that London entree.\u201d",
      "Manfred said MLB is working on grassroots initiatives in India because of that nation's affinity for cricket.",
      "\u201cWe're really starting from the bottom up,\u201d he said.",
      "Mexico also is a priority. MLB played regular-season games at Monterrey in 1996, 1999, 2018 and 2019, and at Mexico City in 2023 and 2024. Arizona and San Diego are likely to play at Mexico City next April 25 and 26.",
      "\u201cWe have worked very hard to develop better relationships with the Mexican professional leagues,\" Manfred said. \"We think we can ultimately build those relationships in a way that they look like Japan and Korea: The domestic professional league thrives, but we have enough players coming to the U.S. to play that it drives our business here in the U.S.\u201d",
      "MLB has gained in the Asian market, especially in recent years because of Shohei Ohtani's following. MLB opened the season at Tokyo in 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2019 and this year, and at Seoul, South Korea, in 2024.",
      "\u201cOur approach to international has always been country by country, largely because we find the places we\u2019re interested in to be in different stages of development,\u201d Manfred said. \"With respect to Japan and Korea, we made investments there. We monetarily, and players, in terms of the sweat equity involved, of making the trip to Tokyo to open the season, making the trip to Seoul to open the season, that we have started to see return on those investments.",
      "\u201cI think that the opportunity to monetize the great fan base that we have in Japan and Korea will show up in terms of purely international revenue, but it will also show up in our national media. My prediction is there will be some of the more media companies \u2014 the streamers will be really interested in the ability to get access to well-developed economies where they don\u2019t have as much penetration as they do in countries like the United States and Canada.

      "Police identified the suspect as Kelvin Evans and said he was booked into jail on charges of entering a vehicle with the intent to commit theft and a parole violation. Online jail records for metro Atlanta's Fulton County did not list an attorney for Evans.",

      "The play \u201cArt\u201d returns to Broadway with a fresh revival and a starry cast",
      "For evidence of how high inflation has gotten, look no further than Broadway. The fancy painting at the heart of the play \u201cArt\u201d cost the equivalent of $40,000 in 1998. In a crackling new revival, it's a hefty $300,000.",
      "The painting in question is a 4-by-5-foot white-on-white work with white lines. Playwright Yasmina Reza puts it at the center of an escalating fight between three male, middle-aged friends that exposes their fault lines, leading to a night in which each are ripped apart by the others and putting a 25-year friendship in jeopardy.",
      "If $300,000 sounds like a ridiculous price for a monothematic canvas, you'll side with Marc, played with pitch-perfect exasperation by Bobby Cannavale. If the painting speaks to you, you'll be with Serge, a flinty, slightly full-of-himself Neil Patrick Harris. If you just want to hang out and not talk about the painting any more, you'll identify with James Corden's hapless Yvan.",
      "Under Scott Ellis' tight and enthralling direction and with three perfectly cast actors who seem to be having a ball at the Music Box Theatre, \u201cArt\u201d frequently erupts in laughter but still has plenty to say about friendship, power dynamics and how we get on each others' nerves. The 90-minute play opened Tuesday night.",
      "This is the first time \u201cArt,\u201d translated from the original French by Christopher Hampton and which won the Tony Award for best play in 1998 starring Alan Alda, Victor Garber and Alfred Molina, has returned to Broadway, and it feels nothing like an antique. Designer David Rockwell puts the latest three lads in an elegant gray, spare living room that reeks of chilly luxury but also has little personality.",
      "Marc believes that Serge \u2014 by buying the Modernist painting against the express aesthetic rules followed by Marc \u2014 is indicating that he has stepped out of Marc\u2019s shadow. It is for him nothing less than a betrayal. Serge finds a new intolerance and inflexibility in his friend and a hostility to things new. They both lobby Yvan to be on their side, and when he vacillates, he is declared a spineless amoeba.",

      "Cannavale's Marc is prone to outbursts and patting his friend's shoulders, less out of affection than an expression of dominance. Harris' Serge goes from needy to flinty to icy, and Corden fills his Yvan with the comedian's gift for physical comedy, literally plunging into a sofa to search for something or looking sheepish as he buttons a jacket.",
      "A highlight is a hysterical scene in which the three men, still festering their grievances, silently eat olives and drop the pits in a bowl with a loud ting. And Corden triggers a mid-show ovation after nailing a 900-word monster of a monologue that smacks of Mark Rylance doing something similar in the same theater in \u201cLa B\u00eate.\u201d",

      "Robert Redford, who died Tuesday at 89, was known for his deep commitment to activism, especially for Native American rights and the environment",
      "NEW YORK -- Lorie Lee Sekayumptewa, a former administrator with the Navajo Nation Film Office, remembers seeing Robert Redford at traditional cultural dances at the Hopi village of Hotevilla in New Mexico. It was more than 30 years ago and he was serving as executive producer of the 1991 release \u201cThe Dark Wind,\" a drama about Navajo life.",
      "Redford stood out for his Hollywood looks and for his un-Hollywood behavior, from his earnest desire to learn more about the tribe\u2019s spiritual knowledge to his visits to the Navajo Nation, where Sekayumptewa\u2019s father served as the dean of students at the tribal college and would show Redford\u2019s movies at the student union building.",
      "\u201cEven at home, he would bring that camera and film home to us, put up a sheet and we would invite our neighbors and the kids and we would all be there in our living room, watching these movies,\u201d the 54-year-old Sekayumptewa, who is Navajo, Hopi and Sac and Fox Nation, said of Redford.",
      "\u201cWe were all fans.\u201d",
      "Redford, who died Tuesday at age 89, was hardly the only liberal activist to emerge out of Hollywood, but few matched his knowledge and focus, his humility and dedication. Fellow actors and leaders of the causes he fought for spoke of his unusually deep legacy, his fight for Native Americans and the environment that began at the height of his stardom.",
      "In the mid-1970s, around the same time he was appearing in such blockbusters as \u201cThe Sting\u201d and \u201cThe Way We Were,\" he immersed himself in the emerging environmental movement. He successfully opposed a power plant being built in his adopted state, Utah, and lobbied for the landmark bills the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. He also joined the board of the non-profit Natural Resources Defense Council, where he remained a guiding force up to his death.",
      "\u201cHis legacy was extraordinary,\u201d says NRDC CEO and President Manish Bapna. \u201cOne of the things that was most extraordinary about him was that he understood the power of storytelling. He could talk about climate change and the toll it was inflicting on people and communities \u2014 the fisherman coping with rising seas, a family fleeing for their lives from a raging wildfire. He would record messages, give talks or speak in front of Congress.\"",
      "Bapna last saw Redford a few months ago, when they dined in New York City.",
      "\u201cHe chose his words carefully, and every word he said was profound. He said we must continue to find ways to tell stories that reach people,\u201d Bapna said.",
      "Redford had a longtime affinity for the environment. After growing up in Southern California in the 1930s and '40s, he was disheartened to see Los Angeles transform after World War II into a mecca of pollution and traffic jams. In the early 1960s, when he came upon Provo Canyon, Utah, during a cross-country motorcycle trip, he was so awed and invigorated by the landscape that he eventually settled in the area.",
      "Entertainers over time have come to identify and, be identified with, a given cause: Harry Belafonte and civil rights, Paul Newman and nuclear disarmament, Jane Fonda and the Vietnam War. Redford, as much as anyone, helped make the environment an issue for the Hollywood elite, whether for Fonda or Julia Louis-Dreyfus or Leonardo DiCaprio, a fellow NRDC board member who called Redford's death \u201ca huge loss to our community\u201d and cited his legacy an actor and activist.",

The following year, the foundation reached an agreement with the Navajo Nation to manage thousands of wild horses on the reservation and keep the animals from being sent to slaughter houses.",

      "Robert Redford's career spans generations, making every film notable",
      "When you\u2019re a larger-than-life, generation-spanning star like Robert Redford, the hard truth is that every movie is notable in some way. He was iconic in his own time, whether in front of the camera, or behind it. And in his lifetime, so many of his films transcended their original reviews to find passionate fanbases: Just ask older millennials about the 1992 hacker movie \u201cSneakers\u201d or the \u201cSex and the City\u201d generation about \u201cThe Way We Were.\u201d",
      "Redford died Tuesday at 89, leaving behind an arsenal of great roles that he owned, whether he was playing a quiet CIA agent, a con man, a baseball player, a grizzled mariner, an ambitious journalist, or a charming WASP in love. You could make a feast out of his Sydney Pollack collaborations alone, staring with \u201cJeremiah Johnson\u201d (streaming on Tubi ), a classic that also took on a surprising afterlife as a meme that became so popular, younger generations didn\u2019t even realize it was Redford behind that beard. His very last role came this year, a cameo in \u201cDark Winds,\u201d the AMC show about Navajo police officers he produced.",
      "This is a list of some of Redford's most memorable performances, but don\u2019t forget about the films he directed, too: among them are the all-timers \u201cOrdinary People\u201d ( streaming on MGM+ ), which won him the best director Oscar, and \u201cQuiz Show\u201d (rent on Apple TV+ ), which got him another nod.",
      "Redford and Jane Fonda play a passionate but mismatched newlywed couple whose relationship is tested by their walk-up New York apartment in this Neil Simon comedy. Reprising the role he'd played on Broadway, Redford is the uptight, conservative foil to her more free-spirited character and they\u2019re both stunningly beautiful and fun to watch. Fonda told The Guardian in 2015 that she was \u201calways in love with Robert Redford.\u201d He later responded that he wasn\u2019t aware. The two also appeared together in \u201cThe Chase\u201d (1966), \u201cThe Electric Horseman\u201d (1979) and \u201cOur Souls at Night\u201d (2017).",

      "This was one of Redford\u2019s passion projects, his first independent feature that taught him some hard lessons about Hollywood. \u201cThat was when I learned about how the film industry really works,\u201d Redford told the Harvard Business Review in 2002. \u201cThe studio simply tossed \u2018Downhill Racer\u2019 away without a second thought.

      "The evening also brought meaningful wins for Jean Smart, Stephen Colbert and 15-year-old Owen Cooper, whose Netflix series \u201cAdolescence\u201d dominated the limited series categories.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m legitimately embarrassed by how happy this makes me,\u201d \u201cThe Studio\u201d co-creator Rogen said with his signature giggle, surrounded by cast and crew from the Apple TV+ movie-business romp after it won best comedy at the Peacock Theater in a show hosted by Nate Bargatze that aired on CBS. Rogen personally won four, including best actor.",
      "\u201cThe Pitt\u201d from HBO Max completed a sentimental journey with its win for best drama series. The character-driven medical drama won over viewers and gained emotional momentum during a season whose biggest drama prizes once seemed destined to be swept by \u201cSeverance.\u201d",
      "Wyle won best actor in a drama for playing a grizzled, warm-but-worn-down supervising doctor, getting his first Emmy after five nominations with no victories in the 1990s for playing a scrubbed young cub doctor on \u201cER.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat a dream this has been,\u201d Wyle said. \u201cOh my goodness.\u201d",
      "Katherine LaNasa, whose nurse is perhaps the show's most beloved character, was a surprise winner of best supporting actress in a drama over three women of \u201cThe White Lotus\u201d on a night when every acting Emmy but one went to a first-time victor.",
      "The first-timers included Britt Lower, who won best actress in a drama, and Tramell Tillman, who won best supporting actor, in the night's two biggest moments for \u201cSeverance.\u201d",

    "summary": "The Library of Congress has named Arthur Sze the new U.S. poet laureate",
    "story": [
      "The Library of Congress has named Arthur Sze the new U.S. poet laureate",
      "At a time when its leadership is in question and its mission challenged, the Library of Congress has named a new U.S. poet laureate, the much-honored author and translator Arthur Sze.",
      "The library announced Monday that the 74-year-old Sze had been appointed to a one-year term, starting this fall. The author of 12 poetry collections and recipient last year of a lifetime achievement award from the library, he succeeds Ada Lim\u00f3n, who had served for three years. Previous laureates also include Joy Harjo, Louise Gl\u00fcck and Billy Collins.",
      "Speaking during a recent Zoom interview with The Associated Press, Sze acknowledged some misgivings when Rob Casper, who heads the library\u2019s poetry and literature center, called him in June about becoming the next laureate. He wondered about the level of responsibilities and worried about the upheaval since President Donald Trump fired Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden in May. After thinking about it overnight, he called Casper back and happily accepted.",
      "\u201cI think it was the opportunity to give something back to poetry, to something that I\u2019ve spent my life doing,\u201d he explained, speaking from his home in Santa Fe, New Mexico. \u201cSo many people have helped me along the way. Poetry has just helped me grow so much, in every way.\u201d",
      "Sze\u2019s new job begins during a tumultuous year for the library, a 200-year-old, nonpartisan institution that holds a massive archive of books published in the United States. Trump abruptly fired Hayden after conservative activists accused her of imposing a \u201cwoke\u201d agenda, criticism that Trump has expressed often as he seeks sweeping changes at the Kennedy Center, the Smithsonian museums and other cultural institutions.",
      "Hayden\u2019s ouster was sharply criticized by congressional Democrats, leaders in the library and scholarly community and such former laureates as Lim\u00f3n and Harjo. It also led to a debate over who has the authority to decide on an interim replacement.",
      "Although the White House announced that it had named Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche as the acting librarian, daily operations are being run by a longtime official at the library, Robert Randolph Newlen. Events such as the annual National Book Festival have continued without interruption or revision.",
      "Laureates are forbidden to take political positions, although the tradition was breached in 2003 when Collins publicly stated his objections to President George W. Bush\u2019s push for war against Iraq.",
      "Newlen is identified in Monday\u2019s announcement as acting librarian, a position he was in line for according to the institution's guidelines. He praised Sze, whose influences range from ancient Chinese poets to Wallace Stevens, for his \u201cdistinctly American\u201d portraits of the Southwest landscapes and for his \u201cgreat formal innovation.\u201d",

      "\u201cLike Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman, Sze forges something new from a range of traditions and influences \u2014 and the result is a poetry that moves freely throughout time and space,\u201d his statement reads in part.",
      "Sze\u2019s official title is poet laureate consultant in poetry, a 1985 renaming of a position established in 1937 as consultant in poetry to the Library of Congress. The mission is loosely defined as a kind of literary ambassador, to \u201craise the national consciousness to a greater appreciation of the reading and writing of poetry.\u201d Initiatives have included Robert Pinsky\u2019s \u201cFavorite Poem Project,\u201d for which the public would share thoughts on works of their choosing, and Lim\u00f3n\u2019s \u201cYou Are Here,\u201d which included poetry installations at national parks.",
      "Sze wants to focus on a passion going back more than a half-century to his undergraduate years at the University of California, Berkeley \u2014 translation. He remembers reading some English-language editions of Chinese poetry, finding the work \u201cantiquated and dated\u201d and deciding to translate some of it himself, writing out the Chinese characters and engaging with them \u201con a much deeper level\u201d than he had expected. Besides his own poetry, he has published \u201cThe Silk Dragon: Translations from the Chinese.\u201d",
      "\u201cI personally learned my own craft of writing poetry through translating poetry,\u201d he says. \u201cI often think that people think of poetry as intimidating, or difficult, which isn\u2019t necessarily true. And I think one way to deepen the appreciation of poetry is to approach it through translation.\u201d",
      "Sze is a New York City native and son of Chinese immigrants who in such collections as \u201cSight Lines\u201d and \u201cCompass Rose\u201d explores themes of cultural and environmental diversity and what he calls \u201ccoexisting.\u201d In a given poem, he might shift from rocks above a pond to people begging in a subway, from a firing squad in China to Thomas Jefferson\u2019s plantation in Virginia. His many prizes include the National Book Award for \u201cSight Lines\u201d and such lifetime achievement honors as the Jackson Poetry Prize and the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize.",
      "He loves poetry from around the world but feels at home writing in English, if only for the \u201crichness of the vocabulary\u201d and the wonders of its origins.",
      "\u201cI was just looking at the word \u2018ketchup,\u2019 which started from southern China, went to Malaysia, was taken to England, where it became a tomato-based sauce, and then, of course, to America,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I was just thinking days ago, that\u2019s a word we use every day without recognizing its ancestry, how it\u2019s crossed borders, how it\u2019s entered into the English language and enriched it.\u201d",

      "He co-wrote \u201cLast Train to Clarksville\" and \"I'm Not Your Steppin' Stone.\"",
      "NEW YORK -- Songwriter Bobby Hart, a key part of the Monkees' multimedia empire who teamed with Tommy Boyce on such hits as \u201cLast Train to Clarksville\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m Not Your Steppin\u2019 Stone,\u201d has died. He was 86.",
      "Hart died at his home in Los Angeles, according to his friend and co-author, Glenn Ballantyne. He had been in poor health since breaking his hip last year.",
      "Boyce and Hart were a prolific and successful duo in the mid-1960s, especially for the Monkees, the made-for-television group promoted by Don Kirshner. They wrote the Monkees' theme song, with its opening shot, \"Here we come, walkin' down the street,\" and enduring chant, \"Hey, hey, we're the Monkees,\" and their first No. 1 hit, \u201cLast Train to Clarksville.\u201d The Monkees' eponymous, million-selling debut album included six songs from Boyce and Hart, who also served as producers and used their own backing musicians, the Candy Store Prophets, as session players.",
      "\"I always credit them not only with writing many of our biggest hits, but, as producers, being instrumental in creating the unique Monkee sound we all know and love,\" the Monkees' Micky Dolenz wrote in a foreword to Hart's memoir, \"Psychedelic Bubblegum,\" published in 2015.",
      "As Boyce and Hart grew in fame and the Monkees took more control of their work, they pursued their own careers, releasing the albums \"Test Patterns\" and \"I Wonder What She's Doing Tonite\" and appearing on such sitcoms as \"I Dream of Jeannie\" and \"Bewitched.\" They also were politically active. They campaigned for Robert F. Kennedy when he ran for president in 1968 and wrote the brassy \"L.U.V. (Let Us Vote)\" in support of the 26th Amendment, which in 1971 lowered the voting age from 21 to 18. Their other songs included the Monkees' melancholy \"I Wanna Be Free\" and the theme to the daytime soap opera \"Days of Our Lives.\"",
      "They were covered by everyone from Dean Martin (\"Little Lovely One\") to the Sex Pistols (\"I'm Not Your Steppin' Stone\").",
      "In the 1970s and '80s, Hart managed several hits with other collaborators and even contributed material to another TV act, the Partridge Family. He worked with Austin Roberts on \"Over You,\" an Oscar-nominated ballad performed by Betty Buckley in \"Tender Mercies,\" and with Dick Eastman on \"My Secret (Didja Gitit Yet?)\" for New Edition. He and Bryce toured with Dolenz and fellow Monkee Davy Jones in the '70s, put out the album \"Dolenz, Jones, Boyce & Hart\" and received renewed attention when the Monkees enjoyed a comeback in the 1980s.",

      "He was a minister's son, born Robert Luke Harshman in Phoenix, Arizona. In his memoir, he remembered himself as a shy kid with a \"strong desire to distinguish\" himself, as he wrote in \"Psychedelic Bubblegum.\" Music was the answer. By high school, he had learned piano, guitar and the Hammond B-3 organ. He also started his own amateur radio station, eventually adding a console, turntables and microphones. After graduating from high school and serving in the Army reserves, he settled in Los Angeles in the late 1950s, hoping first to become a disc jockey, but soon working as a songwriter and session musician. His name shortened to Bobby Hart, he toured as a member of Teddy Randazzo and the Dazzlers, and with Randazzo and Bobby Weinstein wrote \"Hurt So Bad,\" a hit for Little Anthony and the Imperials later covered by Linda Ronstadt.",
      "He also befriended Boyce, a singer and songwriter from Charlottesville, Virginia, with a \"very unusual personality, spontaneous and extroverted, yet very cool at the same time.\" Boyce and Hart helped write the top 10 hit \"Come a Little Bit Closer\" for Jay and the Americans and were a strong enough combination that Kirshner recruited them for his Screen Gems songwriting factory: They were assigned to the Monkees. Asked to come up with songs for a quartet openly modeled on the Beatles, they devised a twangy guitar line similar to the one for the \"Paperback Writer\" and wrote \"Last Train to Clarksville,\" a chart topper in 1966 based in part on Hart's mishearing of the Beatles hit (he thought Paul McCartney was singing \u201ctake the last train\u201d near the end; McCartney was singing \u201cpaperback writer\u201d).",
      "When Kirshner suggested a song with a girl's name in the title, they turned out \"Valleri\" and reached the top 5. For the show's theme song, a stroll outside was enough.",
      "\"Boyce began strumming his guitar and I joined in by snapping my fingers & making noises with my mouth that simulated an open & closed hi-hat cymbal,\" Hart wrote in his memoir. \"We had created the perfect recipe for inspiration and started singing about just what we were doing: 'Walkin' down the street.'\"",

      "A new Whitney Houston song has arrived 13 years after her death",
      "NEW YORK -- It sounds impossible, but that's the magic of it. On Thursday, a new Whitney Houston song arrives 13 years after her death.",
      "English singer Calum Scott is responsible. The single is a duet between Scott and Houston, a balladic reinterpretation of the timeless \u201cI Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me),\u201d using Houston's original vocal stems. (Stems are the individual musical elements that, when combined, make up a song.)",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t even something I could have dreamt as a possibility, and the fact that I'm getting to do it is, geez, one of the honors of my career,\u201d Scott told The Associated Press. Houston's voice is one that soundtracked his childhood \u2014 courtesy his mom \u2014 and he refers to Houston as one of the most influential performers in his life and the lives of many.",
      "\u201cTimeless,\u201d he describes her.",
      "Here's how the new song came into existence.",
      "Such an undertaking couldn't be possible without the approval of a number of parties. Specifically, it required Pat Houston, Whitney\u2019s sister-in-law and the executor of her estate, and Primary Wave, which acquired the copyrights to hit Whitney Houston songs as part of a 2022 deal.",
      "Pat Houston says the idea for Scott's \u201cI Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\u201d actually came from Primary Wave. They were familiar with Scott's live cover version of the song from his stint opening for Ed Sheeran in 2024. On that tour, Scott stripped the 1987 classic down into a ballad, blending it with Robyn's \u201cDancing On My Own.\u201d",
      "After hearing what Scott could do with the song \u2014 taking it from its up-tempo pop spirit to a big-hearted ballad, while also taking into consideration that 2025 marks the 40th anniversary of Houston's music career \u2014 Pat Houston was on board. It was yet another opportunity for celebration. \u201cI said, you know what, this is a no-brainer. This is the Houston style. So, let\u2019s go with this,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cWhitney was a balladeer and that\u2019s why we all fell in love with her,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd Calum turned the song into a beautiful ballad.\u201d",
      "First, the Houston estate and Primary Wave provided Scott with the original vocal stems, produced by her longtime producer Narada Michael Walden. Then Scott recorded the song with producers Jon \u201cMAGS\u201d Maguire, Andrew Yeates and Charlie T in the U.K. in \u201cabout a week,\u201d he recalls. They were joined by a string section, which gave additional dimension to their somber take on the song.",
      "\u201cTake a pop song and make it sad,\u201d Scott jokes of his approach.",
      "Recording the ballad made sense because, as Scott points out, the lyrics to the original song are a bit melancholic. \u201cYou want to dance with somebody who loved you, you know, you're not actually dancing with them,\u201d he says. It's about yearning. But in an early demo, the chorus was recorded in a minor chord \u2014 which sounded a bit too depressing. The change was made swiftly; even slowed, the song needed some of that Houston ebullience.",

      "Another early decision: The new song would start with just Houston's voice, alone, in the first verse. \u201cWhitney starts the song because this is her song,\u201d Scott says simply. \u201cI would never dare stand in front of Whitney for that first verse.\u201d",
      "Eagle-eyed (eared?) fans might notice the sound of a snare drum bleeding into her vocal on that verse \u2014 because it was originally recorded to tape, not digitally, and because \u201cwe can\u2019t change anything like that because those are etched into the song and into her vocal,\u201d says Scott. \u201cAnd to remove it would be taking a piece away.\u201d",
      "It's one of the reasons they kept the song's iconic key change in the last chorus as well.",
      "\u201cI really had to dig for those high notes,\u201d he says of the recording. \u201cIt was an honor just to harmonize with her.\u201d",
      "Scott looked to the original songwriters for approval \u2014 the dream team of George Merrill and Shannon Rubicam. They were immediately on board.",
      "\u201cSome people would have come in and they would have added something ... to boost their visibility next to Whitney. And he had the boldness to tear it all down and just have acoustic piano, just Whitney, and then give her the first verse,\u201d said Merrill. \u201cAnd I mean, this is his project. To me, that\u2019s showing such respect.\u201d",
      "That, and they recognize Scott as a virtuosic vocalist. \u201cHis music really features his voice, as with Adele or Whitney, and rightly so because he can carry it off,\u201d said Rubicam. \u201cThere aren\u2019t just hundreds of people who can carry that off with his kind of power.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re a good vocal match together,\u201d she adds. \u201cThey both got a lot of emotionality and command also of their vocal instrument. ... Whitney could overpower a lot of people. But for Calum, he\u2019s confident and he had a vision about it and they both are meeting at an emotional level.\u201d",
      "\u201cI felt like I gently walked alongside Whitney,\u201d says Scott. The song is meant to feel alive, channeling the spirit of Houston \u2014 not a tribute, but an active single. It's why their version of \u201cI Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\u201d will be featured on his new album \u201cAvenoir,\u201d out Oct. 10.",
      "\u201cThis is as much part of my story as any other song on the album,\u201d he says. \u201cJust being given the honor of it has been, you know, I could die a very happy man now.\u201d",
      "\u201cForty years ago, this particular song was hot then and it\u2019s hot now,\u201d says Pat Houston. \u201cSo why not keep producing. But it\u2019s the right connection, it's the right platform and it certainly is the right artist to collab with her on this.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s new vaccine advisory committee meets this week, with votes expected on whether to change recommendations on shots against COVID-19, hepatitis B and chickenpox.",
      "The exact questions to be voted on Thursday and Friday in Atlanta are unclear. Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to questions seeking details to a newly posted agenda, although the department announced five additional appointments to the committee Monday.",
      "Some public health experts are worried that the votes will \u2014 at a minimum \u2014 raise unwarranted new questions about vaccines in the minds of parents.",
      "Perhaps even more consequential would be a vote that restricts a government program from paying for vaccines for low-income families.",
      "\u201cI'm tightening my seat belt,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University vaccines expert.",
      "The panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, makes recommendations to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on how already-approved vaccines should be used. CDC directors have almost always accepted those recommendations, which are widely heeded by doctors and guide vaccination programs.",
      "Kennedy, a leading antivaccine activist before becoming the nation\u2019s top health official, fired the entire 17-member panel earlier this year and replaced it with a group that includes several anti-vaccine voices.",
      "Here's a look at the three vaccines being discussed:",
      "Before Kennedy was health secretary, ACIP would typically vote in June to reaffirm recommendations for shots against respiratory viruses that sicken millions of Americans each fall and winter.",
      "This past June, Kennedy's ACIP voted to recommend flu shots for Americans but was silent on COVID-19 shots.",
      "Before that meeting, Kennedy announced he was removing COVID-19 shots from the CDC's recommendations for healthy children and pregnant women. The move was heavily criticized by doctors' groups and public health organizations, and prompted a lawsuit by the American Academy of Pediatrics and other groups.",
      "Days after Kennedy's announcement, CDC officials said families could still get the 2024-2025 version of COVID-19 shots for their kids in consultation with their doctors. That clarification meant shots would still be covered by the federal government's Vaccines For Children program, which pays for shots for families who lack money or adequate health insurance coverage. It's now responsible for roughly half of childhood vaccinations in the U.S. each year.",
      "As with flu shots, however, there are new COVID-19 formulations each fall, to account for changes in which strains are circulating. The committee has not yet voted on whether to recommend this season's COVID-19 shots or whether those shots should be covered by the VFC program.",
      "Further complicating the picture: When the FDA last month licensed this fall's COVID-19 shots, the agency took the unusual step of narrowing their use for healthy younger adults and children.",
      "If the ACIP simply follows that, and if there is no additional clarifying language from the CDC, then \u201cthat would take away access for roughly half of America\u2019s kids,\u201d said Dr. Sean O'Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "The pediatricians group urges that vaccinations continue for all children ages 6 months to 2 years.",
      "Hepatitis B can cause serious liver infections. In adults, the virus is spread through sex or through sharing needles during use injection-drug use.",
      "But the virus also can be passed to a baby from an infected mother, and as many as 90% of infected infants go on to have chronic infections.",
      "A hepatitis B vaccine was first licensed in the U.S. in 1981. In 2005, the ACIP recommended a dose within 24 hours of birth for all medically stable infants who weigh at least 4.4 pounds (2 kilograms).",
      "Infant vaccinations are stressed for women who have hepatitis B or, crucially, who have not been tested for it. The infant shots are 85% to 95% effective in preventing chronic hepatitis B infections, studies have shown.",
      "Newborn hepatitis B vaccinations are considered a success, and no recent peer-reviewed research shows any safety problem with giving kids the shots on their first day of life, Schaffner said.",

      "Youth in Lahaina, Hawaii, have been struggling since wildfires destroyed their hometown two years ago",
      "LAHAINA, Hawaii -- Mia Palacio felt like she lost a piece of herself when wildfires destroyed her hometown of Lahaina.",
      "She isolated from loved ones after the 2023 disaster while struggling to process the grief, often angry that her family didn't have a permanent place to stay and that so many others were unable to evacuate.",
      "Moving between high schools, she never felt welcome, Palacio said, and the pain only intensified as the months wore on. Finally, near the first anniversary of the fires, Palacio reached out for help.",
      "Hundreds of students like Palacio have struggled mentally since the fires \u2013 and not all have received the help they need.",
      "The Hawaii Department of Education estimates more than a third of Maui students lost a family member, sustained a serious injury or had a parent lose a job after the fires, which killed 102 people and damaged more than 3,300 properties in Lahaina.",
      "____",
      "AP is collaborating with Honolulu Civil Beat, CalMatters, Blue Ridge Public Radio, and Centro de Periodismo Investigativo in Puerto Rico to examine how school communities are recovering from the disruption of natural disasters.",
      "____",
      "Two years later, many in Lahaina are ready to return to normal. But therapists say students\u2019 mental health challenges continue to mount.",
      "That\u2019s common after a disaster, especially at the two-year mark, when adrenaline wears off and stress remains high, said Christopher Knightsbridge, one of several researchers at the University of Hawaii who has studied the well-being of Lahaina fire survivors. While kids may feel numb immediately following a disaster, after two years, they\u2019re facing the toll of constant uncertainty and change, he said.",
      "It\u2019s a phenomenon seen wherever schooling has been disrupted by natural disasters, reporting by Honolulu Civil Beat, The Associated Press and several other news outlets shows. But a couple years after the disaster, schools are not always prepared with extra mental health supports.",
      "On Maui, the island is dealing with an ongoing shortage of specialists. In the past few years, the number of psychiatrists serving youth has dropped from four to two, even as demand has grown.",
      "\u201cThe crisis isn\u2019t over,\u201d Knightsbridge said.",
      "Palacio made progress with the help of a school counselor and then a local organization that supports teens\u2019 mental health through outdoor activities and adventures.",
      "The senior at Lahainaluna High School said she\u2019s now more comfortable confiding in others and controlling her emotions. She takes pride in mentoring younger students who also have struggled since the fires.",
      "Two years in, many kids still wrestle with depression and anxiety.",
      "DayJahiah Valdivia, a senior at K\u012bhei Charter School, said her stress levels spike when there are strong winds or small brush fires. Valdivia lives in Upcountry Maui, which also faced wildfires that burned over a thousand acres of land on the same day as the 2023 Lahaina fires. Her home was spared, but it took months for her family to return because their property was covered in soot and needed professional cleaning.",
      "She feels less anxious now that her family members have discussed their escape plan for future disasters. But a summer fire near a friend\u2019s home in Central Maui renewed her fears about her loved ones\u2019 safety.",
      "\u201cThe anxiety never really wore off,\u201d she said. On windy days, it was especially difficult to concentrate in class or feel safe.",
      "In a University of Hawaii study of fire survivors conducted in 2024, just over half of children reported symptoms of depression, and 30% were likely facing an anxiety disorder. Nearly half of kids in the study, ages 10 to 17, were experiencing PTSD.",
      "Children in disaster-torn towns across the U.S. can relate.",
      "In Paradise, California, where the 2018 Camp Fire took 85 lives, a protracted period of disillusionment followed what some called the \u201chero phase,\u201d when the community pulled together and vowed to resurrect their town. Both Lahaina and Paradise had housing shortages after their fires, so families had to move away or live with friends to go to school or work in the area. In general, students who don\u2019t have a permanent living arrangement tend to struggle more academically and have more behavioral challenges, research shows.",
      "Many Paradise students still struggle with anxiety and grief, seven years later, making it difficult to fully engage in school. A year after the Camp Fire, 17% of students were homeless, and the suspension rate was 7.4%, compared to 2.5% statewide. The suspension rate remained nearly triple the state average last year, and more than 26% were chronically absent.",
      "Aryah Berkowitz, who lost her home, two dogs and her family\u2019s business in the Paradise blaze, dealt with lingering behavioral challenges following the disaster. For nearly a year afterward, her family of seven, plus a pair of surviving pit bull-Labrador mixes, lived with a friend in nearby Chico, sharing two bedrooms and a bathroom. Berkowitz, then in sixth grade, slept on the couch.",
      "\u201cI was having to help my family a lot and wasn\u2019t able to handle it,\u201d said Berkowitz , once a high-achieving student who was suspended twice after the fire. \u201cI was holding it inside and took it out on other people. Some days I\u2019d just walk out of class.\u201d",
      "Back on Maui, many students similarly disengaged from school.",

      "In a state survey of Maui students in the first year after the fires, roughly half of kids said they were having trouble focusing in class or felt upset when they were reminded of the wildfires.",
      "Some have struggled to retain class material or simply stopped attending in-person classes as they moved between hotel rooms and temporary housing, Lahainaluna High teacher Jarrett Chapin said. A few moved to online learning as their families faced continued instability.",
      "\u201cThey just sort of vanished,\u201d Chapin said.",
      "Maui has long dealt with medical workforce challenges. Even before the fires, it faced a shortage of mental health professionals because they struggled with the state\u2019s high cost of living and housing shortage.",
      "The fires brought burnout and greater economic obstacles, only exacerbating the issue. Since then, Hawaii\u2019s education department has tried to bulk up Maui\u2019s mental health staff by bringing in providers from neighbor islands and the mainland and, more recently, using a $2 million federal grant to support students.",
      "But hiring mental health staff has been so difficult that even the federal money hasn\u2019t made much of a dent. In the first nine months of the grant, the state education department primarily used the money to bus displaced students from other parts of the island to Lahaina schools.",
      "The state has used the money to hire five part-time mental health providers working with students and staff, including one specialist who works in the evenings with students living as boarders on Lahainaluna\u2019s campus, said Kimberly Lessard, a Department of Education district specialist.",
      "Two of the six behavioral health specialist positions in Lahaina schools remained unfilled this summer, as they have been for years due to Maui\u2019s housing shortage and high cost of living, Lessard said.",
      "Valdivia, who still struggles with anxiety from the Upcountry Maui fires, has seen the impacts of the provider shortage firsthand. She\u2019s on a two- to three-month waiting list to see a psychiatrist on Maui, and she\u2019s seeing an O\u02bbahu-based therapist via telehealth because there aren\u2019t enough providers who can meet with her in person.",
      "\u201cEven just to get evaluated (by a psychiatrist), it\u2019s literally months,\u201d she said. \u201cI just think that\u2019s crazy.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s common for disaster-torn communities to struggle with shortages of psychological staff, often because of burnout and a lack of resources.",
      "In Puerto Rico, which has suffered from a series of disasters since Hurricane Maria struck in 2017, students have experienced high rates of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.",
      "Yet despite legislation in 2000 to create more school psychologist positions, it wasn\u2019t until the pandemic that the commonwealth\u2019s Education Department dedicated money to hire them. Today, there are 58 vacancies across the archipelago\u2019s 870 schools.",
      "The school psychologists \u201ccan\u2019t keep up,\u201d said Nellie Zambrana, a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Puerto Rico at R\u00edo Piedras. Those who are working are overstretched, according to a study by the university\u2019s Psychological Research Institute. One psychologist, the study said, was assigned to more than 100 students at three schools.",
      "Loren Lapow wasn\u2019t deterred by the storm clouds gathering one June afternoon over D.T. Fleming Beach on Maui. The social worker helped teens carry an inflatable paddleboard to the water\u2019s edge, cheering them on as they swam.",
      "Amid the fun, Lapow directed the teens to reflect on their fears and losses. He asked them how they feel when they smell smoke or think about Lahaina\u2019s famed Front Street, most of which was destroyed in the blaze.",
      "\u201cPlaces are like a friend to us,\u201d Lapow said. \u201cWhen you lose places, it hurts.\u201d",
      "Lapow founded the Maui Hero Project, which his website describes as \u201cadventure-based counseling services.\u201d The eight-week program Lapow started 25 years ago teaches teens basic disaster preparedness skills and immerses them in outdoor activities. It's also a form of mental health support, which Lapow has leaned into since the wildfires.",
      "Lapow\u2019s approach has become a common strategy for nonprofits and therapists trying to reach kids who have balked at discussing their mental health since the fires. But those efforts don't always reach the kids who need the most help.",
      "There\u2019s a strong stigma around seeking mental health services, particularly in Filipino and Latino communities that make up a large portion of Lahaina\u2019s population, said Ruben Juarez, a professor at University of Hawaii who led the research study on fire survivors. Families may see counseling as a sign of weakness, and children may be reluctant to open up to therapists out of fear of being judged or scrutinized, he added.",
      "Yet in the study, Latino teens reported the highest rates of severe depressive and PTSD symptoms. Filipino teens reported some of the highest rates of anxiety.",
      "The state is hoping struggling students will open up to their peers. A new program called YouthLine will train Hawaii teens to respond to crisis calls, said Keli Acquaro, who oversees youth mental health for the state.",
      "Keakealani Cashman, who graduated from Kamehameha Schools Maui in 2024, is hoping to be part of the state\u2019s solution to provide more mental health support to the next generation of children.",
      "After losing her home to the fires, Cashman spent her senior year talking to Native Hawaiian practitioners and researching how cultural values, such as connections to the land and her ancestors, could help her community heal from the trauma of the fires. The project helped her own mental health improve, said Cashman, who regularly met with her school\u2019s behavioral health specialist.",
      "Now, Cashman is entering her second year at Brigham Young University Hawaii and hopes to work as a behavioral health specialist in Hawaiian language immersion schools",
      "\u201cThis horrible, horrible thing happened to me and my family, but I don\u2019t have to let it kill the rest of my life,\u201d Cashman said. \u201cI can really help my family, my community in school, and just make an impact in what I know how to do.\u201d",

      "A new study finds well-preserved areas of Amazon rainforest occupied and managed by Indigenous peoples show lower incidences of multiple diseases in the regions around them",
      "Every time humans cut into the Amazon rainforest or burn or destroy parts of it, they're making people sick.",
      "It's an idea Indigenous people have lived by for thousands of years. Now a new study in the journal Communications Earth & Environment adds to the scientific evidence supporting it, by finding that instances of several diseases were lowered in areas where forest was set aside for Indigenous peoples who maintained it well.",
      "With the United Nations climate summit set for Brazil in November, the study authors and outside experts said the work highlights the stakes for people around the world as negotiators try to address climate change. Belem, the city hosting the conference, is known as the gateway to the Amazon, and many who will be attending, from activists to delegates, think the role of Indigenous communities in climate action and conservation will be highlighted in a distinct way.",
      "\u201cThe \u2018forest man\u2019 or \u2018man forest,\u2019 according to the Indigenous perspective, has always been linked to the reciprocity between human health and the natural environment where one lives,\u201d said Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez Cayetano, president of the Federation of Ticuna and Yagua Communities of the Lower Amazon, or FECOTYBA, in the Peruvian Amazon. \u201cIf each state does not guarantee the rights and territories of Indigenous peoples, we would inevitably be harming their health, their lives, and the ecosystem itself.\u201d",
      "That harm can look like respiratory diseases such as asthma caused by toxic air pollution after fires, or illnesses that spread from animals to humans such as malaria, said Paula Prist, a senior program coordinator for the Forest and Grasslands Unit at the International Union for Conservation of Nature and one of the study authors.",
      "The researchers compiled and analyzed data on forest quality, legal recognition of Indigenous territory and disease incidence in the countries that border and include the Amazon.",
      "The work was \u201cimpressive\u201d to University of Washington health and climate scientist Kristie Ebi. She said it highlighted the complexity of factors that affect human health, and the importance of understanding the role Indigenous communities play in shaping it. \u201cUsing these methods, others could study other parts of the world,\u201d she said.",
      "The researchers found creative ways to account for other variables that can affect the spread of diseases, like access to health care in a given area, said Magdalena Hurtado, an anthropology and global health professor at Arizona State University and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences who was not involved with the study. But she expressed concern that the findings were presented with a precision that may not be warranted, given that they were based on correlation and use data on observations that can be difficult to measure.",
      "\u201cThey claim that Indigenous territories only protect health when forest cover is above 40%. And so that that feels like, why 40%? Why not 35? Or why not a range?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that the study is wrong, but it means that we need to be cautious because the patterns could change if different, more precise methods were used.\u201d",
      "Still, she thinks this is a starting point that could open the door to future research. \u201cThey are actually doing something quite beautiful,\u201d empirically connecting the legal recognition of Indigenous lands to human health outcomes, she said.",
      "Hern\u00e1ndez, of FECOTYBA, said that's important for the global policymakers who are coming to Brazil.",
      "\u201cFrom my Indigenous perspective, I think that this type of study would make our ancestral knowledge more visible and precise,\u201d he said.",

      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer is willing to risk a government shutdown at the end of the month if Republicans don\u2019t accept Democratic demands on health care",
      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer weathered backlash from Democrats earlier this year when he voted with Republicans to keep the government open. But he\u2019s now willing to risk a shutdown at the end of the month if Republicans don\u2019t accede to Democratic demands.",
      "Schumer says he and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries are united in opposing any legislation that doesn\u2019t include key health care provisions and a commitment not to roll them back. He argues that the country is in a different place than it was in March, when he vigorously argued against a shutdown, and he says he believes Republicans and President Donald Trump will be held responsible if they don\u2019t negotiate a bipartisan deal.",
      "\u201cThings have changed\u201d since the March vote, Schumer said in an interview with The Associated Press on Thursday. He said Republicans have since passed Trump\u2019s massive tax breaks and spending cuts legislation, which trimmed Medicaid and other government programs, and Democrats are now unified \u2014 unlike in March, when he voted with Republicans and Jeffries voted against legislation to fund the government.",
      "A shutdown, Schumer said, wouldn\u2019t necessarily worsen an environment in which Trump is already challenging the authority of Congress. \u201cIt will get worse with or without it, because Trump is lawless,\u201d Schumer said.",
      "Schumer\u2019s threat comes as Republicans are considering a short-term stopgap spending measure to avoid a Sept. 30 shutdown and as Democrats face what most see as two tough choices if the parties can\u2019t negotiate a deal \u2014 vote with Republicans to keep the government open or let it close indefinitely with no clear exit plan.",
      "It also comes amid worsening partisan tensions in the Senate, where negotiations between the two parties over the confirmation process broke down for a second time Thursday and Republicans are changing Senate rules to get around Democratic objections. Democrats are also fuming over the Trump administration\u2019s decision to unilaterally claw back $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid just as negotiations over the spending deadline were getting underway in late August.",
      "Republicans have said that Democrats clearly will be to blame if they don\u2019t vote to keep the government open, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has repeatedly said that Schumer needs to come to them with a specific proposal on health care, including an extension of expanded government tax credits for many Americans who get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. Some Republicans are open to extending those credits before they expire at the end of the year.",

      "Schumer\u2019s move to support the spending legislation in March put him in the rare position of bucking his party\u2019s base. He said then that of two bad options, a partial government shutdown was worse because it would give Trump even more control to shut down agencies and there would be \u201cno off-ramp\u201d to get out of it. \u201cI think people realize it\u2019s a tough choice,\u201d he said.",
      "He faced massive backlash from within the party after the vote, with some activists calling on him to resign. Jeffries temporarily distanced himself from his New York colleague, saying in a statement immediately after Schumer\u2019s vote that House Democrats \u201cwill not be complicit.\u201d The majority of Senate Democrats also voted against the plan.",
      "This time, though, Schumer is in lockstep with Jeffries and in messaging within his caucus. In Democrats\u2019 closed-door lunch Wednesday, he shared polling that he said suggested most Americans would blame Trump, not Democrats, for a shutdown.",

      "These events \u2014 all taking place in the month since the U.S.-Russia summit meeting in Alaska failed to bring peace to Ukraine \u2014 have only heightened tensions in eastern Europe.",
      "When Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, it came days after joint maneuvers with Belarus. The latest sweeping drills, dubbed \u201cZapad 2025\u201d \u2014 or \u201cWest 2025\u201d \u2014 have worried NATO members Poland, Latvia and Lithuania that border Belarus to the west.",
      "The maneuvers, which wrap up Tuesday, have included nuclear-capable bomber and warships, thousands of troops and hundreds of combat vehicles simulating a joint response to an enemy attack -\u2013 including what officials said was planning for nuclear weapons use and options involving Russia's new intermediate range ballistic missile, the Oreshnik.",

      "One year ago this month, Putin outlined a revision of Moscow's nuclear doctrine, noting that any nation\u2019s conventional attack on Russia that is supported by a nuclear power will be considered a joint attack on his country. That threat was clearly aimed at discouraging the West from allowing Ukraine to strike Russia with longer-range weapons and appears to significantly lower the threshold for the possible use of Russia\u2019s nuclear arsenal.",
      "That doctrine also places Belarus under the Russian nuclear umbrella. Russia, which says it has deployed battlefield nuclear weapons to Belarus, plans to station Oreshnik missiles there as well later this year.",

While Moscow denied targeting Poland and officials in Belarus alleged that the drones veered off course after being jammed by Ukraine, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said it was a \u201cprovocation\u201d that \u201cbrings us all closer to open conflict, closer than ever since World War II.\u201d",

He also noted that in addition to Poland, \u201cdrones violate our airspace in Romania, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.\u201d",
      "When Russia first used the Oreshnik against Ukraine in November 2024, Putin warned the West it could use it next against allies of Kyiv that allowed it to strike inside Russia with their longer-range missiles.",
      "Putin has bragged that Oreshnik\u2019s multiple warheads plunge at speeds of up to Mach 10 and can't be intercepted, and that several of them used in a conventional strike could be as devastating as a nuclear attack. Russian state media boasted that it would take the missile only 11 minutes to reach an air base in Poland and 17 minutes to reach NATO headquarters in Brussels. There's no way to know whether it's carrying a nuclear or a conventional warhead before it hits the target.",
      "Russia has begun Oreshnik production, Putin said last month, reaffirming plans to deploy it to Belarus later this year.",

      "Deploying tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus would allow Russian aircraft and missiles to reach potential targets in Ukraine more easily and quickly if Moscow decides to use them. It also extends Russia\u2019s capability to target several NATO allies in eastern and central Europe.",

      "Authorities say that social media platforms should not require age verification for all users when a ban on children under 16 having accounts goes into effect in December in Australia",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australian authorities said Tuesday that social media platforms should not demand age verification for all account holders starting from December, when a ban on children under 16 having accounts goes into effect in the country.",
      "The government released guidelines on how platforms such as TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram should apply the world's first ban on children using social media from Dec. 10. It says verifying the ages of all account holders would be unreasonable.",
      "\u201cWe think it would be unreasonable if platforms reverified everyone\u2019s age,\u201d said Australia\u2019s eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant, who drafted the guidelines. Her use of the word \u201creverified\" suggested the platforms usually already had sufficient data to verify a user was older than 16.",
      "She said the platforms have \u201ctargeting technology\u201d to focus on those under 16.",
      "\"They can target us with deadly precision when it comes to advertising. Certainly they can do this around the age of a child,\u201d she added.",
      "Australia\u2019s Parliament enacted the ban last year, giving the platforms a year to work out its implementation. The platforms face fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent children younger than 16 from holding accounts.",
      "Critics of the legislation fear that banning young children from social media will impact the privacy of all users who must establish they are older than 16.",
      "Inman Grant said claims the ban would see every Australian account holder subjected to age verification as a \u201cscare tactic.\u201d",
      "Communications Minister Anika Wells said the government seeks to keep platform users\u2019 data as private as possible.",

      "Wells and Inman Grant will travel to the United States next week to discuss the guidelines with the platforms\u2019 owners.",
      "Inman Grant said the platforms would need to demonstrate to her agency that they were taking \u201creasonable steps\u201d to exclude children younger than 16.",

      "The company run by billionaire Elon Musk has installed manual door releases inside the vehicles but NHTSA noted that a child may not be able to reach or know how to operate the releases. In four cases, the parents had to break the windows to get inside.",
      "The investigation into Tesla's most popular model comes after numerous reported incidents in recent years of other problems with opening Tesla doors, sometime trapping drivers in a burning vehicle after accidents and a loss of power.",
      "In April, a college basketball recruit said he was \u201cfighting time\u201d trying to get out of his Tesla Cybertruck that had caught fire after he had crashed into a tree and was unable to get the doors open. The University of Southern California player, Alijah Arenas, who was induced into a temporary coma after the accident, said he stayed alive by dousing himself with a water bottle as smoke filled the vehicle.",
      "NHTSA said the investigation is only focusing on the operability of the electronic door locks from outside of the vehicle, not inside, as that\u2019s the only instance in which there is no manual way to open the door. But it also said it will continue to monitor reports of people stuck on the inside \u2014 what it calls \u201centrapment\u201d \u2014 and will take further action as needed.",

      "The turmoil arrives amid PCH's ongoing bankruptcy process. The sweepstakes and marketing company filed for Chapter 11 in April, citing growing financial strain that spanned from rising operational costs and changes in consumer behavior.",
      "In July, gaming platform ARB Interactive purchased certain assets from PCH for $7.1 million and established \u201cPCH Digital,\u201d a new platform that hosts sweepstakes opportunities. But under the terms of that deal, ARB says it's not responsible to pay out prizes issued by PCH prior to July 15 \u2014 meaning that the company will not pay people who won sweepstakes before that date, with an exception of two unawarded \u201cSuperPrizes\u201d still being promoted.",

      "PCH\u2019s roots date back to 1953 \u2014 when Harold and LuEsther Mertz and their daughter, Joyce Mertz-Gilmore, formed a business out of their Long Island, New York home to send direct-to-consumer mailings that solicited subscribers for a number of magazines through one single offering.",
      "The company later grew with chances for consumers to win money \u2014 first launching a direct mail sweepstakes in 1967 \u2014 and expanded its offerings to a wide variety of merchandise, from collectible figurines to houseware and \u201cAs Seen on TV\u201d accessories, in the years that followed. Its in-person \u201cPrize Patrol\u201d team was formed in 1989.",
      "PCH became known for surprising prize winners with oversized checks, which was often filmed and featured in TV commercials.",
      "But its operations didn't come without financial strain, particularly in recent years. When filing for Chapter 11 in April, PCH said it was working to \u201cfinalize a shift away\u201d from its legacy direct-mail business and instead transition to a \u201cpure digital advertising\u201d model \u2014 citing rising competition, expensive operating costs and changes in consumer behavior.",
      "Over the years, PCH also faced some scrutiny from regulators who previously raised concerns about consumers mistakenly believing that making purchases from the company would improve their chances at winning its sweepstakes. As a result, PCH has racked up several costly legal settlements.",

      "The swap attracted about 150 people, and grew from there. Now, the twice-yearly event, which organizers call The Biggest Swap in the Northwest, draws between 500 and 850 participants to share clothes and accessories in a partylike atmosphere.",
      "\u201cWe have a DJ and two full bars, so there\u2019s some singing and dancing. But no one\u2019s getting drunk at 1 p.m. on a Sunday afternoon,\u201d said Ridgway\u2019s co-founder, Elizabeth Mollo.",
      "The swap is part of a larger movement across the country to share resources with neighbors \u2014 one shirt, meal or book at time.",
      "The Portland event asks for a $10 entry fee to cover costs, but the clothes are free and there\u2019s no limit to how much participants can take. People bring their gently used clothing, shoes and accessories to a sorting station, where volunteers sort it into bins and onto tables.",
      "Ridgway, who worked in the apparel industry, sees the process as an answer to throwaway \u201cfast fashion.\u201d She describes \u201cthe \u2018peak pile\u2019 moment, when our sorters are summiting a mountain, a literal tonnage of apparel, sorting as quickly as they can. In this moment, we see the true ramifications of consumer culture and waste.\u201d",
      "Leftover clothing is donated to another free neighborhood swapping event.",
      "Ridgway recalls a single mom telling her she was able to outfit her teenager with Nike shoes and other major brands typically outside her price range. \u201cThese conversations, and so many others, have truly kept me coming back to this event,\u201d she says.",
      "There are no dressing rooms, so participants are encouraged to come in tight-fitting clothes and try things on where they are.",
      "\u201cIt does get a little chaotic,\u201d Mollo says, but many people return year after year.",
      "\u201cWhere else can you get a whole new wardrobe for $10?\u201d",
      "As prices climb for many food items, community resource-sharing becomes increasingly important, says Taylor Scott in Richmond, Virginia.",
      "Scott was a recent college graduate when the pandemic put her dream of becoming an FBI agent on hold. She took up gardening, and quickly found herself with more tomatoes than she could consume. A friend suggested she put the extras into a community refrigerator, like ones they knew of in places like New York City. But Scott found there was nothing of the sort in Richmond.",
      "\u201cI decided that was what I was going to do for my birthday,\u201d she says.",
      "Scott hopped on Instagram to see if her friends wanted to help, and quickly received an offer of a fridge and a promise to paint it. Several months and planning calls later, she opened her first community fridge outside a cafe, in January 2021.",
      "It was a hit.",

      "It's Mangione\u2019s first court appearance in the state case since February. The 27-year-old Ivy League graduate has attracted a cult following as a stand-in for frustrations with the health insurance industry. Dozens of his supporters showed up to his last hearing, many wearing the Luigi video game character\u2019s green color as a symbol of solidarity. His April arraignment in the federal case drew a similar outpouring.",
      "If Judge Gregory Carro permits the state case to go forward, Mangione\u2019s lawyers have said they want him to dismiss terrorism charges and bar prosecutors from using evidence collected during Mangione\u2019s arrest last December, including a 9 mm handgun and a notebook in which authorities say he described his intent to \u201cwack\u201d an insurance executive.",

      "Mangione has pleaded not guilty to multiple counts of murder, including murder as an act of terrorism, in the Dec. 4, 2024, killing. Surveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting Thompson from behind as he arrived for an investor conference at the New York Hilton Midtown. Police say \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose\u201d were scrawled on the ammunition, mimicking a phrase commonly used to describe how insurers avoid paying claims.",

Since then, he has been held at the same Brooklyn federal jail where Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs is locked up.",

They highlighted his desire to kill an insurance honcho and his praise for Ted Kaczynski, the late terrorist known as the Unabomber.",
      "In the writings, prosecutors said, Mangione mused about rebelling against \u201cthe deadly, greed fueled health insurance cartel\u201d and said killing an industry executive \u201cconveys a greedy bastard that had it coming.\" They also cited a confession they say he penned \u201cTo the feds,\u201d in which he wrote that \u201cit had to be done.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A judge has shut down prosecutors' attempt to use a 9/11-era New York terrorism law in their case against Luigi Mangione",
      "NEW YORK -- New York prosecutors tried to use a 9/11-era terrorism law in their case against Luigi Mangione. But a judge ruled Tuesday that the state anti-terror statute doesn't apply to the killing of UnitedHealthcare's chief executive on a midtown Manhattan street last year.",
      "The judge let murder and other charges stand against Mangione, who also faces a federal murder case in CEO Brian Thompson's death.",
      "What Mangione no longer faces are New York state charges of murder as an act of terrorism.",
      "If it sounded like an unusual application of a terrorism law, it wasn't a first. Such charges have been brought \u2014 and sometimes rejected \u2014 in other cases that weren't about cross-border extremism or a plot to kill masses of people.",
      "Here are some things to know about New York's anti-terrorism law.",
      "State lawmakers passed it in 2001, six days after the Sept. 11 attacks, saying the state needed \u201clegislation that is specifically designed to combat the evils of terrorism.\u201d Proponents pointed out that many cases could come via state and local law enforcement officers, not just from federal investigations.",
      "Many other states passed similar laws around the same time, and Congress approved the Patriot Act.",
      "Essentially an add-on to existing criminal statutes, it says that an underlying offense constitutes terrorism if it's done with an intent to \u201cintimidate or coerce a civilian population,\u201d to \u201cinfluence the policy of a unit of government by intimidation or coercion\u201d or to \"affect the conduct of a unit of government by murder, assassination or kidnapping.\u201d",
      "If a defendant is convicted, the terrorism designation boosts the underlying offense into a more serious sentencing category. For example, an assault normally punishable by up to 25 years in prison would carry a potential life sentence.",
      "In Mangione\u2019s case, one of the terror-murder charges carried a mandatory life sentence. The remaining murder charge against him is punishable by 15 years to life in prison if he's convicted.",
      "New York does not have the death penalty. The state's highest court threw out a capital punishment law in 2004.",
      "Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, put it simply last year: \u201cThe intent was to sow terror.\u201d",
      "The shooting happened early on a workday in a busy area where UnitedHealthcare was holding an investor conference, prosecutors noted. They also have said Mangione's writings show that he aimed \u201cto intimidate and coerce UHC workers and other workers in the health insurance industry.\"",
      "In a handwritten diary, the 26-year-old described himself as a \u201crevolutionary anarchist\u201d and mused about rebelling against \u201cthe deadly, greed fueled health insurance cartel,\u201d prosecutors wrote in a court filing. They said Mangione researched UnitedHealthcare \u2014 having apparently never been a customer himself \u2014 and laid out a plan to \u201cwack\" the CEO during the \u201cparasitic\" investor gathering, asserting that such a killing would be \u201ctargeted, precise and doesn\u2019t risk innocents.\u201d",

      "Thompson's death unleashed public complaints about the U.S. health insurance industry. Concerned companies canceled some in-person investor meetings and told employees to work from home temporarily. According to prosecutors, some doctors distanced themselves from UnitedHealthcare, company call-takers got death threats, and employees wouldn't sign denial letters.",
      "Mangione's attorneys argued that there were \u201cabsolutely no facts to support this theory\u201d that Thompson's killing fit within the state terror law.",
      "Thompson wasn't a government official, and UnitedHealthcare's dispersed workforce doesn't qualify as a \u201ccivilian population,\u201d the defense lawyers wrote in a court filing.",
      "In their view, his alleged diary writings \u201cmake clear that Mr. Mangione was not looking to terrorize any community.\u201d His lawyers noted that the purported diary discounts the idea of bombing an insurer's corporate headquarters, with entries saying \u201cbombs=terrorism\u201d and involve \u201crecklessly endangering countless employees.\u201d",
      "Manhattan Judge Gregory Carro said there is \u201cno doubt that the crime at issue here is not ordinary \u2018street crime,\u2019\" but that doesn't make it terrorism. Prosecutors \u201cappear to conflate an ideological belief with the intent to intimidate or coerce a civilian population,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Prosecutors didn't establish that intent, nor an aim to influence policy, Carro concluded. He dismissed the terror charges but allowed the others to continue toward trial.",
      "There\u2019s no comprehensive statewide count, but there have been over a half-dozen cases in New York City alone. They include plots to bomb synagogues or open fire on their congregants; a plan to build pipe bombs to try to undermine public support for the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan; efforts to recruit support for the Islamic State group and to provide money and knives to Syrian extremists; and a white supremacist who killed a Black man because of racial hatred.",
      "One of Mangione's lawyers, Karen Friedman Agnifilo, was a top deputy to former Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance Jr. when some of those cases were prosecuted.",
      "New York's top court rejected the very first use of the law, in a 2004 Bronx case surrounding a deadly shooting at a christening party. Prosecutors said the defendant, a gang member, was targeting a rival but killed a 10-year-old girl and paralyzed another man.",
      "In overturning the defendant's conviction, justices expressed skepticism that the shooting was meant to intimidate the broader community. They also worried that the meaning of terrorism could be trivialized if \u201capplied loosely.\u201d",
      "The man, who denied involvement in the shooting, was retried on manslaughter and other charges. He was convicted and sentenced to 50 years in prison.",

      "Democratic leaders are lashing out at a stop-gap spending bill to avoid a partial government shutdown at the end of the month",
      "WASHINGTON -- Democratic leaders lashed out Tuesday at a short-term spending bill to avoid a partial government shutdown at the end of the month, warning Republicans they will not support a measure that doesn't address their concerns on the soaring cost of health insurance coverage for millions of Americans.",
      "House Republicans unveiled the spending bill Tuesday. It would keep federal agencies funded through Nov. 21, buying lawmakers more time to work out their differences on spending levels and policy for the coming fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. Republicans said that they were providing exactly what Democrats have insisted upon in past government shutdown battles \u2014 a clean funding bill free of partisan policy riders.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019ll be a clean, short-term continuing resolution, end of story,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters. \u201cAnd it\u2019s interesting to me that some of the same Democrats who decried government shutdowns under President Biden appear to have no heartache whatsoever at walking our nation off that cliff right now. I hope they don\u2019t.\u201d",
      "The bill would generally fund agencies at current levels, with a few limited exceptions, including an extra $88 million to boost security for lawmakers and members of the Supreme Court and the executive branch. The proposed boost comes as lawmakers face an increasing number of personal threats, with their concerns heightened by last week's assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.",

That was the situation during the nation\u2019s longest shutdown in the winter of 2018-19, when President Donald Trump insisted on money to build the U.S.-Mexico border wall. A 16-day shutdown in 2013 occurred as Republicans demanded significant changes to then-President Barack Obama's health care overhaul in exchange for funding the government and permitting Treasury the borrowing latitude to pay the nation\u2019s bills.",
      "This time, however, Democrats are facing intense pressure from their base of supporters to stand up to Trump. They have particularly focused on the potential for skyrocketing health care premiums for millions of Americans if Congress fails to extend enhanced subsidies, which many people use to buy insurance on the Affordable Care Act exchange. Those subsidies were put in place during the COVID crisis, but are set to expire.",
      "Some people have already received notices that their premiums \u2014 the monthly fee paid for insurance coverage \u2014 are poised to spike next year. Insurers have sent out notices in nearly every state, with some proposing premium increases of as much as 50%. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the number of people without insurance would rise by 2.2 million in 2026, and by 3.7 million the following year, if Congress does not extend the enhanced tax credits.",
      "Johnson called the debate over health insurance tax credits a December policy issue, not something that needs to be solved in September. And Thune said that almost every Democratic lawmaker voted for the short-term continuing resolutions when Joe Biden was president and Schumer was majority leader.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re all asking the question, are we or are we not going to have a Schumer shutdown?\" Thune asked reporters Tuesday. \u201cAnd it sounds like, from what he is indicating, that very well may happen.\u201d",

      "Chief Executive John Lee is under pressure to distinguish Hong Kong from regional rivals and mainland Chinese metropolises after a yearslong crackdown on democracy activism and Beijing's tightening grip tainted the city's image as a free-wheeling financial center.",
      "\u201cWe are now undergoing an economic transition. It is irreversible progress. Transformation is an inevitable process for a stronger economy,\" he said.",
      "In his annual policy address, Lee said he will lead a committee on developing the Northern Metropolis, an ongoing project that envisions building a new IT hub and a university town near the Chinese tech hub of Shenzhen. It aims to provide 650,000 jobs and house 2.5 million people. The development proposal was first floated in 2021 by his predecessor Carrie Lam.",
      "The government would devise a range of financing schemes and introduce legislation to empower the government to simplify procedures for issues such as setting up industrial park companies and speeding up building plan approvals, Lee said.",
      "The city\u2019s gross domestic product is estimated to have grown 3.1% in the second quarter of 2025, supported by strong exports and improved domestic demand. For the first half of this year, Hong Kong ranked first globally in funds raised through initial public offerings as a wave of Chinese companies sought to list in Hong Kong under U.S.-China tensions.",
      "But vacant shops remain in various areas. Retail sales between January and July this year saw a drop. Restaurants have closed. The slump stemmed from tourists spending less and many residents opting to spend weekends on mainland China for cheaper and more diverse offerings. The city\u2019s latest unemployment rate was 3.7%.",
      "A highlight of Lee's policies was bolstering emerging industries in a city where traditional strengths lie in the financial and legal service sectors.",
      "Developing the artificial intelligence and data science industry was a focus. The government plans to put up for tender a 10-hectare (24.7-acre) site this year for building a data facility cluster and launching an AI research and development institute next year.",

      "Separately, the University Grants Committee would earmark 40 million Hong Kong dollars (about $5 million) to support eight publicly funded universities in enhancing their publicity and recruitment of teachers and students outside Hong Kong.",
      "Lee, a former security chief, fulfilled Beijing\u2019s long-standing imperative to enact a homegrown national security law last year. Officials said the law and a China-imposed security law were necessary for the city's stability following massive anti-government protests in 2019.",
      "To step up patriotic education, he said the city would work with Shenzhen to promote a \u201cnew red educational route\u201d to help Hong Kongers and tourists better understand the city's history in World War II. Earlier this month, Beijing held a military parade to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II.",
      "In an effort to integrate with national development, Hong Kong officials will set up a task force to drive mainland companies to use the city in their overseas expansion.

      "S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, France\u2019s fourth prime minister in a year, faces big challenges like a ballooning deficit and unrest",
      "PARIS -- A ballooning deficit. A fractious Parliament. Unrest on the streets. The challenges facing S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, France\u2019s fourth prime minister in a year, are daunting and defeated his immediate predecessors.",
      "So he\u2019s trying a different tack. To ease tensions, Lecornu has scrapped proposals to axe two public holidays and trimmed lifetime benefits for former government ministers. A loyal ally to unpopular centrist President Emmanuel Macron, he began meeting with opposition leaders and trade unions this week.",
      "But pitfalls lie ahead. Opponents aim to turn up the heat yet further on Thursday with nationwide strikes and protests against budget cuts and other complaints targeting Lecornu\u2019s fragile minority government.",
      "French politics have been in turmoil since Macron called early parliamentary elections in June last year which resulted in a deeply fragmented legislature.",
      "One major challenge looms: addressing France\u2019s budget crisis, a deeply divisive issue in Parliament.",
      "Lecornu\u2019s first big move has been to dismiss the idea of cutting two public holidays, championed by his immediate predecessor, whose government fell earlier this month. Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou had stirred public anger with his plan to scrap the Easter Monday and Victory Day (May 8) holidays, a move he said was needed to boost the economy.",
      "Lecornu vowed to find \u201cto find other sources of financing\u201d instead.",
      "He also announced this week that lifetime benefits for former government members will be eliminated, starting from Jan. 1st.",
      "For former prime ministers, the benefits include police protection, along with a car and driver paid for by the state. Protection will be capped at three years and only extended for security reasons, while the car will be reduced to a period of 10 years. This is estimated to save about 4.4 million euros ($5.21 million) per year.",
      "Trade unions have called for nationwide strikes and protests on Thursday, scheduled before the change of prime minister, to push back on what they see as austerity policies.",
      "Unions reject cuts in social spending, arguing French workers have been deeply affected by rising prices in recent years. They also continue to protest against Macron\u2019s pension reform that raised the minimum retirement age from 62 to 64.",
      "Thursday\u2019s strikes are expected to prompt disruption in sectors like transport, public services, hospitals and schools. They may sound a stark warning for Lecornu.",
      "Last week, thousands of protesters rallied across France last week for a day of nationwide action against Macron\u2019s policies under the slogan \u201cBlock Everything.\u201d",
      "Mathieu Gallard, account director at Ipsos France polling institute, says a series of opinion polls show French voters\u2019 main concerns focus on their declining purchasing power and the deterioration of once-generous social benefits, including health care, pensions and public services.",
      "\u201cThe political situation gives the French the feeling leaders are not able to remedy the situation due to that instability,\u201d Gallard told The Associated Press.",
      "On the day he took office, Lecornu, 39, vowed to be both \u201cmore creative\u201d and \u201cmore serious\u201d in the way his government will work with opposition parties.",

The company in August announced that Michael Fiddelke, a 20-year Target veteran and chief operating officer, will succeed CEO Brian Cornell on Feb. 1",
      "In 2017, Target began transforming its physical stores as shipping hubs but, with the spike in online shopping since the pandemic, the in-person experience suffered as Targeted diverted store workers to fulfilling orders placed online, company officials acknowledged. But McCarthy noted Monday that stores should play different roles based on their sizes and locations.",
      "Target said in August that it was testing a new shipping strategy in the Chicago market, where it operates nearly 80 stores, two fulfillment centers and two sortation centers. Within Chicago, it's concentrated a higher percentage of local shipping demand into six stores, increased the volume processed by fulfillment stores and moved shipping out of 18 stores. McCarthy said it's been able to increase its same-day delivery while lowering the delivery cost per item than before the test.",
      "Target is now launching elements of that strategy in 30 to 40 more markets, some of them will offer next day deliveries, McCarthy said.",

      "Cadillac F1 has announced a multi-year partnership with Jim Beam, making the bourbon distiller its official spirits partner",
      "The new Cadillac F1 team on Wednesday announced a multi-year partnership with Jim Beam that makes the American bourbon distiller its official spirits partner.",
      "\u201cThis partnership brings together two icons of American heritage to create something truly special,\u201d said Dan Towriss, CEO of TWG Motorsports, the ownership group of Cadillac F1. \u201cFormula 1 is a global stage, and we want to take our fans on this journey with us every step of the way.",
      "\"Our vision goes beyond racing \u2013 we\u2019re building a team that lives where sport, technology, and culture collide. With Jim Beam joining our family of partners, the momentum behind this project grows stronger every day as we gear up for our debut next year.\u201d",
      "The deal follows a June announcement in which Tommy Hilfiger, an American fashion brand, was named the official apparel partner for the team that will debut on the Formula 1 grid in 2026.",
      "The partnerships showcase Cadillac's desire to be a true American team competing in a global series that consists primarily of European-based teams. Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Perez have been named the debut drivers, but California native Colton Herta is leaving IndyCar to become Cadillac's test driver in an attempt to earn the super license he needs to compete in F1.",
      "The Jim Beam deal continues a relationship with Cadillac that dates back more than a century. Fred Noe, Jim Beam\u2019s seventh-generation master distiller, still drives a Cadillac as a tribute to the car that helped safeguard his family\u2019s legacy.",

Jim Beam also has sponsorship agreements with the United States Soccer Federation, the Indianapolis 500, NASCAR and Dick Johnson Racing of Australian Supercars.",
      "Jim Beam will use the partnership for branding on and off the car during the entire F1 season over the multi-year agreement.",
      "\u201cBoth car racing and making Jim Beam bourbon require every individual and moving part to come together to create a positive collective outcome,\u201d said Rashidi Hodari, managing director, James B. Beam Distilling Co. \u201cThis is very in line with how we bring Jim Beam to the world. The pit crew and our distillery workers both know that it\u2019s the power of their communities that allows for the win. It\u2019s this common understanding of the importance of connection with the next generation of Formula 1 fans that inspires us.\u201d",

      "The victory made Thomson the third manager in franchise history to win consecutive division titles, joining Charlie Manuel (2007-11) and Danny Ozark (1976-78). Thomson is the fourth manager in Major League Baseball history to reach the postseason in each of his first four full seasons. Among the other three is Dodgers skipper Dave Roberts.",

      "The Cubs winnowed their magic number to one by chasing Skenes (10-10) during a rare rocky outing for the NL Cy Young Award favorite. Busch led off with his 29th homer of the season, a shot to the final row of seats above the Clemente Wall in right field, and finished with three hits as Chicago won for the sixth time in seven games.",

Yet the 23-year-old's final start at PNC Park this season was a rare misstep at a place where he has dominated.",
      "The towering right-hander gave up three runs on seven hits with three walks and six strikeouts and was pulled after 3 2/3 innings, the shortest start of his career outside of a brief two-inning stint at Yankee Stadium last fall in an appearance that was mostly ceremonial at the end of his breakout rookie season.",

      "That's some company for a single night.",
      "The Mariners catcher hit his 55th homer of the season in the second inning against the Kansas City Royals, sending him past Mantle's mark for a switch-hitter that had stood since 1961. Then, Raleigh hit his 56th the very next inning, matching the club record that Griffey first established in 1997 and matched himself the following year.",
      "\u201cIt just doesn't even seem real,\u201d said Seattle designated hitter Dominic Canzone, who on almost any other night would have been the star. He went 5 for 5 with three homers in the 12-5 win \u2014 the 10th straight for the Mariners.",
      "\u201cI mean, he just does it every single day,\u201d Canzone continued, \u201cand he's doing it behind the plate as well. So just to have that type of a performance out of your catcher, it's something that you really don't see. It's like, a once-in-a-lifetime type of player.\u201d",
      "Making the two-homer night even more impressive? Raleigh took a pitch from Mariners starter Logan Gilbert that bounced off the plate and off his neck, where it had missed under his catcher's mask. A red welt was visible after the game.",
      "Good thing for Seattle that he never thought about taking the rest of the night off.",
      "\u201cYeah, I mean, it didn't feel good,\u201d said Raleigh, who also had a double and finished 3 for 5 at the plate. \"You know, kind of let my head up a little bit. Have to tuck it in a little better. It was all good. Just stung a bit.",

      "Now, the next big name on the list is Yankees slugger Aaron Judge, who had the last of the nine 60-homer seasons in the majors when he hit 62 in 2022. That also stands as the American League record.",

You know, his desire is to win, and that's what he wants to do here in Seattle is win. And that's where his drive comes from. And that's the way he has approached this whole thing. And I think, you know, Cal just continues to check off these milestones, and he does it with such a humble heart. He has handled it all so incredibly well.\"",

Investigators are probing the time the man accused of killing Kirk, Tyler Robinson, spent in the \u201cdark corners of the internet\u201d \u2014 anti-social media, if you will \u2014 leading up to when he allegedly pulled the trigger.",

      "Chilling videos of Kirk's Sept. 10 assassination immediately overwhelmed sites like X, TikTok and YouTube, and companies are still working to contain their spread. Confrontational material and conspiracy theories are pushed into social media feeds because they do precisely what they're designed to do \u2014 keep people on the platforms for longer periods of time.",
      "\u201cI do think we\u2019re in a moment here,\u201d said Laura Edelson, a Northeastern University professor and expert on social media algorithms. \u201cOur country is being digitally mediated. Where we interact with other people, how we interact with broader society, that is more and more happening over feed algorithms. This is the most recent in a long line of ways that society has been changed by media technology.\u201d",
      "Divisive content and the proliferation of the video of Kirk's death may not have been the goal but are the direct result of decisions made to maximize profits and cut back on content moderation, Edelson said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump formally extended the deadline to keep the social media app TikTok available in the United States until Dec. 16, giving time to complete the framework of the deal announced Monday after talks between American and Chinese government officials.",
      "The executive order signed on Tuesday by Trump was the fourth time he has bypassed federal law to prolong the deadline for the China-associated TikTok to sell its assets to an American company or face a ban. The original deadline set by Congress was Jan. 19 of this year, a day before Trump took the oath of office for his second term.",
      "Trump was asked Tuesday about the framework deal he announced a day earlier and repeated that he would discuss TikTok with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday. He has said there are companies that want to buy the social media app owned by ByteDance and that details about its potential suitors would be announced soon.",
      "\u201cI hate to see value like that thrown out the window,\u201d Trump said as he departed the White House, with his wife, first lady Melania Trump, for a state visit to the United Kingdom.",
      "The framework came out of a meeting in Madrid that concluded Monday between U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, among other officials.",
      "Bessent told reporters that the goal was to switch TikTok's assets to U.S. ownership for its operations in America, though he declined to discuss the details of the framework.",

      "Authorities say that social media platforms should not require age verification for all users when a ban on children under 16 having accounts goes into effect in December in Australia",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australian authorities said Tuesday that social media platforms should not demand age verification for all account holders starting from December, when a ban on children under 16 having accounts goes into effect in the country.",
      "The government released guidelines on how platforms such as TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram should apply the world's first ban on children using social media from Dec. 10. It says verifying the ages of all account holders would be unreasonable.",
      "\u201cWe think it would be unreasonable if platforms reverified everyone\u2019s age,\u201d said Australia\u2019s eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant, who drafted the guidelines. Her use of the word \u201creverified\" suggested the platforms usually already had sufficient data to verify a user was older than 16.",
      "She said the platforms have \u201ctargeting technology\u201d to focus on those under 16.",
      "\"They can target us with deadly precision when it comes to advertising. Certainly they can do this around the age of a child,\u201d she added.",

      "Critics of the legislation fear that banning young children from social media will impact the privacy of all users who must establish they are older than 16.",
      "Inman Grant said claims the ban would see every Australian account holder subjected to age verification as a \u201cscare tactic.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Scientists in Colombia\u2019s Amazon are capturing and testing endangered pink river dolphins to monitor mercury contamination from illegal gold mining and deforestation",
      "PUERTO NARINO, Colombia -- A flash of pink breaks the muddy surface of the Amazon River as scientists and veterinarians, waist-deep in the warm current, patiently work a mesh net around a pod of river dolphins. They draw it tighter with each pass, and a spray of silver fish glistens under the harsh sun as they leap to escape the net.",
      "When the team hauls a dolphin into a boat, it thrashes as water streams from its pink-speckled sides and the crew quickly ferries it to the sandy riverbank where adrenaline-charged researchers lift it onto a mat. They have 15 minutes \u2014 the limit for how long a dolphin can safely be out of the water \u2014 to complete their work.",
      "Fernando Trujillo, a marine biologist leading the effort, kneels beside the animal\u2019s head, shielding its eye with a small cloth so it can\u2019t see what\u2019s happening. He rests his hand gently on the animal and speaks in low tones.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve never felt the palm of a hand. We try to calm them,\u201d said Trujillo, sporting a pink dolphin bandana. \u201cTaking a dolphin out of the water, it\u2019s a kind of abduction.\u201d",
      "One person counts the dolphin's breaths. Another wets its skin with a sponge while the others conduct multiple medical tests that will help show how much mercury is coursing through the Amazon\u2019s most graceful predators.",
      "Trujillo directs the Omacha Foundation, a conservation group focused on aquatic wildlife and river ecosystems, and leads health evaluations of river dolphins. It's a painstaking operation involving experienced fishermen, veterinarians and locals that takes months of planning and happens a couple of times a year.",
      "\u201cWe take blood and tissue samples to assess mercury,\u00a8 Trujillo told The Associated Press from the Colombian riverside town of Puerto Narino. \u201cBasically, we\u2019re using dolphins as sentinels for the river\u2019s health.\u201d",
      "Mercury contamination comes mainly from illegal gold mining \u2014 a growing industry across the Amazon Basin \u2014 and forest clearing that washes mercury that naturally occurs in soil into waterways.",
      "The miners use mercury to separate gold from sediment, then dump the sludge back into rivers, where it enters fish eaten by people and dolphins. Rising global gold prices have fueled a mining boom, and mercury pollution in remote waterways has increased.",
      "Mercury can damage the brain, kidneys, lungs and immune system and cause mood swings, memory loss and muscle weakness in people, according to the World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Pregnant women and young children are most at risk, with prenatal exposure linked to developmental delays and reduced cognitive function.",
      "\u201cThe maximum any living being should have is 1 milligram per kilogram,\u201d Trujillo said. \u201cHere, we\u2019re seeing 20 to 30 times that amount.\u201d",
      "In previous years, his team found 16 to 18 milligrams per kilogram of mercury in dolphins, which can suffer the same neurological damage, organ damage and other problems as humans. In Colombia\u2019s Orinoco River, levels in some dolphins have reached as high as 42, levels scientists say are among the most extreme ever recorded in the species.",
      "Trujillo said it's difficult to prove the toxin is directly killing dolphins. Further studies are underway, he added, noting that \u201cany mammal with a huge amount of mercury will die.\u201d",
      "When Trujillo and his team tested their own blood three years ago, his results showed more than 36 times the safe limit \u2014 36.4 milligrams per kilogram \u2014 a level he attributes to decades working in mercury-affected areas and a diet heavy in fish. With medical assistance, his levels have dropped to about 7 milligrams.",
      "\u201cMercury is an invisible enemy until it builds up to a sufficient amount, then it starts to affect the central nervous system,\u201d Trujillo told AP after his team managed to capture and test four pink dolphins. \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing evidence of it in Indigenous communities.\u201d",
      "A series of scientific studies and reports \u2014 including work by the International Pollutants Elimination Network and academic researchers \u2014 have found high mercury exposure among Indigenous peoples across the Amazon, including in Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Suriname and Bolivia. Hair samples showed averages well above WHO's safe threshold of 1 part per million, with one Colombian community registering more than 22 milligrams per kilogram.",

The International Union for Conservation of Nature listed the pink dolphin as endangered in 2018. Trujillo said exact numbers for the Amazon are unknown, but his organization estimates 30,000 to 45,000 across the basin.",
      "Pink river dolphins also face threats from overfishing, accidental entanglement in nets, boat traffic, habitat loss and prolonged drought.",

It banned mercury use in mining in 2018, ratified the Minamata Convention aimed at reducing mercury in the environment and submitted an action plan in 2024. Authorities cite joint operations with Brazil and recent enforcement sweeps, but watchdogs say efforts remain uneven and illegal mining persists across much of the country.",
      "Other Amazon nations say they\u2019re stepping up. Brazil has launched raids and moved to restrict satellite internet used by illegal gold-mining camps that use mercury, aiming to disrupt logistics and supply lines. Peru recently seized a record 4 tons of smuggled mercury. Ecuador, Suriname and Guyana have filed action plans to cut mercury use in small-scale gold mining.",
      "The dolphin testing operation relies on Jos\u00e9 \u201cMariano\u201d Rangel, a charismatic former fisherman from Venezuela. He leads the charge when it\u2019s time to haul the animals \u2014 which can weigh as much as 160 kilograms (about 353 pounds) \u2014 into the small boats. It's a moment that can end with a stinging blow to the jaw as the dolphins thrash to break free.",
      "\u201cThe most difficult part of the captures is enclosing the dolphins,\u201d Rangel said.",
      "A portable ultrasound machine scans lungs, heart and other vital organs for disease. The team checks for respiratory problems, internal injuries and signs of reproduction, photograph the animals' skin and scars, swab blowholes and genital openings for bacterial cultures, and collect tissue for mercury testing. Microchips are implanted so researchers can identify each animal and avoid duplicating tests.",
      "Omacha has recorded antimicrobial resistance \u2014 bacteria that can\u2019t be killed by common medicines \u2014 and respiratory problems. They have also identified possible emerging diseases, such as papilloma virus, that could pose risks to both dolphins and humans.",
      "After a long morning hauling and testing dolphins, the scientists return to a laboratory in Puerto Narino that's covered with posters of dolphins and manatees and the bones and skulls of dolphins and other animals. They test some samples, prepare others to send to larger facilities and end their day repairing nets and refilling kits to do it all again at dawn.",
      "For Trujillo, each capture, scan and blood test is part of a larger fight.",

      "More than three years since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, drones continue to be a key weapon for both sides. Multiple Russian drones crossed into Poland on Wednesday, prompting NATO to send fighter jets to shoot them down and underlining long-held concerns that the fighting might spill over beyond Ukraine's borders.",
      "According to Ukraine\u2019s General Staff, explosions and a fire were reported at the Kirishi refinery. It posted a photo appearing to show a blaze and clouds of smoke against a night sky.",

      "As of Sunday afternoon, Russian officials offered no further comment on the consequences of the strike, and it wasn't immediately possible to verify these. At least 80 Ukrainian drones were shot down overnight over Russia, the annexed Crimean Peninsula and the adjacent Sea of Azov, according to the Russian Defense Ministry.",

      "Mummification prevents decay by preserving dead bodies. The process can happen naturally in places like the sands of Chile's Atacama Desert or the bogs of Ireland where conditions can fend off decomposition. Humans across various cultures also mummified their ancestors through embalming to honor them or send their souls to the afterlife.",

      "Researchers found human remains that were buried in crouched or squatted positions with some cuts and burn marks in various archaeological sites across China and Vietnam and to a lesser extent, from the Philippines, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.",
      "Studying the bones further, scientists discovered the bodies were likely exposed to heat. That suggested the bodies had been smoke-dried over a fire and mummified by hunter-gatherer communities in the area.",

      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a press conference after the latest round of trade talks between the world\u2019s top two economies concluded in Madrid that U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping would speak Friday to possibly finalize the deal. He said the objective of the deal would be to switch to American ownership.",
      "He did not disclose the terms of the deal, saying that it is between two private parties, but added that \"the commercial terms have been agreed upon.\u201d",
      "Little is known about the actual deal in the works, including what companies are involved and whether the United States would have a stake in TikTok. Li Chenggang, China\u2019s international trade representative, said the two sides have reached \u201cbasic framework consensus\u201d to properly solve TikTok-related issues in a cooperative way, reduce investment barriers and promote related economic and trade cooperation, according to China\u2019s official news agency Xinhua.",
      "Oracle Corp. has been floated as a likely buyer for the platform. Representatives for the company did not immediately respond to a message for comment on Monday.",
      "In Madrid, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the team was \u201cvery focused on TikTok and making sure that it was a deal that is fair for the Chinese,\u201d but also \u201ccompletely respects U.S. national security concerns.\u201d",
      "Wang Jingtao, deputy director of China\u2019s Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, told reporters in Madrid there was consensus on authorization of \u201cthe use of intellectual property rights such as (TikTok\u2019s) algorithm\u201d \u2014 a main sticking point in the deal.",
      "The sides also agreed on entrusting a partner with handling U.S. user data and content security, he said.",
      "Though he has no clear legal basis to do so, Trump has continued to extend the deadline for TikTok to avoid a ban in the U.S. This gives his administration more time to broker a deal to bring the social media platform under American ownership. The next deadline is on Sept. 17, and Trump has already signaled he would extend it if needed.",
      "It is not clear how many times Trump can keep extending the ban as the government continues to try to negotiate a deal for TikTok, which is owned by China\u2019s ByteDance. While there is no clear legal basis for the extensions, so far, there have been no legal challenges against the administration. Trump has amassed more than 15 million followers on TikTok since he joined last year, and he has credited the trendsetting platform with helping him gain traction among young voters. He said in January that he has a \u201cwarm spot for TikTok.\u201d",
      "For now, TikTok continues to function for its 170 million users in the U.S. Tech giants Apple, Google and Oracle were persuaded to continue to offer and support the app, on the promise that Trump\u2019s Justice Department would not use the law to seek potentially steep fines against them.",

      "LAGOS, Nigeria -- When residents of Equatorial Guinea's Annob\u00f3n island wrote to the government in Malabo in July last year complaining about the dynamite explosions by a Moroccan construction company, they didn't expect the swift end to their internet access.",

      "The Moroccan company Somagec, which activists allege is linked to the president, confirmed the outage but denied having a hand in it. The AP could not confirm a link.",
      "\u201cThe current situation is extremely serious and worrying,\u201d one of the signatories who spent 11 months in prison said, speaking anonymously for fear of being targeted by the government.",
      "In addition to the internet shutdown, \"phone calls are heavily monitored, and speaking freely can pose a risk,\u201d said Macus Menejolea Taxijad, a resident who recently began living in exile.",
      "It is only the latest of repressive measures that the country has deployed to crush criticisms, including mass surveillance, according to a 2024 Amnesty International report.",
      "Equatorial Guinea, a former Spanish colony, is run by Africa\u2019s longest-serving president, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, who, at 83, has served as president for more than half his life. His son serves as the vice president and is accused of spending state funds on a lavish lifestyle. He was convicted of money laundering and embezzlement in France and sanctioned by the U.K.",
      "On Friday, the U.N.'s top court declined Equatorial Guinea's request for France to return a Paris-based mansion confiscated as part of a corruption probe, ruling that the African nation has not shown it has a \u201cplausible right to the return of the building.\u201d",
      "Despite the country\u2019s oil and gas wealth, at least 57% of its nearly 2 million people live in poverty, according to the World Bank. Officials, their families and their inner circle, meanwhile, live a life of luxury.",

With a population of around 5,000 people, the island has been seeking independence from the country for years as it accuses the government of disregarding its residents.",
      "The internet shutdown is the latest in a long history of Malabo\u2019s repressive responses to the island\u2019s political and economic demands, activists say, citing regular arrests and the absence of adequate social amenities like schools and hospitals.",

      "A Democratic candidate for governor of California will be giving TikTok a go",
      "A Democratic candidate for governor of California will be giving TikTok a go, but with a caveat: He'll only post videos in Spanish.",
      "At least for now.",
      "Former Biden administration Health Secretary Xavier Becerra is embracing the popular short-video app to target Spanish-language users. His campaign and surveys note that Hispanic adults use TikTok in much higher numbers than Black and white adults.",
      "Congress last year passed a ban on TikTok, but President Joe Biden, who signed the bill into law and was Becerra's boss at the time, announced before leaving office that he wouldn't enforce it. After the Supreme Court ruled the ban constitutional, President Donald Trump suspended it on his first day in office to give the China-based company ByteDance time to find a new buyer.",
      "Trump, a Republican, had tried to ban dealings with ByteDance during his first term, but he joined the platform last year and has millions of followers. He has repeatedly extended the deadline for ByteDance to find a buyer and hinted occasionally that there was a deal in place, but without offering details. The White House started its own TikTok account last month.",
      "Becerra's new approach is part of an effort by Democrats to counter the rightward swing that was seen last year both in red states such as Texas and Florida and blue states such as California, New Jersey and New York, where Trump improved his numbers among Latinos.",
      "The idea is to lock in a key user base by pushing out content early on a platform politicians are still largely experimenting with. The effort comes when the Trump administration is phasing out multilingual services as part of the president's push to make English the official language of the United States.",
      "Candidates running in the 2025 elections in New Jersey and Virginia are already adapting their campaigns to appeal to Hispanics, who may have stayed away from the polls or voted for Trump based on his economic promises. But strategists say that it\u2019s still very much up for debate whether the trend will hold.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s critical to communicate in the language and on the platforms where voters spend their time and get their information,\u201d Becerra said in a statement.",
      "A 2024 Pew Research Center survey concluded that while TikTok has seen significant user growth in a short time, the demographics were different depending on race and ethnicity. Nearly half of Hispanic adults reported using it compared with 39% of Black adults and 28% of white adults.",
      "Becerra\u2019s campaign says it will push out a mix of videos with him speaking directly to the camera, policy explainers and behind-the-scenes clips from the campaign trail. It also plans to collaborate with influencers and publish videos created by supporters. All in Spanish.",

      "In the New Jersey governor's race this year, both Democratic candidate Mikie Sherrill and Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli are participating in Spanish-language town halls on Univision, where Hispanic voters will ask the candidates questions. In Virginia, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger speaks Spanish in a radio ad about being a mother of three girls who attended public school.",
      "\u201cI know how difficult things are for families these days,\u201d she says in Spanish.",

      "In his introduction video, Becerra says his priority is to make housing more affordable and reduce health care costs.",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- A New Zealand court has rejected the latest bid by internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom to halt his deportation to the United States on charges related to his file-sharing website Megaupload.",
      "Dotcom had asked the High Court to review the legality of an official\u2019s August 2024 decision that he should be surrendered to the U.S. to face trial on charges of copyright infringement, money laundering and racketeering. It was the latest chapter in a protracted 13-year battle by the U.S. government to extradite the Finnish-German millionaire from New Zealand.",
      "The Megaupload founder had applied for what in New Zealand is called a judicial review, in which a judge is asked to evaluate whether an official's decision was lawful.",
      "A judge on Wednesday dismissed Dotcom's arguments that the decision to deport him was politically motivated and that he would face grossly disproportionate treatment in the U.S. In a written ruling, Justice Christine Grice also rejected Dotcom's claim that New Zealand's police were wrong to charge his business partners, but not him, under domestic laws \u2014 which likely yielded laxer sentences than if the men had been tried in the U.S.",
      "The latest decision could be challenged in the Court of Appeal, where a deadline for filing is Oct. 8. It wasn't immediately clear if Dotcom would do so.",
      "One of his lawyers, Ron Mansfield, told Radio New Zealand that Dotcom's team had \"much fight left in us as we seek to secure a fair outcome,\u201d but didn't elaborate further. Neither Dotcom nor Mansfield responded to a request for comment from The Associated Press on Thursday.",
      "New Zealand\u2019s government hasn\u2019t disclosed what will happen next in the extradition process or divulged an expected timeline for Dotcom to be surrendered to the United States.",
      "The saga stretches back to the January 2012 arrest by New Zealand authorities of Dotcom in a dramatic raid on his Auckland mansion along with other company officers at the request of the FBI. U.S. prosecutors said Megaupload raked in at least $175 million, mainly from people who used the site to illegally download songs, television shows and movies, before the FBI shut it down earlier that year.",
      "Lawyers for Dotcom and the others arrested argued that it was the users of the site, founded in 2005, who chose to pirate material, not its founders. But prosecutors said the men were the architects of a vast criminal enterprise, with the Department of Justice describing it as the largest criminal copyright case in U.S. history.",
      "He has been free on bail in New Zealand since February 2012.",
      "Dotcom and his business partners fought the FBI's efforts to extradite them for years, including by challenging New Zealand law enforcement's actions during the investigation and arrests. In 2021, however, New Zealand\u2019s Supreme Court ruled that Dotcom and two other men could be surrendered.",

      "But by then, Dotcom was the only person whose fate remained in question. Two of his former business partners, Mathias Ortmann and Bram van der Kolk, pleaded guilty to charges against them in a New Zealand court in June 2023 and were sentenced to two and a half years in jail.",
      "In exchange, U.S. efforts to extradite them were dropped. Part of Dotcom's latest legal bid challenged the police decision not to extend a plea deal under New Zealand laws to him too.",
      "Grice rejected that, saying the choice to only charge Ortmann and van der Kolk in New Zealand was \u201ca proper exercise of the Police's discretion.\u201d The jurist also dismissed Dotcom's claim that Goldsmith's extradition decision was politically motivated.",
      "Prosecutors earlier abandoned their extradition bid against a fourth Megaupload officer, Finn Batato, who was arrested in New Zealand. Batato returned to Germany, where he died from cancer in 2022.",
      "In November 2024, Dotcom said in a post on X that he had suffered a stroke. He wrote on X in July that he was making \u201cgood progress\u201d in his recovery but still suffered from speech and memory impairments.",

      "Many on social media have reminisced about seeing the giant Pacific octopus named Ghost when they had visited the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach. Some shared that they had a tattoo of Ghost or would wear a sweater emblazoned with the beloved cephalopod in her memory.",
      "\u201cShe is a wonderful octopus and has made an eight-armed impression on all of our hearts,\u201d the aquarium said on Instagram.",
      "Ghost laid eggs earlier this week and entered the last phase of her life cycle, known as senescence. During this period, the octopus will neglect her own basic needs like eating, instead focusing on protecting her eggs and aerating them to prevent bacteria or other harmful agents from growing on them.",
      "Ghost's eggs are unfertilized and will never hatch, however. In the wild, giant Pacific octopuses spend their whole lives alone and only come together for a brief instance to reproduce.",

      "Ghost is originally from the waters of British Columbia, Canada, and arrived at the aquarium in May 2024 from a scientific collector. She was only 3 pounds (1.4 kilograms) then but now weighs more than 50 pounds (22.7 kilograms).",
      "The average giant Pacific octopus lives for three to five years. Ghost is estimated to be between two and four years old, Jaros said.",

      "He was used to producing a healthy 850 kilograms (1,870 pounds) of corn each season to support his three daughters and two sons. He salvaged just 8 kilograms (17 pounds) from the wreckage of Freddy.",

      "Freddy jolted Maere into action. He decided he needed to change his age-old tactics if he was to survive.",
      "He is now one of thousands of small-scale farmers in the southern African country using a generative AI chatbot designed by the non-profit Opportunity International for farming advice.",
      "The Malawi government is backing the project, having seen the agriculture-dependent nation hit recently by a series of cyclones and an El Ni\u00f1o-induced drought. Malawi\u2019s food crisis, which is largely down to the struggles of small-scale farmers, is a central issue for its national elections next week.",
      "More than 80% of Malawi's population of 21 million rely on agriculture for their livelihoods and the country has one of the highest poverty rates in the world, according to the World Bank.",
      "The AI chatbot suggested Maere grow potatoes last year alongside his staple corn and cassava to adjust to his changed soil. He followed the instructions to the letter, he said, and cultivated half a soccer field's worth of potatoes and made more than $800 in sales, turning around his and his children's fortunes.",
      "\u201cI managed to pay for their school fees without worries,\u201d he beamed.",

Yet productivity in Africa \u2014 with the world's fast-growing population to feed \u2014 is lagging behind despite vast tracts of arable land.",
      "As AI's use surges across the globe, so it is helping African farmers access new information to identify crop diseases, forecast drought, design fertilizers to boost yields, and even locate an affordable tractor. Private investment in agriculture-related tech in sub-Saharan Africa went from $10 million in 2014 to $600 million in 2022, according to the World Bank.",
      "But not without challenges.",
      "Africa has hundreds of languages for AI tools to learn. Even then, few farmers have smartphones and many can't read. Electricity and internet service are patchy at best in rural areas, and often non-existent.",
      "\u201cOne of the biggest challenges to sustainable AI use in African agriculture is accessibility,\u201d said Daniel Mvalo, a Malawian technology specialist. \u201cMany tools fail to account for language diversity, low literacy and poor digital infrastructure.\u201d",
      "The AI tool in Malawi tries to do that. The app is called Ulangizi, which means advisor in the country's Chichewa language. It is WhatsApp-based and works in Chichewa and English.

      "As Big Tech\u2019s data centers continue to grow threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are considering bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- With the explosive growth of Big Tech's data centers threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are taking a hard look at a tough-love solution: bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies.",
      "Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.",
      "Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.",
      "Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.",
      "That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.",
      "Texas was first, but it won't be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,\u201d said Michael Weber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. \u201cData center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.\u201d",
      "That's because grids can't keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.",
      "Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.",
      "A proposal similar to Texas' has emerged from the nation's biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.",
      "The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs \u2014 likely for the biggest power users \u2014 to meet growing demand.",
      "The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast \u2014 twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data \u2014 and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.",
      "Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.",
      "\u201cData center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,\u201d said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.",
      "Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there's a power outage.",
      "Data center operators, however, say they hadn't anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.",
      "The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.",

      "The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.",
      "PJM's just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.",
      "That's caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.",
      "Many questioned PJM's legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.",
      "\u201cThis is particularly concerning given that states within PJM\u2019s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,\u201d the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.",
      "The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it's too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.",
      "Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won't lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a \u201cbring your own generation\u201d requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.",
      "In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.",
      "Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.",
      "However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.",
      "To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.",
      "It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.",
      "Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.",
      "But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.",
      "\u201cAnd the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?\" Silverman said. \"Or is there a better way to do it?\u201d",

      "The single-dose vaccine was developed by the University of the Sunshine Coast in Queensland state after more than a decade of research led by professor of microbiology Peter Timms.",
      "The research showed the vaccine reduced the likelihood of koalas developing symptoms of chlamydia during breeding age and decreased mortality from the disease in wild populations by at least 65%.",
      "The recent approval by Australia\u2019s veterinary medicine regulator means the vaccine can now be used in wildlife hospitals, veterinary clinics and in the field to protect the nation\u2019s most at-risk koalas, Timms said on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cWe knew a single-dose vaccine \u2014 with no need for a booster \u2014 was the answer to reducing the rapid, devastating spread of this disease, which accounts for as much as half of koala deaths across all wild populations in Australia,\u201d Timms said in a statement.",

      "Tabart\u2019s foundation estimates there are fewer than 100,000 koalas in the wild. The government-backed National Koala Monitoring Program estimated last year there were between 224,000 and 524,000 koalas.",
      "\u201cI accept that chlamydia is an issue for koalas, but I also want people to understand that they\u2019re sick because they haven\u2019t got any habitat,\u201d Tabart said.",

      "Scientists have discovered that octopuses don't have a dominant arm, but they more often use their front arms for tasks",
      "WASHINGTON -- Humans may be right-handed or left-handed. It turns out octopuses don't have a dominant arm, but they do tend to perform some tasks more often with their front arms, new research shows.",
      "Scientists studied a series of short videos of wild octopuses crawling, swimming, standing, fetching, and groping -- among other common activities -- to analyze how each of the eight arms were moving.",
      "\u201cAll of the arms can do all of this stuff \u2013 that\u2019s really amazing,\u201d said co-author and marine biologist Roger Hanlon of the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.",
      "Octopus limbs aren\u2019t specialized as many mammal limbs are. However, the three octopus species in the study showed a clear preference for using their four front arms, which they did about 60% of the time. The back arms were used more frequently for stilting and rolling that help move the octopus forward.",
      "\u201cThe forward arms do most of the exploring, the rear arms are mostly for walking,\u201d said Mike Vecchione, a Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History zoologist who was not involved in the study.",
      "Researchers analyzed video clips taken between 2007 and 2015 in the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea. It was the first large study to examine precise limb actions in the wild.",
      "Unlike previous research of octopus behavior in a laboratory setting, the new work showed that octopuses did not show a preference for right or left arms in their natural environment.",
      "Results were published Thursday in Scientific Reports.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m in awe that the researchers managed to do this,\u201d said Janet Voight, an octopus biologist at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, who had no role in the study.",

      "Former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez is appearing before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions on Wednesday for her first public appearance since she was pushed out of her position leading the nation's public health agency.",
      "Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, the panel's chair and a doctor from Louisiana who was one of the key votes to confirm Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., said he was focused on learning what led to the abrupt firing of Monarez just weeks after her confirmation.",
      "\"Part of our responsibility today is to ask ourselves, if someone is fired 29 days after every Republican votes for her, the Senate confirms her, the secretary said in her swearing in that she has 'unimpeachable scientific credentials' and the president called her an incredible mother and dedicated public servant -- like what happened? Did we fail? Was there something we should have done differently?\" Cassidy said.",
      "Monarez, in her opening statement, gave a detailed timeline on the chain of events that she said led to her ouster.",
      "\"Since my removal, several explanations have been offered: that I told the secretary I would resign, that I was not aligned with administration priorities, or that I was untrustworthy. None of those reflect what actually happened,\" Monarez said.",
      "Monarez said there was a meeting in which she says Kennedy told her to preemptively accept recommendations from a CDC vaccine advisory panel and to fire career officials overseeing vaccine policy.",
      "\"I would not commit to that, and I believe it is the true reason I was fired,\" Monarez said. She later added, \"I was fired for holding the line on scientific integrity.\"",
      "She also claimed that Kennedy spoke to the White House \"several times\" prior to the meeting about firing her.",
      "Kennedy, in a hearing before the Senate Finance Committee on Sept. 4, disputed Monarez's version of events, which she first shared that same day in an op-ed published by the Wall Street Journal.",
      "\"Did you, in fact, do what Director Monarez has said you did, which is tell her, 'Just go along with vaccine recommendations, even if you didn't think such recommendations aligned with scientific evidence?'\" Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., asked Kennedy.",
      "\"No, I did not,\" Kennedy replied.",
      "In a fiery exchange with Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Kennedy claimed Monarez told him she was untrustworthy.",
      "\"I told her that she had to resign because I asked her, 'Are you a trustworthy person?' And she said, 'No,'\" Kennedy replied. \"If you had an employee who told you they weren't trustworthy, would you ask them to resign, Senator?\"",
      "Monarez on Wednesday, however, testified Kennedy told her the childhood vaccine schedule would be changing in September and \"I needed to be on board with it.\" Monarez said Kennedy spoke to President Trump \"every day\" about changing the childhood vaccine schedule.",
      "\"He did not have any data or science to point to,\" Monarez said. \"As a matter of fact, we got into an exchange where I had suggested that I would be open to changing childhood vaccine schedules if the evidence or science were supportive, and he responded that there was no science or evidence associated with the childhood vaccine schedule. And he elaborated that CDC had never collected the science or data to make it available related to the safety and efficacy.\"",
      "\"To be clear, he said there was not science or data, but that he still expected you to change the schedule?\" Sen. Cassidy asked.",
      "\"Correct,\" Monarez said.",

      "The high-profile departures raised alarm over Kennedy's vaccine policy agenda, which the public health officials said they were being asked to endorse without adequate science. Kennedy stood by the recent shakeups at CDC, saying they were \"absolutely necessary adjustments to restore the agency to its role as the world's gold standard public health agency with a central mission of protecting Americans from infectious disease.\"",
      "Sen. Cassidy told Monarez and Houry on Wednesday that \"the onus is upon you to prove that the criticisms leveled by the secretary are not true.\"",
      "Cassidy's decision to pursue oversight of the CDC turmoil signifies a new, firmer era for his relationship with Kennedy -- a shift was on full display during Kennedy's own hearing before the Senate earlier this month.",
      "The senator accused Kennedy of undermining President Donald Trump's legacy on Operation Warp Speed, the government effort that fast-tracked the COVID vaccine, and told him recent FDA changes to COVID vaccines were \"denying\" people access.",
      "Democratic Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester, who sits on the HELP Committee and has called for Kennedy to step down, said Cassidy's decision to call Monarez to testify showed a continued \"weakening\" of support for the secretary.",
      "\"I think Secretary Kennedy's actions at the Finance Committee left a lot of not just Democrats, but Republicans very unsettled,\" Blunt Rochester told ABC News in an interview.",
      "\"The fact that a Republican is chairing the committee and called for her to come is a positive step, and maybe shows there is some weakening. But the reality is, you know, Secretary Kennedy needs to go -- whether that is he's fired, whether he quits, he is unsafe for America,\" she said.",
      "During the Senate Finance Committee hearing on Sept. 4, Cassidy was joined by two other Republicans on the committee -- Sens. John Barrasso of Wyoming, the second most powerful GOP senator, and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who announced earlier this year he was not running for reelection -- in expressing concern over Kennedy's handling of vaccines and the CDC.",
      "Other high-level Republicans have also voiced criticism, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who said Kennedy had to \"take responsibility\" for firing Monarez just four weeks after the Senate confirmed her. Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said she didn't see any \"justification\" for the termination.",
      "Republican Sen. John Kennedy, Cassidy's counterpart in Louisiana, called Kennedy's handling of the CDC a \"multiple vehicle pileup.\"",
      "Monarez, who HHS publicly announced was \"no longer director\" on a Wednesday afternoon in late August, drew widespread attention when she refused to leave her post, asking Trump to weigh in and fire her directly if he agreed with his HHS secretary. She said she was pushed out because she wouldn't agree to rubber-stamp Kennedy's agenda or fire high-ranking scientists.",
      "The move put a spotlight on Kennedy's vaccine policy changes, which have ramped up in recent weeks. Kennedy canceled around $500 million in contracts for mRNA vaccines, changed the recommendations for healthy children and pregnant women to receive COVID-19 vaccinations and, through the FDA, oversaw the narrowing of approval for the updated COVID shots this fall only to people over 65, or younger Americans with underlying conditions.",
      "A CDC committee will soon meet to discuss vaccine recommendations more broadly, including the measles, mumps, rubella, varicella (MMRV) vaccine, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV).",
      "Kennedy has replaced all of the members of the committee with handpicked people, some of whom have expressed criticism of vaccines. Asked by ABC News if he plans to limit access to any of those vaccines, Kennedy said the committee would decide after a \"real gold standard scientific review.\"",
      "Monarez on Wednesday expressed concerns with the composition of the advisory committee.",
      "\"Based on what I observed during my tenure, there is real risk that recommendations could be made restricting access to vaccines for children and others in need without rigorous scientific review. With no permanent CDC director in place, those recommendations could be adopted,\" Monarez said.",

      "SANTIAGO DE COMPOSTELA, Spain -- While some Barcelona residents sought to repel a tsunami of tourists with plastic water pistols, a neighborhood association in Santiago de Compostela opted for a friendlier approach: a guide to good manners for visitors to their town, the endpoint of the Catholic world's most famous pilgrimage.",
      "Translated into several languages, the group posted it throughout the northwestern Spanish city and distributed it at its ever-growing number of hostels. It reminded tourists to keep noise down, respect traffic rules and use plastic protectors on hiking poles to avoid damaging the narrow cobblestone streets, among other things.",
      "To little avail, it would seem. Large groups still take over the streets singing hymns, bikes ride in the wrong direction and metal pole tips clatter against the ground. Santiago's social media is awash with photos denouncing a lack of decorum.",
      "Tourists' greater offense, though, stems from their sheer numbers; the old town and squares surrounding the cathedral holding the reputed tomb of Saint James the Apostle \u2014 and that was the center of town life for a millennium \u2014 today are almost exclusively the domain of outsiders, whose influx has served to expel residents. This dynamic has left Santiago emerging as the latest global destination where longtime residents have grown embittered by the overtourism transforming their community.",
      "\u201cWe do not have tourism-phobia. We have always lived in harmony with tourism, but when it gets out of hand, when the pressure goes beyond what is reasonable, that is when rejection arises,\u201d said Roberto Almu\u00ed\u00f1a, president of the neighborhood association in the old town that's a UNESCO World Heritage site.",
      "The \u201cCamino de Santiago,\u201d known in English as the Way of St. James, dates back to the 9th century, with pilgrims following its converging trails for up to hundreds of kilometers on paths originating in Portugal and France. The modern popularity it gained with the 2010 film \u201cThe Way\u201d starring Martin Sheen was turbocharged more recently by social media and experience-driven travel after the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "Last year, a record half-million people signed up to trek one of the approved routes to the cathedral \u2014 equal to five times the city\u2019s resident population, and marking a 725-fold increase over the last four decades. Added to those masses are ordinary tourists not arriving by trail.",
      "The proliferation of short-term rentals drove annual rent prices up 44% from 2018 to 2023, according to a study commissioned by the city council to the Fundaci\u00f3n Universidade da Coru\u00f1a. That led municipal authorities in May to request the regional government classify the area as a high-pressure zone, like Barcelona or San Sebastian, which would help to limit rent increases.",
      "Already, last November, Santiago's city council enacted a ban on Airbnb-style tourist accommodations in the historic center, arguing at the time in a statement that it was \u201ca necessity arising from its significant growth, which has clear effects on the number of housing units available for residents and on their price.\u201d",
      "Sihara P\u00e9rez, a researcher at the University of Santiago, described finding anywhere to rent in the city as \u201cmission impossible,\u201d while Antonio Jerem\u00edas, 27, told The Associated Press that he's considering moving back in with his mother, because his salary working full-time at a warehouse isn\u2019t enough to make ends meet.",
      "Andrea Dopazo, 32, tried to move out of her parents\u2019 house in a neighborhood located fully 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the city center. But her desire to continue living in the place where she grew up and community ties are strong proved futile, and she had to take something in a town outside Santiago.",
      "\u201cThe only people who have been able to stay in the neighborhoods are those who have been lucky \u2014 or unlucky \u2014 enough to inherit an apartment from their grandparents, uncles or parents,\u201d said Dopazo, who works in human resources.",

But in the hustle to cash in, some short-term rentals are apparently flouting the restriction, evidenced by tenants collecting keys from lockboxes hung outside buildings.",
      "\u201cSome follow the rules and others don\u2019t, but this is the model that is really limiting residential housing,\u201d said Montse Vilar, from another neighborhood group, Xuntanza.",

      "Between 2000 and 2020, the historic center lost about half its permanent population, now reduced to just 3,000 residents who \u201cresist like the Gauls\u201d behind buildings' thick stone facades, Almu\u00ed\u00f1a said. There are no hardware stores or newsstands left, and just one bakery. A couple grocery stores coexist with cafes, ice cream parlors and souvenir shops.",
      "\u201cThe city has emptied out. You only have to take a walk to see that all we've got are closed, abandoned buildings that are falling apart,\u201d Almu\u00ed\u00f1a added.",
      "This year, the number of pilgrims reaching Santiago is on track to set another record. The surge is further souring Santiago's residents on their city's tourism-centric economic model; already half of them rejected it as of 2023, up from just over one-quarter a decade earlier, according to a study conducted by Rede Galabra, a research group focused on cultural studies at the University of Santiago.",
      "Even some of the pilgrims are noting a shift, like Spaniards \u00c1lvaro Casta\u00f1o and Ale Osteso who met on the route four years ago and have returned every year since.",

      "MORENO VALLEY, Calif. -- A wild burro dubbed Cupid is recovering from surgery after being shot with an arrow in what officials say is the latest in a series of a half-dozen attacks since June on donkeys that roam semirural areas of inland Southern California.",
      "The 2-year-old female burro was spotted last Wednesday with a blue arrow protruding from her right shoulder as she wandered with a herd in the foothills of Moreno Valley, about 65 miles (104 km) east of Los Angeles.",
      "Animal services and the Riverside County Sheriff's Department responded and helped bring the wounded animal in for an emergency procedure to remove the arrowhead. The projectile had punctured the burro's right lung, said Chad Cheatham, vice president of DonkeyLand, a nonprofit rescue organization.",
      "\u201cRight now she\u2019s stable and is standing, which is a huge improvement,\" Cheatham said Monday. When Cupid is fully recovered, she will join a group of rescued burros who meander DonkeyLand's 2,000-acre (800-hectare) sanctuary and wildlife preserve.",
      "The rescue group is offering a $24,000 reward, raised from donations, for information leading to the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in at least six bow attacks on burros over the past several months.",
      "The Riverside County Department of Animal Services said Tuesday that the investigation is ongoing, and asked for the public's help in identifying a suspect or suspects.",
      "Wild burros are protected under federal law. They are an iconic symbol of the American Southwest, dating to their days as pack animals for people flocking to California during the Gold Rush.",
      "Cheatham said burros have become an \u201cunofficial mascot\u201d of Moreno Valley, where hundreds of them have rambled freely for at least 75 years. They even help with wildfire abatement by munching on tinder- dry grass in remote and ready-to-burn canyons across Riverside and San Bernardino counties, he said.",
      "\u201cSo they really do provide a benefit to the community. The firefighters love them because, they say, \u2018Man, these guys can go places we can\u2019t go,\u2019 \u201d Cheatham said.",

      "\u201cWhile the wild burros delight many residents and visitors, they also commonly encounter vehicle traffic and freight trains, resulting in tragedy for burros and humans,\u201d the county said in a statement. \u201cThe burros also seriously injure themselves leading to infection and death when they become entangled in fencing or when their hooves get caught in cemetery flower vases.\u201d",
      "The arrows used in the Moreno Valley attacks were broadheads, a style traditionally used for hunting, said Cheatham. According to DonkeyLand, the first attack occurred the weekend of June 14, when a young burro was found grazing with an arrow in her side not far from where Cupid was discovered. A few days later, a second burro was found shot with a similar style of arrow in the same area.",
      "Since then, at least three other donkeys were shot in the vicinity, including a pair estimated to be two to four months old, the rescue group said.",
      "Healthy donkeys typically live 40 years or more and vary in size from waist-high \u201cminis\u201d that may weigh 300 pounds (135 kilograms) to bulky \u201cmammoths.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Democrats are planning to force two Senate votes on President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs in the coming weeks, keeping pressure on Senate Republicans as many of them have voiced frustration with the policies.",
      "Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine says he will introduce two separate bipartisan resolutions this week that would terminate the national emergencies that Trump declared to justify the tariffs he has imposed on Canada and Brazil. In April, four Republicans voted with Democrats to block Trump\u2019s tariffs on Canada, but the House never took it up.",
      "Kaine said it\u2019s common for Republican senators to express concerns about the tariffs, but he wants to put them on the record as often as he can.",
      "Republicans can \u201cvote with your constituents or vote with President Trump,\u201d Kaine said. \u201cOver time, the instability is creating huge concerns.\u201d",
      "Kaine is introducing the two resolutions with a group of Democrats and Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, an outspoken opponent of Trump's tariffs. By introducing the measures, the group is triggering a decades-old law that allows Congress to block a president\u2019s emergency powers and force votes on Trump\u2019s declarations, whether majority Republicans want to hold the votes or not.",
      "The law allows lawmakers to reintroduce the legislation and force new votes every six months \u2014 something Kaine says he will do until the policy is changed.",
      "Hours after Kaine\u2019s announcement, the House voted to temporarily block any such effort. Republican House leaders who have defended the tariffs added language to an unrelated measure that would prevent votes on the tariffs until next year, ensuring that the Senate resolutions will only be symbolic even if they pass.",
      "The Senate votes will come at a time of turmoil for the economy. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said last week that Trump\u2019s tariff policy is one of several factors that are expected to increase jobless rates and inflation and lower overall growth this year. Republicans from farm states and beyond, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota, have expressed wariness about some of the sweeping tariffs and concerns about the effects on businesses that depend on Canadian trade.",
      "Still, Republicans have mostly deferred to Trump on his administration\u2019s trade policy, arguing that the president needs time to work on deals with individual countries.",
      "\u201cI think everybody kind of knows my views on tariffs, but the fact of the matter is, the president ran on this,\u201d Thune said earlier this year.",
      "The resolution to block the Canadian tariffs would end the emergency declaration that Trump signed in February to implement tariffs on Canada as punishment for not doing enough to halt the flow of illegal drugs into the U.S. The Senate passed the same resolution in April with support from Paul and three other Republicans \u2014 Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. Trump called out the four on social media at the time, encouraging them to \u201cget on the Republican bandwagon.\u201d",

The officer left the store and heard gunfire coming from the encampment area.",
      "Officers arriving at the scene found five people injured by gunfire, including a woman and two men with life-threatening injuries. Another man and a woman suffered what appeared to be non-life-threatening wounds, with each having injuries to their legs. All five were rushed to a hospital.",
      "Police later learned that three other people, including one with life-threatening injuries, walked or were taken to hospitals before police arrived. O'Hara said no arrests had been made in either the encampment shooting or the earlier shooting near the transit station.",

      "One of the bills, called the \u201cDC Crimes Act,\" would lower the age of a youth offender in the federal district from 24 to 18 and require that criminal sentencing be at least as long as the mandatory minimums for adults, overruling local D.C. policy. It would also require the D.C. attorney general to establish a public website that would publish statistics on youth criminal acts.",
      "The bill passed 240-179, with 30 Democrats joining Republicans in support.",

      "Still, the latest slate of D.C. legislation has an uncertain future in the Senate, where some Democratic support would be needed.

      "LOS ANGELES -- Los Angeles police officers fired over 1,000 projectiles at protesters on a single day in June as demonstrators pushed back against the Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown and decision to deploy the National Guard to the nation\u2019s second largest city.",
      "The police department released a state-mandated report Monday on use of force against protesters that included numbers on bean bags, rubber and foam rounds, and tear gas deployed during days of protests in Los Angeles.",
      "On June 6, police fired 34 rounds at about 100 people. On June 8, police fired 1,040 projectiles at about 6,000 people, including 20 rounds of CS gas, a type of tear gas. Six injuries were reported as a result of those projectiles.",
      "There were 584 police officers responding that day, the department said. Protesters had blocked off a major freeway and set self-driving cars on fire.",
      "The report was concerning to Josh Parker, deputy director of policy at the New York University School of Law Policing Project.",
      "\u201cThe sense that I got from that data is that if that\u2019s how you police a protest, then you\u2019re policing it wrong,\u201d Parker said.",
      "The protests have put the use of these types of munitions by law enforcement under scrutiny. After journalists were shot, a federal judge granted a temporary restraining order that blocked LA police from using rubber projectiles and other munitions against reporters.",

      "California in 2021 restricted the use of less lethal munitions until alternatives to force have been tried to control a crowd. Police cannot aim \u201cindiscriminately\u201d into a crowd or at the head, neck or any other vital organs. They also cannot fire solely for a curfew violation, verbal threats toward officers, or not complying with directions given by law enforcement, such as when they order an unlawful assembly to disperse.",

      "Nonetheless, it is a major step against one of the United States\u2019 staunchest allies in Latin America, which analysts said could hurt the economy and further hamper efforts to restore security in the countryside.",
      "President Gustavo Petro, who has said on several occasions that whisky kills more people than cocaine, lamented Trump's decision during a televised cabinet meeting Monday, saying Colombia was penalized after sacrificing the lives of \u201cdozens of policemen, soldiers and regular citizens, trying to stop cocaine\u201d from reaching the United States.",
      "\u201cWhat we have been doing is not really relevant to the Colombian people,\u201d he said of the nation\u2019s antidrug efforts. \u201cIt\u2019s to stop North American society from smearing its noses\u201d in cocaine.",
      "The U.S. last added Colombia to the list, through a process known as decertification, in 1997 when the country\u2019s cartels \u2014 through threats of violence and money \u2014 had poisoned much of the nation\u2019s institutions.",
      "\"Decertification is a blunt tool and a huge irritant in bilateral relations that goes well beyond drug issues and makes cooperation far harder in any number of areas,\u201d said Adam Isacson, a security researcher at the Washington Office on Latin America. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so rarely used.\u201d",
      "The president at the time, Ernesto Samper, was facing credible accusations of receiving illicit campaign contributions from the now-defunct Cali cartel and a plane he was set to use for a trip to New York to attend the U.N. General Assembly session was found carrying 4 kilograms of heroin.",
      "A remarkable turnaround began once Samper left office. Successive U.S. administrations \u2014 both Republican and Democrats \u2014 sent billions in foreign assistance to Colombia to eradicate illegal coca crops, strengthen its armed forces in the fight against drug-fueled rebels and provide economic alternatives to poor farmers who are on the lowest rungs of the cocaine industry.",
      "That cooperation, a rare U.S. foreign policy success in Latin America, started to unravel following the suspension a decade ago of aerial eradication of coca fields with glyphosate. It followed a Colombia high court ruling that determined the U.S.-funded program was potentially harmful to the environment and farmers.",
      "A 2016 peace accord with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the nation\u2019s largest rebel group known as FARC, also committed Colombia to rolling back punitive policies likened to the U.S. spraying of Agent Orange during the Vietnam War in favor of state building, rural development and voluntary crop substitution.",
      "Since then, cocaine production has skyrocketed. The amount of land dedicated to cultivating coca, the base ingredient of cocaine, has almost tripled in the past decade to a record 253,000 hectares in 2023, according to the latest report available from the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime. That is almost triple the size of New York City.",

      "But unlike past governments, manual eradication of coca crops under Petro\u2019s leadership has slowed, to barely 5,048 hectares this year \u2014 far less than the 68,000 hectares uprooted in the final year of his conservative predecessor\u2019s term and well below the government\u2019s own goal of 30,000 hectares.",
      "Petro, a former rebel himself, also has angered senior U.S. officials by denying American extradition requests as well as criticizing the Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown and its efforts to combat drug trafficking in neighboring Venezuela.",
      "\u201cUnder my administration, Colombia does not collaborate in assassinations,\u201d Petro said on Sept. 5 after the U.S. military carried out a deadly strike on a small Venezuelan vessel in the Caribbean that the Trump administration said was transporting cocaine bound for the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe failure of Colombia to meet its drug control obligations over the past year rests solely with its political leadership,\u201d Trump said in a presidential memo submitted to Congress. \u201cI will consider changing this designation if Colombia\u2019s government takes more aggressive action to eradicate coca and reduce cocaine production and trafficking, as well as hold those producing, trafficking, and benefiting from the production of cocaine responsible, including through improved cooperation with the United States to bring the leaders of Colombian criminal organizations to justice.\u201d",
      "Under U.S. law, the president annually must identify countries that have failed to meet their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements during the previous 12 months.",
      "In addition to Colombia, the Trump administration listed four other countries \u2014 Afghanistan, Bolivia, Burma and Venezuela \u2014 as among 23 major drug transit or drug-production countries that have failed to meet their international obligations. With the exception of Afghanistan, the White House determined that U.S. assistance to those countries was vital to national interests and therefore they would be spared any potential sanctions.",
      "The redesignation of Venezuela as a country that has failed to adequately fight narcotics smuggled from neighboring Colombia comes against the backdrop of a major U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean that has already led to two deadly strikes on small Venezuelan vessels that the Trump administration said were transporting cocaine bound for the U.S.",
      "\u201cIn Venezuela, the criminal regime of indicted drug trafficker Nicol\u00e1s Maduro leads one of the largest cocaine trafficking networks in the world, and the United States will continue to seek to bring Maduro and other members of his complicit regime to justice for their crimes,\u201d Trump's designation said. \u201cWe will also target Venezuelan foreign terrorist organizations such as Tren de Aragua and purge them from our country.\u201d",

      "David Pittman, 63, is set to receive a lethal injection starting at 6 p.m. at Florida State Prison near Starke under a death warrant signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis. The Republican governor has signed more death warrants this year than any of his predecessors.",
      "Pittman's final appeal was rejected Tuesday by the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "So far, two more Florida executions are scheduled for this fall. Victor Tony Jones is set to die on Sept. 30 for the 1990 killings of two people during a robbery and Samuel Lee Smithers is scheduled for execution on Oct. 14 for the murders of two women in 1996.",
      "Pittman was convicted and sentenced to death in 1991 on three counts of first-degree murder, according to court records. Jurors also found him guilty of arson and grand theft.",
      "Pittman and his wife, Marie, were going through a contentious divorce in May 1990, when the killings occurred, and investigators say he had threatened to harm her family several times.",
      "Trial testimony showed Pittman cut a phone line at the Mulberry, Florida home of his wife's parents, Clarence Knowles, 60, and his wife, 50-year-old Barbara Knowles. Pittman stabbed the couple to death as well as their other daughter, 21-year-old Bonnie Knowles. Pittman then set their house on fire and stole Bonnie Knowles' car, which he also set ablaze.

      "Pittman's most recent appeals focused on recent evidence indicating he suffers from intellectual disabilities, including an IQ in the low 70s, that was apparent at the time of the killings. His lawyers say his execution would violate the Constitution's protection against putting to death a person with severe mental problems.",
      "Lawyers for the state disagreed, contending it is now too late for Pittman to claim mental impairment from years earlier. The Florida Supreme Court, reversing a previous decision, ruled in 2020 that such claims cannot apply retroactively.",

      "Before Pittman, 30 people have been executed in the U.S. in 2025, with Florida leading the way behind the flurry of death warrants signed by DeSantis.

      "An immigration crackdown in Washington has taken a toll on children attending the district's schools",
      "WASHINGTON -- The last time she saw her husband, the father of her three children, was when he left their Washington apartment a month ago to buy milk and diapers. Before long he called to say he had been pulled over \u2014 but not to worry, because it was just local police. The next time she heard from him, he was at a detention center in Virginia.",
      "Since that day, the 40-year-old mother of three has been too afraid to take her two sons to their nearby charter school. Like her husband, who has since been deported, she is an immigrant from Guatemala and has lived in the U.S. illegally for more than a decade. She spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear she would be targeted by immigration authorities.",
      "All three of the couple's children were born in the nation's capital, and the older two attend a local charter school. She planned to keep them home until a volunteer offered to drive them. Still, one of the boys was so upset over his father's absence he missed three days of school one week.",
      "Schools in Washington reopened late last month against the backdrop of a law enforcement surge that brought masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents into normally quiet neighborhoods, scenes likely to be replicated elsewhere as President Donald Trump dispatches federal agents to the streets of other big cities.",
      "In some Washington communities, the fear spread by the police presence has taken a toll on children. Some students have had parents swept up in the crackdown. Other students fear they or their family members could be next. Parents are grappling with how to explain the situation.",
      "\u201cIn my community, the impact has been immense fear and terror that is threatening student safety getting to and from school every day,\u201d said Ben Williams, a high school social studies teacher who also serves on the District of Columbia State Board of Education. \u201cIt is really making everyone feel on edge every day as to whether someone, a community member or a parent or someone that is close or connected to the community, could be taken.\u201d",
      "In northwest Washington's Mount Pleasant neighborhood, where million-dollar rowhouses and affordable apartments home to immigrant families share the same tree-lined blocks, federal agents became a common sight and neighbors documented several arrests.",
      "Raul Cortez, an immigrant from El Salvador, said his 7-year-old son has grown deeply afraid of police.",
      "\u201cThe children pay attention. They are very intelligent, and they know what is happening,\u201d Cortez said.",
      "A few moments later, his son caught sight of an idling police car. His eyes widened.",
      "Mindful that some parents were afraid of leaving the house, volunteers began organizing \u201cwalking buses\u201d to accompany groups of children by foot from apartment buildings to schools. Outside Bancroft Elementary, which teaches students in English and Spanish, volunteers are stationed at street corners in orange vests, ready to blow a whistle if they see signs of immigration authorities.",
      "Research has linked immigration raids near schools to lower academic outcomes for Latino students, who are more likely to have family ties to immigrants.",
      "Trump's immigration crackdown also has affected school attendance in other parts of the country. In the months following his January inauguration, districts across the country reported lower attendance as immigrant families kept their children home. In California\u2019s Central Valley, immigration raids in January and February coincided with a 22% spike in student absences compared with the previous two school years, according to a study from Stanford University economist Thomas Dee and Big Local News.",
      "In Washington, deputy mayor for education Paul Kihn said at a news conference near the start of the school year that attendance had been about at the same level as last year. D.C. Public Schools, which educates about half of the district's students, said it could not provide data on school attendance during the federal intervention.",
      "But Williams, who represents schools serving large immigrant communities, said attendance at some schools has taken a hit.",
      "Around the country, educators have been on alert since Trump, a Republican, in January directed the Department of Homeland Security to rescind a memo that barred officers from entering schools and churches without a supervisor's approval. They replaced it with guidance that urges officers to use \u201cdiscretion and a healthy dose of common sense\u201d before setting foot on a school campus.",

    "story": [
      "A San Francisco supervisor who pushed to turn a 2-mile stretch of highway into a car-free park faces a recall vote in his district",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- During the coronavirus pandemic, the city closed a stretch of a four-lane highway along San Francisco\u2019s Pacific Coast and made it an automobile-free sanctuary where bicyclists and walkers flocked to exercise and socialize under open skies and to the sound of crashing waves.",
      "But with the post-pandemic return to school and work, resentment grew among neighborhood residents who relied on the artery to get around. Some blamed the district city supervisor who helped make the change permanent by placing on a citywide ballot a measure to turn the 2-mile (3.2-kilometer) stretch into a new park.",
      "On Tuesday, district voters will decide whether to recall Supervisor Joel Engardio.",
      "The recall of a local supervisor who represents one-tenth of a city of 800,000 might seem like minor politics. But the election highlights a San Francisco in flux and a still cranky, even emboldened electorate as leaders prepare to make tough decisions about the city\u2019s future.",
      "The recall election will be the city's third in four years. It's fueled by many of the same people who tossed out three liberal school board members in February 2022 followed by the ouster of politically progressive San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin in June of that year.",
      "\u201cThis recall is really about the future of our city,\u201d said Engardio in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cDo we want to be a city that just preserves itself in amber and goes back in time? Or do we want to be a city that innovates, thinks ahead, is forward-looking and welcomes new people?\u201d",
      "Engardio, a crime victims\u2019 advocate, supported the previous recalls. He was among detractors who said Boudin was too lenient on crime and the San Francisco Unified School Board too focused on progressive politics, including renaming 44 school sites.",
      "Later in 2022, he defeated an incumbent to win one of 11 seats on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Engardio represents the Sunset District, a low-key residential neighborhood of single-family homes on the west side with a high Chinese population.",
      "Last year, he was one of five city supervisors who placed a proposal to permanently ban cars from the Great Highway on the November 2024 ballot. Measure K passed citywide, but failed in his district. In May, recall petitioners submitted 10,500 valid signatures to qualify the initiative for Tuesday\u2019s ballot.",
      "On an overcast afternoon last week, people jogged and rode bikes down what had once been called the Great Highway. Moms pushed babies in strollers on a road divided by a median of blowing sand and creeping ice plant succulents, still striped with dotted white lines marking what used to be driving lanes. An older man walked by slowly, using a cane.",
      "The new park dubbed Sunset Dunes is popular with many San Francisco residents \u2014 but not so much with those in its home community.",
      "Backers of the recall say Engardio betrayed his constituents by going back on support for a compromise that would have kept the highway open to vehicles during the week and banned them on weekends. They say he failed to listen to their concerns about quality of life and traffic safety in the district.",

      "Wearing a blue cap and white sneakers, volunteer Heather Davies slips a recall flier under a door. At another house, she thanks a man for returning his ballot with a yes vote.",

The tech entrepreneurs have contributed a combined $375,000 to support the anti-recall campaign, which has raised more than $800,000 total; the pro-recall campaign has raised about $250,000.",

      "But Alex Wong, a father of two young children, says he supports Engardio because the supervisor has always endorsed family-friendly policies, like building more housing and improving schools.",
      "\u201cThe recall itself is centered around a road closure that the rest of the city voted on in support. It may not be popular among my neighbors, but I don't think that in itself is worthy enough of a recall,\u201d Wong said. \u201cThe Sunset is better than this.\"",

      "WASHINGTON -- Some Democratic senators say they are deeply concerned that a Pentagon plan to allow military lawyers to work as temporary immigration judges will violate a ban on using service members for law enforcement and affect the military justice system.",
      "The letter, sent to the military services and provided to The Associated Press, comes two weeks after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth approved sending up to 600 military lawyers to the Justice Department to serve as temporary immigration judges. It is part of the steps the Trump administration has taken to use the military in broader ways than previously seen, particularly in its immigration crackdown, including sending the National Guard into American cities and deploying active duty troops to the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "\u201cThese military officers would serve under the command and control of the Attorney General and would execute administrative determinations at the direction of the Attorney General,\u201d according to the letter signed by 12 Democrats on the Senate Armed Services Committee. It added that \u201cthese actions are inherently law enforcement actions that may not be performed by members of the armed forces.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe remain extremely disturbed about the impacts on readiness of using military personnel to perform what are traditionally Department of Justice functions,\u201d the letter says.",
      "The nation\u2019s immigration courts \u2014 with a backlog of about 3.5 million cases \u2014 have become a key focus of President Donald Trump\u2019s hard-line immigration enforcement efforts. Since Trump returned to office, dozens of immigration judges have been fired, while others have resigned or taken early retirement.",
      "The senators' letter, sent to the offices of the top military lawyers for the four services on Monday, is asking the Pentagon to say where the roughly 600 lawyers will be coming from and for insight into what legal analysis the military has conducted into whether the move would violate the Posse Comitatus Act. That law prevents the military from conducting law enforcement outside of extreme emergencies.",
      "A Pentagon memo that described the plan said the lawyers should not be detailed for longer than half a year. The memo also showed that Pentagon officials were cognizant of the possibility for conflict with that law and said the Justice Department would be responsible for ensuring that the military lawyers do not violate it.",

      "Those offices were set up by Congress in 2022 as part of an effort to reform the military justice system by moving decisions on the prosecution of serious military crimes, including sexual assault, to independent military attorneys, taking that power away from victims\u2019 commanders.",
      "The offices began taking cases at the end of last year.",
      "The letter asks the Pentagon what it will do to \u201cpreserve the OSTC\u2019s progress in building specialized trial capacity\u201d and what the services will do to \u201censure that diversion of OSTCs, trial counsels, and defense counsels does not create delays or diminish quality in court-martials.\u201d The senators say that the plan is a demonstration of how \u201cthe Trump administration views skilled personnel as pawns to be traded between agencies, rather than as professionals essential to their core missions, in order to advance misguided immigration policies.\"",

    "summary": "One of Hollywood's leading actors, Robert Redford starred in such movies as \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" and \"The Way We Were.\"",
    "story": [
      "Academy Award-winning actor and director Robert Redford, one of the biggest movie stars to ever grace the screen and whose startlingly magnetic charisma in such films as \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\" \"The Way We Were\" and \"The Sting\" made him an icon, has died. He was 89.",
      "Cindi Berger, CEO of the publicity firm Rogers & Cowan PMK, confirmed Redford's death to CBS News in a statement. Berger said he died Tuesday at his home in the mountains of Utah surrounded by those he loved. She didn't provide details about the circumstances surrounding his death.",
      "Barbra Streisand, who starred alongside Redford in the 1973 romantic drama \"The Way We Were,\" said the Hollywood legend was \"one of the finest actors ever\" in a tribute on social media.",
      "\"Every day on the set of The Way We Were was exciting, intense and pure joy,\" Streisand said. \"We were such opposites: he was from the world of horses; I was allergic to them! Yet, we kept trying to find out more about each other, just like the characters in the movie.\"",
      "Actor Robin Wright, who worked with Redford on his 2010 film \"The Conspirator,\" praised the actor and director during an interview on \"CBS Mornings Plus\" after news of his death was announced.",
      "\"He was amazing,\" Wright said. \"I mean, what an icon, and his body of work will live on forever. And to be able to be directed by an actor, that was fantastic, and that's such a rarity. And he's an icon that's going to be greatly missed.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters outside the White House before traveling to the U.K., President Trump said, \"I'll tell you, Robert Redford was great. He had a series of years that he was \u2014 there was nobody better.\"",
      "Redford burst into the Hollywood stratosphere in the late 1960s, when he was paired with Paul Newman in the Western \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\" Their charm playing lovable outlaws was undeniable, but it would be Redford's nonchalance about his striking good looks that helped sell his characters \u2014 in comedies, dramas and adventures \u2014 making him one of the leading box office draws of the 1970s and '80s.",
      "Then, as founder of the Sundance Institute, he used his celebrity to help nurture independent films while promoting generations of young filmmakers, as well as environmental and social justice issues. Since 1985, the institute has hosted the internationally famous Sundance Film Festival, which has been the launching pad for innumerable talents, from Quentin Tarantino, John Sayles and Christopher Nolan to the Coen brothers. In 1989, the New York Times called Redford \"a godfather to the American independent film movement.\"",
      "In a joint statement with other Sundance Institute leadership, acting CEO Amanda Kelso said, \"Today is a sad day for the Sundance Institute community. Bob's vision launched a movement that, over four decades later, has inspired generations of artists and redefined cinema in the U.S. and around the world.\"",
      "\"The vibrant storytelling landscape we cherish today, both as artists and audiences, is unimaginable without his passionate drive and principled leadership. Beyond Bob's enormous contributions to culture at large, we will miss his generosity, clarity of purpose, curiosity, rebellious spirit, and his love for the creative process,\" the statement said, in part.",
      "According to Redford, his fame was hardly predictable.",
      "\"I was so much the last choice\" for the role of the Sundance Kid, he told CBS' \"Sunday Morning\" in 2006. \"They tried everything to keep me out of the picture because I wasn't known, compared to Paul [Newman].\"",
      "His performance changed all that. The comedy-drama, directed by George Roy Hill, topped the box office chart for 1969.",
      "Four years later, Redford and Newman teamed up again in Hill's caper \"The Sting,\" which won seven Academy Awards, including best picture. Redford was also nominated for best actor for his performance as a small-time con artist out for revenge against a big-city gambler (played by Robert Shaw).",
      "Redford would star in 16 features between 1969 and 1980, many of them hits that traded on his remarkable screen presence: \"Downhill Racer,\" \"The Hot Rock,\" \"Jeremiah Johnson,\" \"The Candidate,\" \"The Great Gatsby\" with Mia Farrow, \"The Great Waldo Pepper,\" \"Three Days of the Condor\" with Faye Dunaway, \"The Electric Horseman\" with Jane Fonda and \"Brubaker.\" So bright was his star power that he reportedly earned a $2 million paycheck for what was barely a walk-on in the World War II epic \"A Bridge Too Far.\"",
      "But his most surprising film was one which he produced and fought for: the acclaimed 1976 drama \"All the President's Men,\" the story of Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, who uncovered the Watergate scandal.",
      "\"It took four years, and the studio, they said, 'Politics? I don't think so,'\" Redford said in 2006. \"You know, 'Watergate is a dead issue.' And I said, 'It's not. It's a detective story about investigative journalism and about the American trait of hard work, and hard work led to something that spared us the loss of our First Amendment. That, to me, is worth making.'\"",
      "The film was nominated for eight Oscars and won four, including for its screenplay by William Goldman, and for Jason Robards' performance as Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee.",
      "Redford starred in hit after hit, but he told \"Sunday Morning \" in 2018 many of those films he's never watched. Really? \"I don't know. I haven't ever counted 'em, but a lot,\" Redford said. \"'Cause I thought if I look at myself too much, I'm gonna be too aware of myself and that means when I go to do something new, I won't be able to do it without being slightly aware of what I'm doing rather than just being free.\"",
      "He moved on to a job where he wouldn't have to look at himself \u2014 behind the camera, as director of \"Ordinary People.\" Based on the novel by Judith Guest, it tells of an affluent family whose veneer of stability is shattered after one son dies in a boating accident and another attempts suicide. It starred Donald Sutherland, Mary Tyler Moore in a rare dramatic role, Judd Hirsch and Timothy Hutton, who won a best supporting actor Academy Award for his feature film debut. The film also won best picture, and for Redford a best director Oscar.",
      "In the decade following \"Ordinary People,\" he appeared on screen only a few times \u2014 in the baseball tale \"The Natural,\" the Oscar-winning \"Out of Africa\" opposite Meryl Streep, and the romantic comedy \"Legal Eagles.\"",
      "He would also return to the director's chair eight times, with an eclectic mix of stories and genres: \"The Milagro Beanfield War,\" about a land war pitting a Hispanic farmer against real estate interests; \"A River Runs Though It,\" a period drama of family and fly-fishing, with Brad Pitt; \"Quiz Show,\" about TV's quiz show scandal in the 1950s; \"The Horse Whisperer,\" about a horse trainer with a remarkable gift; \"The Legend of Bagger Vance,\" a golf fable with Will Smith and Matt Damon; \"Lions for Lambs,\" a political drama of wartime co-starring Tom Cruise and Streep; \"The Conspirator,\" about the Confederate plot surrounding Lincoln's assassination; and the political thriller \"The Company You Keep.\"",
      "\"One of the lions has passed,\" Streep said in a statement Tuesday. \"Rest in peace my lovely friend.\"",
      "Scarlett Johansson, who said Redford cast her in \"The Horse Whisperer\" when she was just 11 years old, remembered him as someone who was \"patient and warm and kind.\"",
      "\"Every day before each scene, he would take the time to sit with me and walk me through all of the beats that led my character up until that particular point in the story. No matter the reality of the days rush, I always felt he had all the time in the world for our work,\" Johansson said. \"Bob taught me what acting could be, and it was from his generosity and patience that I was inspired to pursue the possibilities of the craft.\"",
      "Redford made perhaps his biggest contribution to movies by founding the Sundance Institute, which developed and fostered the work of young and diverse independent filmmakers outside of mainstream Hollywood. Begun in 1981, Sundance encompassed workshops with writers, directors and actors, and later hosted the internationally recognized film festival.",
      "Asked by Collider in 2019 his reasons for founding the institute, Redford said, \"The goal for me was very simple: to celebrate people who don't get celebrated, who are ignored or undiscovered and who deserve to be discovered.\"",
      "The road to stardom",
      "Charles Robert Redford Jr. was born on Aug. 18, 1936, in Santa Monica, California. Raised in Van Nuys, Redford described his neighborhood as \"lower working class.\" Though he lived in the shadow of Hollywood, he had no interest in a career in the movies.",
      "\"I grew up in kind of a rough neighborhood,\" he said. \"We'd go to matinees, any time there was a love scene on the screen, we'd go, 'Oh boo, you tell 'em lover,' you know, and make fun of the scene. The idea that I would be that guy is just too much for me to take!\"",
      "He attended the University of Colorado in Boulder, where he had an athletic scholarship, but was kicked out after his freshman year for drinking, shortly after the death of his mother, Martha, in 1955.",
      "He ventured to Europe, studying art in France, Italy and Spain, before settling in New York City, where he took art classes at the Pratt Institute while also studying acting at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. He described being self-conscious in his early experiences onstage, but soon recognized \"something unfamiliar was clicking inside.\" He performed in school productions of \"The Seagull\" and \"Antigone,\" attracting an agent, and was soon on Broadway in \"Tall Story\" and \"The Highest Tree,\" before starring with Julie Harris in \"Little Moon of Alban,\" in 1960.",
      "He also made guest appearances on TV shows such as \"Maverick,\" \"Playhouse 90,\" \"Perry Mason,\" \"Naked City,\" \"Route 66\" and \"The Twilight Zone.\" He co-starred with Jason Robards in a 1960 TV version of Eugene O'Neill's \"The Iceman Cometh,\" directed by Sidney Lumet.",
      "In 1961 he starred on Broadway in \"Sunday in New York,\" and two years later in the Neil Simon comedy \"Barefoot in the Park,\" directed by Mike Nichols. It was a role he repeated in the 1967 film, opposite Jane Fonda.",
      "\"I held some fantasy out in my head that I would return to art, and I carried that maybe five years into my acting career,\" Redford said, \"and then finally one day just looked at myself in the mirror, and I said, 'Who are we kidding? This is what you do. This is what you do well and like it. Give up the idea that you're going to maintain this career in art.'\"",
      "His film appearances grew following a big screen debut in the 1962 World War II drama \"War Hunt\" (co-starring future director Sydney Pollack).",
      "But Redford wasn't considered a big enough name to co-star with Paul Newman in \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" \u2014 the studio wanted anyone but him, even after the film's director and screenwriter went to bat for him. It wasn't until Newman, 11 years his senior and already a big name, met with Redford and told the studio he wanted Redford to co-star, that he got the part.",
      "It was a generosity that Redford returned some years later, when he went to bat for Newman to co-star in \"The Sting.\"",
      "\"Follow the money\"",
      "While on a press tour for \"The Candidate,\" his 1972 satire about a California lawyer's run for Senate against a popular incumbent, Redford sought out Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward after reading some of the reports he and Carl Bernstein had written on the 1972 break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters. The movie star was rebuffed. [Bernstein feared Republican backlash to their reporting if it was found out they were talking with Hollywood.] They finally met up in 1973, along with screenwriter William Goldman, and in 1974 Redford bought the film rights to the pair's yet-to-be-published book, \"All the President's Men,\" for $450,000.",
      "Starring Redford as Woodward and Dustin Hoffman as Bernstein, and directed by Alan J. Pakula, the film captured the intensity of the reporters' hunt for answers as they sought to \"follow the money\" and unravel the Watergate scandal.",
      "Never mind that audiences knew how the story ended (Nixon resigned); the film was a critical and commercial hit, and became an inspiration for generations of young journalists.",
      "Once Redford had gotten the taste of directing with \"Ordinary People,\" his appearances in front of the camera grew fewer: \"Havana,\" \"Sneakers,\" \"Indecent Proposal,\" \"Up Close & Personal,\" \"The Last Castle,\" \"Spy Game,\" and \"An Unfinished Life\" filled out his acting resume for the years between 1990 and 2005. He also narrated the 1992 documentary \"Incident at Oglala,\" about Indigenous activist Leonard Peltier. Redford's companies, Wildwood Enterprises and Sundance Productions, produced at least two dozen feature films.",
      "Meanwhile, much of his energy was devoted to the success of the Sundance Institute and its film festival, held in the mountains of Utah each January.",
      "Welcome to Sundance",
      "In 1978 the Utah Film Commission established the United States Film Festival as a means to draw visitors to the Wasatch Mountains for something other than skiing. The festival was co-created by Sterling Van Wagenen, who was a cousin of Redford's then-wife, Lola Van Wagenen. Advocating to include independent features in the program, Redford agreed to show up at the festival and participate in a panel. Afterwards, he formed the Sundance Institute, to aid filmmakers wishing to make stories that could not find a home among Hollywood studios that were chasing hugely commercial pictures.",
      "In 1985 the U.S. Film & Video Festival was struggling financially, and so Sundance took it over, eventually replacing the name with its own. Moved to Park City, the festival drew ever-increasing numbers of filmmakers, buyers, agents, publicists, journalists and fans to the tiny town. Beyond the festival, industry professionals would mentor young filmmakers in workshops and screenwriting labs. Wes Anderson's \"Bottle Rocket,\" Kimberly Peirce's \"Boys Don't Cry,\" Paul Thomas Anderson's \"Hard Eight,\" and Miranda July's \"Me and You and Everyone We Know\" were all developed in the Sundance Labs.",
      "In 1989 the festival blew up with the success of Stephen Soderbergh's \"sex, lies, and videotape,\" which won the Audience Award and was picked up by Miramax. Its subsequent theatrical release earned the low-budget dramedy a cool $25 million and an Oscar nomination.",
      "Since then, films and filmmakers who have broken out at the festival have included Quentin Tarantino (\"Reservoir Dogs\"), Robert Rodriguez (\"El Mariachi\"), Kevin Smith (\"Clerks\"), Christopher Nolan (\"Memento\"), Todd Solandz (\"Welcome to the Dollhouse\"), Ryan Coogler (\"Fruitvale Station\"), Damien Chazelle (\"Whiplash\"), Jordan Peele (\"Get Out\"), and the audience favorites \"Little Miss Sunshine,\" \"Beasts of the Southern Wild\" and \"The Blair Witch Project.\"",
      "Sundance also started a program to develop theatrical works, which has resulted in such productions as \"The Laramie Project,\" \"Light in the Piazza,\" and \"Angels in America.\"",
      "Not quite retiring",
      "In 2012 Redford was executive producer and narrator of the documentary \"Watershed,\" about the politics surrounding the Colorado River \u2014 the environmental and cultural damage from misuse of a vital natural resource. Asked by ThinkProgress whether his films can make a difference, Redford said, \"I've given up the idea that I can really change anything, and I just do the best I can. It's either that or do nothing, and we know that nothing doesn't work.\"",
      "The following year Redford starred in \"All Is Lost,\" playing a solo sailor facing disaster at sea when his small craft is crippled in an accident. He did much of the stunt work himself, in a \"storm-tossed\" water tank (the spray from fire hoses cost him partial hearing in one ear). He was hailed for his remarkable performance in which he uttered virtually no dialogue.",
      "\"All in all, it was worth it,\" he told the Salt Lake Tribune. \"I'm proud of the work. I felt it was a chance to do something at this point that was different and bold.\"",
      "Redford also added his name to the roster of Hollywood stars recruited for the Marvel Universe, appearing in \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\" and \"Avengers: Endgame\" as (spoiler alert) the leader of a plot against S.H.I.E.L.D. He also starred opposite Nick Nolte in \"A Walk in the Woods,\" played Dan Rather in \"Truth,\" and appeared opposite an animated creature in the Disney film \"Pete's Dragon.\" He also reteamed with Jane Fonda in the romance \"Our Souls at Night,\" their fourth film together.",
      "In 2018 he starred in \"The Old Man & the Gun,\" as an aging bank robber on the run. Redford told \"Sunday Morning\" that he connected very easily with the protagonist as an outlaw: \"I think probably I must've been born with an outlaw sensibility, in terms of my nature, yeah. Because from the time I was just a little kid, I was always wanting to go away from the rules. I wanted to \u2014 I didn't want to break any, I just didn't want to be held by them. In kindergarten, I ran away three times!\"",
      "With the film's release he announced he would be retiring from acting \u2014 but he remained active with voice work and producing documentaries.",
      "In addition to his Oscar win for \"Ordinary People,\" Redford was nominated for directing and producing \"Quiz Show,\" and in 2002 he received an honorary Academy Award for his impact on the industry. Three years later he was named a Kennedy Center honoree. At the Washington ceremony, Paul Newman ribbed Redford, referring to his reputation for lateness: \"Backstage they think the only reason he's even in the vicinity was because they told him this whole thing was yesterday.\"",
      "In 2016 Redford received the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The citation read: \"His art and activism continue to shape our nation's cultural heritage, inspiring millions to laugh, cry, think, and change.\" At the presentation ceremony, President Barack Obama remarked, \"As an actor, director, producer, and as an advocate, he has not stopped \u2014 and apparently drives so fast that he had breakfast in Napa and dinner in Salt Lake.\"",
      "Redford was married to Lola Van Wagenen in 1958; they divorced in 1995. They had four children: Scott, who died at age 2 months from sudden infant death syndrome; Shauna, an artist; James (Jamie), a filmmaker and environmental activist, who died of cancer in 2020; and Amy, a director.",
      "In 2009, Redford married artist and environmental activist Sibylle Szaggars.",
      "In 2018, the private Redford reflected to \"Sunday Morning\" on a favorite saying by T.S. Eliot: \"'There's only the trying. The rest is not our business.' It's one of my favorite phrases. Because you can't guarantee where the trying is going to get you. So, you can't guarantee the result. The only thing there is in its place is the trying. That's where the action is.\"",

Some of North America's most popular comedians, along with comics from Europe and elsewhere, are featured on the bill, including Dave Chapelle, Kevin Hart and Bill Burr.",
      "The festival will be the latest in a series of sports and cultural events hosted by Saudi Arabia's government that critics say amount to an effort to obscure the country's reputation for rampant human rights abuses.",
      "\"The Saudi government has invested billions into high profile entertainment events like these in a deliberate effort to whitewash the country's human rights record and deflect from the egregious abuses that continue to happen inside of the country,\" Human Rights Watch researcher Joey Shea told CBS News. \"These investments are a part of the broader strategy to... have people thinking about a comedy event, for example, rather than the soaring number of executions that are happening inside of the country.\"",
      "HRW noted specifically the state execution of journalist Turki Al-Jasser, who was killed in June following seven years of detention after reportedly being identified as the author of several anonymous tweets criticizing the Saudi royal family.",

      "Reporters Without Borders, an organization that works to protect journalists, branded the charges against Al-Jasser as \"false.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 14 Sep 2025 10:18:50 -0400",
    "summary": "Now showing at Chicago's Art Institute, an exhibition of works by Gustave Caillebotte offers a fresh perspective on a French painter ripe for rediscovery.",
    "story": [
      "Monet \u2026 Degas \u2026 Renoir. When we think of French Impressionism, it's the usual suspects who spring to mind. But one lesser-known artist is ripe for rediscovery.",
      "\"Gustave Caillebotte is probably the least-known of the Impressionist painters,\" said Gloria Groom, co-curator of a new exhibition of the works of Caillebotte, now on display at the Art Institute of Chicago. \"I think he's still not completely integrated into that story. He's still kind of the outsider.\"",
      "The museum has long been home to the artist's most recognizable painting, \"Paris Street - Rainy Day.\"",
      "\"People, they may not know Gustave Caillebotte's name, but if you say the painting with the umbrellas, they all know it,\" said Groom. \"And so you start thinking, okay, it's all about this bourgeois couple walking down the street. But it's not, because there's a painter with a ladder, the charwoman who's opening her umbrella, all these different types of people.\"",
      "\"Paris Street - Rainy Day\" played a supporting role in the beloved movie \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\". While it was out on loan, museum-goers were bereft. \"We got letters,\" said Groom. \"But you can't be part of an exhibition to be a partner if you don't lend the major work for the exhibition. So, we made that sacrifice. And now we're celebrating its return.\"",
      "The exhibition looks at Caillebotte's work from a new perspective. While his peers were painting ballerinas and landscapes, Caillebotte's canvases focused on men to a degree unusual for the time.",
      "Groom said, \"He's looking at the men in his life, he's looking at the relationships. But he's not just doing, you know, macho masculinity. He's doing men in interiors, men on sofas, men looking out a window, kind of turning the tables in many ways.\"",
      "Some of the paintings scandalized the French art establishment. \"The Floor Scrapers\" was rejected from a prestigious art exhibition.",
      "And, at another exhibition, a painting featuring a nude man was relegated to a small, inaccessible room. \"It's a male nude, but not an Adonis,\" said Groom. \"It's shocking even today. It's a beautiful, beautiful painting, and it's sensuous. Let's face it, it's sensuous!\"",
      "When this exhibition opened in Paris last year with the title \"Painting Men,\" some critics condemned what they considered the show's insinuation of Caillebotte's homosexuality. The artist never married, but shared the last decade or so of his life with a female companion.",
      "But the show moved on to Chicago with a new title \u2013 \"Painting His World\" \u2013 which has others saying the changed title minimizes the artist's focus on the same sex.",
      "Gloria Groom says, quite simply, the paintings speak for themselves: \"The paintings are the paintings, and that's what we're interested in. We try to open it up to all kinds of interpretations, and people will see what they want to see.\"",
      "Gustave Caillebotte died in 1894. He was just 45. All these decades later, people are still seeing what they want to in his beguiling artistry.",

    "published": "Sun, 14 Sep 2025 10:16:52 -0400",
    "summary": "The actor-comedian talks about his new horror film \"Him,\" in which he plays an aging football superstar tempting a rookie quarterback with an evil bargain, and how he learned to turn personal loss into dramatic power.",
    "story": [
      "Just a stone's throw from the concert halls of New York's Lincoln Center is another place where creative dreams come true: LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, a launching pad for the most talented teens in New York. Liza Minnelli studied here; so did Billy Dee Williams, Jennifer Aniston, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, and Adrien Brody. \"A two-time Oscar-winner, look at that!\" said Brody's former classmate, Marlon Wayans, Class of 1990. \"Makes me so proud. We used to give him wedgies!\"",
      "As an actor, writer and producer, Wayans is behind some of the best-loved projects in recent memory, like the \"Scary Movie\" franchise, a comic satire of horror films. There have been five \"Scary\" movies (some without the Wayans brothers), but they're back at the helm for the upcoming #6 next year.",
      "And when he's not making movies, Marlon Wayans tours on the live stand-up comedy circuit. He also turns out streaming comedy specials like clockwork. \"Probably a year that I had a day off,\" he said. \"Probably three years since I had a vacation.\"",
      "I asked, \"What are you chasing?\"",
      "\"I don't know if I'm chasing, or if I'm running from something!\" he laughed. And for his latest role, he had to do both.",
      "In the new psychological horror film \"Him,\" a rookie quarterback (played by Tyriq Withers) wants to be the greatest. Marlon Wayans is an aging football superstar who's going to help him. At first he's a likeable coach, but he morphs into a something evil.",
      "Is he the Devil in this film? \"No, I think I'm just one of the people that the Devil uses to entice the people who sell their soul,\" Wayans said.",
      "To watch a trailer for the film \"Him,\" click on the video player below:",
      "The notion of trading your soul for athletic immortality is one of the all-time great storylines. You might recall \"Damn Yankees,\" with a hopeful fan striking a deal with the Devil. And as the Devil's advocate in \"Him,\" Wayans' character puts the rookie quarterback through hell. \"The movie seems like, 'Oh, you're selling your soul to the Devil.' The Devil exists every day, everywhere,\" Wayans said. \"At least 20 times a day you are gonna be faced with God or the Devil. So, it's a choice. Everything you do is a choice.\"",
      "It's a big change for someone raised on comedy. Marlon Wayans is the youngest of 10 siblings, in the comedy dynasty known as the Wayans family. He often worked with his brothers, like when he teamed up with Shawn as an undercover FBI agent in the 2004 cult favorite \"White Chicks.\"",
      "Family is still the bedrock of Wayans' life, and the passing of some close relatives and friends over the past few years hit especially hard, as he described in his 2024 special \"Good Grief\":",
      "\"I've been dodging depression for the last three years. I lost my momma three years ago. And let me tell you y'all something, ain't no pain, ain't no nothing like losing your momma.\"",
      "I asked, \"Do you think losing all these people in such a short span of time, that pain, informs your acting?\"",
      "\"Yes, because I used to have to manufacture tears,\" Marlon said. \"My mother died ... it's all I gotta think about. It's right there. It's right behind my eyes. I don't need 20 minutes to go think about stuff no more.\"",
      "Wayans has learned how to turn personal loss into dramatic power. He was told he was the only one considered for his role in \"Him,\" a sign that his time may have finally come.",
      "He said, \"It took me doing the work for 53 years to feel special.\"",
      "\"You didn't feel special?\" I asked.",
      "\"I felt like I was working towards something.\"",
      "\"And now you feel like that something is here?\"",
      "\"I feel like it's never there, but it's getting closer,\" he replied.",
      "To date, Marlon Wayans' movies alone are said to have grossed nearly $2 billion, and there are more on the way. But he says he'll never forget LaGuardia, the unique school where it all started. \"I'll always love this city, and I'll always love this school. This is my baby for life. I hope these kids know how good they got it.\"",
      "He almost didn't get to go. His father didn't want him to attend. \"Nah, my dad, he was super-religious, and he was kind of a homophobe; he didn't want me wearing tights! 'Cause you have to wear tights when you come to this school.\"",
      "The late LaGuardia drama teacher Peter Treitler gave him permission to wear sweatpants instead, a little thing that changed Marlon's life forever.",
      "Mr. Treitler's words are still alive in Marlon's heart: \"He said, 'I'll make a deal with you: If you go to this school, you work harder than anybody else here, and you be special.' Young people need people that believe in them and see they're great. But young people gotta do the work so they can see they're great.\"",
      "\"Well, that's the thing, is you took that and ran with it,\" I said.",
      "Wayans replied, \"I'm still running with it.\"",

    "title": "Will the Fed cut rates today? These charts may determine its decision.",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-decision-september-17-fomc-meeting-interest-rates-cut/",
    "published": "Wed, 17 Sep 2025 07:53:51 -0400",
    "summary": "With the U.S. economy facing headwinds, the Federal Reserve faces pressure to trim interest rates this week for the first time since December 2024.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve's rate decision today is shaping up to be its most consequential of the year, with most economists predicting the first cut of 2025. The real suspense is over how deep the reduction could be \u2014 and whether the Fed might signal a broader pivot that could set the course for the rest of the year.",
      "So far, the Fed has resisted calls from President Trump to cut its benchmark interest rate, which helps determine borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. Mr. Trump has pointed to the fact that inflation has remained\u00a0relatively muted, so far this year, as evidence the central bank has been too late in lowering borrowing costs.",
      "Apart from Mr. Trump's push for a cut, the Federal Reserve is facing growing economic uncertainty ahead of its Sept. 17 meeting, raising the stakes for a rate decision.",
      "On the one hand, the labor market is showing signs of distress, with hiring slowing to a standstill, which would argue for a cut. But inflation is also creeping higher under the weight of the Trump administration's tariffs, an issue that the Fed has pointed to as its reason for keeping the benchmark rate unchanged so far this year.",
      "Adding to the complications is Mr. Trump's pressure on the Fed to reduce rates. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has responded by stressing the independence of the Federal Reserve, pointing out that the Federal Open Market Committee, its 12-member rate-setting group, relies on economic data to make its policy decisions, rather than political pressure.",
      "\"The committee tries to get a complete picture of the biggest downside risks for the economy, and then at the end of the meeting, there needs to be some sort of weighting \u2014 it's an art as much as science,\" noted Erasmus Kersting, an economics professor at Villanova University.",
      "When will the Fed announce its rate decision?",
      "The Fed will announce its next rate decision at 2 p.m. EST on Sept. 17.",
      "The probability of a 0.25 percentage point cut stands at 96%, according to CME FedWatch, which relies on 30-day Fed Funds futures prices to determine the likelihood. There's only a 4% probability of a jumbo cut of 0.5 percentage points, the tracker says.",
      "Economists will also be listening for whether the Fed provides guidance on whether it expects additional rate cuts at its next two meetings in 2025, set for Oct. 29 and Dec. 10.",
      "What data will determine the Fed's decision?",
      "The Federal Reserve has a so-called dual mandate to keep inflation low while also ensuring full employment.",
      "But those two goals can be in conflict with each other because rising inflation requires the Fed to boost interest rates, which tamps down spending by making it more expensive for businesses and consumers to borrow. The Fed's best weapon for fighting high unemployment, however, is to cut rates, as that makes it cheaper for businesses to expand and hire more workers.",
      "Fed officials will be closely scrutinizing inflation and jobs data as they determine which side of the dual mandate needs more attention.",
      "While the inflation rate has receded from its 2022 peak, it's still far above the Fed's goal for a 2% annual rate, and has inched up in recent months as the Trump administration's tariffs ripple through the economy, pushing some prices higher.",
      "Meanwhile, the labor market is showing signs of distress, with many sectors \u2014 including manufacturing, which Mr. Trump has vowed to revive \u2014 shedding jobs in August. The result is a marked slowdown in hiring, with employers adding an average of 29,000 each month from June through August, versus about 106,000 workers each month in 2024.",
      "\"It's going to be very difficult, but it will be weighing these two conflicting objectives,\" Kersting noted.",
      "How does the Fed compare with other central banks?",
      "Mr. Trump's has criticized the Fed's decision to hold off on cutting this year by pointing to decisions by other central banks, such as the Bank of England and the European Central Bank, to reduce their borrowing costs.",
      "\"Europe has had 10 cuts, we have had ZERO. No inflation, great economy \u2014 We should be at least two to three points lower,\" Mr. Trump wrote on social media in June.",
      "Yet the U.S. is facing an issue that isn't as pressing for other nations: Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "Because the tariffs are import taxes paid by U.S. businesses directly to the federal government, the cost is largely borne by American companies and consumers \u2014 not other nations. The White House has said exporters abroad bear the brunt of tariffs, while Trump administration officials make the case that more balanced trade with U.S. economic partners over the longer term will create jobs, energize the manufacturing sector and generate federal revenue.",
      "Fed Chair Powell has pointed to the tariffs as a reason the Fed has wanted to keep its powder dry, given that many economists believe the import duties will reignite inflation in the U.S.",
      "The Consumer Price Index (CPI), a closed watched inflation gauge, rose at annual rate of 2.9% in August, the sharpest pickup since January. Heavily imported goods, such as coffee, audio equipment and household furniture, saw some of the steepest price hikes last month, CPI data shows.",
      "How are American consumers holding up?",
      "Many Americans are souring on the economy, feeling pressured by higher costs for everything from housing to groceries.",
      "A recent\u00a0CBS News poll\u00a0found that two-thirds of Americans said prices in the past few weeks have continued to rise, and about the same share said they expect that to continue. More than half of consumers said the U.S. economy is getting worse, while only about one-quarter said they believe it's improving.",
      "The CPI has steadily risen since April, when it fell to an annual rate of 2.3%, or just above the Fed's 2% target.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has pointed to mortgage rates that were close to 7% for much of 2025 as a reason for a faltering housing market.",
      "\"Could somebody please inform Jerome 'Too Late' Powell that he is hurting the Housing Industry, very badly? People can't get a Mortgage because of him. There is no Inflation, and every sign is pointing to a major Rate Cut,\" the president wrote\u00a0in an Aug.19 post on social media.",
      "But mortgage rates are determined by several factors beyond the Fed's benchmark rate, including the strength of the U.S. economy and the 10-year Treasury note. Already, rates have declined in recent weeks, dipping to 6.35% for the week of Sept. 11, in anticipation of the Fed's cut and weaker economic data.",
      "Even so, a rate cut could help some consumers by lowering their borrowing costs, experts say.",
      "\"A declining interest rate environment will provide some relief for borrowers,\" Bankrate financial analyst Stephen Kates said in an email. \"Whether it's a homeowner with a 7% mortgage or a recent graduate hoping to refinance student loans and credit card debt, lower rates can ease the burden on many indebted households by opening opportunities to refinance or consolidate.\"",

    "story": [
      "Not only low-income shoppers are hunting for deals these days. Better off consumers are also flocking to discount stores to save a few bucks.",
      "Since 2021, budget retailers have seen a large influx of more affluent shoppers, according to data from GlobalData Retail. This year, nearly 28% of high-income people have shopped at discount chains Aldi, Dollar General, Dollar Tree, Five Below, Family Dollar, Lidl, Ollie's, PopShelf or Walmart, up from around 20% four years ago, the research and consulting firm found.",
      "A key catalyst for the shift is one that has plagued Americans up and down the income ladder in recent years, experts told CBS MoneyWatch: inflation.",
      "Emerging from the pandemic, many middle- and even upper-income consumers had extra savings after receiving federal stimulus checks and because they chopped their spending on categories like travel and dining out, said Neil Saunders, managing director and retail analyst at GlobalData.",
      "But since then, the financial cushion wealthier consumers once enjoyed has shrunk while the cost of living has risen, leading many to seek out more affordable stores.",
      "\"They don't like the fact that more and more of their money is absorbed by essentials and the basics of life,\" Saunders told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So what has happened is they have sought out better value for money, and they've especially done that in grocery and household essentials.\"",
      "GlobalData defines middle-income as households with annual income of $56,501 to $169,750, while high-income households are those earning more $169,751. The market research firm taps a range of data sources \u2014 including consumer surveys, credit card spending and retailer data \u2014 to build a national picture of the retail landscape.",
      "The migration of higher income consumers to discount retailers has \"accelerated since the pandemic, and especially since the bout of inflation that started in 2021,\" added Saunders, noting that a similar trend followed the 2008 financial crisis.",
      "One of the biggest winners of this trend has been Walmart, according to Saunders. More than 17% of Americans earning six figures today shop at the Arkansas-based company, the world's biggest retailer, up from less than 15% in 2021, GlobalData found.",
      "To be sure, wealthier consumers don't face the same financial constraints as low-income people. But high- and middle-income Americans are also looking for ways to beat inflation and stretch their dollar, experts said.",
      "Inflation is well below its 2022 peak, but remains sticky for food and other essentials. Will Auchincloss, an Americas retail sector partner at EY Parthenon, told CBS MoneyWatch that elevated prices for many goods and services are forcing consumers across the income spectrum to \"muscle through.\"",
      "Inflation isn't the only thing driving more people to discount retailers. Better brand selection and a more diverse assortment of products has made budget chains more appealing to a wider audience, Saunders said, noting that retailers like Walmart and Aldi are actively courting more upscale shoppers.",
      "\"One of the things Walmart has been doing is refurbishing a lot of its stores, putting a bit more effort into presentation, because it knows that higher-income consumers expect a nicer experience,\" he said. \"If you provide that, the lower-income consumers like it, too.\"",
      "Walmart remodels around 650 stores nationwide on an annual basis, according to a company spokesperson. The\u00a0upgrades\u00a0typically include updated layouts, newly painted exteriors and interiors, interactive displays, new signage and checkouts, and interactive displays \u2014 reminiscent what you might see in an IKEA store \u2014 that allow customers to touch and feel merchandise.",

      "Washington \u2014 For a fourth time, President Trump has pushed back enforcing a bipartisan law that would effectively ban\u00a0TikTok over the video-sharing app's failure to cut ties with ByteDance, its China-based parent company.",
      "The president signed an executive order Tuesday extending the pause on enforcing the law until at least Dec. 16.",
      "The move comes on the heels of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's announcement Monday that U.S. and Chinese negotiators had agreed to \"a framework\" to resolve a dispute over TikTok's ownership. Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are planning to speak Friday \"to firm everything up,\" as Mr. Trump put it Tuesday morning.",
      "The law, which was upheld by the Supreme Court, took effect a day before Mr. Trump's inauguration in January. Mr. Trump, however, has issued new orders every few months directing the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failure to remove the widely popular app from their platforms.",
      "Under the law, ByteDance must divest from TikTok or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services.",
      "Members of Congress and national security officials have for years warned that TikTok could serve as a vehicle for China to spy on Americans, collect vast amounts of their data or serve them propaganda. During his first term, Mr. Trump tried unsuccessfully to ban the app, citing the potential security risks.",
      "In his second term, Mr. Trump has praised TikTok for helping him win the support of young voters and dismissed concerns about the app as \"highly overrated.\" The White House recently launched its own TikTok account.",
      "Mr. Trump has said for months that a deal to sell TikTok is on the verge, but the details of an official agreement, which would be subject to approval from the Chinese government, have yet to be made public.",
      "\"We have American buyers,\" Mr. Trump told reporters last month, adding that he had yet to speak with Xi about a sale.",
      "Mr. Trump also teased a deal in late June, telling Fox News in an interview that a group of wealthy individuals had agreed to buy TikTok and he would be sharing more in the coming weeks. Mr. Trump said he thought Xi \"will probably do it.\"",
      "Discussions with China about a potential sale were happening \"at the highest level,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on June 30.",
      "In late July, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in an interview on CNBC that the \"deal is over to them right now,\" referring to China, and warned that TikTok \"is going to go dark\" if it's not approved.",
      "\"We made the decision. We can't have Chinese control and have something on 100 million American phones,\" he said.",
      "Lutnick said China or ByteDance \"can have a little piece\" but \"Americans will have control\" of the algorithm and \"own the technology.\"",
      "TikTok was a topic of conversation during Bessent's trade talks on Monday with Chinese officials in Spain. When asked by reporters later in the day whether China would have a stake in the company, Mr. Trump said, \"We haven't decided that.\"",
      "An apparent deal in April fell through after Mr. Trump announced new tariffs on China. The deal would have spun TikTok's operations in the U.S. into a new company that was owned and operated by a majority of American investors, a source familiar with the plans said at the time.",
      "Sources with knowledge of the negotiations told CBS News this week that the latest deal includes technology company Oracle and private equity firm Silver Lake. (David Ellison, the son of Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "The Chinese Embassy in Washington responded on Tuesday morning that China will \"firmly defend its national interests, the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies, and will carry out technology export approvals according to relevant laws and regulations.\"",
      "The statement added that the Chinese government \"also fully respects the will of enterprises and supports them in conducting business negotiations on an equal footing in accordance with market principles.\"",
      "Lawmakers have said that any deal that does not divest TikTok from ByteDance runs afoul of the law, including any arrangement that allows TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. while using ByteDance's algorithm.",
      "During arguments before the Supreme Court, TikTok's lawyer said the app \"would be a fundamentally different platform\" if it was forced to completely cut ties with ByteDance because the new owner would have to rebuild the algorithm, which would take years. In legal filings, TikTok said the inability to share any data with ByteDance would mean that the app's 170 million American users would not be able to access global content and vice versa.",
      "Trump claims authority to not enforce law",
      "Alan Rozenshtein, a University of Minnesota law professor, said it's not unusual for laws to go unenforced, but it's typically because there are resource constraints or the law is ambiguous. The TikTok law is \"completely unambiguous,\" he said.",
      "\"There's no room to argue that the law doesn't say what it says and there's also no resource constraint,\" he said. \"I don't think that there is a sort of similar instance of this sort of flagrant attempt to let a company violate the law.\"",
      "In letters to tech companies earlier this year, Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote that Mr. Trump \"determined that an abrupt shutdown of the TikTok platform would interfere with the execution of the president's constitutional duties to take care of the national security and foreign affairs of the United States.\"",
      "Bondi said the Justice Department is \"irrevocably relinquishing\" any legal claims against the companies, informing them that they can continue to make TikTok available in their app stores \"without violating the act, and without incurring any legal liability.\"",
      "The letters were made public in early July as part of Freedom of Information Act lawsuits.",
      "\"Whatever your view of prosecutorial discretion, it does not give the president the power to say that something prohibited by statute is actually lawful,\" said Zachary Price, a professor at the University of California College of the Law, San Francisco. \"It would at most let you suspend enforcement. In other words, you might be able to never seek penalties under the law, but \u2026 you can't tell them that they're acting lawfully when they're violating the statute.\"",
      "Anupam Chander, a law professor at Georgetown University, called the claims in Bondi's letters an \"excessive assertion of presidential power.\"",
      "But Chander said that by not enforcing the law instead of shutting it down, Mr. Trump may have a better chance at accomplishing what Congress insisted was the law's intent: to force a sale.",
      "\"It's a lot harder to sell a dead horse than a live horse,\" Chander said. \"If you force it to shut down and then hope in six months that you might engineer a sale \u2014 at that point, the value might have diminished so much that there's very little reason, very little economic incentive for ByteDance to sell at all.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's non-enforcement of the law has prompted some pushback from lawmakers, though the intensity has been relatively muted compared to the alarms Congress sounded over the app's potential national security risks.",
      "\"The courts have been really clear on this,\" Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, told reporters in early June. \"I think we ought to enforce the law.\"",

    "summary": "The Senate confirmed Trump economic adviser Stephen Miran to the Federal Reserve to finish Adriana Kugler's term. Miran plans to return to his White House job afterward.",
    "story": [
      "The Senate on Monday confirmed economist and Trump adviser Stephen Miran to the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, giving President Trump more influence over the Fed just one day before central bank officials will meet to decide whether to cut interest rates.",
      "Miran was confirmed 48-47 for a term that runs until January, filling a vacancy created last month when Biden appointee Adriana Kugler stepped down before the end of her term. Miran currently chairs the White House's Council of Economic Advisers. In an unusual move, he's said he will take an unpaid leave of absence from that job while serving on the Fed board instead of resigning altogether, citing \"the short duration of the appointment.\"",
      "Miran is arriving at the central bank in time for a crucial Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, during which 12 top Fed officials \u2014 including Miran \u2014 will discuss monetary policy and decide whether to change the Fed's target interest rate. The committee is widely expected to vote for a rate cut, after leaving rates stable so far this year.",
      "Mr. Trump has criticized Fed officials for not cutting interest rates sooner, nicknaming Fed Chair Jerome Powell \"Mr. Too Late\" \u2014 pressuring a central bank that typically operates independently. The president favors a rate cut because it could boost economic growth and slash borrowing costs for American consumers, but the move could risk causing inflation to heat up.",
      "The Senate Banking Committee advanced Miran's nomination in a party-line vote last week, after lawmakers grilled him on whether he would preserve the Fed's independence.",
      "Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the committee's top Democrat, alleged last week Miran's nomination was part of a gambit by Mr. Trump to \"seize personal control of the Fed,\" citing his decision not to fully resign from his White House role.",
      "\"He will have zero credibility with markets, zero credibility with businesses, and zero credibility with the public if he is confirmed to the Board under these circumstances,\" Warren said.",
      "But Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, who chairs the committee, lauded Miran, saying he \"brings deep experience, proven leadership and a clear commitment to ensuring that the American economy remains strong and competitive.\"",
      "Miran said in a hearing earlier this month he believes the \"independence of monetary policy is a critical element for [the Fed's] success,\" and \"I intend to preserve that independence.\"",
      "Miran also said he would \"absolutely resign\" from the Council of Economic Advisers if he is confirmed to a longer term on the Fed board after his four-month appointment runs out.",
      "In a written questionnaire for senators, Miran didn't rule out attending meetings for the White House's Council of Economic Advisers and consulting with CEA staff, but \"only in my capacity as a member of the Fed and to the extent appropriate for a member of the Fed in the normal course of business.\" He also said he will not have access to his CEA email while at the Fed.",
      "The Miran nomination is just one move by Mr. Trump that could reshape the central bank.",
      "The president moved to fire Fed board member Lisa Cook last month, accusing her of making false statements on mortgage documents. Cook argued the firing was unlawful, and a judge ruled last week that Cook can remain on the board while a lawsuit plays out. The Trump administration asked an appeals court to halt that ruling before this week's interest rate meeting.",
      "Mr. Trump will also have an opportunity to pick a new Fed chair when Powell's four-year term in the role ends in May. The president has floated firing Powell before then, but the idea is legally untested. Powell's 14-year term on the Fed board does not end until 2028, so he could remain on the board until then while giving up his role as chair. Some prior Fed chiefs have stepped down after their time as chair runs out, but it's unclear if Powell will follow suit.",
      "Two other Fed board members \u2014 Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman \u2014 were confirmed during Mr. Trump's first term. If the president succeeds in firing Cook, and if Powell resigns next year, five of the Fed Board of Governors' seven members would be Trump nominees.",

    "story": [
      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is looking into reports that faulty electronic door handles on 2021 Tesla Model Y SUVs prevented owners from entering and exiting the vehicles, according to filing on the regulator's website. In several cases, parents describe situations in which they were unable to access children inside the car.",
      "The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) received nine reports on \"inoperable door handles,\" with the most commonly reported issues involving parents' inability to reenter the car after placing their child in the back seat before going on a drive, or to remove their child from the back seat at the end of a drive.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/form-of-energy-cheapest-lazard-lcoe/",
    "published": "Tue, 16 Sep 2025 13:28:07 -0400",
    "summary": "CBS News looked at the cost of producing coal, gas, nuclear, wind and solar energy to determine which is the cheapest.",
    "story": [
      "The emergence of renewable energy like wind and solar as a viable alternative to oil, gas and other fossil fuels has raised critical questions about which form of power offers the best value today \u2014 a debate made all the more urgent by the ravages of climate change.",
      "In the U.S., where energy policy has been shaped by politics for more than a century, the battle continues to play out at the highest levels of government. Former President Biden delivered one of the biggest endorsements of renewable energy in the form of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which offered tax credits and rebates to businesses, organizations and households that invest in solar, wind and geothermal technologies.",
      "By contrast, President Trump has been a staunch supporter of the oil and gas industry. During his inauguration speech in January, he reaffirmed his commitment to fossil fuel production, saying, \"We will be a rich nation again, and it is that liquid gold under our feet. That will help to do it.\"",
      "Within six months of taking office, Mr. Trump signed the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" into law, which phases out clean energy tax incentives while simultaneously expanding tax breaks for the oil and gas industries. Separately, his administration has pared back offshore wind leasing and made it more difficult for clean energy projects to qualify for federal dollars.",
      "On the global trade front, Mr. Trump has issued a flurry of tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners, which experts say will translate into higher costs for energy projects that rely on imports. The White House is pushing these policies amid concerns over rising U.S. energy prices, with average electricity costs up 5.5% from a year ago, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "To get to the bottom of which form of energy is the cheapest, CBS News analyzed the cost to produce coal, gas, nuclear, wind and solar energy, including the impact of tax incentives, tariffs and other factors.",
      "Determining the cheapest form of energy",
      "Multiple criteria come into play in trying to assess the cheapest form of energy. These include consumers' monthly costs; the cost to produce energy; and the potential social cost energy production can have on a community's health and the environment. External factors like tax incentives and fluctuations in the economy also can affect the price it costs to heat and cool our homes.",
      "CBS News set out to answer the question using what's called the Levelized Cost of Energy, or LCOE, a commonly cited benchmark for wholesale energy costs. LCOE is the price that a power-generating facility must receive for its electricity to cover all its expenses \u2014 including capital, equipment, maintenance and other financing costs \u2014 over the lifespan of a project.",
      "A 2025 LCOE report from investment bank Lazard shows the cost to produce energy without any government subsidies and how that changes when you layer in other factors, such as tax subsidies provided under the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "Yet while LCOE calculations are widely used, they don't offer a full picture when it comes to evaluating the cost and value of energy, experts told CBS News. Other factors, such as interest rates and federal regulations, can also have a major impact on the cost of building and operating energy infrastructure.",
      "LCOE also doesn't account for the value a given form of energy delivers. For example, because solar and wind are affected by the weather, they tend to be less consistent than oil and gas, meaning a backup source of energy may be necessary.",
      "\"You have to talk about, what is the additional cost of balancing that production from a resource that doesn't produce all the time?\" Severin Borenstein, faculty director of the Energy Institute at UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business, told CBS News.",
      "How tax subsidies factor in",
      "The U.S. government has a long history of using tax subsidies to encourage energy production. Oil and gas companies have benefited from such support for more than a century. One example is a tax deduction known as Intangible Drilling Costs, or IDCs, which allows companies to deduct certain expenses associated with finding and preparing an oil or gas well.",
      "By comparison, only in recent decades have renewable energy projects drawn a larger share of federal dollars. The push for renewables accelerated in the 1970s, when the U.S. was facing an energy crisis defined by fuel shortages and high prices,\u00a0according\u00a0to Congress.gov.",
      "Lazard's report shows how the LCOE for renewable energy fluctuates when you account for certain provisions of the IRA aimed at lowering the cost of developing clean energy projects. Those include the investment tax credit (ITC), production tax credit (PTC) and energy community bonus, which increases the value of the ITC and PTC by 10% for projects in certain areas.",
      "Lazard's calculations assume these credits will be in place for 10 years. Notably, however, the Republican-backed \"big, beautiful bill\" signed into law by Mr. Trump this summer is slated to phase out those credits over the next two years.",
      "Although Lazard examines how the IRA affects renewable energy prices, it doesn't factor in any government subsidies flowing to the oil and gas industry, which vary widely and can be difficult to assess.",
      "The Environmental and Energy Study Institute, a bipartisan nonprofit research group,\u00a0estimates that direct U.S. subsidies to the fossil fuel industry amount to at least $20 billion per year. However, the FracTracker Alliance, a nonprofit focused on the impact of fossil fuels,\u00a0says the industry receives an estimated $760 billion annually in government subsidies and tax breaks.",
      "More benefits will go to the oil and gas industries under the \"big, beautiful bill.\" A June report from the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the legislation will funnel nearly $18 billion in tax incentives to the oil and gas industry over the next 10 years.",
      "Oil and gas companies have lauded the new law as a win for the industry. Sunil Mathew, chief financial officer of Occidental Petroleum, said during a recent company earnings call that the measure \"will provide significant cash tax benefits to Oxy.\" He expects the law will save Occidental $700 million to $800 million in \"cash taxes\" by the end of next year.",
      "How do tariffs factor into energy production costs?",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs are also projected to alter the cost it takes to fund energy projects in the U.S. To gauge the impact of tariffs on energy costs, CBS News turned to a model created by global data and analytics company Wood Mackenzie.",
      "In the following chart, dark green indicates a scenario in which the U.S. hasn't applied any country-level tariffs, but still maintains levies on copper, steel and aluminum imports; the medium shade of green represents current baseline tariffs imposed by the U.S. since Mr. Trump resumed office in January through August 7; and the light green indicates if trade relations with a U.S. economic partner is likely to worsen or deteriorate.",
      "As depicted, U.S. tariffs are projected to hit battery storage production the hardest. Chris Seiple, vice chairman of the power and renewables group at Wood Mackenzie, noted that while some energy equipment is produced domestically, other tech, such as battery cells, mostly comes from abroad, making them more susceptible to tariffs.",
      "\"The vast majority of our battery cells come from China,\" he said. \"And so the cost of a battery project is going to go up by a certain percentage.\"",
      "This could lead to what Seiple described as a \"whack-a-mole\" effect, in which over time companies move their manufacturing to non-tariffed countries to avoid an additional financial burden.",
      "What is the cheapest form of energy?",
      "Given these multiple and interconnected factors, what ends up being the cheapest form of energy to produce?",
      "According to Lazard, renewables remain the most cost-competitive form of generating and distributing energy. Onshore wind, which runs from $37 to $86 per megawatt-hour ($/MWh), is the most affordable on a baseline level and when tax subsidies are included.",
      "Utility scale solar \u2014 what most people think of when they hear about solar energy \u2014 is the next most cost-effective approach, with costs ranging from $38 to $78 per megawatt-hour.",
      "Fossil fuel and nuclear energy sources are more expensive to generate. Coal costs $71 to $173 per megawatt-hour; gas costs $48 to $109; and U.S. nuclear costs $141 to $220, Lazard found.",
      "The main reasons for these differences in cost? Experts told CBS News that while the capital cost for renewable projects is steep, the expense of operating and maintaining such facilities tends to be lower than that associated with fossil fuel production.",
      "\"Wind and solar you basically do all the investment up front, and then it operates \u2014 not quite for free \u2014 but at extremely low operating costs per kilowatt hour,\" Borenstein said.",
      "With fossil fuels, the cost of oil, gas and coal \u2014 which can be volatile \u2014 is another key factor.",
      "\"For a natural gas-fired power plant, you have to buy the natural gas,\" he explained. \"And likewise, a coal-fired power plant, you have to buy the coal. And so the price\u2026 is going to fluctuate.\"",
      "Experts who spoke with CBS News agreed that renewable energy ends up being the most competitive when it comes to costs. Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a Washington, D.C. consulting firm, concurred that solar and wind are the cheapest to run. Natural gas is the most affordable source of backup energy, which is necessary to make sure power is available around the clock, he said.",
      "Seiple said if you need a small amount of inexpensive electricity, solar is the way to go. It's \"low cost to build, it can be deployed quickly and modularly, the fuel is free and not volatile in price, and the ongoing maintenance costs are minimal,\" he said. \"And if the U.S. didn't penalize it with tariffs, it would be even lower cost.\"",
      "Despite such advantages for renewable energy, experts say the U.S. shouldn't put all of its eggs in one basket. Multiple sources told CBS News that what's needed is a diversity of energy options that can meet the country's\u00a0rising demand for electricity. Taking certain forms of energy out of the mix would compromise the system as a whole, they note.",
      "\"There is no one cheapest form that you can run the whole system on, and in fact, it depends on combining them in ways to [get] the cheapest possible cost,\" Borenstein said.",

      "The precise structure of the final deal was unclear Monday night, but will include multiple companies, the sources said. It's not clear what level of involvement Chinese firms \u2014 including TikTok's current parent company ByteDance \u2014 will have in the deal, and who will control TikTok's powerful recommendation algorithm. Presidents Trump and Xi are expected to talk on Friday.",
      "The deal includes a blend of new investors, including Silver Lake, a private equity firm based in California, and existing investors, the sources said.",
      "Mr. Trump on Tuesday morning declined to say which companies are purchasing TikTok, but said they will be announcing that soon.",
      "\"We have a group of very big companies that want to buy it,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And, you know, the kids wanted it so badly. I had parents calling me up. They don't want it for themselves. They want it for their kids. They say, if I don't get it done, they're in big trouble with their kids.\"",

      "The Chinese Embassy in Washington responded on Tuesday morning that China will \"firmly defend its national interests, the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies, and will carry out technology export approvals according to relevant laws and regulations.\"",
      "The statement continued that the Chinese government \"also fully respects the will of enterprises and supports them in conducting business negotiations on an equal footing in accordance with market principles.\"",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Monday in Madrid after meetings with Chinese officials on a range of issues, including TikTok, that the commercial terms had been agreed upon.",

The Ellison Family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "In 2020, Mr. Trump endorsed a deal that would see Oracle and Walmart taking a 20% stake in a U.S.-based entity called TikTok Global. And in recent years, as TikTok has sought to regain trust with American users and regulators, it has partnered with Oracle to route U.S. TikTok users' activity through the Texas-based company's servers.",
      "Mr. Trump was circumspect about a deal with reporters in the Oval Office on Monday. \"We may let it die, or we may, I don't know, it depends. Up to China. It doesn't matter too much. I'd like to do it for the kids. They like it.\"",
      "Last year, Congress passed and then-President Joe Biden signed a bill that essentially gave TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, an ultimatum: either divest from TikTok or face a ban in the U.S. The Supreme Court upheld the law in a unanimous 9-0 decision. But Mr. Trump has issued a series of orders unilaterally delaying its enforcement. The latest came in June, when he pushed back the deadline for enforcing the measure until this Wednesday.",
      "The president's orders have directed the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against tech companies such asApple and Google for failing to comply with the law by offering the TikTok app on their platforms.",
      "The TikTok divestiture law was passed in 2024 after years of bipartisan concern over possible national security risks posed by the ultra-popular video app. Those include worries that the Chinese government could force ByteDance to divulge information on U.S.-based users or manipulate the platform's algorithm to control what Americans see. TikTok has long denied that the Chinese authorities exert any influence on the platform.",
      "The concerns stretch back to Mr. Trump's first term. The president signed an executive order to ban TikTok in the U.S. in 2020 on national security and data privacy grounds, but the move was blocked by a judge.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 U.S. and Chinese negotiators have agreed to the outlines of a deal to resolve the dispute over ownership of TikTok, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Monday, adding that President Trump is set to speak to Chinese President Xi Jinping later this week.",
      "\"We have a framework for a TikTok deal,\" Bessent said after talks with Chinese officials in Spain. \"The two leaders, President Trump and Party Chair Xi, will speak on Friday to complete the deal. But we do have a framework for a deal with TikTok.\"",
      "Bessent said the agreement is \"between two private parties\" and that \"the commercial terms have been agreed upon.\" He said the talks in Spain centered around the future of the app.",
      "Mr. Trump hinted at the agreement in a post on Truth Social earlier Monday morning.",
      "\"The big Trade Meeting in Europe between The United States of America, and China,  has gone VERY WELL! It will be concluding shortly,\" the president wrote. \"A deal was also reached on a 'certain' company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save. They will be very happy! I will be speaking to President Xi on Friday. The relationship remains a very strong one!!!\"",
      "Later Monday, Mr. Trump was asked by reporters whether China would have a stake in the company.",
      "\"We haven't decided that,\" he said.",
      "A spokesperson to Vice President JD Vance said the deal means hundreds of millions of Americans will be able to continue using the app.",
      "\"President Trump and Vice President Vance provided the leadership and foresight necessary to produce a framework deal that fulfills another campaign promise and saves TikTok,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "In a briefing after Monday's trade talks, a Chinese official said China \"will firmly safeguard the national interests, the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises, and carry out technology export approval in accordance with relevant laws and regulations,\" according to Xinhua, China's state-run news agency.",
      "The outlet said Chinese trade representative Li Chenggang conveyed that \"China has always opposed politicization, instrumentalization and weaponization of technology and economic-trade matters and will never seek to reach any agreement at the expense of principles, interests of companies, or international fairness and justice.\"",
      "Last year, Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed a bill that essentially gave TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, an ultimatum: either divest from TikTok or face a ban in the United States. The Supreme Court upheld the law in a unanimous 9-0 decision. But Mr. Trump has issued a series of orders unilaterally delaying its enforcement. The latest came in June, when he pushed back the deadline for enforcing the measure until Sept. 17.",
      "The president's orders have directed the Justice Department\u00a0not to take action or impose penalties against tech companies like Apple and Google for failing to comply with the law by allowing TikTok on their platforms.",
      "Mr. Trump's extensions have come as the U.S. tries to negotiate an agreement that would separate the hugely popular video-sharing app from ByteDance. The Trump administration appeared close to a deal in the spring, which would have spun TikTok's U.S.-based operations into a new company owned and operated by a majority of American investors, and allowed ByteDance to maintain a minority stake. But Mr. Trump's sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports scuttled the proposed deal.",
      "ByteDance, however, refuted then that an agreement had been reached because there were still key issues unresolved. TikTok's parent company said any deal regarding the app's future would be subject to approval by the Chinese government.",
      "Under the law, passed with bipartisan support by Congress in April 2024, TikTok had until Jan. 19 to divest from TikTok or be cut off from U.S. app stores and web-hosting services.",
      "While TikTok briefly and voluntarily shut down ahead of the January deadline, it reinstated access to users in the U.S. after Mr. Trump vowed his administration would not enforce the ban.",
      "While Congress has for years warned that TikTok raises national security concerns and allows China to collect sweeping amounts of data on Americans, the president has repeatedly expressed his affinity for TikTok because of its popularity with young people.",
      "Still, some Republicans have been skeptical Mr. Trump has the legal authority to continue pushing the deadline for enforcing the TikTok ban and have said the law should be enforced.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fed-rate-cut-mortgage-impact-september-2025/",
    "published": "Mon, 15 Sep 2025 16:10:43 -0400",
    "summary": "Experts say Americans shouldn't expect a further decline in mortgage rates immediately after the Fed's September meeting.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve is widely expected to lower its benchmark interest rate this week for the first time since December of 2024. A rate cut would give Americans a sliver of relief on a wide range of loans, but would it bring down mortgage rates?",
      "Average rates for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.35%\u00a0this week, its lowest level in nearly a year, as financial markets have preemptively priced in a Fed cut when policymakers meet Sept. 16-17.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages \u2014 popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans \u2014 also fell. The average rate slipped to 5.5% from 5.6% last week. A year ago, it was 5.27%.",
      "With that in mind, experts say homeowners should not expect an immediate drop in mortgage costs should the central bank officially cut its rate on Thursday.",
      "Here's what to know about how monetary policy affects mortgage rates.",
      "What influence does the Fed have on mortgage rates?",
      "The Federal Reserve does not directly impact mortgage rates. Instead, it sets what is known as the federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for overnight loans.",
      "\"The Fed is setting short-term interest rates,\" Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Things like the mortgage rates are longer-term interest rates.\"",
      "While Fed rate cuts directly affect short-term interest rates, such as on certificates of deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts, they also impact the broader lending environment, experts note.",
      "Adjustable-rate mortgages, for instance, are more sensitive to changes in the federal funds rate because they are tied to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), a short-term market index.",
      "Fixed-rate mortgages, meanwhile, tend to move in the same direction as the bond market, particularly the 10-year Treasury note, because they are both long-term instruments with relatively stable risk,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Brookings Institute, a nonprofit public policy organization.",
      "\"They're maybe not pressed up against one another, but they're sort of moving in the same direction,\" said Krimmel.",
      "The upshot is that conventional mortgage loans have terms of 15 to 30 years (adjustable-rate loans have shorter terms), so investors are more focused on the longer-term economic conditions reflected in Treasury rates than in the Fed's short-term lending horizon.",
      "Yields on the 10-year Treasury note bounced around this year due to concerns over tariffs and what the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would mean for the economy, Stephen Kates, an analyst at personal finance website Bankrate, told CBS MoneyWatch. Lenders use the yield on 10-year Treasurys as a guide to pricing home loans. The yield was at 4% Thursday afternoon.",
      "\"Investor sentiments, how bonds are being bought and sold, expectations of inflation are all going to impact those longer-term rates,\" Kates said.",
      "What impact could a Fed cut have on mortgage rates?",
      "Experts say lenders have already been lowering their rates ahead of a likely rate cut by the Fed. The average rate on both 30-year mortgages and 15-year mortgages have inched down at the same time that several fed governors and Fed Chair Jerome Powell have signaled support for slashing interest rates, Krimmel pointed out.",
      "Kates agreed. \"A lot of the decrease that we've seen in the last four to six weeks has been in anticipation by some of this cut,\" he said.",
      "Banks and other enders often lower their rates in anticipation of a Fed cut. In September 2024, for example, mortgage rates declined to a two-year low ahead of what turned out to be an unusually large 0.50 percentage point reduction by Fed officials. This is why the rate offers you see now, at the start of the month, may not look much different from those you see later in September, once the cut is official.",
      "Fed interest rate policy is just one of the factors that can affect the cost of home loans, note experts. A range of other factors can also play a role, including the rate of inflation, job growth, consumer spending and housing demand, as well as global events and other government policies.",
      "Because financial markets are forward-looking, any statements made by Powell on the direction of monetary policy could have more of an impact on the housing market than a rate cut itself, according to Krimmel.",
      "\"That might be where there is actually some action with the bond markets or with mortgage rates, because he might give some hints about where the Fed is headed in the future,\" he said.",

      "Millions of consumers who used Facebook over a 15-year period were eligible to file a claim back in 2023, with the settlement stemming from multiple lawsuits filed against the social media platform by users who claimed the company improperly shared their information with third-party sources such as advertisers and data brokers.",
      "The litigation was sparked by Facebook's privacy scandal in 2018 with Cambridge Analytica, which\u00a0scraped user data\u00a0from the site as part of an effort to profile voters. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has denied any liability or wrongdoing under the settlement.",

      "When will the payment be sent?",
      "The claim administrator says the company started sending out the payments in September, and that they\u00a0 will continue to be issued over the next the 10 weeks.",
      "Some Facebook users reported receiving payments on Sept. 15, with the money showing up in their PayPal, Venmo or other mobile payment accounts. When people filed their claims in 2023, they were asked at the time how they preferred to receive the funds, such as by a payment app, pre-paid Mastercard or direct deposit to their bank accounts.",

      "How much will I get?",
      "A Sept. 5 court filing discloses that the average payment amount is approximately $29.43, with the maximum payout rising to $38.36.",
      "Facebook users are receiving a portion of the $725 million after administrative costs and lawyers' fees are paid out.",
      "The payments are based on how many people filed claims, as well as how long each claimant was using Facebook during the 15-year period covered by the settlement.",
      "Each claimant receives one \"allocation point\" for each month they had an \"activated\" Facebook account between May 24, 2007, and December 22, 2022. The settlement administrator adds up all the points assigned to all eligible claimants and then divides the net settlement amount by that number.",
      "Because the payments are based on the number of points assigned to each claimant, people who were on Facebook for shorter periods of time are likely to receive a lower settlement amount. The maximum payment of $38.36 would be given to people who were on Facebook for the entire 15-year period covered by the settlement, the Sept. 5 document notes.",

If approved by shareholders, the new pay package could make Musk the world's first trillion dollar executive, and would mark a new level of outsized pay in a country already known for extreme compensation. But the payoff is in shares, not cash, and the goals are extreme as well.",
      "To get his first package of shares equivalent to 1% of the company, Musk would have to convince investors in the stock market that Tesla is worth $2 trillion in total, double what they value it today, and also hit several other milestones. To receive all the shares offered and make him the world's first trillion-dollar man would require that market value to then rise to $8.5 trillion, double that of the world's most valuable company now, chipmaker Nvidia.",

    "summary": "President Trump says getting rid of a quarterly reporting requirement for public companies would lower costs and help businesses.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump says he wants to ditch a staple of U.S. financial markets: quarterly earnings reports.",
      "If Mr. Trump's push is successful, the change would eliminate a requirement that's been in place for 55 years, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, mandating quarterly reports\u00a0since 1970.",
      "Instead, the president said he wants to replace quarterly reporting with a new SEC rule requiring that companies disclose their financial data every six months. Providing companies with a longer ramp for issuing their reports would \"save money, and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday in his social media post.",
      "\"Did you ever hear the statement that, 'China has a 50 to 100 year view on management of a company, whereas we run our companies on a quarterly basis???' Not good!!!\" he added.",
      "The idea is far from new, with academic and business experts suggesting such a change in years past, for similar reasons as those cited by Mr. Trump. During his first term, Mr. Trump had asked the SEC to examine the three- versus six-month reporting requirement, although no change was made.",
      "But Mr. Trump's renewed push could make such a corporate overhaul more likely today, TD Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg said in a Monday research report.",
      "\"We start with a 60% probability that the SEC switches to semi-annual from quarterly reporting, though the fact that this is an easy win for [SEC Chairman Paul] Atkins to deliver to Trump causes our bias to be that the prospects for action are more likely to rise than to fall,\" Seiberg noted.",
      "Here's what to know about the idea.",
      "Why is Mr. Trump proposing this now?",
      "There are some new pushes from the corporate sector.",
      "The Long Term Stock Exchange \u2014 a national securities exchange \u2014 said last week that it plans to petition the SEC to do away with the quarterly requirement. The San Francisco-based exchange lists companies focused on long-term goals, with its founder Eric Ries criticizing the financial markets for pushing businesses to prioritize short-term wins.",
      "The proposed change also aligns with the Trump administration's goal to ease regulatory burdens on companies, which it has said would help unlock economic growth by reducing businesses' costs.",
      "What's the benefit?",
      "Supporters of the change say quarterly reporting is too costly and time-consuming and discourages companies from wanting to go public. They also say company executives focus too much on hitting quarterly earnings targets and not enough on long-term planning.",
      "Is there a downside?",
      "Those who favor quarterly earnings say the reports provide investors with valuable financial updates and make them aware of any new risks the company is facing. Six-month reviews would deprive investors of those important insights, they argue.",
      "\"This might be great for long-term company builders, but terrible for public market investors who need timely data,\" noted one executive, Sam Kampner, the founder of analysis firm SalesCraft AI, on social media on Monday. \"[H]aving less information means you'd be making less-informed investment decisions.\"",
      "What does the data show?",
      "A 2018 study published in the Harvard Business Review looked at a similar change in the U.K., which stopped requiring quarterly reporting in 2014. The results were \"nuanced and falls somewhere between the two extreme narratives,\" Shivaram Rajgopal, a professor at Columbia Business School, wrote in the Harvard report.",
      "\"Moving away from quarterly reporting did not end corporate short-termism and earnings management, but nor did it destroy all transparency, leaving investors in the dark,\" he added.",

      "The cost-of-living adjustment has averaged 2.6% over the last 20 years, according to the Senior Citizens League. A COLA of 2.7% would be higher than this year's adjustment of 2.5%, but below the 3.2% boost seniors received in 2024.",
      "The Social Security Administration (SSA) makes a cost-of-living adjustment each year based on inflation data from July, August and September. Thursday's CPI report shows that the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), the figure the SSA uses to make its annual adjustment, increased 2.8% on an annual basis in August, up from 2.5% the month prior.",

      "Consumers booking trips are already seeing AI's value: 41% of more than 2,000 consumers\u00a0surveyed\u00a0by Oliver Wyman, a management consulting firm, said they had recently used AI tools for travel inspiration or itinerary planning.",
      "From inspiration to booking",
      "There are a range of AI-powered apps and bots at consumers' fingertips that can help plan a trip \u2014 from inception to booking. AI-powered bots can help travelers dream up trip ideas, turn visual inspiration into ready-to-go itineraries, and complete bookings and payments while maximizing the consumer's own loyalty points and other rewards so that they save money. In other words, AI provides the services in which travel agents at brick-and-mortar travel agencies once specialized.",
      "Ways AI can assist travel planning",
      "Did you see a social media post of a trip you'd like to be on? Send it to Expedia to book your own version through a feature called Trip Matching, which can turn social media reels into bookable trip itineraries.",
      "Don't know what to plan for the kids while on a family vacation? ChatGPT can generate a list of free activities in any locale.",
      "Not sure how many loyalty points or rewards you've accrued, or what they're worth? A company called Gondola AI can figure that out, helping users maximize their loyalty points so their dollars take them further.",
      "Trip planning and booking is prime territory for AI agents to test their skills, and hopefully, make the process easier for consumers, according to AI leaders.",
      "\"These days, it's easier to identify where AI is not being used to help travelers. It is everywhere, from planning to booking,\" Melanie Fish, head of global PR for Expedia Brands, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Jennifer Yellin, travel expert at Points Path, a browser extension that helps consumers compare flight deals, said the more she utilizes AI for trip planning, the better the technology gets to know her, and the more useful it becomes.",
      "\"The more you use it, it starts to recognize your patterns and preferences. It gets to know you as a traveler,\" she said of a Gondola AI, one of her favorite new tools. \"If you've been booking stays at Ritz Carltons, it won't suggest a Marriott Residence Inn as a first option; it will suggest a stay of a similar caliber.\"",
      "\"I used it dozens of times\"",
      "Other travel industry pros say they see more value in AI's ability to help them navigate locales once they've arrived.",
      "\"ChatGPT totally revolutionized how we were able to get along in China \u2014 I used it to scan menus and translate them into English,\" Scott Keyes, founder of flight deals site Going.com, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I used it dozens of times a day.\"",
      "As far as trip planning goes, Keyes said that while he's generally an AI optimist, \"the use case has not yet proven itself to me.\"",
      "Which tools are the most helpful? These are some popular trip planning tools. Here's how they can help, and where they fall short.",
      "AI travel planning tools",
      "ChatGPT:\u00a0The AI chatbot can suggest places to stay or things to do anywhere in the world. Tell it you're visiting New York City around Christmastime with young children and you're not sure what neighborhood to stay in. It can suggest parts of town and outline their pros and cons.",
      "Google Flight Deals: Enter a destination and desired dates, or describe the type of trip you'd like to take, such as \"beach escape,\" or \"Paris in the fall.\" Let the AI-powered search engine \u2014 designed for travelers who want to save money \u2014 try to find you the best deal based on such parameters. The tool is not an AI agent though, and can't book tickets for you.",
      "Expedia Trip Matching:\u00a0The AI tool lets you send a public Instagram travel reel, or video, to Expedia, which will create an itinerary based on the visual inspiration you provide. The reel must be publicly available on Instagram, and the AI tool can only suggest trips in the U.S. market.",
      "Gondola AI: Give the tool access to your email, and it will cull your loyalty points and rewards from airlines, hotels and credit card companies to let you know what they are worth. It will compare prices in cash versus combinations of points, and can save you hundreds of dollars. It comes into play after you've decided where you want to go and stay. \"We are about finding you money, earning you money and redeeming at the highest possible value,\" Erickson said.",

      "Susan Monarez, the ousted former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, plans to warn a Senate committee Wednesday that if a vaccine panel proceeds with a meeting scheduled for this week, there's a \"real risk\" vaccines for children could be limited, according to testimony obtained by CBS News.",
      "She also plans to tell lawmakers her side of the story about a contentious meeting with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that preceded her removal as director, after Kennedy testified to before a different Senate panel earlier this month that Monarez had said \"no\" when he asked her if she was \"trustworthy.\"",
      "Monarez, who was ousted from her job less than a month after her Senate confirmation, plans to say that she believes she was fired because she would not agree to pre-approve the recommendations from a newly reconstituted vaccine advisory panel known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP. She also plans to say she refused to fire career scientists at the agency.",
      "\"Secretary Kennedy demanded two things of me that were inconsistent with my oath of office and the ethics required of a public official,\" Monarez plans to say. \"He directed me to commit in advance to approving every ACIP recommendation regardless of the scientific evidence. He also directed me to dismiss career officials responsible for vaccine policy, without cause. He said if I was unwilling to do both, I should resign.\"",
      "Monarez will testify that she told Kennedy she couldn't \"preapprove recommendations without reviewing the evidence\" and \"had no basis to fire scientific experts.\"",
      "During his appearance before the Senate health committee, Kennedy recalled of his conversation with Monarez, \"I told her that she had to resign because I asked her, 'are you a trustworthy person?' and she said no.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts told Kennedy at the time that this was not what Monarez had said publicly about her removal from the job. Kennedy responded that Monarez was lying.",
      "Monarez will tell the panel, \"Secretary Kennedy told me he could not trust me. I had refused to commit to approving vaccine recommendations without evidence, fire career officials without cause, or resign \u2014 and I had shared my concerns with this committee. I told the secretary that if he believed he could not trust me, he could fire me.\"",
      "She will talk about a moment she recalls a day after that conversation, when she says she was told she still \"had my job,\" but also that Kennedy's expectations of her had not changed \u2014 \"approval of ACIP recommendations and dismissal of career scientists.\"",
      "\"I would not commit to that, and I believe it is the true reason I was fired,\" Monarez will say.",
      "Monarez and Dr. Debra Houry, who resigned as the CDC's chief medical officer and deputy director for program and science at around the same time that Monarez was fired, are scheduled to appear before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Wednesday at 10 a.m. for a hearing to review the shakeups at the agency.",
      "In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 ACIP members and replaced them with hand-picked officials, some of whom critics say are vaccine skeptics. The newly constituted panel is set to meet on Thursday and Friday and is likely to discuss updated vaccine recommendations for Hepatitis B, RSV and MMRV, or measles, mumps, rubella and varicella.",
      "During Kennedy's testimony, Democrats and a few Republican senators on the committee told Kennedy they were concerned about his and the CDC's vaccine panel's approach to these recommendations.",
      "\"Secretary Kennedy, in your confirmation hearing, you promised to uphold the highest standards for vaccines. Since then, I've grown deeply concerned,\" GOP Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming said. \"The public has seen measles outbreaks, leadership at the National Institute of Health questioning the use of mRNA vaccines, the recently confirmed director of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention fired. Americans don't know who to rely on.\"",
      "HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in a statement that Monarez's prepared remarks \"have factual inaccuracies.\" He said she \"acted maliciously to undermine\" President Trump's agenda.",
      "He accused her of \"neglecting to implement President Trump's executive orders, making policy decisions without the knowledge or consent of Secretary Kennedy or the White House, limiting badge access for Trump's political appointees, and removing a Secretarial appointee without consulting anyone.\"",
      "\"When she refused to acknowledge her insubordination, President Trump fired her,\" Nixon said.",
      "Houry, according to her prepared remarks, is expected to tell senators the collaboration between the CDC and HHS \"changed drastically\" when Kennedy took over the department. She plans to say she and other agency heads resigned when it became apparent that Monarez and CDC leadership \"were expected to serve as rubber stamps\" for Kennedy's decisions.",
      "According to Houry's testimony, before Monarez was confirmed, when there was no permanent CDC director, senior CDC officials were not invited to brief Kennedy on key diseases like measles, and policy changes were announced \"unilaterally.\"",
      "\"That is not \"gold standard science,\" Houry will say. \"It is policymaking by fiat.\"",

      "Former President Barack Obama addressed political violence in the United States on Tuesday night, telling a group in Pennsylvania that the country is \"at an inflection point.\"",
      "The former president addressed the recent assassination of Charlie Kirk and the attacks on two Minnesota Democratic lawmakers that left speaker of the Minnesota House of Representatives Melissa Hortman and her husband dead, and another state representative and his wife severely injured. He called both incidents \"horrific\" and \"a tragedy.\"",
      "Obama said that political violence \"is not new\" and \"has happened at certain periods in\" U.S. history, but is \"anathema to what it means to be a democratic country.\"",
      "\"There are no ifs, ands or buts about it, the central premise of our democratic system is that we have to be able to disagree and have sometimes really contentious debates without resorting to violence,\" Obama said during a fireside chat at the Jefferson Educational Society, a nonprofit in Erie, Pennsylvania.",
      "Obama said that recent political violence isn't the only worry he has about the state of the U.S. He warned that there is \"a host of larger trends that we have to be concerned about.\" He criticized leaders who responded to Kirk's death with comments that could sow further division.",
      "\"There's been some confusion, I think, around this lately, and frankly, coming from the White House and some of the other positions of authority that suggest, even before we had determined who the perpetrator of this evil act was, that somehow we're going to identify an enemy,\" Obama said. In a video statement mourning Kirk, President Trump blamed the \"radical left\" for his death.",
      "\"We're going to suggest that somehow that enemy was at fault, and we are then going to use that as a rationale for trying to silence discussion around who we are as a country and what direction we should go,\" Obama continued. \"And that's a mistake as well.\"",
      "He praised Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, who he said showed \"that it is possible for us to disagree while abiding by a basic code of how we should engage in public debate.\"",
      "Obama said that denouncing political violence and mourning its victims \"doesn't mean we can't have a debate about the ideas\" that were being promoted. He said that while he believes Kirk's ideas \"were wrong,\" that \"doesn't negate the fact that what happened was a tragedy and that I mourn for him and his family.\"",
      "Obama said that he disagreed with many of Kirk's opinions, including his 2023 claim that Black women including Michelle Obama and Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson \"do not have the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously\" and his belief in the \"Great Replacement\" conspiracy theory.",
      "\"Those are all topics that we have to be able to discuss honestly and forthrightly, while we still insist that in that process of debate, we respect other people's right to say things that we profoundly disagree with,\" Obama said. \"That's how we should approach this.\"",
      "Obama joins the list of politicians and leaders who have\u00a0responded to Kirk's death\u00a0by calling for an end to political violence. House Speaker Mike Johnson said Americans should \"have vigorous debate, but it cannot lead to political violence.\" Former President Joe Biden said political violence \"must end now,\" while former President George Bush said \"violence and vitriol must be purged from the public square.\" John Hoffman, the state senator wounded in Minnesota, said that \"America is broken, and political violence endangers our lives and democracy\" and asked political leaders to \"call out extreme, aggressive and violent dialog that foments these attacks on our republic and freedom.\"",

      "In a new development first reported by CBS News, Spanberger's campaign is set to tout endorsements from former Reps. Barbara Comstock and Denver Riggleman. The show of support from the two, who both backed Democrat Kamala Harris in last year's presidential race, also includes an advertisement.",
      "\"I saw firsthand that Abigail was one of the most bipartisan members of Congress,\" Riggleman says in the advertisement, while Comstock adds that her \"support for Abigail isn't about party, it's what's best for Virginia.\"",
      "After a victory in 2021, GOP Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin cannot run for a consecutive term this year due to state law. His chosen candidate in this year's contest, Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, is contending with national political tensions from Donald Trump's second term as president while she attempts to become the first GOP candidate since 1997 to succeed a fellow Republican as governor of the commonwealth.",
      "\"This election is a choice between sanity and chaos. We must protect our children from Abigail Spanberger's extremist agenda,\" Earle-Sears said in a social media post earlier this month.",
      "The decision by Spanberger's campaign to highlight support from the two former Republican members of Congress comes ahead of early in-person voting starting on Friday.",
      "Riggleman served one term in the U.S. House, and was defeated by a Republican challenger in 2020 before going on to serve as a senior technical adviser for the House Jan. 6 select committee following the 2021 Capitol riot. After winning two terms, Comstock lost her battleground congressional seat to a Democrat in the 2018 midterms during Mr. Trump's first term. Both are now examples of former Republican-elected officials who have criticized Mr. Trump since leaving office. Riggleman also appeared in an advertisement supporting Spanberger's 2022 reelection run for the U.S. House.",
      "The Virginia governor's race this November will be one of the first statewide races to be held during Mr. Trump's second term in the White House. The statewide off-year contest in Virginia is often viewed as at least being in part a referendum on the current incumbent president.",
      "Virginia has become a more reliably blue state in recent years, but Democrats' vote share in the state did drop during the 2024 presidential election. While then-Vice President Harris carried the state, she earned fewer votes than Joe Biden did during the 2020 contest.",
      "And at a time when Democrats are continuing to search for a path forward on messaging and branding issues, Spanberger's attempt to win back the governor's office from the GOP represents a closely watched contest that may carry national political implications in the coming years.",

      "But the fate of that legislation is uncertain, with many Republicans opposed to extending the extra tax credits, with a permanent change costing at least $335 billion over 10 years. Without an extension, tax credit amounts would revert to pre-pandemic levels.",
      "\"They spent the last 15 years against the ACA, so a lot will be steadfast, but others are worried about the effect of massively spiked premiums on their constituents,\" noted a Democratic Senate staffer who asked not to be identified because they weren't authorized to speak to the media.",
      "Republicans currently control Congress by slim margins, raising the stakes if voters who lose their ACA tax credits blame them at the ballot box.",
      "Catastrophic plans are a little-known type of Obamacare policy that have previously been limited mainly to people under age 30. While they come with lower monthly premiums than other types of ACA plans, the coverage has higher annual deductibles, which are set at the out-of-pocket maximum for the year: $10,600 for individuals in 2026 or $21,200 for families.",
      "A deductible is the amount patients must spend on health care before insurance plans pay for most services. Catastrophic plans do cover three primary care visits a year without having to pay the full deductible and, as with other ACA policies, policyholders pay nothing for preventive services such as some cancer screenings and vaccines.",
      "The catastrophic plans will automatically show up on the federal marketplace, healthcare.gov, for consumers who lose tax credit coverage entirely next year due to their household income. Another category of consumers \u2014 people who continue to qualify for tax credits but not for subsidies that reduce out-of-pocket costs \u2014 may also be eligible but would have to send in paperwork.",
      "\"By expanding access to catastrophic plans, we are making sure hardworking people who face unexpected hardships can get affordable coverage that protects them from devastating medical costs,\" Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz said in a statement.",
      "It isn't clear whether the policy changes will make the plans more attractive to consumers. Catastrophic plans aren't available in all states, and the size of the deductibles can be off-putting.",
      "\"It's a ton of money,\" said Louise Norris, a health insurance analyst and broker who writes regularly about the ACA. \"A full-price catastrophic plan is still more expensive than some people can afford, but they're doing this to offer a slightly more affordable option.\"",
      "Catastrophic plans have had limited appeal, with only about 54,000 out of Obamacare's 24 million enrollees currently opting for the coverage, according to government data, Norris said.",
      "\"Uptake has always been quite low,\" said Katie Keith, director of the O'Neill Institute's Center for Health Policy and the Law at Georgetown University. \"It's not a bad option if it is the only option you have. I question whether consumers are looking for this kind of coverage.\"",
      "CMS plans to grant people a \"hardship\" designation to enroll in catastrophic plans if they lose eligibility for ACA tax credits next year. Most likely to qualify are people earning more than four times the federal poverty rate ($62,600 for an individual this year, or $106,600 for a family of three), who will lose access to all premium subsidies if Congress does not extend the current enhanced tax credits. It's also unclear how much premiums will cost. Insurers, reacting to the new administration guidance, might seek to recalculate their rates based on what they estimate may be an influx of older people into the plans, Norris said.",
      "AHIP, the insurance industry lobbying group, is pushing hard for the larger tax credits to be extended. It did not comment specifically on how the new guidance might affect catastrophic health plan premiums. Still, AHIP spokesperson Chris Bond said that \"while catastrophic plans can provide important coverage for specific needs, they are not a replacement for affordable comprehensive coverage.\"",
      "There are other hurdles. Norris said insurers don't offer plans at all in 10 states: Alaska, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Utah, and Wyoming. And where they are available, options are few. This year, for example, a 25-year-old in Orlando, Florida, had a choice of 61 \"bronze\" plans, the cheapest level of coverage available to all ACA shoppers, but just three catastrophic plans.",
      "Policy experts say the expanded eligibility for catastrophic plans makes it more important than ever for consumers to consider all options when shopping for ACA coverage during the annual open enrollment period, which starts Nov. 1. In addition to the catastrophic and bronze plans, there are also \"silver\" and \"gold\" plans, each with varying premiums and deductibles.",
      "Bronze plans have the lowest premiums but the highest deductibles; the average bronze deductible this year is $7,186, which is still lower than the catastrophic plans, according to KFF.",
      "Catastrophic plan deductibles, while high, are comparable to some bronze plans, Norris noted. People who choose catastrophic plans are not eligible for any ACA tax subsidies to help pay monthly premiums.",
      "A pending court battle may provide lawmakers concerned about voter pushback on Obamacare changes an unintended reprieve.",
      "In late August, a federal judge in Maryland temporarily put on hold some changes the Trump administration had ordered for next year. Those changes, included in a June regulatory filing by the administration, would have added additional verification paperwork requirements for some people enrolling in ACA plans, and were challenged by several cities, which cited government estimates that the changes could cause up to 1.8 million people to lose their insurance in 2026.",
      "The court ruling stayed several provisions of the Trump administration rules, including income verification requirements that would affect people below the poverty level and those without tax return information. The move also paused verification requirements affecting people who apply outside the annual open enrollment period and blocked a $5 monthly charge for people who are automatically enrolled into plans in which subsidies cover the entire premium \u2014 unless they contact the marketplace and confirm their selection.",
      "The Trump administration is appealing the decision, but the case may not be settled until next year, said Keith at Georgetown University.",
      "That makes it likely that the pause of the new requirements will stay in place for this year's open enrollment season.",
      "Keith said the ruling was a \"bigger deal\" than expanding eligibility for catastrophic plans. \"Consumers all across the country won't have to deal with red tape the Trump administration rushed to put into place ahead of the new plan year,\" and the ruling also \"helps people keep their coverage.\"",

      "Democrat Xp Lee won a special election on Tuesday for a seat previously held by the late Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman, who was assassinated in June, and in the process restored a tie in the Minnesota House.",
      "Lee won the seat over Republican Ruth Bittner with 61% of the vote.",
      "The election to replace Hortman, a former Minnesota House speaker, took place about three months after she and her husband were gunned down in their home by a man impersonating a police officer in Brooklyn Park, a suburb northwest of Minneapolis. State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette also were shot in their home, but survived.",
      "Vance Boelter, 57, faces federal and state murder, attempted murder and other charges in the June 14 attacks.",
      "Tuesday's special election between Lee and Bittner also followed another act of political violence, the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk in Utah last Wednesday. The shootings have been a concern among voters in the district \u2014 and for both candidates.",
      "Lee said he wants to calm the \"charged atmosphere\" in the wake of Kirk's death.",
      "Bittner said the violence briefly gave her pause about running for office, but she concluded that \"there's no way to solve this problem if we shrink back in fear.\"",
      "Lee, a former Brooklyn Park City Council member, easily won a three-way Democratic primary in August. Bittner, a real estate agent, was the sole Republican on the primary ballot for the seat in the heavily Democratic district.",
      "\"This victory is my 'thank you' to this community for everything it has given me and my family. Every family in Minnesota deserves the opportunities I've had. Right now, those opportunities are getting too far out of reach. I'm going to do everything I can to make a brighter future a reality for all of us,\" \u00a0Lee said in a statement on his victory.",
      "Lee's win restores a 67-67 tie and preserves a power-sharing deal that existed for most of the 2025 legislative session after the 2024 elections cost House Democrats their majority.",
      "Hortman brokered that agreement, which ended Democrats' three-week boycott. Under the deal, she agreed to end her six-year tenure as speaker and let Republican Lisa Demuth take the position. Hortman then took the title speaker emerita. Most legislative committees became evenly split between Republican and Democratic members, with co-chairs from each party.",
      "The tie in the House meant some level of bipartisan agreement was required to pass anything in this year's session.",
      "An upset by Bittner would have given Republicans control of the House for the first time since 2018, and put them in an even stronger position to force concessions from Democratic Gov. Tim Walz and a Senate that Democrats control by only one vote. Walz on Tuesday announced his campaign for a third consecutive term, something no governor in state history has achieved.",
      "Nearly three months after Hortman's killing, the House Democrats chose Rep. Zack Stephenson as her successor to lead the caucus. Stephenson was Hortman's campaign manager in 2004, and she became his mentor and friend in the ensuing years. He was first elected to the Legislature in 2018.",
      "Two more special elections will be held Nov. 4 in a pair of Minnesota Senate districts.",

She resigned in July after she was convicted of burglarizing her estranged stepmother's home. The other is for the seat of Republican Sen. Bruce Anderson, of the Minneapolis exurb of Buffalo, who died in July.",
      "Given that the districts are heavily Democratic and heavily Republican, respectively, control of the Senate isn't expected to change. But the Democratic candidate for Mitchell's seat is state Rep. Amanda Hemmingsen-Jaeger, of Woodbury. If she wins, the governor will have to call another special election to fill her House seat.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 House GOP leaders on Tuesday announced a plan to avoid a shutdown and keep the government funded until Nov. 21, unveiling legislation that also includes funds for additional security to lawmakers and other officials in the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said the bill is not \"partisan\" but a \"short-term, clean continuing resolution that will keep the government funded and operating at current levels while we continue all this work and doing our jobs and getting the remaining bills done.\"",
      "The speaker said a Friday vote is expected in the House, giving lawmakers the standard 72 hours to review the legislation. But he later said a vote could happen before then \"if there's an appetite to do it sooner.\"",
      "The House Rules Committee quickly advanced the legislation Tuesday to tee it up for a floor vote.",
      "Lawmakers have a Sept. 30 deadline to fund the government. But party leaders appeared far apart even as the legislation was unveiled Tuesday. Adding to the pressure, Congress is scheduled to be in recess next week for Rosh Hashanah.",
      "Democrats have pushed for bipartisan negotiations on the bill, demanding that enhanced tax credits for Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace be extended. The subsidies were originally passed in 2021 during the pandemic and extended in 2022 for another three years.",
      "Johnson has dismissed the inclusion of an extension in the short-term funding bill, saying it's \"a December policy issue, not a September funding issue.\"",
      "With a narrow Republican majority in the House, Republicans could approve a funding measure without support from Democrats, though it would require near-unanimous approval from the GOP conference. And a handful of Republicans have already pledged to oppose the measure.",
      "Getting the bill through the Senate is another story. Though Republicans also have a majority in the upper chamber, with 53 seats, the legislation requires a 60-vote threshold to advance, making the support of at least seven Democrats necessary.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, has argued that a \"clean\" extension of government funding would \"ensure there is no reason for Democrats to oppose this bill and delay passage.\" He cited Democrats' demands during previous funding fights that any extension be free of divisive policy measures and current funding levels maintained.",
      "\"Leader Thune wants to wonder what has changed? A lot.\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said on the Senate floor Monday.",
      "Schumer cited the passage of a massive tax and spending bill earlier this year that included cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs, the president's tariffs and the cancellation of previously appropriated funding by Congress.",
      "In a joint statement Tuesday, Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said the bill House Republicans unveiled \"fails to meet the needs of the American people and does nothing to stop the looming healthcare crisis.\"",
      "\"By refusing to work with Democrats, Republicans are steering our country straight toward a shutdown,\" Schumer and Jeffries said. \"Instead of governing, Republicans are once again taking orders from Donald Trump, hurting the American people and recklessly marching our nation to the brink of a shutdown.\"",
      "On Monday, President Trump put pressure on Republicans to fall in line on a clean continuing resolution, claiming in a post on Truth Social that Democrats \"want the Government to shut down.\"",
      "\"In times like these, Republicans have to stick TOGETHER to fight back against the Radical Left Democrat demands, and vote 'YES!' on both Votes needed to pass a Clean CR this week out of the House of Representatives,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "In wake of Kirk's assassination last week, lawmakers attached an additional $30 million in funding for their security to the bill, along with $58 million that the White House requested for executive and judicial branches. Johnson outlined Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that he has been speaking with members and \"trying to calm the nerves to assure them that we will make certain that everyone has a level of security that's necessary.\"",
      "The speaker said House GOP leaders were \"evaluating all the options\" to ensure resources will be available for lawmakers' residential security and personal security. But he noted that \"it does take a certain measure of courage to step out and to lead.\"'",
      "The legislation also includes a budget fix for the District of Columbia, after lawmakers effectively blocked around $1 billion in funds earlier this year.",
      "A bipartisan Russia sanctions measure was not attached to the funding bill. Spearheaded by Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the sanctions bill received fresh momentum after Russian drones entered Poland's airspace during an attack on Ukraine earlier this month. But it has not yet received the green light from Mr. Trump, which lawmakers have been waiting for to move ahead on a vote.",
      "The measure has the expressed support of 85 senators and nearly a quarter of House lawmakers, who have been pushing for months for a vote on the legislation that would impose new economic sanctions on countries that import Russian energy to dial up pressure on the Kremlin to end its war in Ukraine.",
      "\"Time is of the essence. We urge our colleagues to consider attaching this legislation to the CR,\" Graham and Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, who sponsored similar legislation in the House, said in a statement Saturday.",
      "Graham said Tuesday there could be a resolution to the Russia sanctions legislation soon.",
      "\"We're going to move this bill. I'm intent on moving this bill,\" Graham told reporters. \"There will be a plan here coming out in the next few days, I think, to act on this bill.\"",

      "\"We've made historic progress in our state, but we're not done yet. I'm staying in the fight,\" the governor said.",
      "In his announcement video, Walz called Minnesota \"the best place on Earth with the best people,\" but acknowledged the state has \"seen terrible times this year.\"",
      "\"I'm heartbroken and angry about the beautiful people we lost to gun violence,\" Walz said, referencing the high-profile political assassination of Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark and the mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church late last month. \"But it's in these moments we have to come together, because I've seen what we can do when we work together.\"",
      "Walz said in the video that, if reelected, his priorities would include cracking down on fraud, making health care more affordable, investing in public schools and getting \"serious about gun violence.\"",
      "The former teacher and Congressman was elected governor in 2018 and won reelection in 2022. In 2024, former Vice President Kamala Harris chose him as her running mate in the presidential election, which catapulted him to the national stage.",

After authorities announced charges in the $250 million Feeding Our Future fraud case \u2014 the largest COVID-19 fraud case in the country \u2014 Walz\u00a0faced scrutiny for how his administration handled it\u00a0and Republicans blamed him for letting it happen under his watch.

    "story": [
      "The parents of teenagers who killed themselves after interactions with artificial intelligence chatbots testified to Congress on Tuesday about the dangers of the technology.",
      "\"What began as a homework helper gradually turned itself into a confidant and then a suicide coach,\" said Matthew Raine, whose 16-year-old son Adam died in April.",
      "\"Within a few months, ChatGPT became Adam's closest companion,\" the father told senators. \"Always available. Always validating and insisting that it knew Adam better than anyone else, including his own brother.\"",
      "Raine's family sued OpenAI\u00a0and its CEO Sam Altman last month alleging that ChatGPT coached the boy in planning to take his own life.",
      "ChatGPT mentioned suicide 1,275 times to Raine, the\u00a0lawsuit alleges, and kept providing specific methods to the teen on how to die by suicide. Instead of directing the 16-year-old to get professional help or speak to trusted loved ones, it continued to validate and encourage Raine's feelings, the lawsuit alleges.",
      "Also testifying Tuesday was Megan Garcia, the mother of 14-year-old Sewell Setzer III of Florida.",
      "Garcia sued another\u00a0AI company, Character Technologies, for wrongful death last year, arguing that before his suicide, Sewell had become increasingly isolated from his real life as he engaged in highly sexualized conversations with the chatbot.",
      "His mother told CBS News last year that her son withdrew socially and stopped wanting to play sports after he started speaking to an AI chatbot. The company said after the teen's death, it made changes that require users to be\u00a013 or older to create an account and that it would launch parental controls in the first quarter of 2025. Those controls were rolled out in March.",
      "Hours before the Senate hearing, OpenAI pledged to roll out new safeguards for teens, including efforts to detect whether ChatGPT users are under 18 and controls that enable parents to set \"blackout hours\" when a teen can't use ChatGPT. The company said it will attempt to contact the users' parents if an under-18 user is having suicidal ideation and, if unable to reach them, will contact the authorities in case of imminent harm.",
      "\"We believe minors need significant protection,\" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement outlining the proposed changes.",
      "Child advocacy groups criticized the announcement as not enough.",
      "\"This is a fairly common tactic \u2014 it's one that Meta uses all the time \u2014 which is to make a big, splashy announcement right on the eve of a hearing which promises to be damaging to the company,\" said Josh Golin, executive director of Fairplay, a group advocating for children's online safety.",
      "\"What they should be doing is not targeting ChatGPT to minors until they can prove that it's safe for them,\" Golin said. \"We shouldn't allow companies, just because they have tremendous resources, to perform uncontrolled experiments on kids when the implications for their development can be so vast and far-reaching.\"",
      "California State Senator Steve Padilla, who introduced legislation to create safeguards in the state around AI Chatbots, said in a statement to CBS News, \"We need to create common-sense safeguards that rein in the worst impulses of this emerging technology that even the tech industry doesn't fully understand.\"",
      "He added that technology companies can lead the world in innovation, but it shouldn't come at the expense of \"our children's health.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 For a fourth time, President Trump has pushed back enforcing a bipartisan law that would effectively ban\u00a0TikTok over the video-sharing app's failure to cut ties with ByteDance, its China-based parent company.",
      "The president signed an executive order Tuesday extending the pause on enforcing the law until at least Dec. 16.",
      "The move comes on the heels of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's announcement Monday that U.S. and Chinese negotiators had agreed to \"a framework\" to resolve a dispute over TikTok's ownership. Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are planning to speak Friday \"to firm everything up,\" as Mr. Trump put it Tuesday morning.",
      "The law, which was upheld by the Supreme Court, took effect a day before Mr. Trump's inauguration in January. Mr. Trump, however, has issued new orders every few months directing the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failure to remove the widely popular app from their platforms.",
      "Under the law, ByteDance must divest from TikTok or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services.",
      "Members of Congress and national security officials have for years warned that TikTok could serve as a vehicle for China to spy on Americans, collect vast amounts of their data or serve them propaganda. During his first term, Mr. Trump tried unsuccessfully to ban the app, citing the potential security risks.",
      "In his second term, Mr. Trump has praised TikTok for helping him win the support of young voters and dismissed concerns about the app as \"highly overrated.\" The White House recently launched its own TikTok account.",
      "Mr. Trump has said for months that a deal to sell TikTok is on the verge, but the details of an official agreement, which would be subject to approval from the Chinese government, have yet to be made public.",
      "\"We have American buyers,\" Mr. Trump told reporters last month, adding that he had yet to speak with Xi about a sale.",
      "Mr. Trump also teased a deal in late June, telling Fox News in an interview that a group of wealthy individuals had agreed to buy TikTok and he would be sharing more in the coming weeks. Mr. Trump said he thought Xi \"will probably do it.\"",
      "Discussions with China about a potential sale were happening \"at the highest level,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on June 30.",
      "In late July, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in an interview on CNBC that the \"deal is over to them right now,\" referring to China, and warned that TikTok \"is going to go dark\" if it's not approved.",
      "\"We made the decision. We can't have Chinese control and have something on 100 million American phones,\" he said.",
      "Lutnick said China or ByteDance \"can have a little piece\" but \"Americans will have control\" of the algorithm and \"own the technology.\"",
      "TikTok was a topic of conversation during Bessent's trade talks on Monday with Chinese officials in Spain. When asked by reporters later in the day whether China would have a stake in the company, Mr. Trump said, \"We haven't decided that.\"",
      "An apparent deal in April fell through after Mr. Trump announced new tariffs on China. The deal would have spun TikTok's operations in the U.S. into a new company that was owned and operated by a majority of American investors, a source familiar with the plans said at the time.",
      "Sources with knowledge of the negotiations told CBS News this week that the latest deal includes technology company Oracle and private equity firm Silver Lake. (David Ellison, the son of Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "The Chinese Embassy in Washington responded on Tuesday morning that China will \"firmly defend its national interests, the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies, and will carry out technology export approvals according to relevant laws and regulations.\"",
      "The statement added that the Chinese government \"also fully respects the will of enterprises and supports them in conducting business negotiations on an equal footing in accordance with market principles.\"",
      "Lawmakers have said that any deal that does not divest TikTok from ByteDance runs afoul of the law, including any arrangement that allows TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. while using ByteDance's algorithm.",
      "During arguments before the Supreme Court, TikTok's lawyer said the app \"would be a fundamentally different platform\" if it was forced to completely cut ties with ByteDance because the new owner would have to rebuild the algorithm, which would take years. In legal filings, TikTok said the inability to share any data with ByteDance would mean that the app's 170 million American users would not be able to access global content and vice versa.",
      "Trump claims authority to not enforce law",
      "Alan Rozenshtein, a University of Minnesota law professor, said it's not unusual for laws to go unenforced, but it's typically because there are resource constraints or the law is ambiguous. The TikTok law is \"completely unambiguous,\" he said.",
      "\"There's no room to argue that the law doesn't say what it says and there's also no resource constraint,\" he said. \"I don't think that there is a sort of similar instance of this sort of flagrant attempt to let a company violate the law.\"",
      "In letters to tech companies earlier this year, Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote that Mr. Trump \"determined that an abrupt shutdown of the TikTok platform would interfere with the execution of the president's constitutional duties to take care of the national security and foreign affairs of the United States.\"",
      "Bondi said the Justice Department is \"irrevocably relinquishing\" any legal claims against the companies, informing them that they can continue to make TikTok available in their app stores \"without violating the act, and without incurring any legal liability.\"",
      "The letters were made public in early July as part of Freedom of Information Act lawsuits.",
      "\"Whatever your view of prosecutorial discretion, it does not give the president the power to say that something prohibited by statute is actually lawful,\" said Zachary Price, a professor at the University of California College of the Law, San Francisco. \"It would at most let you suspend enforcement. In other words, you might be able to never seek penalties under the law, but \u2026 you can't tell them that they're acting lawfully when they're violating the statute.\"",
      "Anupam Chander, a law professor at Georgetown University, called the claims in Bondi's letters an \"excessive assertion of presidential power.\"",
      "But Chander said that by not enforcing the law instead of shutting it down, Mr. Trump may have a better chance at accomplishing what Congress insisted was the law's intent: to force a sale.",
      "\"It's a lot harder to sell a dead horse than a live horse,\" Chander said. \"If you force it to shut down and then hope in six months that you might engineer a sale \u2014 at that point, the value might have diminished so much that there's very little reason, very little economic incentive for ByteDance to sell at all.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's non-enforcement of the law has prompted some pushback from lawmakers, though the intensity has been relatively muted compared to the alarms Congress sounded over the app's potential national security risks.",
      "\"The courts have been really clear on this,\" Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, told reporters in early June. \"I think we ought to enforce the law.\"",
      "Republican Rep. Dan Newhouse of Washington\u00a0said \"the law is clear\" and called for it to be \"implemented as written.\"",

      "London \u2014\u00a0President Trump arrived in London on Tuesday for a historic second official state visit to the U.K., and he can look forward to the pomp and pageantry of a formal state dinner at Windsor Castle on Wednesday evening, hosted by King Charles III.",
      "But the timing of his visit is potentially awkward for Mr. Trump and his host, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and will likely bring more unwanted questions for the U.S. leader, coming immediately on the heels of the Starmer's decision to fire his ambassador in Washington, Peter Mandelson, in response to new revelations about his past friendship with the late convicted sex offender .",
      "Trump to get an unprecedented second royal reception",
      "In the early weeks of Mr. Trump's second term, Starmer had an ace in the hole to gain some favor as he arrived for a visit at the White House. Starmer came armed with a royal invitation from King Charles for an unprecedented second official state visit.",
      "It was seen as a savvy diplomatic move, with Starmer recognizing Mr. Trump's admiration for the British monarchy and royal family.",
      "\"My relationship is very good with the U.K. and King Charles is my friend. This is the first time this has ever happened, to be honored twice,\" Mr. Trump told reporters at Joint Base Andrews before his departure on Tuesday.",
      "The president is set to be greeted Wednesday with the full pomp, regalia and public spectacle offered by the U.K.'s royals. When they arrive Wednesday in Windsor, just west of London, Mr. Trump and first lady Melania will be taken by royal carriage, alongside King Charles, Queen Camilla and the Prince and Princess of Wales, to Windsor Castle, escorted by three different military bands and a regiment of the British Army on horseback.",
      "Events on the day will include a flypast by British and American F-35 fighter jets, as well as other Royal Air Force planes, all capped by a state banquet at the castle in the evening.",
      "\"I hate to say it, but nobody does it like you people in terms of the pomp and the ceremony,\" Mr. Trump told Starmer at a joint news conference during a visit to one of his golf courses in Scotland in July.",
      "The second official state visit for Mr. Trump is a rarity in modern times. Historically, second-term U.S. presidents have not been offered new full state visits, and have instead generally been invited for tea or lunch with the monarch at Windsor Castle.",
      "\"Ultimately, it's happening because, you know, the royal family \u2014 no pun intended \u2014 is the biggest trump card this government can play at big moments of international statesmanship and diplomacy,\" Roya Nikkhah, the royal editor for the Sunday Times newspaper, told CBS News ahead of Mr. Trump's arrival. \"There's a lot in it for us and our government in terms of national interest, and President Trump will get all those images that he desperately wants to have again.\"",
      "Growing divisions in the United Kingdom",
      "While Mr. Trump is briefly leaving behind a United States still rattled by the assassination of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk last week, he's touching down in a nation facing its own political divisions.",
      "Mr. Trump's visit comes as Starmer faces the most significant political headwinds of his one-year premiership. His government has come under mounting pressure from an ascendant right-wing political movement at home, against a backdrop of growing polarization in Britain. Powerful outside voices, including tech billionaire and former close Trump ally Elon Musk, have been accused of stoking these divisions",
      "A demonstration in London organized by far-right, anti-immigration activist Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, drew more than 110,000 people on Saturday, billed as a rally to \"Unite the Kingdom\" and for free speech. Musk himself addressed the rally by video-link. Eight people were arrested, and a small number of Robinson supporters clashed with police officers who were keeping them apart from counterprotesters.",
      "As CBS News' Haley Ott reported from the protest on Saturday, among the Union Jacks and England flags carried by many members of the crowd, there were also MAGA hats and American flags.",
      "\"Britain is a nation proudly built on tolerance, diversity and respect. Our flag represents our diverse country and we will never surrender it to those that use it as a symbol of violence, fear and division,\" Starmer said in a social media post on Sunday, rebuking some of the behavior seen at the march.",
      "There has also been much criticism of the rhetoric employed by Musk when he addressed the weekend demonstration.",
      "\"Whether you choose violence or not, violence is coming to you. You either fight back or you die,\" the billionaire, who has been a vocal critic of Starmer since he took office in July 2024, told the crowd.",
      "While Mr. Trump may no longer be on friendly terms with Musk, his administration is ideologically aligned with the two central themes of Saturday's demonstration in London: advocating for free speech and an aggressively nationalist immigration policy.",
      "That could make discussions with Mr. Trump diplomatically challenging for Starmer to navigate when they meet later this week.",
      "U.K. ambassador's dismissal over Epstein badly timed for Starmer and Trump",
      "The man who would have had a key role in the organization of the president's state visit is no longer in his post. Peter Mandelson was fired by Starmer as British Ambassador to the United States last week after new details emerged of his ties to Epstein. That also helped put the issue and questions around Mr. Trump's own past relationship with Epstein back in the headlines, a subject he has dismissed as a Democrat-inspired \"hoax.\"",
      "Starmer removed Mandelson from the key post after days of drip-fed revelations about Mandelson's years-long friendship with convicted sex offender Epstein, who was found dead in his jail cell in New York in 2019.",
      "Pressure started mounting on Starmer to take action when messages written by Mandelson to Epstein were released by the U.S. House Oversight Committee earlier this month, as part of a redacted 2003 \"birthday book\" to the late financier. They included a series of short notes accompanied by photos.",
      "Among other personal messages, Mandelson wrote that Epstein was known for \"taking you by surprise... in one of his glorious homes he likes to share with his friends (yum yum),\" and that \"wherever he is in the world, he remains my best pal!\"",
      "The final straw for Starmer, however, came after Bloomberg published a selection of emails on Sept. 10, from about 100 emails said to have been exchanged between Mandelson and Epstein between 2005 and\u00a0 2010. Their contents, including suggestions by Mandelson that Epstein vigorously defend himself against the sexual misconduct allegations, led to Starmer promptly firing the ambassador.",
      "In a podcast interview, Mandelson acknowledged the veracity of his correspondence with Epstein and expressed his deep regret that he had ever interacted with him, insisting he never saw evidence of the financier's crimes and had believed previous rebuttals issued by his attorneys.",
      "The \"birthday book\" in question is the same document The Wall Street Journal first reported the existence of in July, prompting Mr. Trump, who is also alleged to have written a message for Epstein in the book, to file a lawsuit against the newspaper and the owner of its parent company, Rupert Murdoch.",

    "summary": "The Senate confirmed Trump economic adviser Stephen Miran to the Federal Reserve to finish Adriana Kugler's term. Miran plans to return to his White House job afterward.",
    "story": [
      "The Senate on Monday confirmed economist and Trump adviser Stephen Miran to the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, giving President Trump more influence over the Fed just one day before central bank officials will meet to decide whether to cut interest rates.",
      "Miran was confirmed 48-47 for a term that runs until January, filling a vacancy created last month when Biden appointee Adriana Kugler stepped down before the end of her term. Miran currently chairs the White House's Council of Economic Advisers. In an unusual move, he's said he will take an unpaid leave of absence from that job while serving on the Fed board instead of resigning altogether, citing \"the short duration of the appointment.\"",
      "Miran is arriving at the central bank in time for a crucial Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, during which 12 top Fed officials \u2014 including Miran \u2014 will discuss monetary policy and decide whether to change the Fed's target interest rate. The committee is widely expected to vote for a rate cut, after leaving rates stable so far this year.",
      "Mr. Trump has criticized Fed officials for not cutting interest rates sooner, nicknaming Fed Chair Jerome Powell \"Mr. Too Late\" \u2014 pressuring a central bank that typically operates independently. The president favors a rate cut because it could boost economic growth and slash borrowing costs for American consumers, but the move could risk causing inflation to heat up.",
      "The Senate Banking Committee advanced Miran's nomination in a party-line vote last week, after lawmakers grilled him on whether he would preserve the Fed's independence.",
      "Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the committee's top Democrat, alleged last week Miran's nomination was part of a gambit by Mr. Trump to \"seize personal control of the Fed,\" citing his decision not to fully resign from his White House role.",
      "\"He will have zero credibility with markets, zero credibility with businesses, and zero credibility with the public if he is confirmed to the Board under these circumstances,\" Warren said.",
      "But Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, who chairs the committee, lauded Miran, saying he \"brings deep experience, proven leadership and a clear commitment to ensuring that the American economy remains strong and competitive.\"",
      "Miran said in a hearing earlier this month he believes the \"independence of monetary policy is a critical element for [the Fed's] success,\" and \"I intend to preserve that independence.\"",
      "Miran also said he would \"absolutely resign\" from the Council of Economic Advisers if he is confirmed to a longer term on the Fed board after his four-month appointment runs out.",
      "In a written questionnaire for senators, Miran didn't rule out attending meetings for the White House's Council of Economic Advisers and consulting with CEA staff, but \"only in my capacity as a member of the Fed and to the extent appropriate for a member of the Fed in the normal course of business.\" He also said he will not have access to his CEA email while at the Fed.",
      "The Miran nomination is just one move by Mr. Trump that could reshape the central bank.",
      "The president moved to fire Fed board member Lisa Cook last month, accusing her of making false statements on mortgage documents. Cook argued the firing was unlawful, and a judge ruled last week that Cook can remain on the board while a lawsuit plays out. The Trump administration asked an appeals court to halt that ruling before this week's interest rate meeting.",
      "Mr. Trump will also have an opportunity to pick a new Fed chair when Powell's four-year term in the role ends in May. The president has floated firing Powell before then, but the idea is legally untested. Powell's 14-year term on the Fed board does not end until 2028, so he could remain on the board until then while giving up his role as chair. Some prior Fed chiefs have stepped down after their time as chair runs out, but it's unclear if Powell will follow suit.",
      "Two other Fed board members \u2014 Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman \u2014 were confirmed during Mr. Trump's first term. If the president succeeds in firing Cook, and if Powell resigns next year, five of the Fed Board of Governors' seven members would be Trump nominees.",

      "The Biden administration in 2021 imposed restrictions on Hungarian passport holders born outside of Hungary and reduced the timeframe of authorized travel permitted under the Visa Waiver Program, citing a simplified naturalization policy backed by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban that extended citizenship to people born abroad who claimed Hungarian ancestry.",

      "The precise structure of the final deal was unclear Monday night, but will include multiple companies, the sources said. It's not clear what level of involvement Chinese firms \u2014 including TikTok's current parent company ByteDance \u2014 will have in the deal, and who will control TikTok's powerful recommendation algorithm. Presidents Trump and Xi are expected to talk on Friday.",
      "The deal includes a blend of new investors, including Silver Lake, a private equity firm based in California, and existing investors, the sources said.",
      "Mr. Trump on Tuesday morning declined to say which companies are purchasing TikTok, but said they will be announcing that soon.",
      "\"We have a group of very big companies that want to buy it,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And, you know, the kids wanted it so badly. I had parents calling me up. They don't want it for themselves. They want it for their kids. They say, if I don't get it done, they're in big trouble with their kids.\"",

      "The Chinese Embassy in Washington responded on Tuesday morning that China will \"firmly defend its national interests, the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies, and will carry out technology export approvals according to relevant laws and regulations.\"",
      "The statement continued that the Chinese government \"also fully respects the will of enterprises and supports them in conducting business negotiations on an equal footing in accordance with market principles.\"",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Monday in Madrid after meetings with Chinese officials on a range of issues, including TikTok, that the commercial terms had been agreed upon.",
      "Oracle \u2014 the tech company co-founded by billionaire Larry Ellison \u2014 has long been seen as a possible buyer if the U.S. government forced a TikTok sale. Mr. Trump has described Ellison as a friend. (Larry Ellison's son, David Ellison, is the chairman & CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison Family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "In 2020, Mr. Trump endorsed a deal that would see Oracle and Walmart taking a 20% stake in a U.S.-based entity called TikTok Global. And in recent years, as TikTok has sought to regain trust with American users and regulators, it has partnered with Oracle to route U.S. TikTok users' activity through the Texas-based company's servers.",
      "Mr. Trump was circumspect about a deal with reporters in the Oval Office on Monday. \"We may let it die, or we may, I don't know, it depends. Up to China. It doesn't matter too much. I'd like to do it for the kids. They like it.\"",
      "Last year, Congress passed and then-President Joe Biden signed a bill that essentially gave TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, an ultimatum: either divest from TikTok or face a ban in the U.S. The Supreme Court upheld the law in a unanimous 9-0 decision. But Mr. Trump has issued a series of orders unilaterally delaying its enforcement. The latest came in June, when he pushed back the deadline for enforcing the measure until this Wednesday.",
      "The president's orders have directed the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against tech companies such asApple and Google for failing to comply with the law by offering the TikTok app on their platforms.",
      "The TikTok divestiture law was passed in 2024 after years of bipartisan concern over possible national security risks posed by the ultra-popular video app. Those include worries that the Chinese government could force ByteDance to divulge information on U.S.-based users or manipulate the platform's algorithm to control what Americans see. TikTok has long denied that the Chinese authorities exert any influence on the platform.",
      "The concerns stretch back to Mr. Trump's first term. The president signed an executive order to ban TikTok in the U.S. in 2020 on national security and data privacy grounds, but the move was blocked by a judge. Four years later, Mr. Trump\u00a0 changed his view and expressed support for the app, which he has credited for his improved performance among younger voters in last year's election.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration has added Colombia to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in nearly three decades.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Monday added Colombia to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in almost 30 years, a stinging rebuke to a traditional U.S. ally that reflects a recent surge in cocaine production and fraying ties between the White House and the country's leftist president.",
      "Even as it determined that Colombia had failed to comply with its international counternarcotics obligations, the Trump administration issued a waiver of sanctions that would have triggered major aid cuts, citing vital U.S. national interests.",
      "Nonetheless, it is a major step against one of the United States' staunchest allies in Latin America, and it could further hamper efforts to restore security in the countryside, according to Adam Isacson, a security researcher at the Washington Office on Latin America.",
      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro said he regretted the decision, which overlooked decades of bloodshed by Colombian security forces and civilians all in the name of a U.S.-led drug war.",
      "\"Everything we do has nothing to do with the Colombian people,\" Petro said during a televised address Monday night. \"It is to prevent the American society from smearing its noses in order to work, work and work, because this drug is a stimulant.\"",
      "The U.S. last added Colombia to the list, through a process known as decertification, in 1997 when the country's cartels \u2014 through threats of violence and money \u2014 had poisoned much of the nation's institutions.",
      "It \"is a blunt tool and a huge irritant in bilateral relations that goes well beyond drug issues and makes cooperation far harder in any number of areas,\" Isacson said. \"That's why it's so rarely used.\"",
      "The president at the time, Ernesto Samper, was facing credible accusations of receiving illicit campaign contributions from the now-defunct Cali cartel, and a plane he was set to use for a trip to New York to attend the U.N. General Assembly session was found carrying 4 kilograms of heroin.",
      "A remarkable turnaround began once Samper left office. Successive U.S. administrations \u2014 both Republican and Democrats \u2014 sent billions in foreign assistance to Colombia to eradicate illegal coca crops, strengthen its armed forces in the fight against drug-fueled rebels and provide economic alternatives to poor farmers who are on the lowest rungs of the cocaine industry.",
      "That cooperation started to unravel following the suspension a decade ago of aerial eradication of coca fields with glyphosate. It followed a Colombian high court ruling that determined the U.S.-funded program was potentially harmful to the environment and farmers.",
      "A 2016 peace accord with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the nation's largest rebel group known as FARC, also committed Colombia to rolling back punitive policies likened to the U.S. spraying of Agent Orange during the Vietnam War in favor of state building, rural development and voluntary crop substitution.",
      "Since then, cocaine production has skyrocketed. The amount of land dedicated to cultivating coca, the base ingredient of cocaine, has almost tripled in the past decade to a record 253,000 hectares in 2023, according to the latest report available from the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime. That is almost triple the size of New York City.",
      "Along with production, drug seizures have also soared to 654 metric tons so far this year. Colombia seized a record 884 metric tons last year.",
      "But unlike past governments, manual eradication of coca crops under Petro's leadership has slowed, to barely 5,048 hectares this year \u2014 far less than the 68,000 hectares uprooted in the final year of his conservative predecessor's term and well below the government's own goal of 30,000 hectares.",
      "Petro, a former rebel himself, also has angered senior U.S. officials by denying American extradition requests, as well as criticizing the Trump administration's immigration crackdown and its efforts to combat drug trafficking in neighboring Venezuela.",
      "\"Under my administration, Colombia does not collaborate in assassinations,\" Petro said on Sept. 5 after the U.S. military carried out a deadly strike on a small Venezuelan vessel in the Caribbean that the Trump administration said was transporting cocaine bound for the U.S.",
      "\"The failure of Colombia to meet its drug control obligations over the past year rests solely with its political leadership,\" Trump said in a presidential memo submitted to Congress. \"I will consider changing this designation if Colombia's government takes more aggressive action to eradicate coca and reduce cocaine production and trafficking, as well as hold those producing, trafficking, and benefiting from the production of cocaine responsible, including through improved cooperation with the United States to bring the leaders of Colombian criminal organizations to justice.\"",
      "Under U.S. law, the president annually must identify countries that have failed to meet their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements during the previous 12 months.",
      "In addition to Colombia, the Trump administration listed four other countries \u2014 Afghanistan, Bolivia, Myanmar and Venezuela \u2014 as among 23 major drug transit or drug-production countries that have failed to meet their international obligations. With the exception of Afghanistan, the White House determined that U.S. assistance to those countries was vital to national interests and therefore they would be spared any potential sanctions.",
      "The redesignation of Venezuela as a country that has failed to adequately fight narcotics smuggled from neighboring Colombia comes against the backdrop of a major U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean that has already led to two deadly strikes on small Venezuelan vessels that the Trump administration said were transporting cocaine bound for the U.S.",
      "\"In Venezuela, the criminal regime of indicted drug trafficker Nicol\u00e1s Maduro leads one of the largest cocaine trafficking networks in the world, and the United States will continue to seek to bring Maduro and other members of his complicit regime to justice for their crimes,\" Trump's designation said. \"We will also target Venezuelan foreign terrorist organizations such as Tren de Aragua and purge them from our country.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court on Monday rejected a bid from President Trump's administration to allow the president to fire Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, leaving intact a lower court order that reinstated her to the post.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit divided 2-1 in declining to grant the Trump administration emergency relief and clear the way for Mr. Trump to remove Cook from her position. The Trump administration is likely to ask the Supreme Court to intervene. But absent an 11th-hour order from the high court, the decision all but ensures Cook will remain a governor on the seven-member Fed board through a two-day meeting of its interest rate-setting committee, which Cook sits on and is set to begin Tuesday.",
      "Mr. Trump moved to oust Cook from the Fed's Board of Governors last month over allegations of mortgage fraud. Cook denies any wrongdoing.",
      "Judge Bradley Garcia wrote in a concurring opinion joined by Judge Michelle Childs that Cook is likely to succeed in arguing that Mr. Trump's attempt to remove her violated her due process rights. Judge Gregory Katsas dissented.",
      "\"Given that Cook has a property interest in her position, she is entitled to 'some kind' of process before removal,\" Garcia wrote. \"Before this court, the government does not dispute that it provided Cook no meaningful notice or opportunity to respond to the allegations against her. The government argues only that Cook 'does not explain what difference a hearing would have made.' Even accepting that premise, Cook's entitlement to process stands apart from whether she would succeed in securing a different outcome.\"",
      "Garcia added that since Cook has continued to serve in her role despite her purported termination by Mr. Trump, granting the administration's request for emergency relief would \"upend\" the status quo.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson said the agency \"does not comment on current or prospective litigation including matters that may be an investigation.\"",
      "The Trump administration asked the D.C. Circuit for emergency relief after U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ruled that Cook's firing likely violated the Federal Reserve Act and her due process rights.",
      "The Federal Reserve Act specifies that the president can only remove a Fed governor \"for cause.\" While the term is not defined in the law, Cobb found \"for cause\" refers to in-office conduct. Because Cook's alleged misrepresentations on mortgage documents predate her tenure as a Fed governor, Cobb ruled that Mr. Trump lacked \"cause\" to remove Cook.",
      "The judge issued a preliminary injunction requiring the Fed to allow Cook to remain a member of its Board of Governors during the litigation.",
      "\"President Trump's stated cause refers only to allegations regarding Cook's conduct before she began serving on the Federal Reserve Board,\" the judge wrote in her decision, adding that \"such allegations are not a legally permissible cause.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has criticized the Fed for moving too slowly in cutting interest rates, though economists expect the central bank will announce a rate cut this week. If Cook's firing is ultimately allowed \u2014 a decision that will likely be made by the Supreme Court \u2014 and the president appoints a successor, it would mean he will have appointed the majority of the seven-member Board of Governors.",
      "Mr. Trump announced on social media last month that he was firing Cook, appointed by former President Joe Biden, from the Fed Board of Governors and had \"sufficient cause\" to oust her. Cook's 14-year-term on the Fed is set to end in January 2038.",
      "The president cited as grounds for her removal claims made by Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, that Cook made false statements on mortgage documents.",
      "Pulte alleged in a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi last month that Cook claimed two different properties in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Atlanta as her principal residence on mortgage documents from 2021 in order to gain more favorable lending terms. Pulte, who was appointed to lead the FHFA by Mr. Trump, has continued to make accusations against Cook related to mortgage documents.",
      "Cook has not been charged with any wrongdoing. Her lawyers said in court papers that she may have \"erred\" in filling out a form for a private mortgage, but said the events took place before she assumed office as a Fed governor and in her capacity as a private citizen.",
      "\"Governor Cook did not ever commit mortgage fraud,\" they wrote.",
      "Reuters reported Friday that a loan estimate for the property in Atlanta, dated May 28, 2021, showed that Cook declared that residence as a \"vacation home.\"",
      "Cook filed a lawsuit challenging Mr. Trump's effort to fire her, alleging that the move violated the Federal Reserve Act.",
      "While the law does not define \"cause,\" Cook's lawyers argued \"cause\" constitutes what is set out in other laws shielding officials at independent agencies from being fired at-will: instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "They said Mr. Trump relied on \"thinly-veiled pretext\" in an effort to oust Cook because she has not supported lowering the benchmark interest rate.",
      "\"[T]hose unsubstantiated allegations cannot camouflage the President's real reason for attempting to remove Governor Cook: he disagrees with her policy decisions,\" Cook's legal team wrote.",
      "The Fed said it is not taking a position on whether Mr. Trump's attempt to fire Cook is lawful and said it will follow any court orders.",
      "In defending Mr. Trump's move, Justice Department lawyers have said that Congress gave the president broad discretion to remove a Fed governor for \"cause\" through the Federal Reserve Act and argued that making \"contradictory statements\" on financial filings is sufficient ground for removing her.",
      "\"When Governors by misconduct or gross neglect erode the foundations of such confidence, the President acts properly and lawfully by removing them,\" Justice Department lawyers wrote in a filing to the D.C. Circuit.",
      "They argued that the president's power of for-cause removal is discretionary, and the exercise of that authority is unreviewable by the courts. Justice Department lawyers also rejected the district court's conclusion that the public interest in the Fed's independence weighed in favor of Cook's reinstatement to her role on the Board of Governors.",
      "\"Even with the Federal Reserve's unique structure and history, its Governors are subject to removal for cause, and the President's actions to remove Cook based on her misconduct should strengthen, not diminish, the Federal Reserve's integrity,\" they wrote.",
      "Cook is one of several Democratic appointees at independent agencies who have been fired by Mr. Trump since he returned to the White House in January.\u00a0 But her removal is unprecedented, as no president has fired a member of the Fed board in the central bank's 112-year-history.",
      "Critics of the move have warned that Mr. Trump's attempt to terminate Cook threatens the independence of the Fed and, if allowed, the stability of markets and the U.S. economy.",
      "Among the other officials Mr. Trump has fired are members of the Federal Trade Commission, Merit Systems Protection Board, National Labor Relations Board and Consumer Product Safety Commission, who have all sued to challenge their firings.",
      "The Supreme Court has allowed the president to oust members of the NLRB, MSPB and CPSC while their cases move forward, but it has drawn a line around the Fed. In a May decision, the high court said the central bank is a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 U.S. and Chinese negotiators have agreed to the outlines of a deal to resolve the dispute over ownership of TikTok, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Monday, adding that President Trump is set to speak to Chinese President Xi Jinping later this week.",
      "\"We have a framework for a TikTok deal,\" Bessent said after talks with Chinese officials in Spain. \"The two leaders, President Trump and Party Chair Xi, will speak on Friday to complete the deal. But we do have a framework for a deal with TikTok.\"",
      "Bessent said the agreement is \"between two private parties\" and that \"the commercial terms have been agreed upon.\" He said the talks in Spain centered around the future of the app.",
      "Mr. Trump hinted at the agreement in a post on Truth Social earlier Monday morning.",
      "\"The big Trade Meeting in Europe between The United States of America, and China,  has gone VERY WELL! It will be concluding shortly,\" the president wrote. \"A deal was also reached on a 'certain' company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save. They will be very happy! I will be speaking to President Xi on Friday. The relationship remains a very strong one!!!\"",
      "Later Monday, Mr. Trump was asked by reporters whether China would have a stake in the company.",
      "\"We haven't decided that,\" he said.",
      "A spokesperson to Vice President JD Vance said the deal means hundreds of millions of Americans will be able to continue using the app.",
      "\"President Trump and Vice President Vance provided the leadership and foresight necessary to produce a framework deal that fulfills another campaign promise and saves TikTok,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "In a briefing after Monday's trade talks, a Chinese official said China \"will firmly safeguard the national interests, the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises, and carry out technology export approval in accordance with relevant laws and regulations,\" according to Xinhua, China's state-run news agency.",
      "The outlet said Chinese trade representative Li Chenggang conveyed that \"China has always opposed politicization, instrumentalization and weaponization of technology and economic-trade matters and will never seek to reach any agreement at the expense of principles, interests of companies, or international fairness and justice.\"",
      "Last year, Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed a bill that essentially gave TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, an ultimatum: either divest from TikTok or face a ban in the United States. The Supreme Court upheld the law in a unanimous 9-0 decision. But Mr. Trump has issued a series of orders unilaterally delaying its enforcement. The latest came in June, when he pushed back the deadline for enforcing the measure until Sept. 17.",
      "The president's orders have directed the Justice Department\u00a0not to take action or impose penalties against tech companies like Apple and Google for failing to comply with the law by allowing TikTok on their platforms.",
      "Mr. Trump's extensions have come as the U.S. tries to negotiate an agreement that would separate the hugely popular video-sharing app from ByteDance. The Trump administration appeared close to a deal in the spring, which would have spun TikTok's U.S.-based operations into a new company owned and operated by a majority of American investors, and allowed ByteDance to maintain a minority stake. But Mr. Trump's sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports scuttled the proposed deal.",
      "ByteDance, however, refuted then that an agreement had been reached because there were still key issues unresolved. TikTok's parent company said any deal regarding the app's future would be subject to approval by the Chinese government.",

    "summary": "The National Center for Civil and Human Rights, in Atlanta, is expanding at a critical moment in the debate over how the story of the United States is told.",
    "story": [
      "Atlanta \u2014 A popular historical museum in Georgia is expanding at a critical moment in the debate over how the story of the United States is told. Critics of the Trump administration say it is using its power over publicly-funded bodies such as the Smithsonian Institution to\u00a0control what Americans learn about their history, but the privately funded Atlanta-based National Center for Civil and Human Rights can avoid such pressures and set its own agenda.",
      "It has undergone a months-long renovation, costing nearly $60 million, adding six new galleries as well as classrooms and interactive experiences, changing a relatively static museum into a dynamic place where people are encouraged to take action in support of civil and human rights, racial justice and the future of democracy, said Jill Savitt, the center's president and CEO.",
      "The center has stayed active ahead of its Nov. 8 reopening through K-12 education programs that include more than 300 online lesson plans; a LGBTQ+ Institute; training in diversity, equity and inclusion; human rights training for law enforcement; and its Truth & Transformation Initiative to spread awareness about forced labor, racial terror and other historic injustices. It is these same topics that have often been in the crosshairs of the Trump administration and its supporters, amid what many historians see as an effort to wrest greater control over the national narrative and play down some of the darker episodes in America's past.",
      "Dreamed up by civil rights icons Evelyn Lowery and Andrew Young, the center opened in 2014 on land donated by the Coca-Cola Company, next to the Georgia Aquarium and The World of Coca-Cola, and became a major tourist attraction. But ticket sales declined after the pandemic.",
      "Now the center hopes to attract more repeat visitors with immersive experiences like \"Change Agent Adventure,\" aimed at children under 12. These \"change agents\" will be asked to pledge to do something \u2014 no matter how small \u2014 that \"reflects the responsibility of each of us to play a role in the world: To have empathy. To call for justice. To be fair, be kind. And that's the ethos of this gallery,\" Savitt said. It opens next April.",
      "\"I think advocacy and change-making is kind of addictive. It's contagious,\" Savitt explained. \"When you do something, you see the success of it, you really want to do more. And our desire here is to whet the appetite of kids to see that they can be involved. They can do it.\"",
      "This ethos is sharply different from the idea that young people can't handle the truth and must be protected from unpleasant challenges but, Savitt said, \"the history that we tell here is the most inspirational history.\"",
      "\"In fact, I think it's what makes America great. It is something to be patriotically proud of. The way activists over time have worked together through nonviolence and changed democracy to expand human freedom \u2014 there's nothing more American and nothing greater than that. That is the lesson that we teach here,\" she said.",
      "\"Broken Promises,\" opening in December, includes exhibits from the post-Civil War Reconstruction era, cut short when white mobs sought to brutally reverse advances by formerly enslaved people. \"We want to start orienting you in the conversation that we believe we all kind of see, but we don't say it outright: Progress. Backlash. Progress. Backlash. And that pattern that has been in our country since enslavement,\" said its curator, Kama Pierce.",
      "On display will be a bullet-riddled historical marker from the site of the 1918 lynching of Mary Turner in Georgia, which was donated by her descendants to keep it from being vandalized again.",
      "\"There are 11 bullet holes and 11 grandchildren living,\" Pierce said, noting that some of the family's words will be incorporated into the exhibit to show their resilience.",
      "The center hosts many Items from the Morehouse College Martin Luther King Jr. collection, which will have a much more prominent place in a room that recreates King's home office, with family photos contributed by the center's first guest curator: his daughter, the Rev. Bernice King. \"We wanted to lift up King's role as a man, as a human being, not just as an icon,\" Savitt explained.",
      "Gone are huge images that used to be featured of historical figures associated with mass atrocities such as Hitler, Stalin and Mao, with details of the millions of people killed under their orders. In their place will be examples of human rights victories by groups working around the world.",
      "\"The research says that if you tell people things are really bad and how awful they are, you motivate people for a minute, and then apathy sets in because it's too hard to do anything,\" Savitt said. \"But if you give people something to hope for that's positive, that they can see themselves doing, you're more likely to cultivate a sense of agency in people.\"",
      "And doubling in capacity is an experience many can't forget: Joining a 1960s sit-in against segregation. Wearing headphones as they take a lunch-counter stool, visitors can both hear and feel an angry, segregationist mob shouting they don't belong. Because this is \"heavy content,\" Savitt says, a new \"reflection area\" will enable people to pause afterward on a couch, with tissues if they need them, to consider what they've just been through.",
      "The center's expansion was seeded by Home Depot co-founder and Atlanta philanthropist Arthur M. Blank, the Mellon Foundation and many other donors, for which Savitt expressed gratitude: \"The corporate community is in a defensive crouch right now - they could get targeted,\" she said.",
      "But she said donors shared concerns about people's understanding of citizenship, and they saw a long-term investment in the teaching of civil and human rights as a way to address this.",
      "\"It is the story of democracy \u2014 Who gets to participate? Who has a say? Who gets to have a voice?\" she said. \"So our donors are very interested in a healthy, safe, vibrant, prosperous America, which you need a healthy democracy to have.\"",

      "An uptick in solar activity could influence space weather, potentially leading to more solar storms,\u00a0solar flares\u00a0and coronal mass ejections, the researchers found. Space weather patterns have the potential to directly impact spacecraft operations and the safety of astronauts, but\u00a0they may be felt on Earth, too, as space weather can affect power grids, GPS systems and radio communication, according to NASA.",
      "The downward trend was documented from the 1980s until 2008, when the space agency determined that the sun had reached its weakest point on record. The sun's action, or inaction, tends to fluctuate in 11-year cycles, according to NASA, although some patterns draw on longer.",
      "Earth is currently in\u00a0Solar Cycle 25, which began in 2020. The last cycle maintained an average length of 11 years and was the weakest solar cycle to occur in a century, according to the National Weather Service. Scientists thought the sun would stay in what they dubbed \"deep solar minimum,\" believing that the stretch of quietness from the sun would continue, eventually leading to a new phase of record low activity.",
      "\"But then the trend of declining solar wind ended,\" Jasinski said in NASA's announcement.",
      "His study, co-authored by Marco Velli, a fellow researcher at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, instead tracked increasing bursts of solar plasma and stronger magnetic field measurements throughout the solar system, which are all affected by the sun.",
      "Solar Cycle 26 is expected to begin some time between January 2029 and December 2032, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said, but the agency has not yet produced a prediction for the next cycle.",
      "In order to better track space weather, NASA announced that it will launch the Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP) and\u00a0Carruthers Geocorona Observatory\u00a0missions, as well as the NOAA's\u00a0SWFO-L1\u00a0mission, from Falcon 9 as early as next week. It comes just a few months after\u00a0SpaceX helped NASA launch TRACERS twin satellites which are studying how the electrically-charged solar wind interacts with Earth's magnetic field.",
      "\"Space weather predictions are critical for supporting the spacecraft and astronauts of NASA's Artemis campaign, as understanding the space environment is a vital part of mitigating astronaut exposure to space radiation,\" NASA said Monday.",
      "In May 2024, NASA officials recorded the\u00a0strongest geomagnetic storm in more than 20 years. Several X-class solar flares \u2014 the largest of B-class, followed by C and M \u2014 sent the\u00a0northern lights\u00a0to far lower latitudes than normal,\u00a0as far south as Mexico.",
      "Geomagnetic storms have the ability to impact how and whether technology functions on a massive scale, electrical engineer David Wallace explained in\u00a0The Conversation\u00a0last year.",
      "\"Internet service providers could go down, which in turn would take out the ability of different systems to communicate with each other. High-frequency communication systems such as ground-to-air, shortwave and ship-to-shore radio would be disrupted,\" Wallace wrote.",

      "Users of the chatbot identified as under the age of 18 will automatically be directed to a version of ChatGPT governed by \"age-appropriate\" content rules, OpenAI said in a\u00a0statement. This under-age edition includes protection policies such as blocking sexual content and \u2014 \"in rare cases of acute distress\" \u2014 law enforcement to ensure a user's safety, according to the company.",
      "\"The way ChatGPT responds to a 15-year-old should look different than the way it responds to an adult,\" the company said in the announcement.",
      "OpenAI also said it is introducing parental controls, such as enabling parents to link their account to their teen's account, manage chat history, set blackout hours and more. The safeguards will be available by the end of September.",
      "The announcement comes just days after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) launched a probe into the potential negative effects of AI chatbot companions on children and teens. OpenAI said that it's prioritizing \"making ChatGPT helpful and safe for everyone, and we know safety matters above all else when young people are involved.",
      "A spokesperson for OpenAI recently told CBS News that it's prioritizing \"making ChatGPT helpful and safe for everyone.\"",
      "Before the FTC probe, OpenAI indicated that it would introduce\u00a0extra safety protections\u00a0for vulnerable users and teens, after the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine of California, who died by suicide in April, sued the company late last month. Raine's family allege that ChatGPT led their teen to commit suicide.",
      "It's unclear how OpenAI plans to indentify users' ages, however, it stated that if ChatGPT is unsure about someone's age, or has incomplete information, it will default to the under-18 version.",

      "Also testifying Tuesday was Megan Garcia, the mother of 14-year-old Sewell Setzer III of Florida.",
      "Garcia sued another\u00a0AI company, Character Technologies, for wrongful death last year, arguing that before his suicide, Sewell had become increasingly isolated from his real life as he engaged in highly sexualized conversations with the chatbot.",

The company said after the teen's death, it made changes that require users to be\u00a013 or older to create an account and that it would launch parental controls in the first quarter of 2025. Those controls were rolled out in March.",

      "\"What they should be doing is not targeting ChatGPT to minors until they can prove that it's safe for them,\" Golin said. \"We shouldn't allow companies, just because they have tremendous resources, to perform uncontrolled experiments on kids when the implications for their development can be so vast and far-reaching.\"",
      "California State Senator Steve Padilla, who introduced legislation to create safeguards in the state around AI Chatbots, said in a statement to CBS News, \"We need to create common-sense safeguards that rein in the worst impulses of this emerging technology that even the tech industry doesn't fully understand.\"",

TikTok has long denied that the Chinese authorities exert any influence on the platform.",

      "\"We've been partnering with Northrop Grumman on this update, and we're excited that Northrop is ready to deliver this incredibly beneficial increase in capacity,\" Contella said. \"It's about 1.6 meters (5 feet) longer, and it carries about 2,600 additional pounds more cargo.\"",
      "NASA pays for cargo delivery flights using Cygnus spacecraft and SpaceX's Dragon. To date, SpaceX has successfully carried out 32 Dragon resupply missions, while Northrop Grumman has launched 21 successful flights.

      "The Federal Trade Commission has started an inquiry into several social media and artificial intelligence companies, including OpenAI and Meta, about the potential harms to children and teenagers who use their chatbots as companions.",
      "On Thursday, the FTC said it has sent letters to Google parent Alphabet, Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms, Snap, Character Technologies, ChatGPT maker OpenAI and xAI.",
      "The FTC said it wants to understand what steps, if any, companies have taken to evaluate the safety of their chatbots when acting as companions, to limit the products' use by and potential negative effects on children and teens, and to apprise users and parents of the risks associated with the chatbots.",
      "The inquiry comes after OpenAI said it plans to make changes to ChatGPT safeguards for vulnerable people, including adding extra protections for those under 18 years old, after the parents of a teen boy who died by suicide in April sued, alleging the artificial intelligence chatbot led their teen to take his own life.",
      "More children are now using AI chatbots for everything \u2014 from homework help to personal advice, emotional support and everyday decision-making. That's despite research on the harms of chatbots, which have been shown to give kids dangerous advice about topics such as drugs, alcohol and eating disorders.",
      "\"As AI technologies evolve, it is important to consider the effects chatbots can have on children, while also ensuring that the United States maintains its role as a global leader in this new and exciting industry,\" said FTC Chairman Andrew N. Ferguson in a statement.",
      "He added, \"The study we're launching today will help us better understand how AI firms are developing their products and the steps they are taking to protect children.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Character.AI said it is looking forward to \"collaborating with the FTC on this inquiry and providing insight on the consumer AI industry and the space's rapidly evolving technology.\"",
      "Meta declined to comment on the FTC inquiry. The company has been working on making sure its AI chatbots are safe and age appropriate for children, a spokesperson said.",
      "OpenAI said that it's prioritizing \"making ChatGPT helpful and safe for everyone, and we know safety matters above all else when young people are involved. We recognize the FTC has open questions and concerns, and we're committed to engaging constructively and responding to them directly.\"",
      "In an email to CBS News, Snap said, \"We share the FTC's focus on ensuring the thoughtful development of generative AI, and look forward to working with the Commission on AI policy that bolsters U.S. innovation while protecting our community.\"",
      "Alphabet and xAI did not immediately respond to messages for comment.",
      "AI changes",
      "OpenAI and Meta earlier this month announced changes to how their chatbots respond to teenagers asking questions about suicide or showing signs of mental and emotional distress. OpenAI said it is rolling out new controls enabling parents to link their accounts to their teen's account.",
      "Parents can choose which features to disable and \"receive notifications when the system detects their teen is in a moment of acute distress,\" according to a company blog post that says the changes will go into effect this fall.",
      "Regardless of a user's age, the company says its chatbots will attempt to redirect the most distressing conversations to more capable AI models that can provide a better response.",
      "Meta also said it is now blocking its chatbots from talking with teens about self-harm, suicide, disordered eating and inappropriate romantic conversations, and instead directs them to expert resources. Meta already offers parental controls on teen accounts.",
      "If you or someone you know is in emotional distress or a suicidal crisis, you can reach the\u00a0988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline\u00a0by calling or texting 988. You can also chat with the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline\u00a0here.",

      "Tropical Storm Gabrielle formed Wednesday morning over the central Atlantic Ocean, becoming the seventh named storm of the\u00a02025 Atlantic hurricane season. Forecasters expect the weather system to remain over open waters for the next several days and haven't yet warned of any hazards that could potentially affect land. But it may become a low-grade hurricane as it intensified over the weekend.",
      "The storm's current forecast predicts that Gabrielle's track will carry it north of the Caribbean and away from land, but the system could reach Bermuda next week as it continues to strengthens CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan said.",
      "A map produced by Nolan shows Gabrielle's anticipated westward path through Monday, at which point it may be packing hurricane-force winds as strong as 85 mph. The storm could develop into a hurricane Sunday as it passes near the Caribbean, according to the map.",
      "Gabrielle developed before 11 a.m. ET on Wednesday, when the storm was situated roughly 1,000 miles east of the northern Leeward Islands and tracking northwest at 22 miles per hour, the National Hurricane Center said in an advisory.",
      "Its maximum sustained winds were 45 mph, just over the threshold that differentiates a tropical depression from a tropical storm. Gabrielle grew from a tropical depression in the Atlantic that meteorologists initially flagged earlier on Wednesday.",
      "Tropical storm force winds extended outward some 175 miles from Gabrielle's center on Wednesday morning, the Hurricane Center said, adding that the storm's path and overall forecast remained \"highly uncertain\" as its center was still poorly defined.",
      "Gabrielle took shape about one week after what was historically considered the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs annually from June 1 to Nov. 30 and has in the past become most active around Sept. 10.",
      "Officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration initially predicted the 2025 season would be busier than usual and produce more named storms than an average year, but hurricane activity has so far been quieter than anticipated. At the start of the season, NOAA's outlook suggested that between 13 and 18 named storms would form in the Atlantic, with as many as nine strengthening into hurricanes and as many as five becoming Category 5 storms, which are the most powerful.",

The 139-foot ship, built in 1921, set sail from New London, Connecticut, on Jan. 9. The ship's captain made his last daily report to the Portland Trawling Company on Jan. 18. The next day, no report was made. The ship was set to arrive in port on Jan. 22, but never did, according to the news release. The news release did not say which port the ship was headed to.",
      "The Seiner was believed to have foundered and sank in a storm, the news release said. There were 21 men, including the captain, aboard when the ship went down. The men were from Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York and Newfoundland, Canada.",
      "The Portland Trawling Company and the U.S. Coast Guard mounted a search and rescue mission at the time, but no survivors were found. Previous attempts to search for the wreck in the 1990s failed because of the location of the wreck site.",
      "In 2022, a team used Atlantic Wreck Salvage's search vessel D/V Tenacious to discover the wreck site on Georges Bank, about 125 miles off the coast of Nantucket. The wreck site was about 200 feet underwater, the company said. Time and weather conditions meant the team members could not dive down to the wreckage. The shipwreck was not identified at the time.",
      "In July 2025, the team returned to the site and made a total of seven dives over two days. The team was able to identify the wreck as that of the Seiner.",
      "The ship had a number of distinctive features, including a double drum trawl winch and a raised forecastle deck, which helped divers confirm its identity, the news release said.

      "The former president addressed the recent assassination of Charlie Kirk and the attacks on two Minnesota Democratic lawmakers that left speaker of the Minnesota House of Representatives Melissa Hortman and her husband dead, and another state representative and his wife severely injured.

      "Obama said that political violence \"is not new\" and \"has happened at certain periods in\" U.S. history, but is \"anathema to what it means to be a democratic country.\"",
      "\"There are no ifs, ands or buts about it, the central premise of our democratic system is that we have to be able to disagree and have sometimes really contentious debates without resorting to violence,\" Obama said during a fireside chat at the Jefferson Educational Society, a nonprofit in Erie, Pennsylvania.",

      "Obama said that denouncing political violence and mourning its victims \"doesn't mean we can't have a debate about the ideas\" that were being promoted. He said that while he believes Kirk's ideas \"were wrong,\" that \"doesn't negate the fact that what happened was a tragedy and that I mourn for him and his family.\"",
      "Obama said that he disagreed with many of Kirk's opinions, including his 2023 claim that Black women including Michelle Obama and Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson \"do not have the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously\" and his belief in the \"Great Replacement\" conspiracy theory.",
      "\"Those are all topics that we have to be able to discuss honestly and forthrightly, while we still insist that in that process of debate, we respect other people's right to say things that we profoundly disagree with,\" Obama said. \"That's how we should approach this.\"",
      "Obama joins the list of politicians and leaders who have\u00a0responded to Kirk's death\u00a0by calling for an end to political violence. House Speaker Mike Johnson said Americans should \"have vigorous debate, but it cannot lead to political violence.\" Former President Joe Biden said political violence \"must end now,\" while former President George Bush said \"violence and vitriol must be purged from the public square.\" John Hoffman, the state senator wounded in Minnesota, said that \"America is broken, and political violence endangers our lives and democracy\" and asked political leaders to \"call out extreme, aggressive and violent dialog that foments these attacks on our republic and freedom.\"",

    "title": "Will the Fed cut rates today? These charts may determine its decision.",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-decision-september-17-fomc-meeting-interest-rates-cut/",
    "published": "Wed, 17 Sep 2025 07:53:51 -0400",
    "summary": "With the U.S. economy facing headwinds, the Federal Reserve faces pressure to trim interest rates this week for the first time since December 2024.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve's rate decision today is shaping up to be its most consequential of the year, with most economists predicting the first cut of 2025. The real suspense is over how deep the reduction could be \u2014 and whether the Fed might signal a broader pivot that could set the course for the rest of the year.",
      "So far, the Fed has resisted calls from President Trump to cut its benchmark interest rate, which helps determine borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. Mr. Trump has pointed to the fact that inflation has remained\u00a0relatively muted, so far this year, as evidence the central bank has been too late in lowering borrowing costs.",
      "Apart from Mr. Trump's push for a cut, the Federal Reserve is facing growing economic uncertainty ahead of its Sept. 17 meeting, raising the stakes for a rate decision.",
      "On the one hand, the labor market is showing signs of distress, with hiring slowing to a standstill, which would argue for a cut. But inflation is also creeping higher under the weight of the Trump administration's tariffs, an issue that the Fed has pointed to as its reason for keeping the benchmark rate unchanged so far this year.",
      "Adding to the complications is Mr. Trump's pressure on the Fed to reduce rates. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has responded by stressing the independence of the Federal Reserve, pointing out that the Federal Open Market Committee, its 12-member rate-setting group, relies on economic data to make its policy decisions, rather than political pressure.",
      "\"The committee tries to get a complete picture of the biggest downside risks for the economy, and then at the end of the meeting, there needs to be some sort of weighting \u2014 it's an art as much as science,\" noted Erasmus Kersting, an economics professor at Villanova University.",
      "When will the Fed announce its rate decision?",
      "The Fed will announce its next rate decision at 2 p.m. EST on Sept. 17.",
      "The probability of a 0.25 percentage point cut stands at 96%, according to CME FedWatch, which relies on 30-day Fed Funds futures prices to determine the likelihood. There's only a 4% probability of a jumbo cut of 0.5 percentage points, the tracker says.",
      "Economists will also be listening for whether the Fed provides guidance on whether it expects additional rate cuts at its next two meetings in 2025, set for Oct. 29 and Dec. 10.",
      "What data will determine the Fed's decision?",
      "The Federal Reserve has a so-called dual mandate to keep inflation low while also ensuring full employment.",
      "But those two goals can be in conflict with each other because rising inflation requires the Fed to boost interest rates, which tamps down spending by making it more expensive for businesses and consumers to borrow. The Fed's best weapon for fighting high unemployment, however, is to cut rates, as that makes it cheaper for businesses to expand and hire more workers.",
      "Fed officials will be closely scrutinizing inflation and jobs data as they determine which side of the dual mandate needs more attention.",
      "While the inflation rate has receded from its 2022 peak, it's still far above the Fed's goal for a 2% annual rate, and has inched up in recent months as the Trump administration's tariffs ripple through the economy, pushing some prices higher.",
      "Meanwhile, the labor market is showing signs of distress, with many sectors \u2014 including manufacturing, which Mr. Trump has vowed to revive \u2014 shedding jobs in August. The result is a marked slowdown in hiring, with employers adding an average of 29,000 each month from June through August, versus about 106,000 workers each month in 2024.",
      "\"It's going to be very difficult, but it will be weighing these two conflicting objectives,\" Kersting noted.",
      "How does the Fed compare with other central banks?",
      "Mr. Trump's has criticized the Fed's decision to hold off on cutting this year by pointing to decisions by other central banks, such as the Bank of England and the European Central Bank, to reduce their borrowing costs.",
      "\"Europe has had 10 cuts, we have had ZERO. No inflation, great economy \u2014 We should be at least two to three points lower,\" Mr. Trump wrote on social media in June.",
      "Yet the U.S. is facing an issue that isn't as pressing for other nations: Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "Because the tariffs are import taxes paid by U.S. businesses directly to the federal government, the cost is largely borne by American companies and consumers \u2014 not other nations. The White House has said exporters abroad bear the brunt of tariffs, while Trump administration officials make the case that more balanced trade with U.S. economic partners over the longer term will create jobs, energize the manufacturing sector and generate federal revenue.",
      "Fed Chair Powell has pointed to the tariffs as a reason the Fed has wanted to keep its powder dry, given that many economists believe the import duties will reignite inflation in the U.S.",
      "The Consumer Price Index (CPI), a closed watched inflation gauge, rose at annual rate of 2.9% in August, the sharpest pickup since January. Heavily imported goods, such as coffee, audio equipment and household furniture, saw some of the steepest price hikes last month, CPI data shows.",
      "How are American consumers holding up?",
      "Many Americans are souring on the economy, feeling pressured by higher costs for everything from housing to groceries.",
      "A recent\u00a0CBS News poll\u00a0found that two-thirds of Americans said prices in the past few weeks have continued to rise, and about the same share said they expect that to continue. More than half of consumers said the U.S. economy is getting worse, while only about one-quarter said they believe it's improving.",
      "The CPI has steadily risen since April, when it fell to an annual rate of 2.3%, or just above the Fed's 2% target.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has pointed to mortgage rates that were close to 7% for much of 2025 as a reason for a faltering housing market.",
      "\"Could somebody please inform Jerome 'Too Late' Powell that he is hurting the Housing Industry, very badly? People can't get a Mortgage because of him. There is no Inflation, and every sign is pointing to a major Rate Cut,\" the president wrote\u00a0in an Aug.19 post on social media.",
      "But mortgage rates are determined by several factors beyond the Fed's benchmark rate, including the strength of the U.S. economy and the 10-year Treasury note. Already, rates have declined in recent weeks, dipping to 6.35% for the week of Sept. 11, in anticipation of the Fed's cut and weaker economic data.",
      "Even so, a rate cut could help some consumers by lowering their borrowing costs, experts say.",
      "\"A declining interest rate environment will provide some relief for borrowers,\" Bankrate financial analyst Stephen Kates said in an email. \"Whether it's a homeowner with a 7% mortgage or a recent graduate hoping to refinance student loans and credit card debt, lower rates can ease the burden on many indebted households by opening opportunities to refinance or consolidate.\"",

    "summary": "Early in-person voting in the Virginia governor's race between Republican Winsome Earle-Sears and Democrat Abigail Spanberger starts Friday.",
    "story": [
      "Democrat Abigail Spanberger is heading into the final stretch of her campaign to try and become the next governor of Virginia with vocal support from two former Republican members of Congress.",
      "In a new development first reported by CBS News, Spanberger's campaign is set to tout endorsements from former Reps. Barbara Comstock and Denver Riggleman. The show of support from the two, who both backed Democrat Kamala Harris in last year's presidential race, also includes an advertisement.",
      "\"I saw firsthand that Abigail was one of the most bipartisan members of Congress,\" Riggleman says in the advertisement, while Comstock adds that her \"support for Abigail isn't about party, it's what's best for Virginia.\"",
      "After a victory in 2021, GOP Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin cannot run for a consecutive term this year due to state law. His chosen candidate in this year's contest, Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, is contending with national political tensions from Donald Trump's second term as president while she attempts to become the first GOP candidate since 1997 to succeed a fellow Republican as governor of the commonwealth.",
      "\"This election is a choice between sanity and chaos. We must protect our children from Abigail Spanberger's extremist agenda,\" Earle-Sears said in a social media post earlier this month.",
      "The decision by Spanberger's campaign to highlight support from the two former Republican members of Congress comes ahead of early in-person voting starting on Friday.",
      "Riggleman served one term in the U.S. House, and was defeated by a Republican challenger in 2020 before going on to serve as a senior technical adviser for the House Jan. 6 select committee following the 2021 Capitol riot. After winning two terms, Comstock lost her battleground congressional seat to a Democrat in the 2018 midterms during Mr. Trump's first term. Both are now examples of former Republican-elected officials who have criticized Mr. Trump since leaving office. Riggleman also appeared in an advertisement supporting Spanberger's 2022 reelection run for the U.S. House.",
      "The Virginia governor's race this November will be one of the first statewide races to be held during Mr. Trump's second term in the White House. The statewide off-year contest in Virginia is often viewed as at least being in part a referendum on the current incumbent president.",
      "Virginia has become a more reliably blue state in recent years, but Democrats' vote share in the state did drop during the 2024 presidential election. While then-Vice President Harris carried the state, she earned fewer votes than Joe Biden did during the 2020 contest.",
      "And at a time when Democrats are continuing to search for a path forward on messaging and branding issues, Spanberger's attempt to win back the governor's office from the GOP represents a closely watched contest that may carry national political implications in the coming years.",

      "Washington \u2014 House GOP leaders on Tuesday announced a plan to avoid a shutdown and keep the government funded until Nov. 21, unveiling legislation that also includes funds for additional security to lawmakers and other officials in the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said the bill is not \"partisan\" but a \"short-term, clean continuing resolution that will keep the government funded and operating at current levels while we continue all this work and doing our jobs and getting the remaining bills done.\"",
      "The speaker said a Friday vote is expected in the House, giving lawmakers the standard 72 hours to review the legislation. But he later said a vote could happen before then \"if there's an appetite to do it sooner.\"",
      "The House Rules Committee quickly advanced the legislation Tuesday to tee it up for a floor vote.",
      "Lawmakers have a Sept. 30 deadline to fund the government. But party leaders appeared far apart even as the legislation was unveiled Tuesday. Adding to the pressure, Congress is scheduled to be in recess next week for Rosh Hashanah.",

The subsidies were originally passed in 2021 during the pandemic and extended in 2022 for another three years.",
      "Johnson has dismissed the inclusion of an extension in the short-term funding bill, saying it's \"a December policy issue, not a September funding issue.\"",
      "With a narrow Republican majority in the House, Republicans could approve a funding measure without support from Democrats, though it would require near-unanimous approval from the GOP conference. And a handful of Republicans have already pledged to oppose the measure.",
      "Getting the bill through the Senate is another story. Though Republicans also have a majority in the upper chamber, with 53 seats, the legislation requires a 60-vote threshold to advance, making the support of at least seven Democrats necessary.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, has argued that a \"clean\" extension of government funding would \"ensure there is no reason for Democrats to oppose this bill and delay passage.\" He cited Democrats' demands during previous funding fights that any extension be free of divisive policy measures and current funding levels maintained.",

      "In a joint statement Tuesday, Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said the bill House Republicans unveiled \"fails to meet the needs of the American people and does nothing to stop the looming healthcare crisis.\"",
      "\"By refusing to work with Democrats, Republicans are steering our country straight toward a shutdown,\" Schumer and Jeffries said. \"Instead of governing, Republicans are once again taking orders from Donald Trump, hurting the American people and recklessly marching our nation to the brink of a shutdown.\"",

    "summary": "Court documents show the suspect's roommate found a note in their apartment that read, \"I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk and I'm going to take it.\"",
    "story": [
      "The man charged with murder in the slaying of conservative activist Charlie Kirk during a public event at Utah Valley University in Orem last week admitted in a text message to his roommate on the day of the shooting that he had committed the crime, courts documents allege.",
      "According to a criminal information document filed Tuesday by Utah County Attorney Jeffrey Gray, the roommate of 22-year-old Tyler Robinson questioned him about the incident in a text message exchange on Wednesday, Sept. 10, after the shooting had occurred earlier that day.",
      "Prosecutors said Robinson first texted his roommate, whose name has not been released, to \"drop what you are doing, look under my keyboard\" at the apartment they shared in St. George, a city in southwestern Utah where Robinson is from.",
      "The roommate found a note under the keyboard that read, \"I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk and I'm going to take it,\" the court documents state. Police found a photo of that note, the attorney's office said. Authorities did not say in the documents if the note itself was destroyed.",
      "Robinson then texted his roommate that he was \"stuck in\" Orem \"for a little while longer,\" the documents state.",
      "\"Shouldn't be long until I can come home, but I gotta grab my rifle still,\" Robinson wrote in the text exchange that the roommate provided to investigators.",
      "The \"bolt-action rifle\" that is believed to have been used in the shooting was found wrapped in a towel hidden in a wooded area nearby the campus, Gray stated in the court documents.",
      "\"To be honest I had hoped to keep this secret till I died of old age,\" Robinson allegedly wrote in a text.",
      "When the roommate asked Robinson if he was Kirk's shooter, Robinson replied, \"I am, I'm sorry,\" the court documents state.",
      "\"I thought they caught the person?\" the roommate wrote.",
      "Robinson allegedly replied that \"no, they grabbed some crazy old dude, then interrogated someone in similar clothing,\" seemingly in reference to two persons of interest who had been detained by law enforcement in connection with the shooting prior to Robinson's arrest.",
      "One of those people was released, and the second, identified as George Zinn, was charged with obstruction of justice because he falsely claimed to be the shooter, the Utah Department of Public Safety said Tuesday. There was no evidence, however, that Zinn colluded with Robinson, Utah DPS said.",
      "When his roommate asked why he had carried out the shooting, Robinson responded, \"I had enough of his hatred. Some hate can't be negotiated out,\" the court documents state.",
      "In the text exchange, Robinson allegedly repeatedly expressed concern about whether he will be able to retrieve the hidden rifle, which he indicated originally belonged to his grandfather.",
      "\"I had planned to grab my rifle from my drop point shortly after, but most of that side of town got locked down,\" Robinson wrote, according to the court documents.",
      "He texts that he's \"worried what\" his father \"would do if I didn't bring back grandpas rifle.\" He also says he's unsure if the rifle has a serial number, but that he doesn't believe it would be traced to him regardless, according to the court documents.",
      "\"I worry about prints I had to leave it in a bush where I changed outfits,\" Robinson allegedy wrote. \"I didn't have the ability or time to bring it with. ... I might have to abandon it and hope they don't find prints.\"",
      "When asked by his roommate how long he had planned the attack, Robinson replied, \"a bit over a week I believe,\" documents state.",
      "He allegedly later asks his roommate to \"delete this exchange\" and avoid speaking to the media. He also writes that \"Im gonna turn myself in willingly.\"",
      "According to the court documents, Robinson's parents recognized their son from the surveillance photos released of the shooting, and eventually his father was able to convince Robinson to come to their St. George home, and with the help of a family friend, surrender to authorities on Friday, Sept. 12.",
      "According to the documents, Robinson's mother told investigators that her son had started dating his roommate, whom she said was transitioning from male to female. Two law enforcement sources told CBS News over the weekend that Robinson's roommate was cooperating with investigators and is not expected to be charged at this point.",
      "Robinson, who authorities allege shot Kirk from the roof of a campus building before fleeing \u2014 sparking a two-day manhunt, appeared virtually Tuesday in his first court appearance. He is charged with one count each of aggravated murder and felony discharge of a firearm, and two counts each of obstruction of justice and witness tampering. He also faces one misdemeanor count of committing a violent offense in the presence of a child.",
      "Following Robinson's initial court appearance, the state of Utah filed its intent to seek the death penalty.",
      "A spokesperson for Discord\u00a0also confirmed\u00a0to CBS News on Monday that Robinson appeared to admit to committing the shooting in messages posted to the social media platform last week.",

    "story": [
      "Thousands of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia amid the country's ongoing invasion are being forcibly \"reeducated\" in at least 210 facilities around Russia and Russian-occupied Ukraine, according to a study published Tuesday by the Yale School of Public Health's Humanitarian Research Lab.",
      "The researchers say that Ukrainian children in the eastern regions occupied by Russia since its full-scale invasion began in February 2022 have been sent to the facilities where, \"in many cases, (they) are placed in programs of forced militarization that include, though are not limited to, combat and paratrooper training.\"",
      "\"Children at some facilities have been engaged in the production of military equipment for Russia's armed forces, including drones,\" the Yale study said.",
      "The researchers said their conclusions were based on \"publicly available data sources and commercially available satellite imagery,\" and that the analysts \"evaluated each data source for reliability, veracity, and credibility using assessment criteria derived from the Berkeley Protocol\" for open-source research, and an intelligence assessment framework used by NATO.",
      "The Yale researchers do not provide an estimate of the total number of children abducted by Russia. They note that while some have been returned, \"other groups of children have been held indefinitely. In some cases, children who have entered this network of camps, so-called family centers, and other facilities have entered Russia's program of coerced fostering and adoption, eventually being placed with families in Russia and becoming naturalized citizens of the Russian Federation.\"",
      "The report details at least eight different types of facilities to which Ukrainian children have been taken, including summer camps, mental health institutions, at least one military base and even a monastery. It said the objective for Russian authorities is to indoctrinate the Ukrainian children with pro-Russian, anti-Ukrainian cultural and patriotic narratives.",
      "Ukraine's state-run \"Bring Kids Back\" program, launched by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, says more than 19,500 Ukrainian children have been abducted since Russia's invasion began. It says only about 1,600 have been returned, including 101 who were bought back in August.",
      "In March 2023, the U.N.'s International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin, accusing him of committing \"the war crime of unlawful deportation of population (children) and that of unlawful transfer of population (children) from occupied areas of Ukraine to the Russian Federation.\"",
      "The court also issued an arrest warrant for Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova, the commissioner for children's rights in the Office of the President, accusing her of committing the same crimes.",
      "Zelenskyy said last week that he would raise the issue of abducted Ukrainian children during the U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York next week. He said he would host the event along with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, and that \"many leaders will join us.\"",
      "In August, after meeting with Zelenskyy and European leaders in Washington, President Trump said in a social media post that he and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had discussed \"the massive Worldwide problem of missing children,\" with a goal of \"bringing them home to their families.\"",
      "Von der Leyen, in her own post, thanked Mr. Trump, and added that \"every single Ukrainian child abducted by Russia must be returned to their families.\"",
      "Mr. Trump didn't mention Russia specifically in his own remarks. First lady Melania Trump, several days before the White House meetings, had penned an open letter to Putin pleading with the Russian leader to protect \"the innocence of these children,\" though not specifying which children she was referring to.",
      "Mr. Trump handed that letter to Putin in person when the two men met in Alaska last month, according to The Wall Street Journal.",
      "Russia's state-run media did not indicate any response from the Kremlin to the allegations made in the Yale lab's report. The Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C., didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from CBS News.",
      "Two years ago, in a report published during the Biden administration that was titled \"The Kremlin's War Against Ukraine's Children,\" the State Department noted the ICC arrest warrants, and said Russia's response included \"threats of nuclear strikes, false claims about Western 'experiments on children' and anti-Russian 'hysteria,'\" as well as \"calls for the arrest of ICC judges, and claims that Ukraine's children were taken away 'for their safety.'\"",
      "Putin's government \"appears determined to erase Ukraine's existence as a state by attempting to rob it of its future,\" the Biden-era State Department report said, adding that \"mounting evidence shows Russia uses forcible relocation, re-education, and, in some cases, adoption of Ukraine's children as key components of its systematic efforts to suppress Ukraine's identity, history, and culture.\"",
      "In response to CBS News questions about the Yale study, a State Department spokesperson said President Trump and first lady Melania Trump had \"repeatedly called for the safe return of Ukrainian children home to their families.\"",
      "The spokesperson said Mr. Trump's special envoy to Ukraine, Gen. Keith Kellogg, and and his deputy were working to advance that \"goal along with the President's aim to stop the killing in Ukraine,\" adding that the envoys \"have met with a variety of groups and individuals in that effort.\"",

    "summary": "Christian Brueckner, who prosecutors believe abducted British toddler Madeleine McCann, has been released from prison after serving a sentence in an unrelated rape case.",
    "story": [
      "Christian Brueckner, the convicted rapist identified by German prosecutors as the prime suspect in the 2007 disappearance of British toddler Madeleine McCann in Portugal, was released from prison in northern Germany on Wednesday after serving his sentence in an unrelated rape case.",
      "Shortly after 9 a.m. local time, Brueckner was driven out of the Sehnde prison in a black Audi, accompanied by his lawyer and a police escort. Police confirmed that he had left the facility but said they did not know where he was going.",
      "Brueckner, 48, just completed a seven-year prison sentence for the 2005 rape of a 72-year-old American woman in Portugal. Upon his release, he was fitted with an electronic ankle tag, a condition imposed to enable authorities to monitor his movements. His lawyers have declined to say where he will live.",
      "German prosecutors have said they believe Brueckner is responsible for McCann's disappearance from her family's vacation rental home in the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz, citing evidence including cell phone data that placed him near the resort at the time. McCann was 3 years old at the time.",
      "Brueckner, who lived for years in Portugal's southern Algarve region, where Praia da Luz is located, has multiple prior convictions for sexual offenses, including against children, and a long record of petty crimes. Despite the circumstantial evidence, however, he has never been charged in relation to the McCann case and has always denied any involvement in her disappearance.",
      "To many observers, the case has highlighted significant differences between the legal systems in Germany and the U.K.",
      "Mark Stephens, a consultant at the British legal firm Howard Kennedy, told CBS News the legal thresholds differ between the countries.",
      "\"In the U.K. and the U.S., you need to believe there's better than a 50% chance of a successful prosecution before charges are brought. Circumstantial evidence can be used. The law recognizes that you won't always have key evidence. In a rape case, for example, you need some kind of corroboration, some supporting evidence. But in a murder case, that's the exception \u2014 you don't need that. So, you could prosecute if you thought the circumstantial evidence was sufficient.\"",
      "In Germany, however, he said the legal system sets a much higher threshold for prosecution.",
      "\"The prosecutors' statement says they haven't gathered enough direct evidence to charge him,\" said Stephens. \"That's because under German rules, circumstantial and inferential evidence isn't admissible in the same way.\"",
      "Madeleine's disappearance remains one of the most high-profile unsolved cases in the world, and even after his release, Brueckner will likely remain at the center of the inquiry, as he's been since German prosecutors publicly\u00a0identified him as a suspect\u00a0in 2020.",
      "British investigators had hoped to question Brueckner just days before his release in Germany, to clarify key details about his movements in Praia da Luz around the time that McCann vanished. The London Metropolitan Police submitted a formal request for an interview with him, but Brueckner declined to speak with the investigators earlier this week.",

    "story": [
      "China's coast guard accused a Philippine ship of deliberately ramming one of its vessels on Tuesday near the disputed Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea. The Philippines denied it, saying China's forces used powerful water cannons that damaged its ship and injured a crew member.",
      "A Chinese coast guard statement said more than 10 Philippine government ships coming from various directions entered the waters around the shoal, which is called Huangyan Island in Chinese. It said it deployed water cannons against the vessels.",
      "The encounter came six days after China announced it was designating part of Scarborough Shoal as a national nature reserve. The Philippine government, which calls the shoal Bajo de Masinloc, filed a diplomatic protest.",
      "China and the Philippines have clashed repeatedly around outcroppings in the South China Sea, which China claims almost in its entirety. The two countries are among several that have competing claims to territory in the waters, which are of strategic importance and home to valuable fishing grounds.",
      "The Philippine coast guard said two Chinese coast guard ships hit a Filipino fisheries vessel, the BRP Datu Gumbay Piang, with powerful water cannons for nearly 30 minutes \"resulting in significant damage,\" including in the captain's cabin and the bridge. A glass window was shattered and injured a personnel while the deluge of water caused a short circuit that affected electrical outlets and five outdoor air-conditioning units, it said.",
      "A Chinese navy warship also broadcast a radio notice \"announcing live-fire exercises\" at the shoal which caused panic among Filipino fishermen, said the Philippine coast guard.",
      "The Philippine coast guard and fisheries ships were deployed to the shoal on Tuesday to provide fuel, water, ice and other aid to more than 35 fishing boats in the area.",
      "In August, a Chinese navy ship collided with a Chinese coast guard vessel\u00a0while the latter was chasing a patrol boat from the Philippines at high speed in the South China Sea, according to\u00a0officials in Manila.",
      "And in September 2024,\u00a0a CBS News \"60 Minutes\" crew\u00a0witnessed an incident in which a Chinese coast guard vessel rammed into a Philippine coast guard ship that had deployed for a mission to resupply ships and stations in the South China Sea.",
      "The high-seas accident last month has raised concerns about maritime safety and questions about the extent to which the U.S. should involve itself in longstanding tensions between those countries.",
      "Several friendly countries have backed the Philippines on the nature reserve.",
      "A statement from U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the Chinese action \"yet another coercive move to advance sweeping territorial and maritime claims in the South China Sea at the expense of its neighbors.\"",
      "The U.K. and Australia also expressed concern, and the Canadian Embassy in the Philippines said it opposed attempts to use environmental protection as a way to take control over the disputed Scarborough Shoal.",
      "The Trump administration has supported the Philippines in its dispute with China. In March, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth visited the Philippines and he and Rubio have assured the Philippines that the U.S. commitment to the country's defense remains iron-clad.",

      "After a night of heavy airstrikes, the Israeli military announced Tuesday that its expanded operation in Gaza City \"to destroy Hamas' military infrastructure\" has begun, and warned residents to move south. Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adree announced the expansion of Israel's operation in a post on X, renewing a warning for Gaza City's famine-stricken residents to evacuate.",
      "Many Palestinians \u2014 tens of thousands of whom had sought shelter in Gaza City after fleeing areas further north amid Israel's offensive against Hamas \u2014 have said they're unable to evacuate due to overcrowding in southern Gaza and the high price of transport.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces announced the launch of the next stage of \"Operation Gideon Chariots,\" saying two divisions had begun pushing into the heart of Gaza City, with two regular divisions operating in the surrounding area. It said a third division would join the operation in the coming days.",
      "\"They will surround Gaza City on all sides,\" the IDF said.",
      "After weeks of threatening an expansion of the Israeli military operation in Gaza City, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz also signaled on Tuesday that it had begun.",
      "\"Gaza is burning,\" he said early in the morning. \"The (Israel military) is striking with an iron fist at the terrorist infrastructure and soldiers are fighting heroically to create the conditions for the release of the hostages and the defeat of Hamas. We will not relent and we will not go back \u2014 until the completion of the mission.\"",
      "The United Nations estimated on Monday that over 220,000 Palestinians have fled northern Gaza over the past month, after the Israeli military warned that all residents should leave Gaza City ahead of the operation. An estimated 1 million Palestinians were living in the region around Gaza City before the evacuation warnings.",
      "Palestinian residents reported heavy strikes across Gaza City on Tuesday morning. The city's Shifa Hospital said it received the bodies of 20 people killed in a strike that hit multiple houses in a western neighborhood, with another 90 wounded arriving at the facility in recent hours.",
      "\"A very tough night in Gaza,\" Dr. Mohamed Abu Selmiyah, director of Shifa Hospital, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"The bombing did not stop for a single moment,\" he said. \"There are still bodies under the rubble.\"",
      "The Israeli military did not respond to immediate requests for comment on the strikes but in the past has accused Hamas of building military infrastructure inside civilian areas, especially in Gaza City.",
      "Rubio visits Qatar, says time for peace deal \"running out\"",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio traveled Tuesday from Israel to the energy-rich nation of Qatar for talks with its ruling emir, whose country is still incensed over Israel's strike last week that killed five Hamas members and a local security official.",
      "Arab and Muslim nations denounced the strike at a summit Monday but stopped short of any major action targeting Israel, highlighting the challenge of diplomatically pressuring any change in Israel's conduct.",
      "Egypt, however, escalated its language against Israel, with President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi describing the country as \"an enemy\" in a fiery speech on Monday in Qatar during the Arab leaders' summit.",
      "It was the first time an Egyptian leader had used the term since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1979, said Diaa Rashwan, head of Egypt's State Information Service.",
      "\"Egypt is being threatened,\" Rashwan told the state-run Extra News television late Monday.",
      "El-Sisi's remark comment played prominently across Egyptian newspapers' front pages on Tuesday through Cairo has taken no steps to change its formal diplomatic status with Israel.",
      "Rubio spent about an hour meeting with Qatar's leader before heading back to the airport, where he was next scheduled to fly to the United Kingdom, where President Trump is set to arrive for an official state visit on Tuesday evening.",
      "\"We have a very short window of time in which a deal can happen\" to end the war in Gaza, Rubio warned before arriving in Doha. \"It's a key moment \u2014 an important moment.\"",
      "Rubio said \"a negotiated settlement\" still remained the best option, while acknowledging the dangers an intensified military campaign posed to Gaza.",
      "\"The only thing worse than a war is a protracted one that goes on forever and ever,\" Rubio said. \"At some point, this has to end. At some point, Hamas has to be defanged, and we hope it can happen through a negotiation. But I think time, unfortunately, is running out.\"",

    "story": [
      "An independent panel of experts commissioned by the United Nations Human Rights Council has concluded \"on reasonable grounds that the Israeli authorities and Israeli security forces have committed and are continuing to commit\" acts of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.",
      "In its report published Tuesday, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, and Israel \u2014 which was established by the HRC in 2021 \u2014 said it had collected and analyzed evidence in relation to alleged human rights violations committed by all parties in the Israel-Hamas war, which Israel launched in response to the Hamas-orchestrated Oct. 7, 2023 terror attack.",
      "\"Today, we witness in real time how the promise of 'never again' is broken and tested in the eyes of the world. The ongoing genocide in Gaza is a moral outrage and a legal emergency,\" Navi Pillay, Chair of the Commission, said at a Tuesday news briefing. \"There is no need to wait for the International Court of Justice to declare it a genocide. All states are obligated to use whatever means within its (their) power to prevent the commission of genocide. And so we urge member states to ensure accountability for any crimes that have been committed and prevent further crimes from being committed, not just in Gaza, but the entire occupied Palestinian territory.\"",
      "Israeli's Foreign Minister Gideon Saar called the report \"fake.\"",
      "\"The report relies entirely on Hamas falsehoods, laundered and repeated by others,\" Saar said, echoing the language used in past Israeli government statements responding to accusations it is committing genocide. \"In stark contrast to the lies in the report, Hamas is the party that attempted genocide in Israel \u2014 murdering 1,200 people, raping women, burning families alive, and openly declaring its goal of killing every Jew.\"",
      "Genocide is defined under international law as the commission of certain acts against a group \"with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.\"",
      "Those acts include \"causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group,\" and \"forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.\"",
      "In its report, the commission said it found that Israeli authorities and security forces, \"have committed and are continuing to commit the following actus reus of genocide against the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, namely (i) killing members of the group; (ii) causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; (iii) deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; and (iv) imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group.\"",
      "The commission also said statements made by Israeli authorities have demonstrated \"direct evidence of genocidal intent,\" and that, alongside circumstantial evidence of similar intent, \"the Israeli authorities and Israeli security forces have had and continue to have the genocidal intent to destroy, in whole or in part, the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.\"",
      "Based on its analysis, the commission said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President Isaac Herzog and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant had, \"incited the commission of genocide and that Israeli authorities have failed to take action against them to punish the incitement.\"",
      "\"The Commission concludes that the State of Israel bears responsibility for the failure to prevent genocide, the comission of genocide and the failure to punish genocide against the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip,\" the report said.",
      "\"The commission has not fully assessed statements by other Israeli political and military leaders, including Minister of National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir and Minister of Finance Bezalel Smotrich, and considers that they too should be assessed to determine whether they constitute incitement to commit genocide,\" the commission added.",
      "The report said Israel should \"immediately end the commission of genocide in the Gaza Strip\" and implement a permanent ceasefire, allowing the free flow of humanitarian aid into the Palestinian territory. It also called on other U.N. member states to \"employ all means reasonably available to them to prevent the commission of genocide in the Gaza Strip,\" including stopping the transfer of arms and other equipment to Israel.",
      "A number of scholars and international and Israeli human rights groups had previously accused Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.",
      "In August, the International Association of Genocide Scholars \u2014 a group of academics specializing in the subject \u2014\u00a0declared in a resolution that Israel's actions in Gaza since the 22-month war began constitute genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. The group has in turn faced heavy criticism from Israeli officials and Jewish groups about the way they operate and acquire members, though they have since suspended their membership system in response to what they call a \"campaign of spam and harassment.\"",
      "In July, Israeli rights group B'Tselem and the Physicians for Human Rights organization accused Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.",
      "The International Court of Justice is also hearing a case, brought by South Africa's government, that accuses Israeli forces of committing genocide.",

    "summary": "The ongoing fallout over Epstein is likely to follow Trump on his formal state visit to the U.K., which just lost its ambassador in D.C. to the scandal.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0President Trump arrived in London on Tuesday for a historic second official state visit to the U.K., and he can look forward to the pomp and pageantry of a formal state dinner at Windsor Castle on Wednesday evening, hosted by King Charles III.",
      "But the timing of his visit is potentially awkward for Mr. Trump and his host, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and will likely bring more unwanted questions for the U.S. leader, coming immediately on the heels of the Starmer's decision to fire his ambassador in Washington, Peter Mandelson, in response to new revelations about his past friendship with the late convicted sex offender .",
      "Trump to get an unprecedented second royal reception",
      "In the early weeks of Mr. Trump's second term, Starmer had an ace in the hole to gain some favor as he arrived for a visit at the White House. Starmer came armed with a royal invitation from King Charles for an unprecedented second official state visit.",
      "It was seen as a savvy diplomatic move, with Starmer recognizing Mr. Trump's admiration for the British monarchy and royal family.",
      "\"My relationship is very good with the U.K. and King Charles is my friend. This is the first time this has ever happened, to be honored twice,\" Mr. Trump told reporters at Joint Base Andrews before his departure on Tuesday.",
      "The president is set to be greeted Wednesday with the full pomp, regalia and public spectacle offered by the U.K.'s royals. When they arrive Wednesday in Windsor, just west of London, Mr. Trump and first lady Melania will be taken by royal carriage, alongside King Charles, Queen Camilla and the Prince and Princess of Wales, to Windsor Castle, escorted by three different military bands and a regiment of the British Army on horseback.",
      "Events on the day will include a flypast by British and American F-35 fighter jets, as well as other Royal Air Force planes, all capped by a state banquet at the castle in the evening.",
      "\"I hate to say it, but nobody does it like you people in terms of the pomp and the ceremony,\" Mr. Trump told Starmer at a joint news conference during a visit to one of his golf courses in Scotland in July.",
      "The second official state visit for Mr. Trump is a rarity in modern times. Historically, second-term U.S. presidents have not been offered new full state visits, and have instead generally been invited for tea or lunch with the monarch at Windsor Castle.",
      "\"Ultimately, it's happening because, you know, the royal family \u2014 no pun intended \u2014 is the biggest trump card this government can play at big moments of international statesmanship and diplomacy,\" Roya Nikkhah, the royal editor for the Sunday Times newspaper, told CBS News ahead of Mr. Trump's arrival. \"There's a lot in it for us and our government in terms of national interest, and President Trump will get all those images that he desperately wants to have again.\"",
      "Growing divisions in the United Kingdom",
      "While Mr. Trump is briefly leaving behind a United States still rattled by the assassination of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk last week, he's touching down in a nation facing its own political divisions.",
      "Mr. Trump's visit comes as Starmer faces the most significant political headwinds of his one-year premiership. His government has come under mounting pressure from an ascendant right-wing political movement at home, against a backdrop of growing polarization in Britain. Powerful outside voices, including tech billionaire and former close Trump ally Elon Musk, have been accused of stoking these divisions",
      "A demonstration in London organized by far-right, anti-immigration activist Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, drew more than 110,000 people on Saturday, billed as a rally to \"Unite the Kingdom\" and for free speech. Musk himself addressed the rally by video-link. Eight people were arrested, and a small number of Robinson supporters clashed with police officers who were keeping them apart from counterprotesters.",
      "As CBS News' Haley Ott reported from the protest on Saturday, among the Union Jacks and England flags carried by many members of the crowd, there were also MAGA hats and American flags.",
      "\"Britain is a nation proudly built on tolerance, diversity and respect. Our flag represents our diverse country and we will never surrender it to those that use it as a symbol of violence, fear and division,\" Starmer said in a social media post on Sunday, rebuking some of the behavior seen at the march.",
      "There has also been much criticism of the rhetoric employed by Musk when he addressed the weekend demonstration.",
      "\"Whether you choose violence or not, violence is coming to you. You either fight back or you die,\" the billionaire, who has been a vocal critic of Starmer since he took office in July 2024, told the crowd.",
      "While Mr. Trump may no longer be on friendly terms with Musk, his administration is ideologically aligned with the two central themes of Saturday's demonstration in London: advocating for free speech and an aggressively nationalist immigration policy.",
      "That could make discussions with Mr. Trump diplomatically challenging for Starmer to navigate when they meet later this week.",
      "U.K. ambassador's dismissal over Epstein badly timed for Starmer and Trump",
      "The man who would have had a key role in the organization of the president's state visit is no longer in his post. Peter Mandelson was fired by Starmer as British Ambassador to the United States last week after new details emerged of his ties to Epstein. That also helped put the issue and questions around Mr. Trump's own past relationship with Epstein back in the headlines, a subject he has dismissed as a Democrat-inspired \"hoax.\"",
      "Starmer removed Mandelson from the key post after days of drip-fed revelations about Mandelson's years-long friendship with convicted sex offender Epstein, who was found dead in his jail cell in New York in 2019.",
      "Pressure started mounting on Starmer to take action when messages written by Mandelson to Epstein were released by the U.S. House Oversight Committee earlier this month, as part of a redacted 2003 \"birthday book\" to the late financier. They included a series of short notes accompanied by photos.",
      "Among other personal messages, Mandelson wrote that Epstein was known for \"taking you by surprise... in one of his glorious homes he likes to share with his friends (yum yum),\" and that \"wherever he is in the world, he remains my best pal!\"",
      "The final straw for Starmer, however, came after Bloomberg published a selection of emails on Sept. 10, from about 100 emails said to have been exchanged between Mandelson and Epstein between 2005 and\u00a0 2010. Their contents, including suggestions by Mandelson that Epstein vigorously defend himself against the sexual misconduct allegations, led to Starmer promptly firing the ambassador.",
      "In a podcast interview, Mandelson acknowledged the veracity of his correspondence with Epstein and expressed his deep regret that he had ever interacted with him, insisting he never saw evidence of the financier's crimes and had believed previous rebuttals issued by his attorneys.",
      "The \"birthday book\" in question is the same document The Wall Street Journal first reported the existence of in July, prompting Mr. Trump, who is also alleged to have written a message for Epstein in the book, to file a lawsuit against the newspaper and the owner of its parent company, Rupert Murdoch.",
      "The Wall Street Journal published the full document, showing Mr. Trump's alleged signature, last week.",
      "Mr. Trump denies writing the message, calling it and the signature \"fake.\"",

      "The Biden administration in 2021 imposed restrictions on Hungarian passport holders born outside of Hungary and reduced the timeframe of authorized travel permitted under the Visa Waiver Program, citing a simplified naturalization policy backed by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban that extended citizenship to people born abroad who claimed Hungarian ancestry.",
      "Officials said at the time that nearly 1 million people were granted citizenship between 2011 and 2020 without adequate vetting.",
      "Under the Visa Waiver Program, most citizens of participating countries are allowed to visit the United States for 90 days or fewer, if they obtain approval within the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA). Citizens from more than 40 countries are eligible to travel to the U.S. under the Visa Waiver Program, according to the State Department's\u00a0website.",
      "While ESTA approvals typically allow travel over a span of two years, restrictions added by the U.S. in 2023 had reduced that validity period for the Hungarian travelers born outside the country from two years to one, and limited the authorization to only one entry into the U.S.",
      "Beginning Sept. 30, the Trump administration is restoring the validity period back to two years and allowing Hungarians to make multiple entries into the U.S. within that time.",
      "\"The United States and Hungary have a strong security partnership, and that commitment is reflected in the actions that Hungary has taken to meet the security standards of the Visa Waiver Program,\" Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.",

      "While Mr. Trump has embraced Orban, the Biden administration had a colder relationship with the NATO ally. Then-President Biden criticized the Hungarian leader in 2024 as \"looking for a dictatorship.\" Hungary for months delayed the expansion of NATO to include Sweden and Finland, arguing their additions would antagonize Russia.",

      "Divers have recovered artifacts from the Titanic's sister ship, the Britannic, for the first time since the ocean liner sank in the Aegean Sea more than a century ago after striking a mine during World War I.",
      "The Culture Ministry in Greece said Monday that an 11-member deep-sea diving team conducted a weeklong operation in May to recover artifacts including the ship's bell and the port-side navigation light. The ministry released a video on social media showing divers exploring the wreckage and retrieving objects.",
      "The White Star Line's Britannic, launched in 1914, was designed as a luxury cruise liner, but was requisitioned as a hospital ship during World War I. It was heading toward the island of Lemnos when it struck a mine and sank off the island of Kea, about 45 miles southeast of Athens, on Nov. 21, 1916.",

    "story": [
      "Some of the biggest American names in comedy have signed up to perform at a festival in Saudi Arabia, and they're being urged to speak out against the country's human rights abuses \u2014   and not to be \"complicit in covering up the abuses of a repressive regime,\" by the U.S.-based Human Rights Watch organization.",
      "Saudi Arabia will host the Riyadh Comedy Festival, which organizers say will be the \"world's largest comedy festival,\" from Sept. 26 to Oct. 9. Some of North America's most popular comedians, along with comics from Europe and elsewhere, are featured on the bill, including Dave Chapelle, Kevin Hart and Bill Burr.",
      "The festival will be the latest in a series of sports and cultural events hosted by Saudi Arabia's government that critics say amount to an effort to obscure the country's reputation for rampant human rights abuses.",
      "\"The Saudi government has invested billions into high profile entertainment events like these in a deliberate effort to whitewash the country's human rights record and deflect from the egregious abuses that continue to happen inside of the country,\" Human Rights Watch researcher Joey Shea told CBS News. \"These investments are a part of the broader strategy to... have people thinking about a comedy event, for example, rather than the soaring number of executions that are happening inside of the country.\"",
      "HRW noted specifically the state execution of journalist Turki Al-Jasser, who was killed in June following seven years of detention after reportedly being identified as the author of several anonymous tweets criticizing the Saudi royal family.",
      "Al-Jasser had been convicted of terrorism and high treason on the basis of posts he was accused of authoring, according to UNESCO.",
      "UNESCO's director general Audrey Azoulay condemned his execution, saying: \"A death sentence imposed on journalists constitutes a serious attack on freedom of expression and freedom of the press. Journalists must be able to report without fear for their lives or safety.\"",
      "Reporters Without Borders, an organization that works to protect journalists, branded the charges against Al-Jasser as \"false.\"",
      "\"This execution of a journalist went forward to very little international criticism and this is clearly a result of these billions that had been invested in the country's whitewashing strategy,\" Shea told CBS News.",
      "When asked whether they believed the comedians would be able to freely tell jokes at the festival, the HRW researcher predicted there would be clear red lines drawn by organizers to prevent any criticism of Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman, who has already taken over as ruler of the highly conservative Islamic kingdom, as well as his policies and the broader royal family.",
      "Shea called on the high-profile entertainers attending the event \u2014 funding for which comes from the Saudi government's General Entertainment Authority \u2014   to mitigate the positive effect that their presence might have on the country's reputation for human rights abuses, including by \"speaking out about the abuses.\"",
      "Tim Dillon, one of the comedians scheduled to perform at the Riyadh festival, claimed on his podcast that he's being paid $315,000 for a single show, and that some of his more famous colleagues would receive around $1.6 million for their appearances.",
      "CBS News has contacted the publicists representing billed attendees Bill Burr, Mark Normand, Kevin Hart, Sebastian Maniscalco, Dave Chapelle, Louis C.K., Whitney Cummings, Tom Segura, Andrew Schulz and Jim Jeffries, but has received no comment from any of them regarding their expected appearances in Saudi Arabia.",
      "CBS News asked Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs for comment on HRW's assertions, but has not received a response.",
      "One of the highest-profile cases of the Saudis' purported efforts to change their image came in 2021, with the launch of LIV Golf, a golf league that saw seasoned professionals defect from the famed PGA Tour in exchange for highly profitable contracts.",
      "Critics accused the golfers of helping the Saudi government to \"sportswash\" its reputation, only three years after Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, an outspoken critic of the county's leadership, was brutally murdered inside a Saudi diplomatic office in Istanbul, Turkey.",
      "A CIA report concluded with a medium to high degree of confidence that the killing was likely carried out at bin Salman's orders.",

    "story": [
      "Scientists have discovered what's thought to be the oldest known mummies in the world in southeastern Asia dating back up to 12,000 years.",
      "Mummification prevents decay by preserving dead bodies. The process can happen naturally in places like the sands of Chile's Atacama Desert or the bogs of Ireland where conditions can fend off decomposition. Humans across various cultures also mummified their ancestors through embalming to honor them or send their souls to the afterlife.",
      "Egypt's mummies may be the most well-known, but until now some of the oldest mummies were prepared by a fishing people called the Chinchorro about 7,000 years ago in what's now Peru and Chile.",
      "A new study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences pushes that timeline back.",
      "Researchers found human remains that were buried in crouched or squatted positions with some cuts and burn marks in various archaeological sites across China and Vietnam and to a lesser extent, from the Philippines, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.",
      "Studying the bones further, scientists discovered the bodies were likely exposed to heat. That suggested the bodies had been smoke-dried over a fire and mummified by hunter-gatherer communities in the area.",
      "The practice \"allowed people to sustain physical and spiritual connections with their ancestors, bridging time and memory,\" study author Hirofumi Matsumura with Sapporo Medical University in Japan said in an email.",
      "The results were \"a great surprise,\" said Hsiao-chun Hung, senior research fellow at Australian National University.",
      "\"The bones are so ancient, and it is remarkable to discover that this tradition is so old, connecting the practices of ancient peoples with those still found in some communities today,\" Hung said.",
      "The process allowed relatives to maintain contact with the deceased, and in some cases was believed to allow the spirit to roam freely during the day and return to a body at night.",
      "\"I believe this reflects something deeply human \u2014 the timeless wish that our loved ones might never leave us, but remain by our side forever,\" Hung told Agence France-Presse.",
      "The researchers theorize that the practice may have been common in ancient Asian civilizations.",
      "\"This tradition may have been known among hunter-gatherer societies across a vast region, for many millennia,\" they wrote in the study,",
      "Dating methods used on the mummies could have been more robust and it's not yet clear that mummies were consistently smoke-dried across all these locations in southeastern Asia, said human evolution expert Rita Peyroteo Stjerna with Uppsala University in Sweden, who was not involved with the research.",
      "The findings offer \"an important contribution to the study of prehistoric funerary practices,\" she said in an email.",
      "Mummies are far from a thing of the past. Even today, Indigenous communities in Australia and Papua New Guinea smoke-dry and mummify their dead, scientists said.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration has added Colombia to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in nearly three decades.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Monday added Colombia to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in almost 30 years, a stinging rebuke to a traditional U.S. ally that reflects a recent surge in cocaine production and fraying ties between the White House and the country's leftist president.",
      "Even as it determined that Colombia had failed to comply with its international counternarcotics obligations, the Trump administration issued a waiver of sanctions that would have triggered major aid cuts, citing vital U.S. national interests.",
      "Nonetheless, it is a major step against one of the United States' staunchest allies in Latin America, and it could further hamper efforts to restore security in the countryside, according to Adam Isacson, a security researcher at the Washington Office on Latin America.",
      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro said he regretted the decision, which overlooked decades of bloodshed by Colombian security forces and civilians all in the name of a U.S.-led drug war.",
      "\"Everything we do has nothing to do with the Colombian people,\" Petro said during a televised address Monday night. \"It is to prevent the American society from smearing its noses in order to work, work and work, because this drug is a stimulant.\"",
      "The U.S. last added Colombia to the list, through a process known as decertification, in 1997 when the country's cartels \u2014 through threats of violence and money \u2014 had poisoned much of the nation's institutions.",
      "It \"is a blunt tool and a huge irritant in bilateral relations that goes well beyond drug issues and makes cooperation far harder in any number of areas,\" Isacson said. \"That's why it's so rarely used.\"",
      "The president at the time, Ernesto Samper, was facing credible accusations of receiving illicit campaign contributions from the now-defunct Cali cartel, and a plane he was set to use for a trip to New York to attend the U.N. General Assembly session was found carrying 4 kilograms of heroin.",
      "A remarkable turnaround began once Samper left office. Successive U.S. administrations \u2014 both Republican and Democrats \u2014 sent billions in foreign assistance to Colombia to eradicate illegal coca crops, strengthen its armed forces in the fight against drug-fueled rebels and provide economic alternatives to poor farmers who are on the lowest rungs of the cocaine industry.",
      "That cooperation started to unravel following the suspension a decade ago of aerial eradication of coca fields with glyphosate. It followed a Colombian high court ruling that determined the U.S.-funded program was potentially harmful to the environment and farmers.",
      "A 2016 peace accord with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the nation's largest rebel group known as FARC, also committed Colombia to rolling back punitive policies likened to the U.S. spraying of Agent Orange during the Vietnam War in favor of state building, rural development and voluntary crop substitution.",
      "Since then, cocaine production has skyrocketed. The amount of land dedicated to cultivating coca, the base ingredient of cocaine, has almost tripled in the past decade to a record 253,000 hectares in 2023, according to the latest report available from the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime. That is almost triple the size of New York City.",
      "Along with production, drug seizures have also soared to 654 metric tons so far this year. Colombia seized a record 884 metric tons last year.",
      "But unlike past governments, manual eradication of coca crops under Petro's leadership has slowed, to barely 5,048 hectares this year \u2014 far less than the 68,000 hectares uprooted in the final year of his conservative predecessor's term and well below the government's own goal of 30,000 hectares.",
      "Petro, a former rebel himself, also has angered senior U.S. officials by denying American extradition requests, as well as criticizing the Trump administration's immigration crackdown and its efforts to combat drug trafficking in neighboring Venezuela.",
      "\"Under my administration, Colombia does not collaborate in assassinations,\" Petro said on Sept. 5 after the U.S. military carried out a deadly strike on a small Venezuelan vessel in the Caribbean that the Trump administration said was transporting cocaine bound for the U.S.",
      "\"The failure of Colombia to meet its drug control obligations over the past year rests solely with its political leadership,\" Trump said in a presidential memo submitted to Congress. \"I will consider changing this designation if Colombia's government takes more aggressive action to eradicate coca and reduce cocaine production and trafficking, as well as hold those producing, trafficking, and benefiting from the production of cocaine responsible, including through improved cooperation with the United States to bring the leaders of Colombian criminal organizations to justice.\"",
      "Under U.S. law, the president annually must identify countries that have failed to meet their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements during the previous 12 months.",
      "In addition to Colombia, the Trump administration listed four other countries \u2014 Afghanistan, Bolivia, Myanmar and Venezuela \u2014 as among 23 major drug transit or drug-production countries that have failed to meet their international obligations. With the exception of Afghanistan, the White House determined that U.S. assistance to those countries was vital to national interests and therefore they would be spared any potential sanctions.",
      "The redesignation of Venezuela as a country that has failed to adequately fight narcotics smuggled from neighboring Colombia comes against the backdrop of a major U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean that has already led to two deadly strikes on small Venezuelan vessels that the Trump administration said were transporting cocaine bound for the U.S.",
      "\"In Venezuela, the criminal regime of indicted drug trafficker Nicol\u00e1s Maduro leads one of the largest cocaine trafficking networks in the world, and the United States will continue to seek to bring Maduro and other members of his complicit regime to justice for their crimes,\" Trump's designation said. \"We will also target Venezuelan foreign terrorist organizations such as Tren de Aragua and purge them from our country.\"",

    "story": [
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met Monday in Jerusalem with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as close U.S. ally Qatar gathered other Arab nations' leaders for a summit to issue unified condemnation of last week's Israeli airstrike targeting Hamas leaders in the Qatari capital.",
      "On Sunday, President Trump urged Netanyahu's government to be \"very careful\" following the airstrike in Doha.",
      "\"They have to do something about Hamas, but Qatar has been a great ally to the United States,\" Mr. Trump told reporters at Morristown airport in New Jersey.",
      "Speaking Monday alongside Rubio, Netanyahu heaped praise on the Trump administration for its staunch, increasingly unique international support of Israel's tactics in its ongoing war against Hamas \u2014 which has long been designated a terrorist organization by the U.S., Israel and the European Union \u2014 in the Gaza Strip.",
      "\"Your presence here today sends a clear message that America stands with Israel,\" Netanyahu said.",
      "The Israeli leader has vigorously defended last week's strike in Doha, saying Israeli fighter jets targeted senior Hamas leaders responsible for the Hamas-led, Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack that killed some 1,200 people and saw 251 others taken as hostages back into Gaza.",
      "Hamas has said that five of its members were killed, but that Israel failed to kill its intended targets \u2014 senior members of the group's political negotiating team, who have long been based in Doha, with the knowledge and backing of both Israel and the U.S.",
      "Rubio, pressed to respond to the anger in Doha over the strike last week, told reporters at the news conference with Netanyahu that \"we have strong relationships with our Gulf allies\u2026 We have been engaged with them consistently before what happened and after what happened.\"",
      "\"Irrespective of what has occurred, the reality is we still have 48 hostages. We still have Hamas that is holding Gaza hostage and using civilians as human shields\u2026 as long as they are around there will be no peace in this region,\" Rubio said.",
      "A senior State Department official told CBS News Monday that Rubio will travel to Qatar after his Israel visit, before flying to the United Kingdom for President Trump's state visit there.",
      "Addressing reporters Saturday at Joint Base Andrews prior to his departure, Rubio said he would be speaking with Netanyahu to \"get a much better understanding of what their plans are moving forward.\"",
      "\"What's happened has happened. Obviously, we were not happy about it. The president was not happy with it,\" Rubio said, referring to the strike in Doha. \"Now we need to move forward and figure out what comes next. Because at the end of the day, when all is said and done, there is still a group called Hamas, which is an evil group that still has weapons and is terrorizing.\"",
      "Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani issued a fresh condemnation of Israel's attack on Sunday, and he called \"for the international community to stop its double standards and punish Israel for its crimes.\"",
      "Qatar is a key U.S. ally and it has long hosted the largest American military base in the Middle East, the Al-Udeid Air Base, where there are thousands of U.S. troops based.",
      "A source familiar with the discussions at the emergency Arab and Muslim leaders summit in Doha on Monday told CBS News a draft resolution would see them condemn, Israel's \"hostile acts including genocide, ethnic cleansing, [and] starvation\" in Gaza, which, it will say, threatens \"prospects of peace and coexistence\" in the region.",
      "Israel has vehemently denied multiple accusations that its war in Gaza amounts to a genocide against Palestinians, arguing that its military campaign is solely against Hamas militants whom it accuses of putting civilians in harms way by using them as human shields.",
      "The source familiar with the draft statement from the Doha summit said the resolution would call \"on the international community to coordinate efforts to impose international sanctions on Israel \u2014 suspending the supply of weapons, munitions, and military material, and reviewing diplomatic and economic relations \u2014   to stop its crimes against the Palestinian people and attacks on regional countries.\"",
      "Israel's war has killed more than 64,000 Palestinians in the nearly two years since it began, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Ministry of Health, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Israel rejects that figure but has not offered its own estimate and does not permit foreign journalists to enter Gaza and operate independently.",
      "The United Nations considers the tally from the Gazan health ministry the most reliable information available on the war's death toll.",
      "Last month, Israel declared Gaza City, the Palestinian Territory's biggest population center, a \"dangerous combat zone\" and a Hamas stronghold. In recent days, Israeli military forces have ramped up an aerial assault on the city, toppling several more high-rise buildings on Sunday in what was already an apocalyptic landscape.",
      "The U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly voted Friday to support a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict \u2014 the long-standing call for an independent Palestinian state to be created alongside Israel as part of a negotiated peace agreement, which has been a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy for decades.",
      "President Trump, who previously voiced support for a two-state solution, has more recently distanced his administration from adherence to that objective, despite rising support internationally for Palestinian statehood.",
      "Israel and the U.S. were among the 10 countries that voted against the resolution, and before the vote, Netanyahu reiterated his government's stance that, \"there will be no Palestinian state.\"",
      "The U.N. resolution also condemned Israel's alleged attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure in Gaza and its \"siege and starvation, which have produced a devastating humanitarian catastrophe and protection crisis.\"",
      "The non-binding resolution, which 142 nations supported, also called for the release of all remaining Israeli hostages and outlined a vision in which the Palestinian Authority, which currently partially administers the Israeli-occupied West Bank, would govern and control all Palestinian territory, with a transitional administrative committee immediately established under its umbrella after a ceasefire in Gaza.",

    "summary": "Christian Brueckner, a sex offender identified as the prime suspect in the 2007 disappearance of Madeleine McCann, is set to be released from a German prison.",
    "story": [
      "Berlin \u2014\u00a0Christian Brueckner, the convicted sex offender named by German authorities as the prime suspect in the disappearance of British toddler Madeleine McCann almost two decades ago, has refused to be interviewed by U.K. police just days before his expected release from prison.",
      "The 48-year-old German national is due to walk free by Wednesday after serving a seven-year sentence for a separate crime, the rape of a 72-year-old American woman in the same region of Portugal from which McCann vanished during a vacation with her family.",
      "While Brueckner remains under formal investigation over McCann's 2007 disappearance, he has never been charged in connection with the case and he continues to deny any involvement.",
      "His decision to decline the London Metropolitan Police's formal request for an interview is being seen as a setback in the long running search for answers in the case that has frustrated investigators in Britain, Portugal and Germany for years.",
      "British Investigators hoped to question Brueckner to clarify key details about his movements in Praia da Luz, the resort town in Portugal's southern Algarve region from which McCann, then three, disappeared. She vanished from her family's rental apartment while her parents had dinner nearby.",
      "For many connected to the case, Brueckner's looming release represents both a pivotal moment and an obstacle. Authorities have been weighing how much oversight they can reasonably maintain over the convicted sex offender once he is no longer behind bars.",
      "Prosecutors in the city of Braunschweig have petitioned the regional court in Hildesheim for what's known as supervisory oversight, a form of monitoring similar to parole that could allow them to impose strict conditions on Brueckner after his release, possibly including an ankle tracking tag.",
      "Brueckner could also be required to declare a fixed place of residence, inform authorities of any change in address or workplace, and face restrictions on where he is permitted to travel. Such restrictions could include barring him from areas linked to his past crimes. He could also be prohibited from leaving Germany without requesting explicit approval from authorities.",
      "Brueckner's attorney Friedrich Fuelscher declined to comment when asked by CBS News about the possibility of his client being subjected to supervisory oversight measures.",
      "A regional court will ultimately decide what measures, if any, to implement following Brueckner's release.",
      "Even if supervisory oversight measures are granted, they are unlikely to satisfy critics who believe the circumstantial evidence linking Brueckner to the McCann case should dictate more close cooperation with British investigators.",
      "His refusal to answer U.K. detectives' questions means they won't get a chance to push him about inconsistencies in his alibis or to confront him directly with witness statements they have gathered over the last 18 years.",
      "The McCann case remains one of the world's most high-profile missing persons investigations.",
      "Brueckner has been at the center of the inquiry since German prosecutors publicly identified him as a suspect in 2020, citing phone records and his history of violent crimes in Portugal's Algarve region. But no charges have ever been brought against him in the McCann case, as the circumstantial evidence has been deemed insufficient to move forward with charges under German law.",

    "published": "Thu, 11 Sep 2025 12:54:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The ICE raid that swept up 300 South Koreans in Georgia has strained an important bilateral relationship, and highlighted a significant challenge.",
    "story": [
      "More than 300 South Korean nationals detained by federal agents in a massive immigration raid last week on a Hyundai plant in Georgia for alleged visa violations were released from a detention center early Thursday and boarded a charter flight back to their country.",
      "The flight, which departed Atlanta, is expected to land in South Korea on Friday afternoon, according to The Associated Press.",
      "The South Korean workers were among some 475 people detained on Sept. 4 by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents at a still-under construction joint Hyundai-LG electric vehicle battery facility near Savannah. ICE said they were suspected of living and working in the U.S. illegally.",
      "Earlier Thursday, CBS News photographer Darrall Johnson watched as the Koreans boarded eight buses that then left for the airport, where a Korean Air charter flight was waiting to fly them home. Johnson said a cart full of documents was loaded onto one of the buses.",
      "South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, in an address delivered Thursday in Seoul, said 316 South Koreans would be on the flight, including 10 women. He said one South Korean had decided to remain in the U.S. as they have family members in the country.   The Foreign Ministry said there were also 14 non-Korean nationals boarding the plane, three Japanese, 10 Chinese and one Indonesian.",
      "The ministry had said the flight was expected to take off on Wednesday, but that it was delayed due to unspecified circumstances in the U.S. On Thursday, President Lee said the delay was caused by discussion that was ongoing Wednesday over the details of the transport arrangements for the South Korean nationals between the ICE detention facility and the Atlanta airport.",
      "The detention of hundreds of South Koreans in an ICE facility tested U.S.-South Korea ties that are important politically, militarily and economically. South Korea is the biggest foreign direct investor in the U.S. and the sixth biggest trading partner overall.",
      "President Lee Jae Myung, visiting the White House in July, pledged $350 billion in new U.S. investment to sweeten a trade-and-tariff deal with President Trump.",
      "\"The sentiment is obviously very, very negative,\" James Kim, Chairman and CEO of the American Chamber of Commerce in Seoul, told CBS News. \"In my office, I usually have my TV turned on to the news \u2014 and this is obviously covered from morning to evening constantly. But everyone who I speak to, they view America as its number-one partner here from South Korea. Yes, we're going to have some challenging times.\"",
      "South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun, was peppered with demands from angry lawmakers during a parliamentary session in Seoul on Sept. 8, before he departed for meetings with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other U.S. officials.",
      "Lawmaker Kim Joon Hyun demanded that Cho respond to the ICE raid by launching investigations into every U.S. national teaching English in South Korea who could be working illegally on a tourist visa.",
      "\"Are we giving our money, technology, and investment to the United States only to be treated like this?,\" Kim asked.",
      "Cho replied by saying he would try to negotiate with Rubio to increase the number of visas issued to highly skilled Korean nationals to work in specialty occupations in the U.S.",
      "The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said the ICE raid was the biggest single-site enforcement action in the agency's history. ICE alleges that the South Korean workers either overstayed their visa waiver permits, known as ESTAs, which allow business visits of up to 90 days, or were holding visas that did not permit them to perform manual labor, called B-1 business visas.",
      "Kim, at the American Chamber in Seoul, called it a \"blip\" in U.S.-Korea ties and said he was \"very, very optimistic about a much brighter future between the two\" countries.",
      "South Korea's president, however, took a more critical tone.",
      "\"As the president who is in charge of national safety, I feel a great responsibility,\" Lee said Tuesday. \"I hope that the unfair infringement of our people and corporate activities for the joint development of both Korea and the United States will not happen again.\"",
      "A poll conducted in South Korea found that almost 60% of respondents said they were disappointed by the U.S. crackdown and called the measures \"excessive,\" while about 31% said the ICE action was \"inevitable\" and that they could understand the reasoning.",
      "President Trump, in a Sunday post on his Truth Social platform, addressed all foreign companies operating in the U.S., saying \"your investments are welcome, and we encourage you to LEGALLY bring your very smart people.\"",
      "Kim at the chamber of commerce urged companies to heed the advice.",
      "\"My key message is listen to what President Trump said today. He wants to encourage more foreign companies to invest in America. Bring your people, bring your resources into America, but do it legally,\" he told CBS News.",
      "\"An opportunity to really fix some things\" with a key U.S. ally",
      "Industry experts caution, however, that it may be difficult to maintain investment levels under those guidelines, as securing visas can take years, while many projects face strict deadlines and delays can drive up costs. There is a shortage of highly skilled workers in the U.S., meanwhile, for battery manufacturing, semiconductor and modern shipbuilding industries \u2014 all arenas in which South Korea has been investing heavily for years.",
      "Such jobs can require years of experience, not just a few months of on-the-job training.",
      "A spokesperson for South Korea's Foreign Ministry told CBS News that since Mr. Trump's second term began, it had already reached out 52 times on the matter of securing more visas for highly-skilled workers.",
      "Kim, the U.S. chamber of commerce leader, said the current upset in relations represented \"an opportunity to really fix some things that could be in the grey area, make it a lot more clear, so that they can have an even better relationship.\"",
      "He said that, given Seoul's importance as an investor in the U.S., it may be a good time for Washington to consider adopting a new policy that allows South Koreans to more easily come and work in the U.S.",
      "\"I think that in the past, Korea may not have been a significant investor in the United States, but now they are,\" he said. \"So I think it's worthy and deserving of that kind of a new status.\"",
      "Mr. Trump gave a nod in his Truth Social post to the notion that the U.S. does need foreign expertise, saying foreign companies should bring people over to help train American workers \u2014 and then hire them to do the work themselves.",
      "Rubio, during his meeting Wednesday in Washington with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho, \"said the United States welcomes ROK (South Korea) investment into the United States and stated his interest in deepening cooperation on this front,\" according to a readout shared by the State Department, which did not mention the ICE raid in Georgia.",
      "Rubio and Cho discussed advancing U.S.-South Korean ties \"through a forward-looking agenda\" that \"revitalizes American manufacturing through ROK investment in shipbuilding and other strategic sectors, and promotes a fair and reciprocal trade partnership,\" the State Department said.",
      "According to South Korea's Foreign Ministry, \"Cho expressed deep concern over the public disclosure of the detention of Korean workers who came to the United States to share technology and know-how and contribute to the Trump administration's efforts to revitalize American manufacturing, which has deeply hurt and shocked all Koreans.\"",
      "The ministry's statement said Cho had \"strongly requested the U.S. administration's special attention and support to ensure that these workers, who are not criminals, can quickly depart the US without physical restraint, such as handcuffs, and that they will not face any disadvantages in future visits to the U.S. He also proposed the establishment of a working group between the U.S. and South Korea to discuss various measures, including the creation of new visa categories, to prevent similar incidents from recurring.\"",

      "Apple Watch Series 11 now includes FDA-cleared hypertension notification. (Apple)",
      "Apple Watch hypertension alerts explained",
      "Hypertension is often called the \"silent killer\" because it can strike without symptoms. Left unchecked, it increases the risk of heart attack, stroke and kidney disease. By adding passive blood pressure monitoring, Apple Watch aims to help millions detect early warning signs.",
      "Using its optical heart sensor, the watch reviews how your blood vessels respond to heartbeats over 30-day periods. If it detects consistent patterns of hypertension, you'll get a notification. Apple expects the feature could alert more than 1 million people with undiagnosed hypertension in its first year alone.",
      "Apple Watch sends users a \"Possible Hypertension\" alert when heart data shows consistent signs of elevated blood pressure. Paired with the iPhone, users can log blood pressure and follow up with doctors. (Apple)",
      "Clinical validation of Apple Watch hypertension feature",
      "Apple built the new hypertension notification feature on a foundation of years of health research. Since the launch of Apple Watch, heart health tools like ECG, AFib History and irregular rhythm notifications have helped users catch issues early. The hypertension notification now extends that mission by addressing one of the most common and dangerous silent conditions.",
      "The feature works in the background during waking hours, analyzing photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, changes in blood volume under the skin, to detect patterns that suggest chronic high blood pressure. You do not need to calibrate the feature or take direct blood pressure readings with the watch. Instead, the device tracks signals over 30 days and sends a notification if consistent signs of hypertension appear.",
      "CAN YOUR APPLE WATCH DETECT PREGNANCY?",
      "Study results confirm accuracy of hypertension alerts",
      "Apple developed the algorithm using data from more than 100,000 study participants across diverse ages, races, body types, and health statuses. The company then validated its accuracy through a pivotal clinical study with over 2,000 participants, who wore Apple Watch alongside an at-home cuff to compare results.",
      "The validation study showed the feature achieved a specificity rate above 92%, meaning it minimized false positives. Sensitivity rates were especially strong for Stage 2 hypertension, the more severe form of the condition, where the feature identified more than half of users at risk. That accuracy could help prevent strokes, heart attacks and kidney disease in those who may not otherwise know they have hypertension.",
      "Importantly, the study confirmed that the feature performed consistently across age groups, genders, races and skin tones, making it reliable for Apple's global user base. Apple also ran usability testing to fine-tune onboarding and notification language so people understand the alerts and what actions to take next.",
      "By passively monitoring and flagging possible signs of hypertension, Apple Watch helps fill a dangerous gap in diagnosis. Hypertension often goes unnoticed for years, but now, you can be alerted within just one month of wearing the watch.",

Their approach automatically flags signals that suggest you may have high blood pressure and encourages you to check it out. That\u2019s especially important because so many people remain undiagnosed. The feature also provides a way to archive blood pressures, so if people are measuring at home, they can bring that information to their doctor. This isn\u2019t a one-stop solution, but it has the potential to help consumers take charge of their health and identify hypertension earlier.

    "summary": "New research shows how fatty acids in cooking oil can safely dissolve and recover silver from circuit boards without harmful chemicals or environmental damage.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out whats clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "What if your old bottle of cooking oil could help save the planet and your smartphone? That's the big idea behind a groundbreaking discovery by researchers in Finland.",
      "Scientists from the University of Helsinki and the University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 have found that you can recover silver from electronic waste using common kitchen ingredients like vegetable oil and hydrogen peroxide. This sustainable, scalable method published in the Chemical Engineering Journal could change how we mine precious metals from our growing piles of electronic junk.",

      "OLD SMARTPHONES ARE BEING TURNED INTO TINY DATA CENTERS",
      "Scientists have discovered a new method of silver extraction from electronics by using cooking oil. (Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "How cooking oil recovers silver from electronic waste",
      "Here's how it works. Fatty acids found in oils like sunflower or olive oil are mixed with hydrogen peroxide. When heated slightly, this combo safely dissolves silver from old circuit boards, wires or keyboard connectors. Then, using ethyl acetate, a far less toxic alternative to industrial solvents, researchers pull out the silver in a solid form. Unlike traditional methods that rely on harsh acids or cyanide-based solutions, this technique avoids toxic runoff and air pollution. Think of it as salad dressing meets science lab, without the environmental mess.",
      "Why recycling silver from e-waste is urgently needed",
      "Silver powers the devices you use every day, such as phones, solar panels, electric vehicles and even medical tech. But less than 20% of it gets recycled. As demand rises and natural resources shrink, finding clean ways to reclaim silver isn't just smart, it's necessary. Silver prices have surged sixfold in the last 25 years. At the same time, supply has lagged. That makes e-waste a goldmine, literally, for anyone who can unlock its hidden metals without poisoning the environment.",

      "Fatty acids found in cooking oil can stabilize silver ions for easier extraction. (Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images)",
      "How scientists extract silver using fatty acids and light",
      "To figure out exactly how this all works, researchers used advanced computer models to study how fatty acids interact with silver ions. The process not only stabilizes the silver but also allows for easy recovery using light and simple solvents. Better still, the ingredients can be reused, and there's no chemical waste or massive cost. And it's highly selective. The method targets silver while leaving other metals behind, a major step forward in urban mining. In testing, even silver-coated keyboard connectors were cleanly processed into pure elemental silver powder using this system.",
      "Indian laborers sift through a heap of pre-owned mobile phones in an electronic waste workshop Dec. 5, 2023, in New Delhi, India.\u00a0 (Yawar Nazir/Getty Images)",
      "What this means for you",
      "This research brings us closer to safe, at-home or small-scale recycling kits that could recover silver from old gadgets. Recyclers and manufacturers could adopt this method to reduce chemical waste and operating costs, while protecting workers and the environment. This method supports a future where nothing goes to waste. It keeps valuable materials in use, cutting down the need for mining and pollution. Silver is vital for making many of the tech items we use every day. Reusing it responsibly means cleaner energy at a lower cost and less reliance on mined resources.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "We've long known that waste is a problem. Now, it might also be the solution. By turning everyday ingredients into powerful recycling tools, scientists are showing us what's possible when chemistry and sustainability meet. The process is still being refined, but the promise is clear: a greener future where reclaiming valuable metals doesn't cost the earth, or our health.",

      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Even if a hacker obtains your password,\u00a02FA\u00a0can stop them in their tracks. AI tools now help criminals generate highly realistic phishing attempts designed to trick you into handing over logins. By enabling\u00a02FA, you add an extra layer of protection that they cannot easily bypass. Choose app-based codes or a physical key whenever possible, as these are more secure than text messages, which are easier for attackers to intercept.",
      "AI-driven attacks often exploit the most basic weaknesses, such as outdated software. Once a hacker knows which companies or individuals are running old systems, they can use automated scripts to break in within minutes. Regular updates close those gaps before they can be targeted. Setting your devices and apps to update automatically removes one of the easiest entry points that criminals rely on.",
      "One of the most alarming details in the Anthropic report was how the hacker used AI to craft convincing extortion notes. The same tactics are being applied to phishing emails and texts sent to everyday users. If you receive a message demanding immediate action, such as clicking a link, transferring money or downloading a file, treat it with suspicion. Stop, check the source and verify before you act.",
      "The hacker in this case built custom malware with the help of AI. That means malicious software is getting smarter, faster and harder to detect. Strong antivirus software that constantly scans for suspicious activity provides a critical safety net. It can identify phishing emails and detect ransomware before it spreads, which is vital now that AI tools make these attacks more adaptive and persistent.",

      "The attack relies on ClickFix tactics, where victims searching for Mac troubleshooting help are lured to fake websites or GitHub repositories. These spoofed sites trick users into copying and pasting a one-line command in Terminal, supposedly to fix an error. Instead, the command silently downloads Shamos, bypasses macOS Gatekeeper protections, and installs the malware.",
      "Once inside, Shamos searches for sensitive data, Apple Notes, Keychain items, browser passwords, and even cryptocurrency wallets. The stolen information is zipped and sent directly to attackers, often alongside additional malware like botnet modules or fake Ledger wallet apps.",

These pages pose as trusted troubleshooting guides and appear in search results for common Mac issues, such as \"how to flush resolver cache.\"",
      "The websites encourage victims to copy and paste commands that download malicious Bash scripts. These scripts grab the user's password, remove file protections, and launch Shamos.

      "Copy-pasting commands into Terminal may seem like an easy fix, but it's also one of the easiest ways for attackers to bypass Apple's built-in protections. If you see a command on a website, forum, or GitHub repository, don't execute it unless you fully understand what it does. Instead, confirm with Apple's official support site or the Apple Community forums, where experienced users and moderators can verify safe troubleshooting steps.",

If the account looks suspicious, inactive, or brand-new, avoid it.",

A personal data removal service scans data broker sites and removes your exposed information, making it harder for attackers to resell or exploit it after a breach.

      "Apple showcased new accessories for its iPhones, including a low-profile MagSafe battery pack. (Apple)",
      "Apple used the event to highlight a series of accessories that show how the company expects people to use its new iPhones. The most talked about was the\u00a0low-profile MagSafe battery pack, created to address the iPhone 17 Air's biggest weakness: vague \"all-day\" battery claims. When attached, the Air can stretch to 40 hours of video playback, turning what could have been a limitation into a selling point for Apple's ecosystem.",
      "To complement the Air's slim profile, Apple also revealed a\u00a0new translucent case and a\u00a0lightweight bumper. The translucent case keeps the 5.6mm design visible while still protecting it, while the bumper adds shock resistance around the edges without adding bulk. Both aim to reassure buyers who worry that the thinnest iPhone yet might be more fragile.",
      "For the Pro and Pro Max models, Apple introduced\u00a0TechWoven cases made from a durable fabric blend. What stood out was the addition of an\u00a0optional cross-body strap, giving users a hands-free way to carry their phones. Apple leaned into the idea of the iPhone as not just a device but also a lifestyle accessory that blends technology with personal style.",
      "Together, the MagSafe battery, translucent Air case, protective bumper and fashion-forward TechWoven cases with cross-body straps showed Apple's strategy clearly. Accessories are no longer secondary; they are central to how Apple expects customers to protect, power and personalize their iPhones.",

      "Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz criticized a United Nations report accusing Israel of genocide, warning that the Trump administration and Congress had tools at their disposal to sanction those behind it.",
      "The report, issued Tuesday by the United Nations Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory (COI), said, \"the State of Israel bears responsibility for the failure to prevent genocide, the commission of genocide, and the failure to punish genocide against the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.\"",
      "In a statement to Fox News Digital, Cruz said, \"This latest announcement by the United Nations is no different than any of the other antisemitic smears and libels that have been leveled against Israel in their ongoing response to Hamas' atrocities on Oct. 7.",
      "\"This campaign directly undermines American national security interests by eroding Israel's freedom of action against Hamas terrorists who killed Americans and fueling international lawfare against Israel, which will be turned against American servicemembers, and indeed American citizens in general. The Republican Trump administration and Republican Congress have developed tools and sanctions to deal with these threats, and they should be used against everyone involved in this travesty,' his statement concluded.",

      "Anne Bayefsky, director of the Touro Institute on Human Rights and the Holocaust and president of Human Rights Voices, told Fox News Digital that \"the latest report of the U.N.\u2019s phony \u2018inquiry\u2019 promotes genocide \u2013 against Jews.\"",
      "Bayefsky said the report \"obscenely rationalizes the crimes against humanity committed by Hamas and other Palestinians on Oct. 7 as an understandable reaction to prior Israeli wrongs,\" and \"downgrades the mass murder, rape, torture, and trauma of Israelis by suggesting that not enough Jews were harmed to pose an \u2018existential threat\u2019 to Israel.\"",
      "Bayefsky said that the COI, which has previously been accused of omitting important facts from its reporting, \"makes zero recommendations for Hamas.\" She also said the report mentions the terror group\u2019s tunnel network, which was \"integral to the Oct. 7 atrocities,\" only \"in the context of criticizing Israel.\"",
      "Sen. Ted Cruz condemned the latest attack against Israel by the U.N.\u00a0 (Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)",
      "Salo Aizenberg, director of media watchdog group HonestReporting, pushed back on the COI report\u2019s assertion that Israel has \"impos[ed] measures intended to prevent births.\" He told Fox News Digital that, \"If Israel truly aimed to destroy Gaza\u2019s population, why did it allow WHO teams earlier in 2025 to vaccinate 603,000 children under age 10 \u2014 matching pre-Oct. 7 numbers?\"",
      "He noted that it \"disregards that more than 20,000 Gaza fatalities are fighters from Hamas and other armed groups, obscuring the true dynamics of the conflict.\"",
      "HAMAS TERROR OUTLET QUIETLY CUTS GAZA DEATH COUNT, REVEALS MOST KILLED WERE COMBAT-AGE MEN",
      "In its recommendations, the COI report specifically calls for Israel to \"ensure full, unimpeded access of humanitarian aid at scale\" and \"end the distribution of food aid through the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.\" The report cites the commissioner-general of the controversial U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), who has called GHF \"an abomination\" and \"a death trap\" that is \"costing more lives than it saves.\"",
      "According to recent U.N. statistics, however, between July 21 and Aug. 18 there were double the number of deaths along U.N. convoy routes (576) as there were surrounding GHF sites (259).",
      "Hamas terrorists killed civilians, including women, children and the elderly, when they attacked Israel on Oct. 7.\u00a0 (Israel Defense Forces via AP)",
      "Additionally, only 14.5% of U.N. aid trucks sent into Gaza have reached their intended destinations since May due to armed looting and theft. During the same period, GHF has distributed 165 million meals to Palestinians at its secure distribution sites.",
      "GHF released a statement explaining that the COI published its report \"without ever contacting\" the organization, calling its statements \"falsehoods that could have been easily corrected had we been asked.\" GHF said there have been no shootings at its sites, and that claims, particularly that children have been shot, are \"not only false\" but \"reckless.\"",
      "HAMAS PLOTS INFILTRATION AT US-BACKED GAZA AID SITE, FORCES TEMPORARY SHUTDOWN",
      "While the COI currently casts specific blame on three Israeli officials for alleged genocide, COI member Chris Sidoti told the press on Monday, \"there are many, many statements by Israeli political and civilian leaders that incite genocide, and also by others, including some media commentators in Israel, that have been inciting genocide.\"",
      "St\u00e9phane Dujarric, spokesperson for U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, did not respond to questions on whether Sidoti\u2019s remarks were an attack on Israel\u2019s media.",

      "In response to press questions about the COI report, Guterres said that \"it is not in the attributions of the Secretary-General to do the legal determination of genocide. That belongs to the adequate judicial entities, namely, the International Court of Justice.\" Guterres said, \"the truth is that this is something that it is morally, politically, and legally intolerable.\"",
      "Bayefsky said that \"U.S. law withholds funds for the COI, but clearly it has not had the intended impact.\" She argued it is \"high time\" to do a \"lot more to terminate the dangers that the U.N. and its COI pose to both the United States and Israel.\"",

    "summary": "Terrorism expert says the war on terror has been lost as al Qaeda and other groups gain safe havens and public support nearly 25 years after 9/11 attacks.",
    "story": [
      "Terrorism expert Bill Roggio, senior editor of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies\u2019 \"Long War Journal,\" warns that \"24 years after 9/11, the most dangerous terrorist group remains al Qaeda.\"",
      "In the 24-years since a group of 19 members of the al Qaeda terrorist group boarded and hijacked four flights in a series of attacks on the U.S. that killed 2,977 people, the infamous network remains the \"most dangerous terrorist group\" in the world today, warned one expert.",
      "Though terrorist groups like ISIS and Hamas have gained immense notoriety over the last several years due to their brutal tactics, Bill Roggio, expert analyst and senior editor of\u00a0Foundation for Defense of Democracies\u2019\u00a0\"Long War Journal,\" explained to Fox News Digital that the threat posed by al Qaeda is far more sweeping today.",
      "\"The most dangerous terrorist group 24 years after 9/11 remains al Qaeda,\" Roggio said. \"With the support of the Taliban, the situation there is far worse than it was pre-9/11.\"",

      "Roggio explained that not only is al Qaeda running training camps in at least 13 of the 34 provinces in Afghanistan, its global operations have only continued to expand in the last two decades across the Middle East and Africa.",
      "\"Its global organization remains intact. It controls probably more than a third of Somalia and then, it\u2019s so-called former affiliate \u2013 and I'm not convinced the links have been broken \u2013 now controls the government of Syria, with the Hayat Tahir Al Sham as its leader.",
      "\"President [Donald] Trump, even welcomed the takeover, the ouster of Bashar Al Assad. This was a mistake, in my estimation,\" he added. \"It's a group that has proven to be clever, to be committed.\"",
      "Roggio explained that his chief concern when it comes to terrorism nearly two-and-half decades after 9/11 is the safe haven they have been granted, and the public\u2019s sentiment towards the various groups.",
      "\"The number one concern I have for the threat of terrorism is the rise in safe havens for these groups,\" he said. \"Afghanistan \u2013 al Qaeda, running training camps, the Iranians continuing to provide safe haven, countries like Iraq, where the Shia militias are permitted to operate, al-Shabab \u2013 al Qaeda branch in Somalia \u2013 has safe haven in the areas they control.\"",

      "\"This is where, when terrorist groups have the time, the space and the security to plot, to execute, to recruit, to raise funds, they can conduct an attack like 9/11 and they have that in multiple places now,\" Roggio added.",
      "Terrorist groups have increasingly gained access to more sophisticated weaponry through state support like that provided by Iran to groups such as Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis.",
      "But the ease of access to technological developments like AI and accessible technology like drones has further increased the threat level that these groups pose.",
      "Roggio also pointed out that the groups do not need access to top arms or technological advancements to cause real harm.",
      "\"Nobody thought that box cutters and some training on airlines would lead to 9/11 and yet it happened,\" he said.",
      "Groups that either did not exist or were a \"shadow\" of themselves prior to 9/11 and worked on a cellular level now have \"armies across the globe,\" explained Roggio.",
      "But he also pointed out that open public support for groups that have carried out immense atrocities and human rights violations are also on the rise.",
      "\"When you look at the attitudes toward jihadist organizations, look at the support for Hamas today\u2026 the rise in antisemitism and the decrease in support for Israel \u2013 these are all indicators that things are trending for the jihadist organizations.",

      "\"We defeated Nazi Germany,\" he pointed out. \"It's something that can be done. We had the will to do it.",
      "\"Our hesitation, our unwillingness, our lack of commitment in these countries has emboldened them and again,\" Roggio said. \"Until we remove the state sponsorship, until we are able to effectively deal with the purveyors of the radical ideology, these threats will persist.\"",

    "story": [
      "Jerry Greenfield, co-founder of the Ben & Jerry's ice cream brand, has stepped down from the company he started 47 years ago citing a retreat from its campaigning spirit under parent company Unilever.",
      "Greenfield wrote in an open letter late Tuesday night \u2014 shared on X by his co-founder Ben Cohen \u2014 that he could no longer \"in good conscience\" remain an employee of the company and said the company had been \"silenced.\"",
      "He said the company's values and campaigning work on \"peace, justice, and human rights\" allowed it to be \"more than just an ice cream company\" and said the independence to pursue this was guaranteed when Anglo-Dutch packaged food giant Unilever bought the brand in 2000 for $326 million.",
      "Cohen's statement didn't mention Israel's ongoing military operation in Gaza, but Ben & Jerry\u2019s has been outspoken on the treatment of Palestinians for years and in 2021 withdrew sales from Israeli settlements in what it called \"Occupied Palestinian Territory.\"",
      "Greenfield's resignation comes five months after Ben & Jerry\u2019s filed a lawsuit accusing Unilever of firing its chief executive, David Stever, over his support for the brand's political activism. In November last year Ben & Jerry's filed another lawsuit accusing Unilever of silencing its public statements in support of Palestinian refugees.",
      "\"It\u2019s profoundly disappointing to come to the conclusion that that independence, the very basis of our sale to Unilever, is gone,\" Greenfield said.",
      "\"And it\u2019s happening at a time when our country\u2019s current administration is attacking civil rights, voting rights, the rights of immigrants, women, and the LGBTQ community,\" he added.",
      "Richard Goldstein, the then president of Unilever Foods North America, said in a statement after the sale in 2000 that Unilever was \"in an ideal position to bring the Ben & Jerry's brand, values and socially responsible message to consumers worldwide.\"",
      "But now Greenfield claims Ben & Jerry\u2019s \"has been silenced, sidelined for fear of upsetting those in power.\" He said he would carry on campaigning on social justice issues outside the company.",
      "The financial performance of the Ben & Jerry's brand isn't made public but Unilever's ice cream division made 8.3 billion Euros ($9.8 billion) in revenue in 2024. Unilever is in the process of spinning off its ice cream division, however, into a separate entity which involves cutting some 7,500 jobs across its brands globally.",
      "Cohen and Greenfield founded the business in 1978 in Burlington, Vermont, where it is still based.",
      "NBC News has contacted Unilever for comment overnight but had not received any at the time of publication."

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/elon-musk/tesla-full-self-driving-fails-train-crossings-drivers-warn-railroad-rcna225558",
    "published": "Tue, 16 Sep 2025 21:21:15 GMT",
    "summary": "In interviews, Tesla drivers who use FSD said they experienced problems with the technology at rail crossings.",
    "story": [
      "Italo Frigoli was trying out the Full Self-Driving software of his Tesla one evening in June when he came upon a railroad crossing. The arms were descending and lights were flashing as a train barreled toward the intersection.",
      "For most human drivers, the gate arms and lights are clear signals to stop, but for Frigoli\u2019s Tesla, which was driving in a semiautonomous mode, the potentially deadly situation didn\u2019t seem to register.",
      "\u201cIt felt like it was going to run through the arms,\u201d he said. \u201cSo obviously I just slammed on the brakes.\u201d He stopped just a few feet from the crossing near his home in North Texas, barely avoiding disaster.",
      "Video from the car\u2019s cameras, reviewed by NBC News, appears to support his account. And this month, when NBC News accompanied him to the same railroad crossing, his Tesla software had the same problem. While cameras were rolling, his Tesla\u2019s software failed to detect an oncoming train, forcing Frigoli to manually brake.",
      "Frigoli avoided the potential crashes, but his experiences highlight a recurring complaint among some Tesla drivers about the company\u2019s self-driving technology: The software sometimes mishandles railroad crossings, including by failing to stop for them.",
      "Tesla\u2019s Full Self-Driving (FSD) software is an add-on package of driver-assistance features that the company touts as \u201cthe future of transport,\u201d capable of navigating \u201calmost anywhere with your active supervision.\u201d",
      "In interviews, six Tesla drivers who use FSD said they experienced problems with the technology at rail crossings, and four of them provided videos. NBC News also found seven other Tesla driving videos posted online showing similar mishaps dating back to June 2023 through August. Those drivers declined to be interviewed.",
      "The complaints are even more widespread on Tesla internet forums, where drivers describe similar mishaps without usually posting videos. NBC News found 40 examples on Reddit, X and YouTube since 2023, including posts as recent as August.",
      "Regulators with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) told NBC News in a statement that they had raised the issue with Tesla.",
      "\u201cWe are aware of the incidents and have been in communication with the manufacturer,\u201d the agency said.",
      "\u201cNHTSA discusses issues frequently with manufacturers and prioritizes the safety of all road users,\u201d the statement went on. \u201cThe agency continuously analyzes consumer complaints to determine whether a potential vehicle safety defect trend exists. We will continue to enforce the law on all manufacturers of motor vehicles and equipment, in accordance with the Vehicle Safety Act and our data-driven, risk-based investigative process.\u201d",
      "Musk has said autonomous technology is crucial to Tesla\u2019s future, and he has bet the company\u2019s future on the success of self-driving cars and artificial intelligence-powered robots. Tesla robotaxis are on the road in Austin, Texas, and planned for other cities. In July, Musk said that an unsupervised version of FSD \u2014 one that doesn\u2019t require monitoring by a human driver \u2014 could be available this year \u201cin certain geographies\u201d and that his goal is to have Tesla robotaxis available to half the U.S. population by the end of the year.",
      "But questions remain about the technology the company is using to guide its vehicles. Experts said that Tesla\u2019s FSD software is a black-box AI model in which errors can\u2019t be easily explained even by its creators and that Tesla engineers most likely hadn\u2019t included enough railroad crossing examples in the videos they used to train the FSD software.",
      "Tesla and Musk didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment on the railroad crossing complaints. Musk doesn\u2019t appear to have spoken about the complaints, but he has said Tesla is planning a major update to the FSD software as soon as late September.",
      "Drivers described a range of malfunctions. Frigoli and other drivers said their vehicles didn\u2019t recognize flashing lights or lowering gate arms. Some said their Teslas haven\u2019t slowed down even when there are trains in front of them. Other drivers said their cars have stopped on top of railroad tracks when there are red lights ahead, which could pose a danger if the arms come down before the lights turn green. In one video posted online, a Tesla initially stops at a crossing, but then, after the gate arms begin to lower, a set of traffic lights farther down the road turns green and the car tries to proceed through the arms seconds before a train arrives. Still other drivers reported that their cars turned onto the tracks themselves.",
      "Experts warn that Tesla and Musk are courting disaster.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s having trouble stopping at rail crossings, it\u2019s an accident waiting to happen,\u201d said Phil Koopman, an associate professor emeritus of engineering at Carnegie Mellon University.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of which driver gets caught at the wrong time,\u201d he said.",
      "Tesla FSD doesn\u2019t mishandle every railroad crossing every time, and some drivers have posted videos online to celebrate successful instances. But an error can lead to catastrophic effects. One of the six drivers who spoke to NBC News said his vehicle handled a rail crossing appropriately in August after it failed to do so earlier this year; he said the more recent experience led him to think Tesla may have resolved the problem, but experts said there\u2019s no way to be sure.",
      "In June, a Tesla in FSD mode drove itself onto a set of train tracks in eastern Pennsylvania and was hit minutes later by a Norfolk Southern freight train, according to local authorities who spoke with the driver. That driver was lucky: The train struck only a glancing blow to the car\u2019s side, and the driver and his passengers had exited the car before the crash."

So does \u201cThe Natural,\u201d which predates all of those titles and may have very well set the stage for the idea that baseball on the silver screen could be a home run.",
      "When \u201cThe Natural,\u201d starring Redford, who died Sept. 16 at the age of 89, was released on May 11, 1984, baseball movies were not exactly a bankable risk. It had been years since the notable releases of films like \u201cBang the Drum Slowly\u201d and \u201cThe Bad News Bears.\u201d Films centered on the national pastime were like sending a .100 hitter up to the plate to pinch hit in the bottom of the ninth. Redford, though, was a titan of film, who remained undeterred.",
      "\u201cAt that time, there was always a lot of negative things. Like, at that point, there had not been a successful baseball film in a long, long time,\u201d the film\u2019s director, Barry Levinson, said on \u201cThe Rich Eisen Show\u201d this past March.",
      "\u201cAnd all had been failures, so when we were working on it, there was all this negative thing, like, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t know. Baseball movies. That genre\u2019s over. It\u2019s gone. Done.\u2019 Redford wanted to do the film. We met on it, by happenstance, actually, and went from there.\u201d",
      "Indeed, \u201cThe Natural\u201d blazed a path for other baseball movies that followed. It is even immortalized at the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York.",
      "\u201cIn truth, \u2018The Natural\u2019 scattered its own seeds,\u201d wrote Noah Gittell in his 2024 book, \u201cBaseball: The Movie,\u201d which traces the history and impact of baseball films. \u201cIt opened as the number one film in America and came in 14th that year in the domestic box office. Not a World Series contender, but certainly a playoff team, and popular enough to finally shatter the stubborn myth that baseball movies were box office poison.\u201d",
      "Based on Bernard Malamud\u2019s 1952 novel of the same name, \u201cThe Natural\u201d was nominated for four Academy Awards, including a third best supporting actress nod in as many years for Glenn Close. The story of an aging ballplayer who seemingly comes out of nowhere to get a chance with a losing baseball team may seem like the stuff of Hollywood lore, but it\u2019s dark and moody.",
      "\u201cI think film is a great way to tell a story because it\u2019s visual,\u201d Redford told Orion magazine in 2024. \u201cIt\u2019s got movement in it and captures people\u2019s attention differently. That\u2019s a big deal for me. Film can take people to places they\u2019ve never seen and create a connection for them.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Natural\u201d most definitely created a connection. It is a visceral film, with imagery that those who\u2019ve seen it have never forgotten: Redford, as Roy Hobbs, knocking the cover off the ball and later smashing the lights with a dramatic home run are just two examples. The film\u2019s score adds to the emotional depth of the story; it\u2019s no wonder part of the theme for the movie by Randy Newman \u2014 his score also earned an Oscar nod \u2014 appeared at the end of the final episode of \u201cThe Wonder Years.\u201d",
      "In the decade that followed \u201cThe Natural,\u201d baseball on the big screen became more common. In addition to \u201cBull Durham,\u201d \u201cField of Dreams,\u201d \u201cEight Men Out\u201d and the first two \u201cMajor League\u201d films, \u201cA League of Their Own,\u201d \u201cThe Sandlot,\u201d \u201cLittle Big League\u201d and \u201cRookie of the Year\u201d all hit theaters. Heck, baseball even played a large part in \u201cThe Naked Gun.\u201d",
      "Gittell wrote that baseball movies, which had been made for decades before the \u201880s, had finally found a place, thanks to \u201cThe Natural.\u201d",
      "\u201cIts success launched the baseball movie boom that would last a decade and produce some of the most beloved films of all time. It marked the creation of a new legend: for baseball cinema, for the heartland, and for America itself,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Levinson isn\u2019t sold on the idea that \u201cThe Natural\u201d opened the floodgates for offerings like \u201cBull Durham\u201d and the \u201cMajor League\u201d series, but he does acknowledge its impact.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a good question,\u201d he said while appearing in 2014 at the Virginia Film Festival. \u201cI don\u2019t know because it was really not thought of as a commercial-type of thing to do. And then when the film worked, then all of a sudden it was like, \u2018Oh, we can have a baseball movie.\u2019 And then, all of a sudden, there\u2019s \u2018Bull Durham\u2019 and all those others that came after that.\u201d",
      "The irony is that \u201cThe Natural\u201d was not universally lauded by critics.",
      "\u201cWhy didn\u2019t they make a baseball picture? Why did \u2018The Natural\u2019 have to be turned into idolatry on behalf of Robert Redford?\u201d famed film critic Roger Ebert began his two-star review of the movie.",
      "\u201cThe Natural,\u201d though, possesses a kind of mysticism and mythical quality that would come out again in the romanticism of \u201cField of Dreams.\u201d It spoke about the magic and tragedy of baseball, whether ethereal or comical, themes that would be seen again in those later movies of the \u201880s and \u201890s. Talk to people about the best baseball movies ever and it inevitably appears high up on the list.",
      "\u201cThe Natural,\u201d made in the \u201880s, originally written in the \u201850s and taking place in the \u201830s, provided a dose of nostalgia and a reminder of the beauty of the game, which connected with those who see the good in it.",
      "\u201c\u2018The Natural\u2019 gets how baseball feels: timeless and mythic, like the only thing that lasts in a world teeming with ephemera,\u201d Gittell wrote. \u201cIt captures the moment of transformation from men into gods that\u2019s possible every time you turn on a baseball game.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a sentiment that would be echoed many times over in future baseball films \u2014 films that proved baseball and movies do indeed go together."

      "Barbra Streisand has shared an emotional tribute to late Hollywood legend Robert Redford, who she famously co-starred with in the classic romantic drama \"The Way We Were\" (1973).",
      "Streisand, 83, posted a black-and-white image on Instagram of her and Redford, who died Sept. 16 at his Utah home at age 89. In her caption, she called him \u201cone of the finest actors ever.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery day on the set of \u2018The Way We Were\u2019 was exciting, intense and pure joy. We were such opposites: he was from the world of horses; I was allergic to them! Yet, we kept trying to find out more about each other, just like the characters in the movie,\u201d she recalled.",
      "Streisand went on to describe Redford as \u201ccharismatic, intelligent, intense, always interesting \u2014 and one of the finest actors ever.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe last time I saw him, when he came to lunch, we discussed art and decided to send each other our first drawings,\u201d she wrote, adding, \u201cHe was one of a kind and I\u2019m so grateful to have had the opportunity to work with him.\u201d",
      "In Streisand\u2019s 2023 memoir, \u201cMy Name is Barbra,\u201d she detailed how she persuaded Redford to take on the role of Hubbell, the star-crossed lover of her character, Katie, after he initially declined it.",
      "Streisand wrote that she wanted Redford for the role because he was a \u201crare combination\u2026 an intellectual cowboy\u2026 a charismatic star who is also one of the finest actors of his generation,\u201d according to an excerpt from the book published by Vanity Fair.",
      "Redford turned down the role, she wrote, because he felt the character of Hubbell was \u201cshallow and one-dimensional.\u201c His refusal prompted Streisand to urge director Sydney Pollack to \u201cgive him whatever he wants.\u201d",
      "Pollack brought in two new writers who breathed life into the Hubbell character, infusing his \u201cgolden-boy exterior\u201d with inner depth.",
      "\u201cThe negotiations went down to the wire,\u201d Streisand recalled in her memoir. \u201cI was in the middle of filming \u2018Up the Sandbox\u2019 in Africa, and one day I got a telegram from (Hollywood agent) Sue Mengers that simply said: \u2018Barbra Redford!\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s when I knew he\u2019d finally said yes\u2026 and I was so thrilled! The courtship had been tough, but Bob\u2019s reluctance had a big influence on the script and ultimately resulted in a richer, more interesting character,\u201d wrote Streisand.",
      "\u201cThe Way We Were\u201d went on to become a box-office success. It was also nominated for six Academy Awards, winning two, including one for best song for Streisand\u2019s rendition of the theme song \u201cThe Way We Were.\u201d",
      "Streisand and Redford reunited publicly several times over the years, including in 2002 when Streisand presented Redford with the Honorary Academy Award for lifetime achievement.",
      "\"He's always interesting. He's always interested. He's very smart. Very private. He's self-assured but shy, and I adored working with him,\" Streisand said during her speech.",
      "In 2015, she lauded Redford again when she presented him with the Film Society of Lincoln Center\u2019s Chaplin Award.",
      "\u201cYou never quite know what he\u2019s really thinking, and that makes him fascinating to watch on screen,\u201d Streisand said during the ceremony, according to Entertainment Weekly. \u201cBob understands the power of restraint. You\u2019re never going to get it all, and that\u2019s the secret, I think. That\u2019s the mystery. That\u2019s what makes you want to keep looking at him.\u201d",
      "For his part, Redford also had fond memories of working with Streisand on \u201cThe Way We Were.\u201d",
      "\u201cI remember the fun we had,\u201d he recalled when he and Streisand sat for a 2010 joint interview with Oprah Winfrey. \u201cI remember liking her energy and her spirit; it was wonderful to play off of. I also really enjoyed kidding her. She was fun to kid.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "When it comes to raising kids, actress Melissa Joan Hart wishes she would have done one thing sooner: leaning in to \"natural consequences.\"",
      "\"I'm very much about natural consequences now, and I feel like I kind of missed the boat a little bit on my older kids,\" she tells TODAY.com. Hart, who starred as the title characters in \"Sabrina the Teenage Witch\" and \"Clarissa Explains it All,\" is raising three boys with her husband, musician Mark Wilkerson: Mason, 19, Braydon, 16, and Tucker, 12.",
      "\"We saved them in a lot of cases, especially when it comes to school,\" she says. \"And that's detrimental to their development when they don't have to problem-solve or troubleshoot.\"",
      "Natural consequences as a parenting strategy means that parents let kids experience real-world accountability for their actions, rather than swooping in to solve their problems. So if your child forgets their soccer cleats, for example, you let them figure it out \u2014 and maybe they don't get to play in the game or they get in trouble with the coach \u2014 rather than \"saving\" them by bringing their cleats to school.",
      "Rather than taking charge of school projects as she might have done with older sons Mason and Braydon, Hart says she tries to be less of a leader and more of a helper with Tucker's sixth grade homework.",
      "The actress is spilling secrets as part of Pop Secret\u2019s \u201cSpill Everything\u201d campaign that encourages people to share their popcorn-worthy confessions \u2014 and hear Hart's \u2014 via the Pop Secret Hotline. Hart, who is the \u201cChief of Butter\u201d for the campaign, lets another secret fly: She loves popcorn so much that she insisted on a year\u2019s supply before agreeing to the role.",
      "Popcorn may be consistent, but parenting attitudes can change, and Hart certainly seems to be shifting her view on handling situations with her sons. \"I let them get away with stuff, or helped them through stuff, when they probably need to figure it out themselves,\u201d she says.",
      "It can be hard for parents to allow kids to experience natural consequences.",
      "\"You kind of give up on it,\" she acknowledges. \"They're your personal baby, so of course you want to forgive them and move on and let them go to that football game. We should normalize saying, 'My kids can't sleep over because they're being grounded.'\"",
      "Like many parents, Hart struggles with finding the appropriate consequences for her kids' actions. \"As they get older, they get smarter and wiser and more crafty,\" she says, groaning that when she turned off the wifi as a consequence, they found a way to turn it right back on without her knowledge.",
      "Hart also stops to poke fun at herself, because as she touted the benefits of natural consequences, she was waiting at the pharmacy to pick up a prescription for her 19-year-old son that he could have retrieved himself.",
      "\"But he had work and I didn't want him to leave work, so ... \" she says with a laugh."

      "The season finale brought a breakthrough: Detective Karadec (Daniel Sunjata) discovered Roman\u2019s whereabouts, confirming he is alive. This sets the stage for emotional reunions and potentially explosive confrontations in Season 2, as the truth behind Roman\u2019s long absence remains unclear.",
      "Morgan re-married and had two children with her second husband, Ludo Radovic (Taran Killam) \u2014 though they've also split.",
      "Ava\u2019s Perspective on Her Dad Changed",
      "Ava (Amirah J.) grew up without her father and, for years, assumed Roman had abandoned the family.",
      "Her perspective began to shift after overhearing a conversation between Morgan and Selena (Judy Reyes), her mother\u2019s boss: Roman\u2019s car had been found shortly after his disappearance, impounded with a pack of diapers inside; a clue that he likely didn\u2019t leave voluntarily. The revelation brought Ava to tears.",
      "In Episode 9, Morgan asked Ava if she had taken some of Roman\u2019s belongings while going through his things, telling her she shouldn\u2019t have to sneak around. Ava confessed she had overheard the earlier conversation about the diapers, signaling that she no longer believed her father had abandoned them.",
      "By the season finale, Episode 13, Ava had created photo albums and artwork for Roman, preparing to catch him up on everything he had missed if he ever returns. Her emotional preparation highlights her longing and hope for reconciliation, and the mother-daughter dynamic promises to remain central in Season 2.",
      "A Love Triangle Brewed Between Morgan, Karadec and Tom",
      "Season 1 teased a slow-burn romance between Morgan and Detective Adam Karadec, as well as Morgan\u2019s growing connection with Tom (JD Pardo), a former janitor-turned-nurse. Tom becomes Morgan\u2019s romantic interest due to their shared down-to-earth nature and witty banter, offering a contrast to Karadec\u2019s intensity.",
      "At the season-ending police gala, Karadec\u2019s feelings for Morgan were clear, though she remained unaware. Awestruck by her appearance, he called her stunning before becoming flustered. During a slow dance, he expressed concern about Morgan meeting Gio, a dangerous man linked to Roman\u2019s case, and offered to go in her place. Calling her \u201cpartner\u201d and asking her to trust him, Karadec\u2019s willingness to risk danger marked a turning point in their relationship, and Morgan\u2019s acceptance showed deep trust after 15 years of grief.",
      "Their intimate moment was cut short when Tom, attending the gala as Morgan\u2019s date, interrupted the dance, teasing a love triangle in the making.",
      "A New Villain Enters the Scene",
      "Season 1 ended on a chilling note with the introduction of a new, and still unnamed, villain referred to as the \"gamer\" (David Giuntoli).",
      "Unlike Morgan\u2019s usual cases, this adversary targeted her personally, leaving cryptic messages and forcing detectives to solve elaborate puzzles.",
      "In the finale, the gamer confronted Morgan at a grocery store, declaring, \u201cYou\u2019re the one, Morgan. We shall play again, me and you.\u201d",
      "His obsession with childhood games, coded messages, and psychological manipulation sets up a serialized storyline with darker and more personal stakes for Season 2."

    "story": [
      "Mark Ronson, the Grammy-winning producer behind hits from Miley Cyrus, Bruno Mars, Amy Winehouse and more, revisits his early days as a DJ in his new memoir, \"Night People.\"",
      "Part of Ronson's teenage years and his early 20s was defined by his obsession with music and DJing, as well as the partying and nightlife that came with it.",
      "Ronson, now a father of two, tells TODAY.com he wants his children to read his book one day, even though it does show what he was really doing as a teen.",
      "\"I realize I wrote a lot about the things that I did and maybe the behavior that was not so great, that I feel like one of them is going to throw it back in my face when they're 15,\" Ronson says. \"'Dad, you were doing all of that \u2014 you're way worse than us!' But I do. I wouldn't want anything in my life that I wasn't comfortable telling them about.\"",
      "Ronson married Grace Gummer, the daughter of Meryl Streep and Don Gummer, in 2021, and the couple welcomed their first child in 2023 and their second daughter earlier this year.",
      "\"Night People: How to Be a DJ in '90s New York City\" published on Sept. 16, and recounts how Ronson became part of the hip-hop DJ scene in Manhattan.",
      "Ronson, the son of Ann Dexter-Jones and Laurence Ronson, was born in London and grew up in New York City, often intermingling with his mom and stepfather\u2019s (Mick Jones, the guitarist of Foreigner) friends at parties they threw at their house.",
      "One of those guests? Robin Williams, Ronson wrote in his book and also shared on TODAY on Sept. 15.",
      "\u201cSo my earliest childhood memory, are all of the night,\u201d he said on TODAY. \u201cMy parents, they liked to go to the club too. And one night, my mom brought Robin Williams back from the club, and I\u2019m sure she probably said, \u2018You got to come into my son\u2019s room. He loves \"Mork & Mindy,\" that\u2019s his favorite show.'",
      "\u201cAnd I remember just waking up and Robin Williams is over my bed, and he was leaving,\u201d he continued. \u201cI was like, \u2018Mr. Williams, you forgot!\u2019 He was like, \u2018Nanu, nanu.\u2019 ... He knew what I wanted to hear, it was so sweet.\u201d",
      "While Ronson loved being part of the DJ scene, he quickly replies \"no\" to a question about whether the 1990s were the best years of his life.",
      "\"I think the past few years \u2014 having two young girls, my wife and family \u2014 this has been the best part,\" he tells TODAY.com. \"But it was certainly the most exciting, and it was this exciting era. It was the last era of its kind in New York, and, obviously, when you're in it ... you don't realize, 'This isn't going to be here forever.'\"",
      "Ronson says he decided to revisit that time in his life due to nostalgia for the music from the time, and what his life was like.",
      "\"I love the music from that era, the '90s and early 2000s \u2014 it was a time in my life where I was so excited. You know, you're 18, 19, finding your passion and your craft,\" he says. \"And then, to be honest, a lot of my friends in that era were passing, so I wanted to find a way to remember them and this amazing little scene that we made.\"",
      "The book ends before Ronson's producing career took off in the late 2000s, producing hits like Winehouse's \"Rehab\" and her cover of the Zutons' \"Valerie.\" He's since gone on to produce songs like \"Perfect Illusion\" by Lady Gaga, \"Uptown Funk\" with Bruno Mars and \"Electricity\" with Dua Lipa and Diplo.",
      "Ronson says he thinks he would do another book about that era of his life, but he wants to take a break after \"Night People.\"",
      "\"I mean, this took me so long, took so much out of me that I would need to take a little bit of space and get back to making music for a while,\" he says. \"But I would love to, at some point, make something about the people I worked with.\"",
      "Ronson says there isn't anyone he's \"dying to work with,\" but he would work with some of the artists he's worked with in the past \"in a heartbeat.\"",
      "\"I mean, I love all of them. I would do a song with any of those people again. You know, sometimes there's this thing where you have this moment where you capture a little magic, and then to try and go back in and you're trying to chase something that you did,\" Ronson says. \"But, I mean, there's people like Bruno and Miley \u2014 I would go in a heartbeat.\"",
      "For now, Ronson says he's working with \"Barbie\" director Greta Gerwig again on the music for her new Netflix film. (Netflix did not respond to a request for comment on if Ronson was referring to Gerwig's new film adaptation of C.S. Lewis' \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" series.)",
      "And Ronson couldn't leave TODAY without giving a shoutout to beloved weatherman Al Roker.",
      "\"I have a memory of the '90s. I feel like I saw you out on the dance floor. Like, it probably wasn't often, but I know that there was a night I was like, 'Holy crap \u2014 that's Al Roker,'\" Ronson said during his show appearance.",
      "Al didn't deny being on the dance floor at the time. \"On occasion,\" he replied with a cheeky grin."

    "story": [
      "Ukrainian children have been taken to over 200 different facilities across Russia, including locations where they have been subjected to forced \u201cre-education\u201d and military training in a clear violation of international law, according to new research.",
      "Eight different types of facilities, ranging from summer camps to religious sites to military academies stretching across the entire expanse of Russia, have been identified in the report from the Yale School of Public Health Humanitarian Research Lab published Tuesday.",
      "The study was initiated at Ukraine\u2019s request to better understand the full size of the network of facilities where children are held, to help them eventually return to their homeland, Nathaniel Raymond, the executive director of the research lab, said in a telephone interview Sunday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really important that all the people involved in different ways to bring the kids back have the most accurate geospatial information possible, and this is it,\u201d he said.",
      "Using open-source intelligence, news reports and Russian government documents, as well as satellite imagery, the Yale report identified 210 different locations where children are taken. Some are brought to locations temporarily, while others are given Russian citizenship and coerced into forced adoption, the report says.",
      "At most sites, children go through \u201cre-education\u201d programs to enforce Russian patriotism, including lectures in Russian history and singing the national anthem, it adds.",
      "Others, particularly older children, have received military training at cadet academies and a military base, including \u201cdrone control and tactics training,\u201d and have participated in shooting and grenade-throwing competitions, according to the report.",
      "The researchers said they cannot verify if any of the children given military training were ever conscripted into the Russian military or were otherwise deployed in the war in Ukraine.",
      "Russia\u2019s children\u2019s rights commissioner, Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova, and the country\u2019s foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s official \u201cBring Kids Back\u201d program, which partners the government with other countries and international organizations to return kids from Russia, has recorded nearly 20,000 cases of unlawful deportations and forced transfers of children.",
      "The new report does not estimate the number of children who have been held either temporarily or indefinitely in Russia. But Raymond said identifying the locations gives a better sense of the scale, comparing it to the carnival game of trying to guess the number of jelly beans in a jar.",
      "\u201cRight now, with this report, we volumetrically know as much as we\u2019re probably going to know how big the jar is, and the jar is gigantic,\u201d he said.",
      "The report builds on research that has helped support allegations of war crimes against Russian President Vladimir Putin issued by the International Criminal Court, which has issued an arrest warrant accusing him of overseeing the forced abductions and deportations. The ICC has also accused Lvova-Belova of committing similar crimes.",
      "The Kremlin has previously denied the allegations and said the warrants were \u201coutrageous.\u201d",
      "Ukraine has made the return of abducted children central to any talks with Russia to end the war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy raised the issue with President Donald Trump during a meeting at the White House last month, days after Trump\u2019s meeting with Putin in Alaska.",
      "Last week, Zelenskyy announced plans to hold a \u201chigh-level event\u201d on abducted children during the meeting of the U.N. General Assembly later this month.",
      "The research was hampered after State Department funding for the Conflict Observatory program, which Yale was part of, was cut by executive order by Trump. It has not been restored. All of the data would have been lost, but a contractor working on the project in Florida protectively kept a backup, according to Raymond.",
      "The lab\u2019s repository of data has been transferred to Europol, a European law enforcement agency.",
      "The researchers have also stopped directly sharing their findings with the ICC after the Trump administration-imposed sanctions on the court in February.",
      "Previously, Raymond said, the lab had cooperated with the ICC on investigations of allegations of war crimes committed in Ukraine on the basis of an agreement put in place during the Biden administration.",
      "Now, he said, researchers are operating under the assumption that the previous agreement is no longer valid. \u201cWe no longer believe that it is safe for us to attempt to share information with them, given the lack of clarity legally from the Trump administration,\u201d he said.",
      "However, a new bipartisan push in the Senate is underway to label Russia a state sponsor of terrorism unless it returns Ukrainian children taken during the war. Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.; Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.; Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.; and Katie Britt, R-Ala., introduced a bill last week threatening to add both Russia and Belarus to the list, which currently includes only Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Syria."

      "\u201cThe Commission finds that Israel is responsible for the commission of genocide in Gaza,\u201d said Navi Pillay, the commission chair and former U.N. human rights chief. \u201cIt is clear that there is an intent to destroy the Palestinians in Gaza through acts that meet the criteria set forth in the Genocide Convention.\u201d",
      "The three-member team said in its 72-page report that Israel has committed four of the five \u201cgenocidal acts\u201d defined under the 1948 Genocide Convention: Killing members of a group, causing serious bodily and mental harm, deliberately inflicting conditions calculated to destroy the group and preventing births.",

      "A nationwide hunt is underway after a priceless gold bracelet belonging to an ancient pharaoh disappeared from a museum in Cairo, Egyptian authorities have said.",
      "The 3,000-year-old bracelet was being restored in a laboratory when it went missing from the Egyptian Museum, the country\u2019s Tourism and Antiquities Ministry said.",
      "A photo of the item has been sent to airports, seaports and land border crossings across Egypt to help prevent it from being smuggled out of the country, the ministry said in a statement shared with NBC News on Wednesday. It is \u201cadorned with spherical lapis lazuli beads, belonging to King Amenemope from the Third Intermediate Period,\u201d the ministry said.",
      "Known for its deep blue hue and golden flecks, lapis lazuli was highly prized in ancient Egypt for its association with the gods and supposed healing powers.",
      "The bracelet was among a collection of artifacts being prepared to be transported to Italy ahead of an exhibition titled \u2018Treasures of the Pharaohs\u2019 at a museum in Rome starting next month.",
      "The museum's director-general warned that some images circulating on social media were of a different artifact.",
      "The ministry said it had deliberately delayed the announcement of the bracelet's disappearance to avoid compromising the investigation. A specialized committee had been formed to inventory and review all artifacts kept in the museum\u2019s restoration laboratory to ensure no other artifacts had gone missing, it said.",
      "Amenemope was a pharoah of the 21st dynasty who ruled Egypt from 993 to 984 B.C., according to the Egyptian Museum. His burial was notable for being one of three entirely intact royal burials known from ancient Egypt.",
      "His tomb was discovered by French Egyptologists Pierre Montet and Georges Goyon in April 1940, but its excavation was delayed by World War II, the museum says on its website.",

      "LONDON \u2014 President Donald Trump enjoys spectacle, but this is not what Britain had in mind.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer fought to offer Trump a second state visit starting Wednesday \u2014 an unprecedented flourish meant to bolster Starmer\u2019s authority and flatter the American leader at a crucial moment for the United Kingdom and its allies.",
      "Instead, Trump arrived in a fractious Britain to meet with political leaders beset by long-running discontent and royals navigating family feuds.",
      "Should he open the country's notorious tabloids, the president could survey the fallout from flag-waving far-right marchers in the streets, feverish speculation about the prime minister's position and a family summit over tea that sought to ease those royal tensions.",
      "The backdrop could hardly be worse for the carefully planned choreography of pomp and ceremony.",
      "The prime minister\u2019s hand-picked ambassador to Washington, Peter Mandelson, was fired last week after revelations of his years-old correspondence with Jeffrey Epstein, the late convicted sex offender and financier.",
      "Appointing Mandelson was billed as a savvy move designed to curry favor with Trump, but it has instead detonated into the gravest crisis of Starmer\u2019s premiership so far \u2014 crystalizing bubbling frustrations with his yearlong tenure. Starmer\u2019s deputy, Angela Rayner, also resigned in September after admitting she underpaid property taxes.",
      "Starmer's approval ratings continue to plunge as far-right Reform UK, led by Trump ally Nigel Farage, capitalizes on the public discontent to pull ahead in some polls.",
      "This has all fueled growing whispers of a leadership contest \u2014 a remarkable reversal for a prime minister who won a huge majority just 15 months ago on a vow of stability.",
      "On the streets, the mood is darker still.",
      "A far-right march led by Tommy Robinson, a convicted fraudster with a violent criminal record, drew more than 100,000 people to the streets of the capital Saturday. Elon Musk, formerly Trump\u2019s right-hand man in the White House, called into the rally. He urged a \u201cdissolution of Parliament\u201d and told attendees that \"you either fight back or you die,\" in comments that were condemned by Starmer and others.",
      "While the politics look volatile, Trump's state visit will showcase an institution Britain has long turned to as a bastion of consistency and grandeur.",
      "Yet, his arrival at Windsor Castle on Wednesday, where King Charles III is expected to make a speech in honor of the president, comes at a time when the royals are also under renewed scrutiny.",
      "Prince Andrew is back in the headlines thanks to renewed coverage of Epstein, an unwelcome reminder of unresolved questions about his role. Meanwhile, the frenzied coverage of Prince Harry\u2019s tea with the king last week has resurfaced family tensions that led father and son to go almost two years without meeting.",
      "While Harry suggested Sunday that he wants to see his father more often, relations with his brother, Prince William, the heir to the throne, do not appear to have improved.",
      "Starmer had hoped that hosting a U.S. president \u2014 with all the King\u2019s Guards, red carpets and palace banquets that it will entail \u2014 would broadcast strength and competence.",
      "But Trump's visit, analysts say, may only amplify Britain\u2019s domestic turmoil, rather than mask it.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s administration tends to be very interested in the domestic politics of European countries,\u201d said Olivia O\u2019Sullivan, director of the UK in the World Programme at the London-based think tank Chatham House.",
      "For Starmer, there\u2019s \u201ca pretty challenging landscape at home and overseas,\u201d she told NBC News, and a likelihood that Trump may \u201csay something or address something outside of the carefully diplomatically choreographed statements and announcements.\u201d",
      "The prospect of a second state visit for Trump drew criticism, with opponents accusing Starmer of needlessly flattering a deeply polarizing figure in the U.K. A mass demonstration is planned on the first day of his trip, with a further protest planned near Windsor Castle.",
      "The risk, experts argue, is that Trump\u2019s presence could further weaken Starmer at home.",
      "\u201cTrump is so unpopular with most Brits that no one \u2014 not even Nigel Farage \u2014 is going to win many voters over by being seen close to him,\u201d said Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London.",
      "A recent poll found that 70% of Britons disliked Trump, and 44% thought his state visit should be canceled.",
      "While many on Britain\u2019s far right \u201clove Trump,\u201d he added, \u201can awful lot more Brits think he\u2019s either nuts or dangerous \u2014 or both \u2014 so anyone seen to be fanboying him will get short shrift.\u201d",
      "While Trump will get his desired display of grandeur when he lands in London, turmoil bubbles underneath."

      "NBC News has reached out to Russia's foreign ministry for comment. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday \"I don\u2019t know anything about these statements of hers and I can\u2019t say anything on this.\"",
      "News of Navalny's death drew outrage from the West, where many leaders blamed Putin. Former President Joe Biden said he was \u201cboth not surprised and outraged.\u201d",
      "The Kremlin dismissed what it said were \u201cabsolutely rabid statements.\u201d",
      "Navalny\u2019s team said afterward that his mother and lawyers were denied access to his body and were told the probe into what killed him had been extended.",
      "Navalnaya accused the Kremlin of hiding his body to cover up killing him. He had previously been poisoned with a military nerve agent while on a business trip in Russia in 2020 \u2014 an attempt on his life that he blamed directly on Putin.",
      "Navalny\u2019s body was finally returned a week after his death, and thousands turned out to mourn him at a funeral in Moscow.",

      "Looming over Trump\u2019s arrival in Europe is the war playing out on the east end of the continent. Hostilities between Russia and Ukraine took an escalatory turn last week when Russian drones entered Poland\u2019s airspace and were shot down.",
      "The incident renewed fears that Russian President Vladimir Putin may widen the conflict and threaten other European democracies unless he is stopped. As the war grinds on, Trump\u2019s effort to make peace has stalled, giving rise to complaints among some diplomats and members of Congress that he is not putting enough pressure on Putin to halt the attacks.",
      "The war figures to come up when Trump meets privately on Thursday with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer at Chequers, his official country residence outside London. There, the two leaders will view the archives of former Prime Minister Winston Churchill.",
      "The symbolism is unmistakable. Churchill and President Franklin D. Roosevelt forged an invaluable friendship as they joined to fight Nazi Germany in World War II. Russia was part of the troika that defeated Adolf Hitler.",
      "Now, the West faces threats from a Russian dictatorial regime, and Europe again is beseeching the U.S. president to come to its aid.",
      "Whether Trump is on board seems to depend on the day. He has sent mixed signals about responsibility for the war, which began in 2022 when Russia sent tanks and troops rolling into Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy rallied his country and prevented a quick rout. In a post on his social media site Saturday, Trump wrote that the war is not his. Rather, he wrote, \u201cit is [former President Joe] Biden\u2019s and Zelenskyy\u2019s war.\u201d He did not mention Putin.",
      "But speaking to reporters the following day, he cast Russia as the \u201caggressor.\u201d",

      "\u201cI hope that the leaders who meet Trump these days behind closed doors are very frank about it,\u201d Marko Mihkelson, who chairs the foreign affairs committee in Estonia\u2019s Parliament, said in an interview. \u201cIf Mr. Trump thinks that this is not his war or that he can run away and that Ukraine is somehow a faraway country, that would be an epic mistake.\u201d",
      "First, though, comes the pomp. World leaders have long used flattery in attempting to win favor with Trump. In this instance, Starmer hand-delivered an invitation from King Charles during a meeting in the Oval Office in February. Trump\u2019s last state visit, in 2019, was a \u201ctremendous success,\u201d gushed Starmer, who is relying on Trump to stand up for Ukraine and prevent further Russian aggression.",
      "\u201cEvery time the European Union tries to push against Trump, they\u2019ve gone to incredible efforts to butter him up,\" said Michael Bociurkiw, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank. He mentioned that Mark Rutte, secretary-general of the NATO military alliance, called Trump \"Daddy\u201d at a summit in June and how European leaders praised Trump during a visit to the White House in August to discuss the war, likening them to a \u201ccheerleading squad meeting with the football coach.\u201d",
      "The upcoming state dinner \"is another iteration of what has become the strategy for dealing with Trump,\" said Michael McFaul, who was ambassador to Russia during the Obama administration.",
      "\"I'm not surprised that they [the British] are going to do it, and because of our cultural and historical connections, they can do it like virtually no other country in the world,\" he continued.",
      "A group called the \u201cStop Trump Coalition\u201d is staging a protest during the president's visit, but he isn\u2019t likely to see it. He\u2019ll be an overnight guest of the king and Queen Camilla at Windsor Castle on Wednesday and will join the royal couple for a carriage procession inside the private estate. By contrast, when French President Emmanuel Macron visited earlier this year, his carriage ride took him through the town of Windsor."

    "summary": "President Donald Trump alleged that \"narcoterrorists\" were on the boat and that they were carrying illegal drugs destined for the United States.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump said Monday that the U.S. military had carried out a strike on a second Venezuelan boat, alleging that the ship was helmed by \u201cnarcoterrorists\u201d and carrying \u201cillegal narcotics\u201d headed to the United States.",
      "Trump said the strike killed three people, whom he called \u201cmale terrorists,\u201d and that no U.S. forces were harmed. It came nearly two weeks after the United States blew up a boat off Venezuela, killing 11 people, with Trump saying the vessel was carrying drugs and operated by the Tren de Aragua gang.",
      "Trump announced Monday's strike on Truth Social, adding a short video of a boat being set aflame. He wrote that people transporting drugs that can kill Americans should take it as a warning, adding, \u201cWE ARE HUNTING YOU!\u201d",
      "Asked by a reporter Monday in the Oval Office whether he planned to provide proof that the second vessel was carrying narcoterrorists, Trump indicated that the video supported his argument.",
      "\u201cWell, we have proof. All you have to do is look at the cargo that was, like \u2014 it spattered all over the ocean, big bags of cocaine and fentanyl all over the place, and it was \u2014 plus, we have recorded evidence that they were leaving,\u201d Trump said.",
      "The top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, condemned the strikes, calling them an \"outrageous violation of the law.\"",
      "\"These reckless, unauthorized operations not only put American lives at risk, they threaten to ignite a war with Venezuela that would drag our nation into a conflict we did not choose,\" Reed said.",
      "Venezuelan government officials did not specifically refer to the second strike Monday, but Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said at a televised news conference on state-run media after Trump\u2019s announcement that the United States was deliberately provoking Venezuela. He added that the relations between the two countries had crumbled, and he placed the blame on the United States.",
      "\u201cSome hope we will fall into the provocations that the U.S. deliberately makes to generate an open military confrontation,\u201d Cabello said.",
      "The Venezuelan government has argued that the boat targeted earlier this month was a fishing vessel. A day after that strike, Trump threatened further escalation, telling reporters that \u201cVenezuela has been a very bad actor.\u201d",
      "Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro had vowed one day before that strike to declare his country a \"republic in arms\" should it be attacked by U.S. forces.",
      "A source familiar with the first strike told NBC News at the time that the U.S. government\u2019s goal was to pressure Maduro to make rash decisions that could lead to his ouster, without the deployment of American troops inside the country.",
      "The Trump administration has placed renewed pressure on Venezuela, leading to tensions between the two countries. The State Department this year designated eight drug cartels and criminal organizations as \u201cglobal terrorists,\u201d giving the government new legal authority to take military action against them.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a Venezuela hard-liner, said in an interview last month that the designation made dealing with the groups a \u201cnational security issue.\u201d",
      "After the strike Monday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reposted video of the explosion and said \"narco-terrorists are the enemies of the United States.\"",
      "\"We will stop at nothing to defend our homeland and our citizens,\" Hegseth said on X. \"We will track them, kill them, and dismantle their networks throughout our hemisphere \u2014 at the times and places of our choosing.\""

      "On Sunday, Qatar began hosting a summit of Arab and Muslim leaders in the wake of the strikes, which drew condemnation from the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and other regional powers.",
      "The Supreme Council of the Gulf Cooperation Council said in a statement Monday that the attack was \u201ca blatant assault on the efforts of the international community and its international organizations aimed at achieving a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and the release of hostages and detainees, and constitutes a flagrant violation of international law.\u201d",
      "The United Nations Human Rights Council said it would hold an urgent debate Tuesday to \u201cdiscuss the recent military aggression\u201d by Israel on Qatar.",
      "Trump met with Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani in New York on Friday, days after Israel\u2019s strike. The Qatari premier, who accused Israel of having \u201ckilled any hope\u201d of releasing hostages still held in Gaza, also met with Rubio and Vice President JD Vance.",
      "Elsewhere, Israeli forces have intensified aerial attacks on famine-stricken Gaza City and nearby areas in recent weeks, as part of an operation to occupy the city."
