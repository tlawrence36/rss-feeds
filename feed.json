      "Actor Kim Sae-ron\u2019s death adds to the list of celebrity deaths in South Korea that underscore the enormous pressure they face under the gaze of a relentlessly unforgiving media that pounces on their every misstep",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- In the about 1,000 days between her drunken-driving crash in May 2022 and her death, South Korean mainstream news organizations published at least around 2,000 stories on film actor Kim Sae-rom.",
      "They illustrate how the local media often cover a celebrity\u2019s fall from grace. Previously one of the brightest young stars in South Korean cinema, Kim was condemned and ridiculed for driving drunk; for talking about her financial struggles after losing roles; for taking a job at a coffee shop; for attempting a comeback in theater; for going out with friends instead of \u201cshowing remorse\u201d; and for being seen smiling on set while shooting an indie movie.",
      "After the 24-year-old actor was found dead at her home Sunday, the headlines predictably swung to calling for changes to the way celebrities are treated in the public arena.",
      "Kim\u2019s death, which police consider a suicide, adds to a growing list of high-profile celebrity deaths in the country, which some experts attribute to the enormous pressure celebrities face under the gaze of a relentlessly unforgiving media that seizes on every misstep.",
      "___",
      "EDITOR'S NOTE: In South Korea, callers can receive 24-hour counseling through the suicide prevention hotline 1577-0199, the \u201cLife Line\u201d service at 1588-9191, the \u201cHope Phone\u201d at 129 and the \u201cYouth Phone\u201d at 1388.",
      "___",
      "Here's a look at the intense pressure faced by South Korean celebrities who fall from grace.",
      "South Korea is notoriously harsh on its celebrities, particularly women.",
      "Kim rose to stardom as a child actor with the 2010 hit crime thriller \u201cThe Man from Nowhere\u201d and garnered acclaim and popularity for her acting in movies and TV dramas for years.",
      "But that changed after May 18, 2022, when Kim crashed a vehicle into a tree and an electrical transformer while driving drunk in southern Seoul. She posted a handwritten apology on Instagram and reportedly compensated around 60 shops that lost power temporarily because of the crash, but that did little to defuse negative coverage and she struggled to find acting work.",
      "When a Seoul court issued a 200 million won ($139,000) fine over the crash in April 2023, Kim expressed her fears about the media to reporters, saying many articles about her private life were untrue.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m too scared to say anything about them,\u201d she said.",
      "In the wake of Kim's drunken-driving crash, celebrity gossip channels on YouTube began posting negative videos about her private life, suggesting without providing evidence that she was exaggerating her financial straits by working at coffee shops, and arguing that social media posts showing her socializing with friends meant she wasn't showing enough remorse.",
      "Other entertainers, especially female, have struggled to find work after run-ins with the law, including drunken driving or substance abuse, and experts say many of them are reluctant to seek treatment for mental health problems like depression, fearing further negative coverage.",
      "Kwon Young-chan, a comedian-turned-scholar who leads a group helping celebrities with mental health issues, said celebrities often feel helpless when the coverage turns negative after spending years carefully cultivating their public image. Kwon, who stayed with Kim's relatives during a traditional three-day funeral process, said her family is considering legal action against a YouTube creator with hundreds of thousands of subscribers for what they describe as groundless attacks on Kim's private life.",
      "Peter Jongho Na, a professor of psychiatry at the Yale School of Medicine, lamented on Facebook that South Korean society had become a giant version of \u201cSquid Game,\u201d the brutal Netflix survival drama, \u201cabandoning people who make mistakes or fall behind, acting as though nothing happened.\u201d",
      "The National Police Agency said officers found no signs of foul play at Kim's home and that she left no note.",
      "But a spate of high-profile deaths has sparked discussions about how news organizations cover the private lives of celebrities and whether floods of critical online comments are harming their mental health. Similar conversations happened after the 2008 death of mega movie star Choi Jin-sil; the death of her former baseball star husband, Cho Sung-min, in 2013; the deaths of K-Pop singers Sulli and Goo Hara in 2019; and the death of \u201cParasite\u201d actor Lee Sun-kyun in 2023.",
      "Sensational but unsubstantiated claims like from social media are widely recycled and amplified by traditional media outlets as they compete for audience attention, said Hyun-jae Yu, a communications professor at Seoul\u2019s Sogang University.",
      "Struggling with a sharp decline in traditional media readership, he said, media turn to covering YouTube drama as the easiest way to drive up traffic, often skipping the work of reporting and verifying facts.",
      "Following the 2019 deaths of Sulli and Goo Hara, which were widely attributed to cyberbullying and sexual harassment both in the public and media, lawmakers proposed various measures to discourage harsh online comments. These included expanding real-name requirements and strengthening websites\u2019 requirements to weed out hate speech and false information, but none of these proposed laws passed.",
      "South Korean management agencies are getting increasingly active in taking legal action to protect their entertainers from online bullying. Hybe, which manages several K-Pop groups including BTS, publishes regular updates about lawsuits it\u2019s filing against social media commentators it deems malicious.",
      "But Yu said it's crucial for mainstream media companies to strengthen self-regulation and limit their use of YouTube content as news sources. Government authorities could also compel YouTube and other social media platforms to take greater responsibility for content created by their users, he said, including actively removing problematic videos and preventing creators from monetizing them.",
      "The South Korean office of Google, YouTube's parent company, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Heo Chanhaeng, an executive director at the Center for Media Responsibility and Human Rights, said news organizations and websites should consider shutting down the comments sections on entertainment stories entirely.",
      "\u201cHer private life was indiscriminately reported beyond what was necessary,\u201d Heo said. \"That\u2019s not a legitimate matter of public interest.\u201d",

      "A famous YouTuber in India is facing public outrage and a police investigation after he made an allegedly obscene remark on a YouTube show last week",
      "NEW DELHI -- A famous YouTuber in India is facing public outrage and a police investigation after he made an allegedly obscene remark on a YouTube show, raising questions about freedom of speech in a country where digital creators in the past have come under fire for their content.",
      "The controversy began last week when social media influencer and YouTuber Ranveer Allahbadia made remarks to a participant on a comedy show about his parents' personal relationship. The joke was quickly condemned by social media users, public figures and political leaders.",
      "Multiple police complaints were filed against Allahabadia and Samay Raina, who hosts the show \u201cIndia\u2019s Got Latent.\u201d Both of them, along with some other participants on the show, were summoned by police for questioning and the issue was also raised in Parliament.",
      "On the show, Allahbadia asked a contestant: \u201cWould you rather watch your parents have sex every day for the rest of your life or join in once and stop it forever?\u201d",
      "Allahbadia, who has interviewed senior Indian ministers and Bollywood celebrities on his YouTube channel, has since apologized for the comments. Raina, meanwhile, has removed all videos of the show from his YouTube channel and said he was \u201cfully cooperating\u201d with the authorities.",
      "India\u2019s Supreme Court on Tuesday shielded Allahbadia from arrest but said his conduct showed \u201clack of responsibility\u201d and was \u201ccondemnable.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is something that is dirty in his mind that has been vomited by way of this program,\u201d the judge hearing the case said.",
      "The court also ordered Allahbadia to surrender his passport at a police station and barred him from leaving the country.",
      "The case, however, prompted a parliamentary panel to write to the country's Information Technology Ministry seeking steps to amend existing laws to clamp down on such content.",
      "One lawmaker also asked Parliament to enact a law to regulate social media platforms, raising fears that the controversy will be used by the federal government to regulate online content.",
      "Indian content creators on social media platforms like YouTube, Instagram and X are worried after the government last year proposed draft legislation that aims to overhaul and regulate broadcasting services in the country. The legislation, if enacted into law, would apply to all content creators including YouTubers.",
      "Many content creators, journalists and digital experts say it could lead to censorship, stifle free speech and significantly expand the government\u2019s powers to regulate digital media content.",
      "\u201cI think we are facing a threat that this particular incident might be a trigger point for obscenity laws,\u201d said Nikhil Pahwa, a digital policy analyst and founder of the tech website MediaNama.",
      "In Allahbadia's case, observers say the controversy was blown out of proportion and could lead to a chilling effect on India\u2019s comedy scene.",
      "\"The morality of the audience and the current political atmosphere is a very strong determining factor that decides whether our jokes are acceptable or not. And once a perception has been made about your content, no one can control its outcome. It is troubling,\u201d said Anurag Minus Verma, a cultural critic based in New Delhi.",
      "This is the not the first time Indian comedians have come under fire for their jokes and faced police crackdowns or their shows being cancelled.",
      "Stand-up comedy has become hugely popular in recent years in India, but a swelling tide of nationalism under Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's rule has also put comedians under scrutiny for making fun of politicians or making references to religion or national icons.",
      "In 2021, comedian Vir Das faced police complaints for his \u201cI Come from Two Indias\u201d show, which was critical of India over its fight against COVID-19, crimes against women and crackdowns on comedians. During his show, Das described India as a country where people \u201cworship women during the day but gang rape them at night.\u201d",
      "That same year comedians Munawar Faruqui and Nalin Yadav were arrested by police for making allegedly objectionable remarks about Hindu deities while performing in an Indian state that\u2019s ruled by Modi\u2019s party. Faruqui was jailed for a month."

      "In a James Bond shakeup that stirred the film industry, MGM Amazon announced that the studio has taken the creative reins of the 007 franchise after decades of family control",
      "NEW YORK -- In a James Bond shakeup that stirred the film industry, Amazon MGM announced Thursday that the studio has taken the creative reins of the 007 franchise after decades of family control. Longtime Bond custodians Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli said they would be stepping back.",
      "Amazon MGM Studios, Wilson and Broccoli formed a new joint venture in which they will co-own James Bond intellectual property rights \u2014 but Amazon MGM will have creative control.",
      "Financial terms weren\u2019t disclosed. The deal is expected to close sometime this year.",
      "\u201cWith my 007 career spanning nearly 60 incredible years, I am stepping back from producing the James Bond films to focus on art and charitable projects,\u201d Wilson said in a statement. \u201cTherefore, Barbara and I agree, it is time for our trusted partner, Amazon MGM Studios, to lead James Bond into the future.\u201d",
      "Amazon bought MGM Studios in 2022 for $6.5 billion, a purchase that was significantly motivated by the acquisition of one of the movies' most beloved and long-running franchises. Since the Daniel Craig era of 007 concluded with 2021's \u201cNo Time to Die,\u201d Broccoli and Wilson have reportedly clashed with Amazon MGM over the direction of Bond.",
      "The announcement Thursday means that for the first time in the more than 50-year history of Bond, a Broccoli won't be greenlighting a new James Bond film. Amazon MGM also anticipates expanding the franchise beyond movies.",
      "\u201cWe are grateful to the late Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman for bringing James Bond to movie theatres around the world, and to Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli for their unyielding dedication and their role in continuing the legacy of the franchise that is cherished by legions of fans worldwide,\u201d said Mike Hopkins, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios. \u201cWe are honored to continue this treasured heritage, and look forward to ushering in the next phase of the legendary 007 for audiences around the world.\u201d"

      "Being cut cut from her high school basketball team was painful for Baileigh Sinaman-Daniel, but she refused to let that rejection, or being born with one arm, stop her from pursuing her basketball dreams",
      "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- When her high school basketball coach cut her from the team senior year, Baileigh Sinaman-Daniel refused to let that rejection, or the fact she was born with one arm, end her dream of playing the game that her childhood idol LeBron James made her fall in love with 15 years ago.",
      "That determination led the 22-year-old guard at Lesley University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to become the first NCAA Division III women\u2019s basketball player with one arm to score in a collegiate game, said her coach, Martin Rather.",
      "\u201cI kind of just shot the ball with the anticipation that I would have to go and get it back on a rebound,\u201d Sinaman-Daniel said of the historic basket that she made from near the three-point line, which snapped the net without hitting the rim. \u201cWhen the shot actually went in, I was more so surprised.\u201d",
      "Rather immediately called a timeout to mark the moment.",
      "\u201cMy first thought was, \u2018That\u2019s history and we need to take a second to pause and celebrate it,\u2019\u201d Rather said. \u201cEverybody just swarmed Baileigh, giving her high fives, celebrating her.\u201d",
      "The Stafford, Virginia, native\u2019s path to history was sparked by a painful rejection at Mountain View High School.",
      "\u201cI had played for my high school for about three years and my senior year of high school when I tried out again, as I always did, I actually got cut and the coach basically told me that I wasn\u2019t needed on the team,\u201d she said.",
      "That led to two days of misery and crying, until she made a bold decision while sitting in her car.",
      "\u201cI thought to myself, I could do this in college. What\u2019s stopping me from doing this in college?\u201d Sinaman-Daniel said. \u201cSo, I started emailing hundreds of coaches and it didn\u2019t really matter what division it was. I was just trying to get a possible maybe or even better \u2014 a yes.\u201d",
      "That persistence caught Rather\u2019s attention when Sinaman-Daniel, a 5-foot-6-inch guard, entered the transfer portal after two years at Warren Wilson College in North Carolina.",
      "At Lesley, Sinaman-Daniel has become known for her work ethic with the Lynx.",
      "She has completed more individual practice sessions than any other player on the team, which is having its best season in 14 years and has reached the playoffs, Rather said.",
      "\u201cI think any team in this country would benefit from having a player with Baileigh\u2019s heart on their team,\u201d Rather said.",
      "The achievement is particularly notable given the scarcity of one-armed players in collegiate basketball who could have served as role models.",
      "\u201cIt is not very common to see somebody with one arm playing basketball. I think there\u2019s probably about two or three of us in the collegiate level,\u201d Sinaman-Daniel said.",
      "Though there are few other notable one-armed college basketball players, the most successful is likely Hansel Emmanuel at Austin Peay, whose coach describes as \u201cthe biggest inspiration in college sports.\u201d The athletic success of the 6-foot-6 men\u2019s Division I junior, whose arm was amputated at age 6 after an accident, has proved limitations don\u2019t define potential.",
      "Since Sinaman-Daniel could not always use standard balance and ball management techniques used by two-armed players, her on-court success has required unique training methods allowing her to develop fundamental skills.",
      "\u201cTaking passes or giving a good pass or figuring out the right shooting form \u2014 I\u2019ve had to tweak and adjust,\u201d she said.",
      "Sinaman-Daniel scored her second basket on her birthday, some seven weeks after her initial score, adding another layer of satisfaction to her breakthrough season.",
      "The junior guard who was born with a tiny right arm that she is unable to use is studying psychology at the university just outside Boston and hopes her achievement will inspire others facing similar challenges.",
      "\u201cWhen people look at me, I just hope they see me as Baileigh. I hope they see me as a basketball player and also see me as somebody who\u2019s willing and able to do everything that everybody else is doing,\u201d she said.",
      "Rather sees her impact extending beyond the court.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re showing that we can both win and have really high quality players that might not look like everybody else on our team,\u201d he said."

      "\u201cWatson\u201d is an unusual TV medical procedural",
      "NEW YORK -- The idea for a new TV show came to Craig Sweeny as he was driving. The producer and screenwriter, thinking about how to put his own stamp on a medical series, had to pull over when a familiar figure popped into his mind: Sherlock Holmes.",
      "Why not combine a hospital procedural with the lore of Britain's greatest detective? It would have a medical mystery every week and also tell stories of Holmes' good friend, Dr. John Watson. It was a mashup of two popular draws, the TV equivalent of peanut butter and jelly.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re sort of each their own show-worthy premise in a way. And we\u2019re blessed to have both. So they compete for space in a really interesting way,\u201d says Sweeny.",
      "So was born \u201cWatson,\u201d a CBS series starring Morris Chestnut as the titular character who leads a team of medical detectives set in a present-day Pittsburgh populated with Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s characters.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of those blessed moments,\u201d says Sweeny, who was well-versed with the world of Holmes after executive producing and writing for \u201cElementary,\u201d a contemporary update.",
      "\u201cWatson\u201d is not alone among the networks jazzing up the tried-and-true procedural. While the traditional form remains the bedrock of modern TV \u2014 think the prime-time blocks of \u201cNCIS,\u201d \u201cFBI\u201d and \u201cChicago Med\u201d \u2014 new twists are emerging.",
      "ABC\u2019s \u201cDoctor Odyssey\u201d is a medical procedural aboard a luxury cruise ship and NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Hunting Party\u201d mashes up \u201cThe Blacklist\u201d and \u201cCriminal Minds.\u201d CBS has Kathy Bates in \u201cMatlock\u201d playing an underestimated, retirement-age lawyer \u2014 with the twist that she\u2019s really a hard-charging mom out for vengeance.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s something really pleasurable about the self-contained, 43-minute procedural that gives you a beginning, middle and end, a little bit of a mystery and the fun of watching something get figured out,\u201d says Jonathan Tolins, a playwright, TV writer and showrunner. \u201cI think that the audience is so familiar with it that it does reward you if you come up with a sort of fun twist on it.\u201d",
      "Tolins' own current take on the procedural is CBS' \u201cElsbeth,\u201d which takes the quirky character Elsbeth Tascioni from \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d and plops her down in a \u201cColumbo\u201d-style police procedural.",
      "Elsbeth, played by Carrie Preston, is a sleuth in bright colors and a bucket hat, blunt and unpredictable, playing off the guest star of the week. Tolins says the writers and camera crew try not to make her feel like the show's lead, even though she's the very title.",
      "\u201cI said early on that I think the show works best when it feels like a CBS police procedural with Elsbeth thrown into it,\u201d he says. \u201cWe talked about always keeping her sort of out of the center of the frame in wide shots.\u201d",
      "Another elevated procedural with a quirky lead character is ABC\u2019s \u201cHigh Potential,\u201d a police show starring a genius \u2014 but this time, she\u2019s a single mom of three who has an IQ of 160 and is played by Kaitlin Olson.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s a bit of a unicorn,\u201d says Todd Harthan, executive producer and showrunner. \u201cYou throw a unicorn into the bullpen with a bunch of detectives and they go, \u2018What are we supposed to do with this colorful creature with the horn coming out of her head?\u2019\u201d",
      "Supercharging procedurals comes as streaming increasingly offers subscribers a highly curated selection of unconventional, relatively short series with big names and high production values.",
      "\u201cI think that, inevitably, the innovations that streaming is doing bleed into what happens in network TV and challenge what we\u2019re doing to compete for eyeballs in a healthy way,\u201d says Sweeny.",
      "Procedurals are often referred to as the comfort food of TV, offering a predictable, solvable hour with a familiar cast. So strong is our attachment to the form that streaming services have also been stretching their form with shows like the also \u201cColumbo\u201d-like \u201cPoker Face\u201d on Peacock and Max's \u201cThe Pitt,\u201d which takes a medical show like \u201cER\u201d and breaks it down into different hours of a hospital shift, like \u201c24.\u201d",
      "Harthan believes the gap between the streaming and network may be closing as networks offer writers a bit of a longer leash to try different things and streaming looks enviously at the broad audiences that networks pull.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re always sort of learning and trying to glean certain things from different shows that are very different than the one you\u2019re working on day-to-day,\u201d Harthan says. \u201cIt\u2019s just part of the growth of doing what we do for a living.\u201d",
      "Showrunners caution that mixing different elements into a show to raise the level can't be done willy-nilly. The creator of \u201cWatson\u201d notes that its hero was already a doctor in the world of Sherlock Holmes, so making him head of a clinic makes sense.",
      "\u201cIt is an exotic combo, but it\u2019s also very organic,\u201d says Sweeny. \u201cMechanically you don\u2019t have to force anything into place. Everything\u2019s already there.\u201d",
      "A few years ago, the term \u201cgourmet cheeseburger\u201d was given to streaming shows that were both premium and commercial \u2014 take \u201cBridgerton\u201d \u2014 and network TV may be going through their own gourmet cheeseburger phase.",
      "\u201cThe more the two converge, the better,\u201d says Robert King. He and his wife, Michelle King, are the prolific creators of shows on networks (\u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d \u201cEvil\u201d and \u201cElsbeth\u201d) and streaming (\u201cHappy Face\u201d).",
      "\u201cWe love working in both and we don\u2019t start with, \u2018Oh, we must do a network show,\u2019 or, \u2018We must do a streaming show.\u2019 It's very much, \u2018This idea we have fits more comfortably either in network or in streaming,\u2019\u201d says Michelle King.",
      "Robert King considers one of the greatest TV hybrids to be \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d which mixed a comic premise with violence and put it into a serialized format. It was a hit for HBO but was originally pitched to a network, Fox.",
      "\u201cI do think the hybrid goes back to \u2018The Sopranos,\u2019 at least and I\u2019m sure beyond that,\u201d he says.",
      "Tolins, who leads the \u201cElsbeth\u201d writing room, recently got some nice feedback about his elevated procedural skills. CBS did a focus group about the new season's premiere episode, which starred \u2014 spoilers \u2014 Nathan Lane as the killer of an obnoxious operagoer.",
      "\u201cOne of the women who saw it afterwards kept saying, \u2018This is network? I\u2019m going to have to watch more network television,\u2019 which of course was very, very satisfying for all of us listening,\u201d Tolins says."

      "Christoph Waltz\u2019s Danny Dolinski is the one at an unwelcome crossroads in the film. He\u2019s only partially healed from a hand injury that\u2019s rendered him dependent on pills and unable to aim a gun as well as he used to. Dolinski also seems to be in the throes of a full crisis: We meet him not on the job, or even in flashback to his pre-injury glory, but out clubbing. The next morning, Dolinski emerges in a bathrobe to gaze proudly upon the several much younger women who have spent the night.",
      "But a room full of scantily clothed model-types who seem to be there willingly is only a temporary balm for poor Dolinski. While he might still be a viable specimen for the 20-something party girls of London, his game does not hold the same appeal in the workplace. Soon he\u2019ll be getting the dreaded \u201cwe\u2019re going younger\u201d talk from his boss, and she\u2019s talking about him, not his love interests. This is a guy who is certain he\u2019s got a lot left to give in the assassin game, and not as a mentor to a \u201chitman prodigy,\u201d as Cooper Hoffman\u2019s character Wihlborg is described.",
      "Is a familiar conceit like the wise veteran and the cocksure newcomer tired or a classic? Well, it\u2019s all in the execution. And \u201cOld Guy,\u201d stylishly filmed though it may be, is not one of the better attempts, likely hampered by the script from Greg Johnson. Generational clashes should be easy enough comedic fodder for a screenwriter and two capable actors, but here it lands with a thud. One likes to drink! The other doesn\u2019t even like to be around alcohol! The more serious ethical questions about hitman etiquette are similarly inelegant. Take this gem from Wihlborg: \u201cWhere I come from one does what one needs to do to survive. That includes killing a kid.\u201d",
      "Hoffman, so perfect leading \u201cLicorice Pizza,\u201d is not served well by this script, which never quite justifies why he\u2019s such a prodigy at such a young age and doesn\u2019t give him or Waltz any room to play off one another in a natural way. Waltz also can\u2019t seem to choose a lane with Danny, an eccentric hedonist with a soul who doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to kill kids on the job. He\u2019s also working with his normal accent which is all well and good until the movie very unnecessarily introduces his Irish mother.",
      "And because action movies of this variety need a woman, Lucy Liu, who deserves much, much better than this (they all do, but mostly her), goes along for the ride. Her character Anata is the glamorous manager of a Soho karaoke bar that might also be a front for a brothel, but that\u2019s never really explored. What is deemed important here is that she\u2019s Dolinski\u2019s longtime confidante, and tags along on their mission to Belfast for\u2026wait for it\u2026a date. It\u2019s a very strange little subplot in which Anata does go to this date only to be broken up with. The guy she\u2019s been seeing is not connected to the larger plot in any way, except as the narrative push to have her ultimately fall in Dolinski\u2019s arms.",
      "West is an action and studio system veteran behind \u201cCon Air,\u201d \u201cLara Croft: Tomb Raider\u201d and various Jason Statham vehicles. There's lots of shoot-em-up action and bullets to the head for anyone looking for that, but not much more to hang on to. \u201cOld Guy\u201d feels very of this moment in the fact that it looks good and has a good cast and yet can\u2019t seem to deliver something that\u2019s either entertaining or meaningful. But unlike so many of its peers, this one amazingly was not made by a streamer.",
      "\u201cOld Guy,\u201d a The Avenue release in limited theaters and on VOD Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for \u201clanguage, violence, some drug use.\u201d Running time: 93 minutes. One and a half stars out of four."

      "\u201cI got a phone call from a number I didn't recognize,\" the author said during a recent interview. \u201cWhen the caller said she was Oprah Winfrey I nearly dropped the phone I was so baffled. I was expecting to talk to my publicist, and at first, I didn't believe her. But then she started to talk in that inimitable way.\u201d",
      "The 54-year-old author is an associate professor at Johns Hopkins University who hopes the Winfrey endorsement might mark a shift from years \u201ctoiling in obscurity,\u201d wishing only that he could attract enough readers to keep writing. \u201cDream State\u201d is the fourth book from Puchner, whose previous works include the story collections \u201cMusic Through the Floor\u201d and \u201cLast Day on Earth\u201d and the novel \u201cModel Home,\u201d a finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award in 2011.",
      "Puchner's latest work, published Tuesday, is a love triangle among two old college friends and the woman they both have wished to marry.

      "The trial of the only suspect ever charged in the 1996 killing of rap icon Tupac Shakur has been postponed",
      "LAS VEGAS -- A Nevada judge on Tuesday postponed the murder trial of the only suspect ever charged in the 1996 killing of rap icon Tupac Shakur for nearly a year, saying she had little choice given new developments presented by his defense attorneys and the need to ensure a fair trial.",
      "The trial of Duane \u201cKeffe D\u201d Davis, previously set for next month in Las Vegas, has been rescheduled for Feb. 9, 2026. The judge ordered prosecutors and the defense to return to court over the summer for a status hearing.",
      "\u201cIt looks like there are quite a few things that are left to be done to get this case prepared so that Mr. Davis can have effective assistance of counsel,\u201d Clark County District Court Judge Carli Kierny said during a short hearing.",
      "When asked by the judge if he was OK with moving the trial that far out, Davis agreed.",
      "Davis' defense team filed a motion Friday seeking more time, saying critical investigative work had to be done and witnesses needed to be interviewed to ensure he gets a fair trial. The lawyers said a private investigator identified witnesses who can testify that Davis was not at the scene of the shooting.",
      "Attorney Carl Arnold, who is leading the defense, said the case involves decades-old allegations and critical facts have yet to be fully examined.",
      "On the night of Sept. 7, 1996, Shakur was in a BMW being driven by Death Row Records founder Marion \u201cSuge\u201d Knight. They were waiting at a red light when a white Cadillac pulled up next to them and gunfire erupted.",
      "Davis, an ex-gang leader who is accused of orchestrating Shakur\u2019s killing near the Las Vegas Strip, has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder and has been jailed since his September 2023 arrest.",
      "Davis has acknowledged in interviews and in his tell-all memoir that he provided the gun used in the drive-by shooting and that he was in the car. But his court filings say his descriptions in recent years of orchestrating the shooting were \u201cdone for entertainment purposes and to make money.\u201d",
      "Arnold has argued that Davis never should have been charged because of immunity agreements that Davis says he reached years ago with federal and local prosecutors while living in California.",
      "Prosecutors disagree, saying they have strong evidence against Davis and any immunity agreement was limited.",
      "Defense attorneys also are raising questions about the manner of Shakur's death, saying they have witness information indicating that he was in stable condition after the shooting and died suddenly after being hospitalized for a week. They want to consult medical and forensic experts to evaluate potential alternative causes of death."

      "A collection of essays by the late David McCullough, including some never published before, will be released this fall",
      "NEW YORK -- A collection of essays by the late David McCullough, including some never published before, will be released this fall.",
      "\u201cHistory Matters\u201d is scheduled for Sept. 16, Simon & Schuster announced Tuesday. McCullough's daughter, Dorie McCullough Lawson, and longtime researcher Michael Hill co-edited the book. Fellow historian Jon Meacham contributed a foreword.",
      "\u201cIt has been an honor to work with my father\u2019s writings in the years since his death,\" Lawson said in a statement. \"My mother, Rosalee, always said that his work was built to last, and it has been reassuring to see how right she was. What comes through most clearly in this collection are the themes of his optimism, integrity, careful study, independence, creativity, hard work, and love of country.\u201d",
      "McCullough, who died in 2022 at age 89, was a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner and among the beloved and influential historians of his time. His books include biographies of President Harry Truman and President John Adams, \u201c1776\" and an acclaimed work on the Brooklyn Bridge, \u201cThe Great Bridge.\u201d",
      "\u201cOver the course of his distinguished storytelling career, David McCullough emphatically showed the public why history matters,\u201d Simon & Schuster\u2019s announcement reads in part.",
      "\u201cNow, at a time of self-reflection in America following an election that has left the country divided, his essays explore core American values to which we all subscribe, regardless of which region we live in, which political party we identify with, or how our backgrounds differ \u2014 values like optimism, determination, and character. The book also shares McCullough\u2019s advice about writing along with his own early influences and inspirations.\u201d"

      "Yura Borisov does not have a flashy entrance in \u201cAnora.\u201d His character Igor isn\u2019t even introduced until the movie\u2019s nearly halfway through. He\u2019s just the hired muscle, quietly observing and reacting to the quickly devolving situation around him. And yet you can\u2019t take your eyes off of this stranger.",
      "Up until that point it\u2019s been the Mikey Madison show, a chronicle of her character Ani\u2019s whirlwind romance with the spendy, wild son of a Russian oligarch. Igor arrives at the turning point, the end of the honeymoon and the beginning of a swift descent into a chaotic, all-night manhunt. And soon he establishes himself not just as an intriguing outsider, but the soul of the film: The henchman with a heart.",
      "It\u2019s a performance that has caught many off guard: An introduction to a fresh face with an undeniable star quality that has earned him nominations from the Oscars, the Screen Actors Guild and the BAFTAs. But Borisov, 32, is only a newcomer in some parts of the world. Already a star in Russia, Borisov broke through on the international scene in the Cannes title \u201cCompartment No. 6\u201d as the uncouth miner sharing a cramped room with a Finnish student on a long train ride through Russia.",
      "That was the performance that made filmmaker Sean Baker take note and give him a call about participating in what would become \u201cAnora.\u201d Baker has described his secret weapon, who quickly becomes the beating heart and soul of the film, as the \u201cRussian Ryan Gosling.\" Borisov is flattered, but also little confused by the comparison.",
      "\u201cI love Ryan Gosling and very interested to work with him one day. I\u2019ve seen his films. He plays very, very cool. But I don\u2019t know what he means,\u201d Borisov laughed. \u201cLet\u2019s ask Sean.\u201d",
      "Baker, for his part, knew he had a ringer in Borisov but doesn\u2019t show his hand from the top. He strings the audience along, letting them feel like they\u2019re discovering something too. The 28-minute real-time home invasion scene where we meet Igor was actually Borisov\u2019s first to film. It was rehearsed and discussed in detail before the cameras started rolling. In all, it took about eight days to film and three months to edit.",
      "\u201cWe discussed everything trying to find the balance humor and scares and drama and comedy because it\u2019s important for this scene to,\" Borisov said. \u201cBut for me I\u2019m just thinking about a real person named Igor and a real person named Anora.\u201d",
      "He and Baker spoke a lot about Igor\u2019s past, his story, his dreams and his clothes. The white Nike sneakers as contrast to Igor\u2019s all black outfit, he thought, were particularly poignant \u2014 a symbol of Igor\u2019s soul. He liked that his director would ask him if he thought Igor might do this or that instead of just telling him to do something.",
      "But Borisov is not the kind of actor who thinks that he has much interesting to say or explain about his performance. If he could, he said, he\u2019d be a writer. For him, it\u2019s the work that does the talking.",
      "\u201cThe most important is what do you feel when you see the film,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not so important what we were discussing.\u201d",
      "The week that Borisov spoke to the AP was the week \u201cAnora\u201d had emerged as the frontrunner in an awards race that had previously been wide open. The supporting actor category however, competitive as it may be with nominees like Edward Norton, Guy Pearce and Jeremy Strong, has been considered Kieran Culkin\u2019s to lose for some time now. But it\u2019s still significant: Borisov is the first Russian actor to get an Oscar nomination since Mikhail Baryshnikov\u2019s nod in 1977 for \u201cThe Turning Point.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy that it means something for a lot of people and that\u2019s why it means a lot for me,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople could feel some hope maybe inside them, maybe proud inside them, you know? \u201c",
      "It\u2019s been a wild ride since Cannes and the end is now in sight. Soon he\u2019d be leaving for London, to attend the BAFTAs, and in two weeks Los Angeles for the Oscars. The accolades and nominations have been exciting, though the impulse to keep the conversations going with all the interesting people he\u2019s met along the way has led to more than few late nights.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a crazy, crazy time,\u201d he said.",
      "It\u2019s too early for him to talk publicly about how much the raised profile has impacted his career, but, he teased \u201clife is changing.\u201d And if he\u2019s being completely honest, he\u2019s happiest about simply getting to spend more time with the people he made the film with.",
      "\u201cMaybe it looks like kind of stupid because you could say that \u2018man, it\u2019s awards, it\u2019s big opportunities for you, why are you talking about spend time with your friends?\u2019\u201d Borisov said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s kind of stupid, but for me, it\u2019s still important to spend this time with them together. Because without this stuff, we will go to live our life separately. And it will be one day, of course, and I\u2019m kind of sad about this but it just will come. Now we\u2019re still together and I\u2019m happy about this.\u201d",

      "The new National Institutes of Health policy would strip research groups of hundreds of millions of dollars to cover so-called indirect expenses of studying Alzheimer's, cancer, heart disease and a host of other illnesses \u2014 anything from clinical trials of new treatments to basic lab research that is the foundation for discoveries. Now U.S. District Judge Angel Kelley, who was appointed by Democratic President Joe Biden, must decide whether to extend the temporary restraining order blocking those cuts.",
      "The states and research groups say such a move is illegal, pointing to bipartisan congressional action during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term to prohibit it.",
      "\u201cYet here we are again,\u201d attorneys argued in a court motion, saying the NIH is \u201cin open defiance\u201d of what Congress decreed.",
      "In its own written arguments, the Trump administration said NIH has authority to alter the terms after awarding grants and that Kelley\u2019s courtroom isn\u2019t the proper venue to arbitrate claims of breach of contract.",
      "States and researchers \u201chave failed to show that they would suffer an irreparable injury,\u201d according to the administration motion.",
      "The NIH, the main funder of biomedical research, awarded more than 60,000 grants last year totaling about $35 billion. The total is divided into \"direct\" costs \u2013 covering researchers\u2019 salaries and laboratory supplies \u2013 and \u201cindirect\u201d costs, the administrative and facility costs needed to support that work.",
      "The Trump administration had dismissed those expenses as \u201coverhead\u201d but universities and hospitals argue they\u2019re far more critical. They can include such things as electricity to operate sophisticated machinery, hazardous waste disposal, staff who ensure researchers follow safety rules and janitorial workers.",
      "Different projects require different resources. Labs that handle dangerous viruses, for example, require more expensive safety precautions than a simpler experiment. So currently each grant\u2019s amount of indirect costs is negotiated with NIH, some of them small while others reaching 50% or more of the total grant.",
      "If the new policy stands, indirect costs would be capped at 15% immediately, for already awarded grants and new ones. NIH calculated that would save the agency $4 billion a year.",
      "A motion filed earlier this week cited a long list of examples of immediate harm in blue states and red states. They included the possibility of ending some clinical trials of treatments at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, that could leave \u201ca population of patients with no viable alternative.\"",
      "Officials at Johns Hopkins University were more blunt, saying the cut would end or require significantly scaling back research projects potentially including some of the 600 NIH-funded studies open to Hopkins patients.",
      "\u201cThe care, treatments and medical breakthroughs provided to them and their families are not \u2018overhead,\u2019\u201d university president Ron Daniels and Hopkins Medicine CEO Theodore DeWeese wrote to employees.",
      "Attorneys also argued the cuts would harm state economies. The University of Florida would need to cut \u201ccritical research staffing\u201d by about 45 people, while construction of a new research facility in Detroit expected to create nearly 500 new jobs could be paused or even abandoned, they wrote.",
      "\u201cImplementing this 15% cap will mean the abrupt loss of hundreds of millions of dollars that are already committed to employing tens of thousands of researchers and other workers, putting a halt to countless lifesaving health research and cutting-edge technology initiatives,\u201d the lawsuit said.",

      "Abortion rights groups fear punishment for women who have abortions and governments tracking pregnancies",
      "Abortion rights advocates feared the 2022 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that opened the door to state abortion bans would also lead to tracking women and charging women who get abortions with murder.",
      "No states have allowed either, but the ideas, once off the table, have gotten attention in legislatures this month.",
      "Oklahoma lawmakers killed a bill that would have allowed murder charges after a public hearing, and North Dakota did so after a floor debate. Similar bills have been introduced before, but they haven't been granted hearings, in part because most major anti-abortion groups oppose them.",
      "A Missouri committee heard testimony on a bill to create a database of pregnant women deemed \u201cat risk\u201d of getting an abortion and connecting them with prospective adoptive parents.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at the proposals:",
      "Under the Missouri legislation, the state Department of Social Services would be directed to create a new division tasked with maintaining a \u201ccentral registry of each expectant mother who is at risk for seeking an abortion.\u201d",
      "The division would also keep a list of prospective adoptive parents and coordinate adoption proceedings.",
      "House Speaker Jonathan Patterson, a Republican, said Thursday that he wants to aid adoption but that the bill doesn't have broad support among House Republicans. Two similar bills were rescinded this week.",
      "\u201cThere is some question about the central registry and databases,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cThat has to be really tightened up to make sure that people\u2019s privacy is protected.\u201d",
      "Republicans are also wary of expanding government and concerned about the measure's estimated $30 million-a-year cost.",
      "Still, it has won some support.",
      "\u201cBills like this continue to disprove the false narrative advanced by pro-abortion advocates that the pro-life movement does not care about women, or care about children after they are born,\u201d Susan Klein, executive director of Missouri Right to Life, wrote in a statement supporting the bill.",
      "The Planned Parenthood Federation of America says the Missouri legislation is the first of its kind, though fears over the potential tracking of pregnant women are nothing new.",
      "Abortion rights advocates have long argued that if individuals\u2019 reproductive health information is not kept private, then it could be used not only in targeted ads but also in law enforcement investigations. Some Democratic-led states have taken steps to protect such health data in recent years.",
      "On a call with reporters Wednesday, Katie Knutter, executive director of Wellspring Health Access, which provides abortion in Wyoming, said that she hears from out-of-state patients that they might be tracked by their home states when they seek abortion \u2014 even though laws to do so are not on the books.",
      "\u201cThe broader discussion in the media has made patients very aware and very concerned about these things,\u201d Knutter said.",
      "Oklahoma\u2019s Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday voted 6-2 against advancing a proposal to allow murder charges against women who obtain abortions, with possible punishments including the death penalty and life in prison.",
      "A week earlier, North Dakota\u2019s House rejected a measure with similar features 77-16.",
      "Groups including the National Right to Life Committee and Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America have for years been urging lawmakers not to consider those measures, arguing that women are often coerced into abortion and should not be punished.",
      "Some conservative lawmakers see it differently.",
      "\u201cWhile the abortion clinics no longer offer or perform abortion, there is a massive loophole in Oklahomans' laws,\u201d Sen. Dusty Deevers, who sponsored the Oklahoma measure, told the judiciary committee during a hearing Wednesday. \u201cNamely, they don\u2019t apply to the mothers themselves.\u201d",
      "Deevers said his approach is the only way to stop the flow of abortion pills prescribed by doctors in other states via telehealth and shipped in. A survey conducted for the Society of Family Planning, which advocates abortion access, found that there were nearly 1,000 abortions via telemedicine in Oklahoma in the second half of 2023. The Guttmacher Institute, another research organization that supports abortion rights, has found that by 2023, more than 6 in 10 abortions in the formal healthcare system nationally involved pills.",
      "Democrats and some Republicans on the committee had concerns, including that the law could lead to criminal investigations of women who have miscarriages, that such an extreme approach could rally support for a state constitutional amendment to allow abortion, or that enforcement would be hard.",
      "Similar measures in Idaho and Indiana appear unlikely to advance. Bills have also been introduced in South Carolina and Texas.",

    "summary": "Spending all day standing can take a toll on a worker&rsquo;s body",
    "story": [
      "Spending all day standing can take a toll on a worker\u2019s body",
      "NEW YORK -- While traveling in Europe, Margaux Lantelme noticed something different about the store cashiers: they did their work sitting down. It was a stark contrast to Chicago, where Lantelme works the register at REI and cashiers typically spend eight hours a day on their feet.",
      "For Lantelme, a former kayaking instructor, prolonged standing can trigger flare-ups of chronic pain that limit her mobility. She requested a chair to use during her shift and got one. But after a change in management, she had to fill out paperwork to keep the chair, which required multiple doctor visits and insurance co-payments over a period of months. She's still waiting for final approval.",
      "\u201cNot having access to a chair without approval from a doctor, which costs money and time and energy, is really ridiculous,\u201d Lantelme said. \u201cI personally think that people should be able to have access to seating at work anytime they need it.\u201d",
      "Standing for long periods can lead to low back pain, fatigue, muscle pain and leg swelling, and it can increase the risk of cardiovascular problems and pregnancy complications, according to a review conducted by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Researchers there concluded that movement, whether walking or shifting from a standing to a seated or leaning position, appeared to be the best way of reducing those health hazards.",
      "Being on one's feet for an extended time also can lead to chronic venous insufficiency, a disease in which damaged veins impact blood circulation, according to the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses, which represents operating room nurses.",
      "The association recommends trying \u201cfatigue-reducing techniques such as alternate propping one foot on a footstool, the use of anti-fatigue mats, using a sit-stand stool and wearing supportive footwear,\u201d said Lisa Spruce, senior director of evidence-based perioperative practices at AORN.",
      "Many jobs besides nursing require extended standing: department store sales clerks, hairdressers, surgeons, restaurant cooks and airport workers are just some of the people who perform their roles on their feet.",
      "Cecilia Ortiz, 43, used to work as an airport wheelchair attendant in Phoenix. \u201cIt takes a really hard toll on the knees,\u201d she said. The break room had three or four chairs, which wasn\u2019t enough for everyone, so workers often went to the hallway and sat on the floor, Ortiz said.",
      "She said she once got written up by her boss for sitting down at an electronic device charging station for 15 minutes after she'd been on her feet for five hours without a break.",
      "Ortiz now works for a warehouse that provides supplies to the airport, and when she needs to sit, she can.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not so strict over there. If we needed to sit down for any reason there wouldn\u2019t be a problem,\u201d Ortiz said.",
      "Her former employer, Prospect Airport Services, said it adheres to all local, state and federal labor regulations regarding breaks. \"Our employees are welcome to take their breaks and meals in our designated break room or in any common-use space throughout the airport,\" company spokesperson Jackie Reedy said. \"This policy allows our employees to choose the location that best suits their needs.\u201d",
      "Unionized workers at the Barnes & Nobles store in Manhattan's Union Square have made access to chairs and the right to sit down under certain conditions a part of their negotiations for their first contract.",
      "\u201cThe longer I\u2019ve been at the job, I\u2019ve started noticing knee issues, especially because we do a lot of bending down and standing back up when we\u2019re shelving books and showing customers things and creating displays,\u201d bookseller Bear Spiegel, 28, said. \u201cBeing able to have a stool available would be really useful just so I could rest my knees for a couple of minutes throughout the day while I\u2019m doing things on the computer while I\u2019m at the registers.\u201d",
      "Spiegel\u2019s coworkers suggested wearing a knee brace and athletic tape, and those solutions have helped, but it\u2019s hard for him to predict what days he\u2019ll need the extra support because his symptoms vary each day, he said.",
      "\u201cThere have been days that I\u2019ve requested a stool and thankfully my managers have allowed me to take them out and use them when needed,\u201d Spiegel said.",
      "Barnes & Noble uses chairs or stools routinely for those working off the sales floor when it\u2019s sensible to do so, but a lot of a bookseller\u2019s work is done on the move, including unpacking, sorting and shelving books, a company spokesperson said.",
      "The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which represents about 100,000 workers, has been pushing to include in the contracts it negotiates, including at Barnes & Noble, a guaranteed right to sit during work that can be done seated, said Stuart Appelbaum, the union's president.",
      "During one bargaining session, an employer objected to the demand. Union negotiators used a break that emptied the conference room to underline their position. \u201cThe employer came back and saw we had removed all chairs from the negotiating table,\u201d Appelbaum said. \u201cI think the point was made.\u201d",
      "In the end, the union got the chairs it wanted written into the contract, he said.",
      "Around the turn of the 20th century, most states in the U.S. had laws requiring seating for female workers. Women were increasingly entering the workforce, and there was a fear that if their jobs were too physically taxing, they might not become pregnant, said Eileen Boris, a labor historian and professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara.",
      "Women were seen as the \u201cmothers of the human race, and thus we have to protect motherhood,\u201d Boris added. \u201cAlmost every state had laws, but they weren\u2019t enforced.\u201d",
      "Those laws were repealed over time because they applied only to women. One reason was that the women's movement was pushing for equal rights, rather than special treatment, Boris said.",
      "Labor movements in other countries were more successful in establishing requirements about seating. \u201cThe English shop movement was much stronger and had more men in it than the U.S.,\" Boris said.",
      "In 1964, the International Labour Organization, a U.N. agency, adopted workplace standards requiring employers to furnish sufficient and suitable seats, as well as reasonable opportunities for workers to use them. More than 50 countries ratified the agreement, but the U.S. was not one of them.",
      "Today, California, Florida, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey, Oregon and Wisconsin are among the states with \u201cright to sit\u201d laws that obligate employers to provide suitable seating for all workers, regardless of gender, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "The city of Ann Arbor, Michigan, approved an ordinance in October that requires manufacturers, retail stores, laundromats, hotels, restaurants, hairdressers, barbers and skin care professionals to let workers sit down as along as sitting doesn\u2019t interfere with their duties. A statewide bill also was introduced in Michigan last fall.",

    "story": [
      "A U.S. aid freeze is threatening the lives of HIV-positive orphans at Nyumbani Children\u2019s Home in Nairobi",
      "NAIROBI, Kenya -- Two-year-old Evans was brought to the Nyumbani Children\u2019s Home in Nairobi, Kenya a year ago, suffering from HIV and tuberculosis. With no family to care for him, Evans was referred to the orphanage by a health center after he stopped responding to medical treatment.",
      "Nyumbani Children\u2019s Home is the reason Evans is still alive. But political decisions made thousands of miles (kilometers) away might spell the end of his short life. Nyumbani provides him and around 100 other children with antiretroviral medication, which they have been receiving from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) through the Kenyan government.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s recent executive order to freeze USAID\u2019s funding means Nyumbani\u2019s access to life-saving antiretroviral drugs, which stop the HIV virus from replicating in the body, may end soon.",
      "Trump\u2019s order seeks to review almost all U.S. foreign aid for 90 days and his administration has moved to shut down USAID. The effects are beginning to set it in, with thousands of people losing their jobs globally and humanitarian programs around the world disrupted.",
      "For children at Nyumbani Children's Home, it's a life and death situation.",
      "As he plays with other preschoolers, Evans is oblivious to his uncertain future, despite the worry on his caregivers\u2019 faces.",
      "The tiny graves at one end of the orphanage compound are a bleak reminder of what a future without USAID looks like for the children. It's a scenario Sister Tresa Palakudy \u2014 who has been looking after children here for 28 years \u2014 is well familiar with having worked at the orphanage before USAID started helping.",
      "\u201cWhen we started caring for them, they didn\u2019t look like they had life in them,\u201d she said. \u201cOne after another, they died. It was so painful, and I don\u2019t want to see that happen again.\"",
      "When Nyumbani, which means \u201cHome\u201d in Swahili, was started in 1992 by Christian missionaries, antiretroviral medication had not been introduced. Back then, it operated as a rescue center for orphaned and abandoned children living with HIV, offering largely palliative care.",
      "The 2003 inception of the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, provided new hope for children living with HIV around the continent, including the orphans at Nyumbani. PEPFAR\u2019s humanitarian aid to combat HIV in Kenya was funded largely by USAID.",
      "\u201cUSAID started bringing ARVs free of charge,\u201d said Palakudy. \u201cWe put all our children on ARVs and their lives changed. They became healthy and were able to go to school and live like other children.\u201d",
      "Over the last two decades, the U.S government, through PEPFAR, has spent more than $8 billion on HIV/AIDS treatment for close to 1.3 million people in Kenya.",
      "USAID and PEPFAR have been critical to operating Nyumbani, having donated more than $16 million to the home between 1999 and 2023. This has enabled the home to reach up to 50,000 children through the rescue center, as well as its two outreach programs Lea Toto and Nyumbani Village. The aid included direct funds to the home, which was used to run the two outreach programs.",
      "Direct funding from USAID was discontinued in 2023, about the same time the orphanage came under scrutiny over allegations of sexual abuse of children by volunteers and staff members.",
      "According to a Washington Post report, six former residents claimed that administrators at the home covered up allegations of sexual abuse. The home disputed the claims of a cover up, insisting that all allegations were handled according to protocols including reporting to local authorities and providing counseling to affected residents.",
      "Executive Director Judith Wamboye said investigations by the Kenyan police were inconclusive. The discontinuation of the funds was not related to the investigations and was in line with a change in USAID policy to channel aid through the government rather than directly to organizations.",
      "The policy change affected all organizations receiving funding. Rather than giving money directly to non-governmental organizations, funding would be channeled through government programs that catered to similar needs. As a result, Nyumbani scaled down its outreach programs and referred beneficiaries to government institutions.",
      "With the discontinuation of direct funding from USAID, the two outreach programs under Nyumbani were scaled down and children in the program were referred to other centers. However, Nyumbani has still been reliant on USAID to supply the lifesaving PEPFAR HIV treatment drugs for free.",
      "\u201cThe future is uncertain,\u201d said Wamboye. \u201cThe Kenyan government announced that they only have ARV stocks to last six months.\u201d",
      "According to data from amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research, about 1.3 million people are on HIV/AIDS treatment in Kenya, and 1,602 orphans and vulnerable children in Kenya are dependent on PEPFAR. amfAR warns that President Trump\u2019s freeze on foreign aid could sever their access to critical medical care.",
      "One such child is Mercy, who has been under the care of Nyumbani for the last 12 years. The ARVs saved her life. \u201cI had a very weak immune system,\" she said. \"This led me to contracting many serious illnesses like tuberculosis and skin diseases.\u201d",
      "Mercy was placed on HIV treatment, giving her a lifeline, but recent news on the freeze order has her scared for her life.",
      "\u201cI am very afraid that previous illnesses that I experienced when I was young will reoccur. And now that I have finished high school and am ready to join college, I am scared it will ruin everything,\u201d she said.",
      "On average, the children's home requires $1,139 per child annually for HIV treatment. In addition to antiretrovirals, the home needs reagents to enable regular testing of the viral load in the children, as well as medicines to treat opportunistic illnesses, which are common among HIV patients.",
      "Wamboye said that should PEPFAR be discontinued permanently, the cost of ARVs could go up and become unaffordable, which will mean children living with HIV will die.",
      "\u201cThis is a life-saving situation and we cannot sit and wait and bargain on human life. So for us, it\u2019s about human life, the lives that we need to save. Something needs to be done urgently,\u201d she said.",

      "New York is suing several large electronic cigarette distributors for allegedly selling vaping flavors that can appeal to children",
      "New York on Thursday sued some of the country\u2019s biggest distributors of electronic cigarettes, accusing the companies of violating state laws that prohibit the sale of vaping flavors and designs that appeal to children.",
      "Attorney General Letitia James announced the lawsuit targeting middlemen that distribute fruit- and candy-flavored e-cigarettes like Puff Bar and Elf Bar to hundreds of convenience stories and gas stations across the state. The approach differs from past litigation by New York and other states, which targeted vaping manufacturers, such as Juul Labs.",
      "Widely blamed for sparking the teen vaping trend, Juul has paid more than $1 billion to settle dozens of state and local lawsuits and investigations into its early marketing practices, which included launch parties and product giveaways. The company stopped selling flavors like mango and mint in 2019 and is no longer popular with teens.",
      "Instead, Chinese-made disposable e-cigarettes like Elf Bar have become the top choice among high school and middle school students. None of the products are approved by federal health regulators but they continue shipping into the U.S., often mislabeled as batteries, cell phones or other products.",
      "The state\u2019s nearly 200-page legal complaint points to \u201cwidespread evidence of illegal conduct, including documents showing illegal shipments of flavored vapes to New York.\u201d The filing also includes photos of brightly colored e-cigarettes that resemble soft drinks and candy and come in flavors like \u201cfruity bears freeze,\u201d \u201ccotton candy,\u201d and \u201cstrawberry cereal donut milk.\u201d",
      "New York banned all vaping flavors other than tobacco in 2020.",
      "\u201cFor too long, these companies have disregarded our laws in order to profit off of our young people, but we will not risk the health and safety of our kids,\u201d James said in a statement.",
      "The lawsuit seeks hundreds of millions of dollars in damages from the companies, as well as a permanent ban on their sales of flavored vapes in New York.",
      "In 2022 litigation, the co-founder of Buffalo-based Demand Vape told a federal judge that his company had sold more than $132 million worth of Elf Bar e-cigarettes in the past year. The company that makes Elf Bar is based in Shenzhen, China, and sells flavors including \u201cstrawberry mango\u201d and \u201clemon mint.\u201d",
      "Despite the continued availability of disposable e-cigarettes, the vaping rate among U.S. teens has fallen to a 10-year low of under 6%, according to federal figures released last year. Government health officials attribute the drop to more aggressive U.S. enforcement, including hundreds of warning letters sent to retail stores selling unauthorized vaping products.",

    "story": [
      "The freeze on U.S. foreign aid ordered by President Donald Trump has effectively halted one of the world's most successful responses to a disease",
      "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- Florence Makumene held a plastic container of HIV medication and wondered if it would be her last as fears swelled of a return to a time decades ago when millions across sub-Saharan Africa died of AIDS.",
      "As a young adult in Zimbabwe, Makumene watched loved ones succumb to a diagnosis of HIV that was viewed back then as a death sentence. But the 53-year-old didn\u2019t have to suffer the same fate when she tested positive in 2016. A community group funded by the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, ensured she enrolled in lifesaving treatment.",
      "\u201cPeople around me, including my own children, had written me off and were preparing to bury me, but I bounced back stronger,\u201d Makumene said.",
      "PEPFAR has been credited with saving more than 26 million lives and helping change the course of AIDS globally since being introduced in 2003. But the 90-day freeze on foreign aid ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump effectively halted one of the world\u2019s most successful responses to a disease, although his administration subsequently promised waivers to keep lifesaving treatment going. A judge has ordered the administration to lift the freeze.",
      "In Africa, thousands of U.S.-funded health workers have been laid off and clinics have closed, restricting access to HIV testing and treatment. African health officials and experts have pleaded for PEPFAR to resume, fearing services that have become a key part of the health care system will be stripped in a way that sets countries back decades.",
      "\u201cPeople are finding doors closed. They are desperate,\u201d said Simon Bwanya of the Zimbabwe National Network of People Living with HIV.",
      "Globally, AIDS-related deaths have been reduced by 69% since the peak in 2004 and new HIV infections have been reduced by 60% since 1995, according to the United Nations AIDS program. Many experts see PEPFAR, which was introduced by Republican President George W. Bush, as a key part of that turnaround, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, the most severely affected region.",
      "\u201cPEPFAR is the most efficient deployment of health resources I have seen,\u201d said professor Francois Venter of the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, who has worked in the HIV sector in South Africa, the country with the most people living with HIV, for more than 20 years. \u201cI challenge anyone to tell me how we could have used the money better.\u201d",
      "PEPFAR\u2019s focus is Africa and the vast majority of lives have been saved there, largely through a program that helps get medication that keeps HIV in check to millions of people. Now their ability to keep taking that medication is in peril.",
      "The nongovernmental organization that helps Makumene has been closed for weeks, as has almost every PEPFAR-funded NGO across Africa while their fates are decided in Washington.",
      "\u201cWe are like orphans; we have no one to turn to,\u201d said Makumene, who has a small stockpile of medication. \u201cI fear we might be going back to the old days when being HIV (positive) was equated with death.\u201d",
      "She is one of some 20 million people worldwide who receive antiretroviral medications, or ARVs, with PEPFAR help. The drugs keep HIV from spreading in the body. Stopping them lets the virus start multiplying again and could lead to the emergence of drug-resistant strains.",
      "\u201cHIV is a simple disease,\u201d Venter said. \u201cYou stop your ARVs, you get AIDS.\u201d",
      "Without the drugs, HIV can rise again to detectable levels in a person's blood, increasing the chance of its spread.",
      "United Nations AIDS program Executive Director Winnie Byanyima told The Associated Press in an interview that the funding freeze could bring a surge in AIDS and has caused \u201cpanic, fear and confusion\u201d in many African countries.",
      "PEPFAR funds thousands of NGOs but also directly supports countries\u2019 public health systems \u2014 in many cases, by paying the salaries for tens of thousands of health workers who are part of the national HIV programs.",
      "In South Africa, PEPFAR pays for 15,000 HIV-specialist health workers in government hospitals and clinics. They represent just 5% of the total number of health workers in South Africa\u2019s HIV response program but are crucial components: doctors and nurses providing ARVs, social workers and counselors, along with community-based workers reaching people far from hospitals and clinics. Removing them breaks the system.",
      "\u201cCritical health care infrastructure is being dismantled, clinics forced to close, frontline workers without support, all while lives hang in the balance,\u201d said Sibongile Tshabalala, chairperson of the Treatment Action Campaign, one of a coalition of HIV advocacy groups that have come together since the funding freeze.",
      "The coalition said basic HIV services, including testing and treatment, were \u201ccrumbling\u201d in one of the country\u2019s main hospitals in Johannesburg.",
      "The South African government said it is looking at plans to avert a crisis by finding money to keep the health workers in place. Other African countries face even bigger problems.",
      "In Kenya, more than 40,000 workers face being laid off after the aid freeze, officials said. In Lesotho, a small, poor nation in southern Africa, 1,500 health workers \u2014 about 7% of the country's entire health staff \u2014 have already been dismissed. Lesotho's Health Ministry has asked final-year medical students and recent graduates to volunteer at local health centers to stand in for them.",
      "On Jan. 28, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced waivers to keep lifesaving treatment and other parts of PEPFAR going. Rubio has said he is a \u201csupporter of PEPFAR\u201d \u2014 though he has some questions about it \u2014 and the Trump administration wants to see it continue.",
      "Last week, a federal judge ordered the administration to temporarily lift the foreign funding freeze and rejected the argument that the administration was offering waivers to allow some funding to keep flowing. The judge cited testimony that no such waiver system yet existed.",
      "Officials with the U.S. Agency for International Development, which provides much of PEPFAR's funding, and aid groups say they know of no payments getting through for that or any program.",
      "Experts and health activists have also criticized the content of the waivers published by the Trump administration, which restrict access to treatment for some.",
      "As well as ARVs, PEPFAR funds pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, a newer preventive medication. But the waivers only allow PEPFAR-funded NGOs to give PrEP to pregnant or breastfeeding women and not to gay men or sex workers, high risk groups for contracting and spreading HIV. Contraception services through PEPFAR have also been halted.",
      "\u201cThe fight against HIV is not over yet,\u201d said Dr. Kebby Musokotwane, director general of the National AIDS Council in Zambia. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of progress that has been made, but there\u2019s still a lot that needs to be done.\u201d",

      "There was a time not long ago that the exercise mantra in gyms was \u201cno pain, no gain.\u201d",
      "If you ever turned on the TV in the 2000s after midnight, you might have seen an informercial for P90X.",
      "The exercise program promised shredded abs and bulging biceps for anyone who pushed themselves to their limits for 90 days of 90-minute workouts. So it may come as a surprise that its creator, Tony Horton, now preaches the benefits of rest and warns against overtraining.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t know then what I know now,\u201d said Horton, who had spent the \u201990s training celebrities. \u201cBack then it was all about warm-ups and cool-downs, and telling them to eat better and get off the hooch.\u201d",
      "His evolution reflects a broader shift in the exercise industry away from a \u201cno pain, no gain\u201d mentality that once dominated but often led to injury. Instead, the current buzzword in fitness is \u201crecovery.\u201d",
      "Horton \u2014 who at 66 still exudes a boyish exuberance \u2014 noted that P90X did include recovery days with stretching and low-impact movement such as yoga. But these days, he prioritizes mindfulness as much as exercise, and the time between workouts is filled with plenty of good sleep, plunges in frigid water baths, using foam rollers on tight muscles, relaxing in a sauna, and other activities in the name of recovery.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t get the recovery and the rest part right, then you\u2019re never going to be able to be consistent with the fitness end of things,\u201d Horton said.",
      "Before Horton, Jane Fonda had pushed home exercisers to \u201cfeel the burn,\u201d while bodybuilders lifted weights to the point of muscle failure. Now, the American College of Sports Medicine and the National Academy of Sports Medicine, two of the largest organizations certifying personal trainers, emphasize recovery methods.",
      "NASM\u2019s \u201cFitness and Wellness\u201d certification includes training in \u201cholistic health and wellness including physical, mental, social and emotional well-being.\u201d",
      "The industry has learned from research that shows the benefit of proper rest, said Stan Kravchenko, founder of the OneFit personal training platform. During deep sleep, the body repairs muscle tissue, and studies show that well-rested people perform better and are less likely to get injured.",
      "But rest is only part of recovery. Kravchenko said personal trainers used to focus only on specific exercises a client could do during their workout. Now, they\u2019re more like life coaches who also give exercise advice.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s more about your lifestyle, how you eat, how you sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you stressed? What do you do for living? Are you working from a desk? So it\u2019s taking a little bit more like a broad approach.\u201d",
      "The \u201cno pain, no gain\u201d motto is great for athletes who can handle intense workouts and are looking to get stronger, but not everyone needs to push themselves that hard, Horton said. It depends on the goal.",
      "Michael Zourdos, chair of exercise science and health promotion at Florida Atlantic University, said lifting weights \u201cuntil failure\u201d may build bigger muscles, but isn\u2019t needed to increase strength. \u201cThere is a difference between training for health and training for elite performance benefits,\u201d he said.",
      "To realize the health benefits of a workout, it\u2019s still necessary to push yourself, Horton said: \u201cIn the muscles, the lungs, your heart, there\u2019s gotta be a certain amount of strain.\u201d",
      "There is a big difference, however, between discomfort and acute pain. If discomfort crosses into sharp pain in joints, tendons or muscles, stop that movement.",
      "People\u2019s needs vary depending on their goals and bodies. But Kravchencko offered a few general guidelines:",
      "For lifting weights, he recommends allowing 48 hours of recovery time per muscle group, and doing a maximum of 10 sets per muscle group per week. During the workout, he said, it\u2019s best to rest for two to three minutes between sets, as opposed to old advice to wait only a minute before exercising the same muscles.",
      "In between workouts, it\u2019s not necessary to stay still.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to do walking, jogging, very light yoga, stretching, pilates, core exercises,\u201d Kravchencko said. \u201cThat\u2019s all fine, because it\u2019s not specifically targeting the areas you\u2019ve targeted before.\u201d",
      "Horton and Kravchencko both mentioned a recovery practice not typically associated with weightlifting \u2014 meditation. Taking a few quiet minutes every morning helps you deal with the physical and emotional stress of life that can get in the way of wanting to exercise, they said.",
      "Horton recommends establishing a mindfulness routine even before formalizing an exercise plan because it will lay the groundwork to be consistent.",
      "\u201cWhat is your strategy to get to get healthy and to get fit and to stay that way?\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of it has to do with letting the pendulum swing the other way.\u201d",

      "Vatican officials said that Pope Francis had developed pneumonia in both lungs, further complicating the pontiff\u2019s recovery",
      "LONDON -- Vatican officials said late Tuesday that Pope Francis had developed pneumonia in both lungs, further complicating the pontiff\u2019s recovery. The 88-year-old pope was hospitalized Friday after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. On Monday, doctors said he had developed a mix of infections in his respiratory tract.",
      "On Wednesday, the Vatican said Pope Francis \u201chad a tranquil night, woke up and had breakfast,\u201d saying he was in good spirits. Here\u2019s a look at what a pneumonia diagnosis can mean and potential treatments doctors might be trying:",
      "Pope Francis was admitted to Rome\u2019s Gemilli hospital in \u201cfair\u201d condition on Friday after his bronchitis worsened. On Monday, doctors said he had developed a polymicrobial respiratory tract infection, or a mix of viruses, bacteria and possibly other organisms were growing in his respiratory tract.",
      "Late Tuesday, the Vatican said a chest scan showed he had developed pneumonia in both lungs, requiring additional medication.",
      "Bronchitis occurs when the airways in the lung, known as the bronchial tubes, become inflamed, leading to coughing and mucus production. That infection can sometimes spread to the lungs, resulting in pneumonia, an inflammation of the lungs that's typically caused by an infection.",
      "Doctors say pneumonia in anyone can be serious, but for someone of the pope\u2019s age, it\u2019s particularly worrying.",
      "\u201cOne of the risk factors for more serious infection, like older age, meaning anyone over 65,\u201d said Dr. Meredith McCormack, director of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Johns Hopkins University.",
      "Even though the pope lost part of his right lung decades ago, McCormack said that shouldn\u2019t necessarily compromise his recovery, adding that she would be more concerned about any possible signs of weakness in His Holiness.",
      "\u201cBeing a more frail older person can increase your risk of having complications,\u201d she said, noting that having to use a wheelchair could be considered a sign of frailty. The pope has relied on a wheelchair for more than two years.",
      "It appears, however, that the pope is not bed-bound. He has been able to get out of bed and his heart function is good, according to a Vatican official.",
      "Beyond antibiotic drug therapy, there are multiple treatments available, including supplemental oxygen and therapies to support the lungs and body while it\u2019s trying to recover.",
      "Dr. Andrew Chadwick, a respiratory and intensive care specialist at Oxford University Hospital in Britain, said steroids and antibiotics would be the core elements of the pope\u2019s care, alongside nursing care and chest physiotherapy.",
      "Physiotherapy can help patients clear the fluids building up in their lungs, particularly if they aren\u2019t very mobile themselves.",
      "McCormack of Johns Hopkins said that severe cases of pneumonia were typically treated for about one to two weeks but that recovery in an older person could extend beyond that.",
      "Mainly, they\u2019ll be hoping that the pope\u2019s condition doesn\u2019t deteriorate further.",
      "\u201cWhile we give antibiotics and other therapies, we\u2019re waiting for the body to respond,\u201d McCormack said. \u201cIf he just stays as he is while he\u2019s fighting off the infection and has a gradual recovery, that lack of worsening would be an encouraging sign.\u201d",
      "Dr. Maor Sauler, who specializes in adult pulmonary and critical care at Yale University, said that antibiotics typically need the lungs to be working to recover from infections, including pneumonia, but the ability of lungs to recover diminishes with age.",
      "\u201cWhen anyone has pneumonia, there\u2019s a good chance we can treat it,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, it is also one of the leading causes of death. And so there are also situations where, despite our best efforts, we cannot clear the infection.\u201d",

      "At least 29 recruits have died during basic training at law enforcement academies nationwide in the last decade",
      "Ronald Donat\u2019s longtime dream of becoming a police officer was in jeopardy.",
      "The 41-year-old struggled to stand after completing a flurry of pushups, sprints and pullups in the notoriously grueling start of physical training that recruits call \u201cHell Day.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou are dead!\u201d classmates recall a sergeant berating Donat, ordering him to sit on concrete at the suburban Atlanta police academy.",
      "Donat, a Haitian immigrant on his third attempt to land a law enforcement job, assured instructors he wasn\u2019t giving up. He managed to get off the ground and rejoin recruits in a bear crawl exercise. But he soon went limp.",
      "One hundred minutes after training began that October 2021 morning, he was dead, according to records obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "Donat is among at least 29 recruits who died during basic training at law enforcement academies around the country in the last decade, an AP investigation found. Most died of exertion, dehydration, heat stroke and other conditions tied to intense exercise \u2014 often on the first day of training, like Donat. Others died several weeks in, sometimes after suffering trauma during boxing or use-of-force drills or collapsing during high-stakes timed runs on hot days.",
      "Experts and police advocates were surprised by AP\u2019s findings \u2014 based on an extensive review of lists of law enforcement deaths in every state, workplace safety records and news reports \u2014 and said many of the deaths were preventable. No federal agency or outside organization comprehensively tracks recruit deaths, unlike officers who die in the line of duty.",
      "\u201cTraining shouldn't have one death, much less 29,\" said David Jude, a retired Kentucky State Police academy commander and instructor. \u201cTo hear that number, it is shocking.\"",
      "Black recruits represented nearly 60% of those who died, a striking disparity given that federal data show Black officers make up 12% of local police forces. Many carried sickle cell trait, a condition most prevalent among Black Americans that increases the risk of serious injury following extreme exertion.",
      "Overall, the deaths amount to a tiny percentage of the nation\u2019s 800,000 sworn officers but highlight another hazard in a profession where shootings, car accidents and other dangers are part of the job.",
      "AP\u2019s tally shows the deaths have grown at a time when departments are tapping an older and more diverse pool of applicants to address officer shortages. More than two-thirds of the deaths occurred since 2020.",
      "A Texas recruit collapsed minutes after instructors denied his request for water, saying: \u201cYou can\u2019t get water in a fight,\u201d video obtained by AP shows.",
      "An Arkansas cadet died after he was forced to run wearing long pants in the scorching midday sun. A North Carolina trainee\u2019s temperature was 106 degrees an hour after his death, when he had no water breaks during an hourlong obstacle course.",
      "Citing similar cases, one expert warned in a medical journal in mid-2023 of a \u201ctroubling spate of exertional collapse and death\u201d of police trainees.",
      "\u201cThis sad tragedy is preventable, but will not become so until our police chiefs begin to heed the message,\u201d wrote Dr. Randy Eichner, a retired University of Oklahoma professor who has long studied exertion-related deaths.",
      "But deaths have only continued to mount. At least five were recorded in 2024, including a New York City recruit who died of heat stroke, a Kentucky man who exerted himself during water-based survival training and a Massachusetts cadet who became unresponsive during defensive tactics training.",
      "Police leaders say some deaths can be prevented through improved awareness and practices, acknowledging that the field needs to better screen for and accommodate health conditions that put recruits at risk and to rein in unnecessarily harsh drills.",
      "\u201cNot only are we potentially putting students in danger, but we\u2019re also putting instructors in precarious situations where they may not know about the risks,\u201d said Jude, an expert witness in the 2022 death of 38-year-old Jonesboro, Arkansas, recruit Vincent Parks.",
      "Jude cited a law passed in Arkansas, amid outrage over video showing Parks collapsing while training on a hot afternoon, as a positive step. It requires trainers be educated on heat exhaustion, dehydration and symptoms of sudden cardiac arrest, and mandates that instructors remove cadets from physical activities if they faint or lose consciousness.",
      "AP's investigation found instances in which recruits who were in serious medical distress were pushed to continue training before they died. In addition to calling off drills in such cases, academy leaders must ensure adequate hydration and breaks and limit training when heat makes it unsafe, experts said.",
      "Bill Alexander, CEO of the National Law Enforcement Memorial in Washington, said the number of deaths could be reduced but probably not eliminated given the nature of policing, which can require chasing and arresting combative suspects.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re training people physically and if you\u2019re training them hard, you\u2019re going to have these very rare medical events,\u201d said Alexander, who previously led an academy in Maryland.",
      "Still, some leaders say the field needs urgent action to better protect recruits.",
      "\u201cIt was just heartbreaking. I\u2019ll never forget it. And I\u2019ll do anything at all to get this message out,\u201d said Sheriff Charmaine McGuffey of Hamilton County, Ohio, who witnessed the 2023 death of 36-year-old Marcus Zeigler after he collapsed during a training run. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about life or death.\u201d",
      "When Ronald Donat arrived at the Gwinnett County Police Department Academy in Lawrenceville, Georgia, he thought he\u2019d finally found his place in law enforcement.",
      "He always wanted to become an officer, but his wife, Sharline Volcy, said she initially discouraged him due to safety concerns when their children were young. Both immigrated from Haiti in the 1990s to New Jersey, where they met at church.",
      "Donat earned a college degree and worked various jobs, including installing satellites and cable, but longed for the responsibility and community service that policing would bring.",
      "He finally applied but was initially passed over. When Gwinnett County recruited applicants from New Jersey, Donat applied because he already had a sister living in Georgia, Volcy said.",
      "Georgia's second-largest police agency, Gwinnett County has held hiring events around the country as it struggles to fill hundreds of vacancies. It\u2019s offered bonuses to combat the officer shortage, which grew during the coronavirus pandemic and 2020 protests against police brutality.",
      "A physician who evaluated Donat for the department concluded he was healthy, with no concerning conditions, according to a form the doctor submitted to the state's police standards agency. Following the normal process for the county and most U.S. police departments, the doctor didn\u2019t screen Donat for sickle cell trait.",
      "Donat began working out with other recruits, passed a state-mandated physical fitness test and was given badge 2423. He smiled for a selfie in a squad car. He shared advice with a classmate: \u201cNever give up.\u201d",
      "Up to 3 million Black citizens in the U.S. have sickle cell trait, yet many adults with the genetic condition don't know their status, researchers say. Unlike people with sickle cell disease, they carry only one gene for sickle cell, and one normal gene.",
      "The condition, which is diagnosed through a blood test, doesn\u2019t usually affect their daily lives. But it can cause decreased blood flow and muscle breakdown after intense exertion, dehydration or high body temperatures. In very rare cases, that can result in collapse and death.",
      "The NCAA and U.S. military now screen recruits for the condition, which has contributed to some deaths during football practices and boot camps. Researchers say exertional deaths among college athletes plummeted after NCAA-mandated testing and precautions went into effect in 2010, while the impact of the military programs is under review. Slowly building intensity, resting between drills, remaining hydrated during workouts and responding quickly to signs of distress are recommended.",
      "Most police departments have no such screening programs. Many longtime law enforcement trainers say they\u2019ve never heard of the condition, which AP found was cited as a contributing factor in several deaths and serious injuries of recruits.",
      "McGuffey, the Ohio sheriff, said the cause of Marcus Zeigler\u2019s death was initially a mystery. Before his collapse in May 2023, Zeigler was in peak condition and a top recruit, she said.",
      "The sheriff said she learned about sickle cell trait afterward from another employee, who himself had been seriously injured during academy training. She asked the coroner to investigate whether Zeigler had the condition. After ruling that Zeigler died of exertional heatstroke, the coroner's office added sickle cell trait as a contributing factor.",
      "Since the death, Hamilton County has started screening recruits for the condition, which costs $75 per test.",
      "For Donat and his 27 classmates, academy staffers planned an intense hourlong workout -- a first-day ritual designed to test physical and mental fitness.",
      "Pushups. Flutter kicks. More pushups. Hill sprints. Burpees. Pullups. Bear crawls.",
      "Trainers say the exercises set the tone for the monthslong academy, which seeks to instill a never-quit mindset and prepare recruits for the most dangerous aspects of policing. But the military-style drills have long led to allegations of harsh treatment that cross the line into hazing.",
      "The risks were so well-known that an ambulance usually sat nearby on the first day at the Gwinnett County academy. But that year, a major declined the staff\u2019s request, saying an ambulance would create the perception of danger, according to statements in an internal investigation report.",
      "Donat kept up with classmates for 45 minutes but became exhausted during a set of pullups and couldn\u2019t complete the next exercise, air squats.",
      "An instructor ordered Donat to sit: \u201cYou are dead!\u201d six recruits recalled him screaming, according to the investigation.",
      "The instructor insisted that he told Donat \u201cYou are done!\u201d Either way, it was intended as a reminder, the investigation found, that giving up on police work could lead to death.",
      "Donat didn\u2019t want to quit. Three minutes later, he got up with the help of another recruit and got in formation for a 25-foot bear crawl. \u201cEverything is all right, Donat,\u201d a recruit assured him. But Donat collapsed and stopped breathing.",
      "A paramedic on scene quickly treated Donat with oxygen and chest compressions. An ambulance arrived 10 minutes later.",
      "After Donat was pronounced dead at a hospital, instructors wondered whether his life could have been saved with an ambulance on site.",
      "Hours after Donat died, Gwinnett County released a statement saying Donat had been \u201cinstructed by supervising staff to rest\u201d after becoming lethargic.",
      "A fellow recruit who saw that statement on the news questioned the claim, texting classmates, \u201cas far as I know I never heard that or saw that.\u201d One responded that Donat was last seen in the planking position before his collapse.",
      "A county medical examiner ruled Donat died of natural causes, saying he had an enlarged heart prone to abnormal rhythms. That shocked his wife, Volcy, who said her husband was a fit soccer player with no known heart issues.",
      "The autopsy report didn\u2019t mention sickle cell trait. Volcy believes her husband had it \u2013 she\u2019s learned their daughters do, she said, and she has tested negative. Today, Gwinnett County still doesn\u2019t screen recruits for the condition, spokesperson Sgt. Collin Flynn said.",
      "The department\u2019s investigation, completed weeks after Donat\u2019s death, found no policy violations and resulted in no disciplinary action. A major who led the investigation concluded, \u201cI cannot imagine a scenario, had different actions been taken, that would have changed the tragic death of Recruit Donat.\u201d",
      "Still, the department now requires an ambulance with emergency responders on scene during the first day of physical training, Flynn said. Changes to the workout allow instructors to keep a closer eye on those who are struggling, he said.",
      "The Occupational Safety and Health Administration didn\u2019t investigate because local government agencies aren\u2019t under its jurisdiction. That\u2019s the case in many states, which have not extended workplace safety protections to municipal employees such as police officers.",
      "Because most of the recruits in AP\u2019s investigation hadn\u2019t been sworn in as officers before they died, their names don't appear on the national memorial for deceased officers or some state memorials. And many of their families can\u2019t qualify for death benefits.",
      "Aware of those stakes last year, the police chief in Knoxville, Tennessee, summoned a judge to the hospital room of unconscious recruit Wisbens Antoine.",
      "On that February night, a fellow recruit took the oath on behalf of Antoine, who\u2019d collapsed during training a week before graduation.",
      "Hours later, Officer Antoine, 32, died.",
      "Like Donat, he was a Haitian immigrant who left behind a wife and two daughters.",
      "In Gwinnett County, officials honored Donat by adding his name to its Fallen Heroes Memorial in 2022. But his name isn't on federal or state memorials. Donat\u2019s family was ineligible for state death benefits because he hadn\u2019t graduated.",
      "Congress in 2021 passed a law allowing trainees\u2019 relatives to be eligible for the same federal death benefits as those of sworn officers. The program includes a payment of nearly $450,000, plus college assistance.",
      "But three years later, Volcy said, she\u2019s still awaiting a ruling from the Department of Justice on her application for benefits, which she said she desperately needs to afford college tuition and other expenses.",
      "Volcy was unaware of the investigation into her husband\u2019s death until AP gave her the report last year. She said the department put recruits like Donat \u2013 and their families \u2013 at risk.",
      "\u201cIt is disappointing to know that excessive strain and physical activities brought an end to his life,\u201d Volcy said. \u201cWhat was supposed to be a new beginning, a lifetime achievement, a dream come true turned children into orphans, a wife into a widow and a lifetime of grief.\u201d"

      "A Philippine village in the densely populated capital region has launched a battle against dengue by offering a token bounty to residents for captured mosquitos \u2014 dead or alive",
      "MANILA, Philippines -- A village in the densely populated Philippine capital region launched a battle against dengue Wednesday by offering a token bounty to residents for captured mosquitos \u2014 dead or alive.",
      "The unusual strategy adopted by the Addition Hills village in Mandaluyong City reflects growing concern after the nearby city of Quezon declared an outbreak of the mosquito-borne illness over the weekend. Eight more areas reported an upsurge in cases of the potentially deadly viral infection.",
      "At least 28,234 dengue cases have been recorded in the Philippines this year up to Feb. 1, a 40% increase compared to the same period last year, according to health department statistics. Quezon City declared a dengue outbreak Saturday after deaths this year reached 10 people, mostly children, out of 1,769 residents infected.",
      "A urban village of more than 100,000 residents living in crowded neighborhoods and residential condominium towers, Addition Hills has done clean-ups, canal de-clogging and a hygiene campaign to combat dengue. But when cases spiked to 42 this year and two young students died, village leader Carlito Cernal decided to intensify the battle.",
      "\u201cThere was an alarm,\u201d Cernal told The Associated Press. \u201cI found a way.\"",
      "Residents will get a reward of one Philippines peso (just over 1 cent) for every five mosquitos or mosquito larva they turn in, Cernal said.",
      "Critics warned the strategy could backfire if desperate people start breeding mosquitoes for the reward. Cernal said that was unlikely because the campaign would be terminated as soon as the uptick in cases eases.",
      "As the campaign began, about a dozen mosquito hunters showed up at the village office. Miguel Labag, a 64-year-old scavenger, handed a jug with 45 dark mosquito larvas squirming in some water and received a reward of nine pesos (15 cents).",
      "\u201cThis is a big help,\u201d Labag said, smiling. \u201cI can buy coffee.\u201d",
      "Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection found in tropical countries worldwide. It can cause joint pain, nausea, vomiting and rashes, and in severe cases can cause breathing problems, hemorrhaging and organ failure. While there is no specific treatment for the illness, medical care to maintain a person\u2019s fluid levels is seen as critical.",
      "Officials in another village in Quezon City were considering releasing swarms of frogs to eat mosquitoes.",
      "Health Secretary Teodoro Herbosa said it\u2019s crucial to clean up mosquito breeding sites, and for anyone who might be infected to seek immediate medical attention. Despite an increase in dengue infections, the Philippines has managed to maintain low mortality rates, he said.",
      "Dengue cases surged unexpectedly ahead of the rainy season, which starts in June, likely because of intermittent downpours that have left stagnant pools of water where dengue-causing mosquitos can breed, Health Undersecretary Alberto Domingo said, adding that climate change was likely contributing to off-season downpours."

    "story": [
      "Republicans are weighing billions of dollars in cuts to Medicaid, jeopardizing health care coverage for some of the 80 million U.S. adults and children enrolled in the safety net program",
      "WASHINGTON -- Republicans are weighing billions of dollars in cuts to Medicaid, threatening health care coverage for some of the 80 million U.S. adults and children enrolled in the safety net program.",
      "The signing up of millions of additional Americans for taxpayer-funded health care coverage like Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act's marketplace during the Biden administration was lauded by Democrats as a success. But Republicans, who are looking to slash federal spending and offer lucrative tax cuts to corporations and wealthier Americans, now see a big target ripe for trimming. The $880 billion Medicaid program is financed mostly by federal taxpayers, who pick up as much as 80% of the tab in some states. And states, too, have said they're having trouble financing years of growth and sicker patients who enrolled in Medicaid.",
      "To whittle down the budget, the GOP-controlled Congress is eyeing work requirements for Medicaid. It's also considering paying a shrunken, fixed rate to states. All told, over the next decade, Republican lawmakers could try to siphon billions of dollars from the nearly-free health care coverage offered to the poorest Americans.",
      "Weeks before Congress began debating those changes, Republican governors in Arkansas, Ohio and South Dakota were making moves to implement Medicaid work rules of their own, likely to be approved by President Donald Trump's administration.",
      "And other cuts could be on the way. Already on Friday, the Republican administration announced it would shrink the Affordable Care Act's navigator program annual budget by 90% to $10 million. Navigators are stationed throughout the country to help people enrolled in ACA and Medicaid coverage and have helped boost enrollment in health care programs.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana has floated the idea of tying work to Medicaid.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s common sense,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cLittle things like that make a big difference not only in the budgeting process but in the morale of the people. You know, work is good for you. You find dignity in work.\u201d",
      "But about 92% of Medicaid enrollees are already working, attending school or caregiving, according to an analysis by KFF, a health policy research firm.",
      "Republicans have suggested a work requirement similar to the conditions for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly called food stamps. Those ages 16 to 59 must work or volunteer at least 80 hours a month if they are not in school, caring for a child under age 6, disabled, pregnant or homeless. On average, a SNAP enrollee's monthly household income is $852, and the enrollee typically receives $239 in benefits.",
      "During a GOP House retreat last month at Trump's golf resort in Doral, Florida, Republicans said the requirement could motivate people to find employment \u2014 maybe even a job that comes with health insurance.",
      "Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., said the spending cuts should not be \u201con the back of the poor and needy\" but instead target those who shouldn't be getting the benefit.",
      "\u201cWhy should somebody literally sit on the beach and surf, buy their sandwiches from the food truck with their food stamps and then pick up low-cost housing and so on, while writing a book,\" Issa said, noting that he was describing a constituent from more than a decade ago.",
      "Other cuts on the table include a proposal to change the federal government's reimbursement to a per-person limit.",
      "That would shift the costs to states, which might be forced to make tough choices about who or what they cover, said Joan Alker, executive director of the Georgetown Center for Children and Families.",
      "\u201cPeople still have health care needs even if you cut their coverage,\u201d Alker said. \u201cTheir health care needs are not going to go away.\u201d",
      "Cuts to the program could also prompt upset, with just over half of U.S. adults saying the government spends \u201ctoo little\u201d on Medicaid. Only 15% say it\u2019s spending \u201ctoo much,\u201d according to a January Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll.",
      "President Joe Biden's administration largely blocked states from enacting work rules of their own and required 10 states to remove the requirement for Medicaid coverage.",
      "With Trump now back in charge, some Republican-led states are pressing ahead of Congress to add work rules again. Governors in Arkansas, Iowa and Ohio have announced they'd pursue approval from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to introduce work requirements again. And last fall, South Dakota voters signed off on a plan to add a work rule.",
      "When Arkansas enacted a work requirement during the Trump years, about 18,000 people lost coverage. The rule was later blocked by a federal judge and Biden's Democratic administration.",
      "Some people lost coverage because they had trouble accessing the state's website to log their hours or had other procedural problems, said Trevor Hawkins, an attorney with Legal Aid of Arkansas. The organization sued on behalf of Medicaid beneficiaries who were dropped from coverage.",
      "\u201cThese hoops, these things are very consequential,\u201d Hawkins said \u201cThere were a lot of people having hard times.\u201d",
      "In Georgia, 47-year-old Paul Mikell is all too familiar with those hoops.",
      "He's enrolled in Georgia's Pathways to Coverage plan, which offers Medicaid for a slice of impoverished people who make just too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid. Georgia, which has not expanded Medicaid like most other states, requires that people work, volunteer or go to school for 80 hours a month in exchange for accessing the expanded health coverage.",
      "Mikell makes 15-mile (24-kilometer) monthly drives to a government office where he reports his work hours. Sometimes, he said, when he goes online to check whether his hours were logged, they\u2019re not there.",
      "He likened navigating the online system to a battle \u2014 one fought on a computer at the library or borrowed from a friend.",
      "In Idaho, where lawmakers are considering a state work rule and a three-year limit for Medicaid benefits, family physician Peter Crane estimates about two-thirds of his patients are enrolled in the program.",
      "Many work on farms, on ranches or in the local phosphate mines. Before the state expanded Medicaid to cover those with incomes of up to 138% of the poverty level, many of his uninsured patients avoided the doctor entirely. One ignored abdominal pain for months, to the point of needing hospitalization for a severe gallbladder infection, he said.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not outliers,\" Crane said of those enrolled in Medicaid during a state hearing last week. \u201cThey\u2019re hardworking citizens of our state who are employed and running small businesses.\u201d",
      "Democrats are warning of the side effects for health care facilities, including rural hospitals and nursing homes. Hospitals have benefited from increased enrollment in health insurance programs such as Medicaid because it guarantees payment for a patient's treatment.",
      "\u201cHospitals will close, including in rural America and urban America and the heartland of America,\u201d House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York warned during a recent speech on the House floor. \u201cNursing homes will be shut down, and everyday Americans, children, seniors, those who are suffering with disabilities, will be hurt.\u201d",

      "A push to ban sugary drinks, candy and more from the U.S. program that helps low-income families pay for nutritious food has been tried before \u2014 but it may soon get a boost from new Trump administration officials.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the newly confirmed health and human services secretary, and Brooke Rollins, the new agriculture secretary, have both signaled that they favor stripping such treats from SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.",
      "Kennedy has been most vocal, calling for the government to stop allowing the nearly $113 billion program that serves about 42 million Americans to use benefits to pay for \u201c soda or processed foods.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe one place that I would say that we need to really change policy is the SNAP program and food stamps and in school lunches,\u201d Kennedy told Fox News host Laura Ingraham last week. \u201cThere, the federal government in many cases is paying for it. And we shouldn't be subsidizing people to eat poison.\u201d",
      "In one of her first interviews after being confirmed, Rollins said she looked forward to working with Kennedy on the issue.",
      "\u201cWhen a taxpayer is putting money into SNAP, are they OK with us using their tax dollars to feed really bad food and sugary drinks to children who perhaps need something more nutritious?\u201d Rollins said. \u201cThese are all massive questions we're going to be asking and working on in the coming months and years.\u201d",
      "But removing certain foods from SNAP \u2014 known for years as food stamps \u2014 isn't as simple as it sounds.",
      "The program is run by the USDA, not HHS, and is administered through individual states. It is authorized by the federal Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, which says SNAP benefits can be used for \u201cany food or food product intended for human consumption,\u201d except alcohol, tobacco and hot foods, including those prepared for immediate consumption.",
      "Excluding any foods would require Congress to change the law \u2014 or for states to get waivers that would let them restrict purchases, said Katie Bergh, a senior policy analyst for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan research group. Over the past 20 years, lawmakers in several states have proposed stopping SNAP from paying for bottled water, soda, chips, ice cream, decorated cakes and \u201cluxury meats\u201d like steak.",
      "\u201cNone of those requests have ever been approved under either Republican or Democratic presidents,\u201d Bergh said.",
      "In the past, Agriculture Department officials rejected the waivers, saying in a 2007 paper that no clear standards exist to define foods \u201cas good or bad, or healthy or not healthy.\u201d In addition, the agency said restrictions would be difficult to implement, complicated and costly. And they might not change recipients' food purchases or reduce conditions such as obesity.",
      "Anti-hunger advocates point to research that shows SNAP recipients are no more likely than other low-income Americans to buy sugary drinks or snack foods. And they say that limiting food choices undermines the autonomy and dignity of people who receive, on average, about $187 per month \u2014 or about $6.16 per day, according to latest figures.",
      "\u201cThis is just another way to cut benefits,\u201d said Gina Plata-Nino, a deputy director at the Food Research and Action Center, a nonprofit advocacy group. \u201cIt's like, how do we restrict people more? How do we stigmatize them more?\u201d",
      "Bills are pending in Congress and in several states to restrict SNAP benefits from paying for soda, candy and other items.",
      "Rep. Josh Breechan, an Oklahoma Republican, sponsored the Healthy SNAP Act.",
      "\u201cIf someone wants to buy junk food on their own dime, that\u2019s up to them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what we\u2019re saying is, \u2018Don\u2019t ask the taxpayer to pay for it and then also expect the taxpayer to pick up the tab for the resulting health consequences.\u2019\u201d",
      "One SNAP recipient said she uses her monthly $291 benefit to buy necessities such as meat, oil, milk and coffee. Martina Santos, 66, of New York City, supplements those foods with fresh vegetables and fruits from a pantry run by the West Side Campaign Against Hunger, where she's also a volunteer. Because she has diabetes and other health conditions, she said she understands the importance of using the benefits only for nutritious options.",
      "\u201cFor me, SNAP is to be used toward healthy food to get people to avoid all the disease they\u2019re having around right now: obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure,\u201d Santos said.",
      "In Kansas and elsewhere, bills that would ban soft drinks and candy highlight some of the challenges of such changes.",
      "Several pending bills seek to keep SNAP from paying for soft drinks, but they would continue to allow drinks containing milk, milk alternatives like soy or almond milk, or drinks with more than 50% vegetable or fruit juice. Candy is characterized as any unrefrigerated, flourless preparation of \u201csugar, honey or other natural or artificial sweeteners in combination with chocolate, fruits, nuts or other ingredients or flavorings in the form of bars, drops or pieces.\u201d",
      "By that definition, Kit Kat and Twix bars, which contain flour, wouldn't be banned. And juices that contain high amounts of sugar, but are more than half fruit juice by volume, would be allowed.",
      "Such conundrums have stymied changes to the SNAP program for decades. But this moment could be different, said Dr. Anand Parekh, chief medical officer of the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank based in Washington, D.C.",
      "The momentum behind Kennedy's \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement could spur a new focus on solutions to poor diets that account for leading risk factors for early disease and death.",
      "\u201cWhen we talk about the SNAP program, we have to remind people that the \u2018N\u2019 stands for nutrition,\u201d Parekh said. \u201cIt's about time that both parties can come together and see what are the innovations here to improve diet quality and nutrition.\u201d",

      "\"This is a huge, huge issue,\" said Matthew Smeltzer, a managing partner of Capstone Recruiting Advisors, a company that helps hospitals, physician practices, and other employers find and hire doctors. \"It probably hits small towns the hardest, just because most people would prefer to live in a midsize or large community.\"",

      "\"Everything you would imagine a Hallmark movie to be is kind of where we live,\" Wilkerson said. \"It's people who still care and look out for each other, and neighbors are actually friends.\"",
      "",
      "Offering generous incentives was how town leaders got Newberry to practice in Havana in 1993. The town gave Newberry an initial deal similar to the one it's offering now, and later began providing him about $15,000 a year in financial support.",

    "story": [
      "In the rural villages of South Africa, U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s sudden freeze on foreign aid impacts hundreds of thousands of HIV patients",
      "UMZIMKHULU, South Africa -- At a rural village in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province, unemployed 19-year-old Nozuko Majola is trying to figure out if she has enough money for the one-hour ride to collect her much-needed HIV medication, usually delivered to her home that can't be easily reached due to rough, untarred roads.",
      "Majola is one of millions of patients in South Africa affected by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s global foreign aid freeze, raising worries about HIV patients defaulting on treatment, infection rates going up and eventually a rise in deaths.",
      "In 2024, think tank Human Sciences Research Council released figures showing that Majola's province recorded the second-highest HIV prevalence in the country, at 16%, with at least 1,300 young people estimated to contract the disease every week.",
      "KwaZulu-Natal also had the highest number of people living with HIV in South Africa in 2022, about 1,980,000. The country counts more than 7.5 million people infected with the virus that causes AIDS \u2014 more than any other nation.",
      "There are 5.5 million South Africans receiving antiretroviral treatment, whose funding is now in question after Trump suspended the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. It contributes more than $400 million a year to South Africa's HIV programs and nongovernmental organizations, about 17% of the total funding, according to the Health Ministry.",
      "Globally, PEPFAR is credited with saving at least 26 million lives since its inception in 2003, according to the U.N. AIDS agency.",
      "Last week, a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to temporarily lift the funding freeze, while the U.S. Embassy in South Africa said PEPFAR projects would resume under a limited waiver. However, aid groups dealing with HIV have already shuttered with closure notices hanging at the entrances and PEPFAR-branded vehicles standing idle, with patients diverted to struggling health facilities.",
      "Most of the PEPFAR funding is channeled through non-governmental organizations, which run programs that compliment health care services provided by the government.",
      "For Majola and other HIV patients in the Umzimkhulu region, where unemployment is rife and most people rely on subsistence farming and government welfare grants, the aid freeze has disrupted their lives.",
      "\u201cThings will be tough around here, and a lot of people will default on their treatment because we really struggle with transport,\" she said. \u201cThe mobile clinics hardly come here.\u201d",
      "The freeze has hurt various groups that can no longer provide treatment, causing an influx of patients to already overstretched public facilities. Along with the medication, these programs also allowed health personnel to test HIV patients in far-flung villages, which has been a lifeline for many, especially those afraid to visit public facilities due to the social stigma attached to HIV.",
      "In addition, nearly 15,000 health workers whose salaries are funded through PEPFAR are left wondering if they have lost their livelihoods.",
      "About an hour away in the district of Umgungundlovu, which the think tank says has the highest number of HIV cases in South Africa, HIV counselors gathered in a small office discussing how best to assist patients like Majola. A manager at a nearby health clinic wondered how to handle the administrative work that is piling up after PEPFAR-funded workers withdrew.",
      "\u201cPeople who were doing administration and data capturing, whose salaries were funded by PEPFAR, have left. We are a small facility and we cannot handle such a workload,\u201d said the manager, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.",
      "Nozuko Ngcaweni has been on HIV treatment for about 30 years. One of her children was also infected and died at age 17. She said the aid suspension already impacted her community and many missed their treatment.",
      "\u201cNot long ago, we said by 2030, we want to see an HIV-free generation. But if things remain as is, we will not achieve that. We will have to deal with deaths,\u201d she said.",
      "Mzamo Zondi, a provincial manager of the Treatment Action Campaign, which advocates for access to HIV treatment for the poor, has been monitoring the impact of the aid freeze in Umgungudlovu.",
      "\"Our response (to HIV) is likely to falter as we struggle to stop newly infected cases,\" he said. \u201cThis is a matter of life and death.\u201d",

      "ROME -- Pope Francis marked the one-week point Friday in his hospital stay, getting up to eat breakfast as the 88-year-old pontiff continued fighting pneumonia and a complex respiratory infection, the Vatican said.",
      "The Vatican late Thursday reported a \u201cslight improvement\u201d in his overall clinical condition, with his heart working well. But it will still take some time to understand if the various drug therapies are working, and outside doctors have said that regardless, recovery from pneumonia in such a fragile patient could take up to two weeks.",
      "According to the one-line morning bulletin Friday, \u201cThe night went well, this morning Pope Francis got up and had breakfast.\u201d",
      "Francis was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on Feb. 14 after a case of bronchitis worsened; doctors later diagnosed a complex respiratory infection, involving bacteria, virus and other organisms and the onset of pneumonia in both lungs on top of asthmatic bronchitis. They prescribed \u201cabsolute rest.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, some of Francis' cardinals began responding to the obvious question circulating: whether Francis might resign if he becomes irreversibly sick and unable to carry on. Francis has said he would consider it, after Pope Benedict XVI \u201copened the door\u201d to popes retiring.",
      "\u201cEverything is possible,\u201d said Cardinal Jean-Marc Aveline, the archbishop of Marseille, France.",
      "Another cardinal, Gianfranco Ravasi, was asked if Francis might decide to follow in the footsteps of Pope Benedict XVI and step down if he becomes too ill. Benedict became the first pope in 600 years to retire when he concluded in 2013 that he didn\u2019t have the physical strength to carry on the rigors of the globe-trotting papacy.",
      "\u201cThere is no question that if he (Francis) was in a situation where his ability to have direct contact (with people) as he likes to do ... was compromised, then I think he might decide to resign,\u201d Ravasi was quoted as telling RTL 102.5 radio.",
      "Francis confirmed in 2022 that shortly after being elected pontiff he wrote a resignation letter in case medical problems impeded him from carrying out his duties. There is no provision in canon law for what to do if a pope becomes incapacitated.",
      "But there is no indication Francis is in anyway incapacitated or is even considering stepping aside. During his hospital stay, he has continued to work, including making bishop appointments. And besides, after Benedict died, Francis made clear that he believed the job of pope is for life.",
      "Francis had an acute case of pneumonia in 2023 and is prone to respiratory infections in winter.",
      "Doctors say pneumonia in such a fragile, elderly patient makes him particularly prone to complications given the difficulty in being able to effectively expel fluid from his lungs.

      "An ancient trading post known for housing some of West Africa's most historically significant manuscripts could soon be covered by the Sahara Desert",
      "CHINGUETTI, Mauritania -- For centuries, poets, scholars and theologians have flocked to Chinguetti, a trans-Saharan trading post home to more than a dozen libraries containing thousands of manuscripts.",
      "But it now stands on the brink of oblivion. Shifting sands have long covered the ancient city's 8th-century core and are encroaching on neighborhoods at its current edge. Residents say the desert is their destiny.",
      "As the world's climate gets hotter and drier, sandstorms are more frequently depositing inches and feet of dunes onto Chinguetti's streets and in people\u2019s homes, submerging some entirely. Tree-planting projects are trying to keep the invading sands at bay, but so far, they haven\u2019t eased the deep-rooted worries about the future.",
      "Chinguetti is one of four UNESCO World Heritage sites in Mauritania, a West African nation where only 0.5% of land is considered farmable. In Africa \u2014 the continent that contributes the least to fossil fuel emissions \u2014 only Somalia and Eswatini have experienced more climate change impacts, according to World Bank data.",
      "Mauritanians believe Chinguetti is among Islam\u2019s holiest cities. Its dry stone and mud mortar homes, mosques and libraries store some of West Africa\u2019s oldest quranic texts and manuscripts, covering topics ranging from law to mathematics.",
      "Community leader Melainine Med El Wely feels agonized over the stakes for residents and the history contained within Chinguetti's walls. It's like watching a natural disaster in slow motion, he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a city surrounded by an ocean of sand that\u2019s advancing every minute,\u201d El Wely, the president of the local Association for Participatory Oasis Management, said. \u201cThere are places that I walk now that I remember being the roofs of houses when I was a kid.\u201d",
      "He remembers that once when enough sand blew into his neighborhood to cover the palms used to make roofs, an unknowing camel walking through the neighborhood plunged into what was once someone\u2019s living room.",
      "Research suggests sand migration plays a significant role in desertification. Deserts, including the Sahara, are expanding at unprecedented rates and \u201csand seas\u201d are being reactivated, with blowing dunes transforming landscapes where vegetation once stood.",
      "\u201cWhat we used to think of as the worst case scenario five to 10 years ago is now actually looking like a more likely scenario than we had in mind,\u201d said Andreas Baas, an earth scientist from King\u2019s College London who researches how winds and the way they blow sand are changing.",
      "More than three-quarters of the earth\u2019s land has become drier in recent decades, according to a 2024 United Nations report on desertification. The aridity has imperiled ability of plants, humans and animals to survive. It robs lands of the moisture needed to sustain life, kills crops and can cause sandstorms and wildfires.",
      "\u201cHuman-caused climate change is the culprit; known for making the planet warmer, it is also making more and more land drier,\u201d the U.N. report said. \u201cAridity-related water scarcity is causing illness and death and spurring large-scale forced migration around the world.\u201d",
      "Scientists and policymakers are mostly concerned about soils degrading in once-fertile regions that are gradually becoming wastelands, rather than areas deep in the Sahara Desert.",
      "Still, in Chinguetti, a changing climate is ushering in many of the consequences that officials have warned about. Trees are withering, wells are running dry and livelihoods are vanishing.",
      "Date farmers like 50-year-old Salima Ould Salem have found it increasingly difficult to nourish their palm trees, and now have to pipe in water from tanks and prune more thoroughly to make sure it's used efficiently. Salem's neighborhood used to be full of families, but they\u2019ve gradually moved away. Sand now blocks the doorway to his home. It's buried those where some of his neighbors once lived. And a nearby guesthouse built by a Belgian investor decades ago is now half-submerged in a rippling copper-hued dune.",
      "Though many have departed, Salem remains, aware that each time a member of the community leaves, their home can no long serve as a bulwark and the rest of the community therefore becomes more likely to be swallowed by the desert.",
      "\u201cWe prefer to stay here. If I leave, my place will disappear,\u201d the 50-year-old date farmer said.",
      "Acacia, gum and palm trees once shielded the neighborhood from encroaching dunes, but they\u2019ve gradually disappeared. The trees have either died of thirst or have been cut down by residents needing firewood or foliage for their herds to feed on.",
      "Sandstorms are not new but have become increasingly intrusive, each leaving inches or feet in the neighborhoods on the edge of the city, retired teacher Mohamed Lemine Bahane said. Residents use mules and carts to remove the sand because the old city's streets are too narrow to accommodate cars or bulldozers. When sand piles high enough, some build new walls atop existing structures.",
      "\u201cWhen you remove the vegetation, it gives the dunes a chance to become more active, because it\u2019s ultimately the vegetation that can hold down the sand so it doesn\u2019t blow too much,\u201d Bahane said.",
      "Bahane has for years taken measurements of the sand deposits and rains and says that Chinguetti has received an annual average of 2.5 centimeters (one inch) of rainfall over the past decade. As rainfall plummets, trees die, and more sand migrates into town. And with shorter acacia trees submerged in sand, some herders resort to cutting down date palm trees to feed their flocks, further disrupting the ecosystem and date farming economy. The sands also raise public health concerns for the community breathing in the dust, Bahane said.",
      "The solution, he believes, has to be planting more trees both in neighborhoods and along the perimeter of town. Such \u201cgreen belts\u201d have been proposed on a continent-wide scale as Africa's \u201cGreat Green Wall\u201d as well as locally, in towns like Chinguetti. Mauritania's Ministry of Environment and Ministry of Agriculture as well as European-funded NGOs have floated projects to plant trees to insulate the city's libraries and manuscripts from the incoming desert.",
      "Though some have been replanted, there's little sign that it has contributed to stopping the desert in its tracks. It can take years for taproots to grow deep enough into the earth to access groundwater.",
      "\u201cWe're convinced that desertification is our destiny. But thankfully, there are still people convinced that it can be resisted,\u201d El Wely, the community leader, said.",

      "SAN JOS\u00c9, Costa Rica -- A group of families and children hailing from Uzbekistan, China, Afghanistan, Russia and more climbed down the stairs of an airplane in Costa Rica's capital on Thursday, the first flight of deportees from other nations Costa Rica agreed to hold in detention facilities for the Trump administration while it organized return back to their countries.",
      "The flight of 135 deportees, half of them minors, added Costa Rica to a growing list of Latin American nations to serve as a stopover for migrants as U.S. President Donald Trump \u2019s administration seeks to step up deportations.",
      "While Costa Rica joins Panama in holding deportees of mostly Asian origin until their repatriation can be arranged or they can seek protection somewhere, Honduras on Thursday also facilitated a handoff of deportees between the U.S. and Venezuela from a flight coming from Guantanamo Bay.",
      "The migrants arriving to Costa Rica will be bussed hours to a rural holding facility near the Panama border, where they will be detained up to six weeks and be flown back to their countries of origin, said Omer Badilla, Costa Rica\u2019s deputy minister of the interior and police. The U.S. government will cover the costs.",
      "The arrangement is part of a deal the Trump administration struck with Costa Rica during U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's visit earlier this month. It comes as Trump has pressured countries across the region to help facilitate deportations at times under the threat of steep tariffs or sanctions.",
      "Costa Rican President Rodrigo Chaves told reporters Wednesday that his country is helping its \u201ceconomically powerful brother from the north.\u201d",
      "Similar agreements have been reached with other Latin American nations, but the concept of using third countries as deportation layovers has drawn strong criticism from human rights advocates. Beyond the conditions of their detention in Costa Rica, concerns revolve around international protections for asylum seekers and whether these deportees will be appropriately screened before being returned to their countries or sent to yet another country.",
      "Panama this week became the first such country to accept 299 deportees from other nations, with the government holding them in hotel rooms guarded by police. About one-third of those who refused to voluntarily return to their countries were sent to a remote camp in Darien province bordering Colombia on Wednesday. The rest were awaiting commercial flights back home.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve thrown out the possibility of a hotel, precisely to avoid a situation similar to that in Panama,\u201d Badilla, the Costa Rican official, told The Associated Press.",
      "Honduras said Thursday it also acted as a brief stopover for a deportation flight of Venezuelans coming from Guantanamo Bay in what it described as a \u201chumanitarian bridge\u201d since there are no direct flights between the U.S. and Venezuela.",
      "A U.S. flight carrying 170 Venezuelans landed Thursday in a joint U.S.-Honduran military base in central Honduras, and within hours were transferred to a Venezuelan aircraft. An official with Honduras\u2019 foreign ministry said this was not a routine arrangement, but that the Central American nation remains open to facilitating more transfers between the two adversaries.",
      "Badilla said that Thursday's deportation flight from San Diego is largely made up of families, including 65 children, two pregnant women and an elderly woman. He said Costa Rica was told by the Trump administration that most of the deportees have agreed to voluntarily return to their countries.",
      "If they refuse, Costa Rica is open to offering deportees refuge or will work with the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration, IOM, to facilitate travel to another third country.",
      "\u201cCosta Rica is a country that guarantees human rights,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to guarantee that they are returned to safe countries. We cannot leave that to chance because of an ethical and moral commitment of our country.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, migrants will be detained in the border facility, where they will be accompanied by U.N. officials, the Red Cross and other aid-focused government entities to \u201cguarantee their rights,\u201d Badilla said.",
      "The facility being used to hold migrants, a former factory, has faced criticisms for its conditions in the past.",
      "During a visit by the AP in October 2023, migrants were fenced off in cramped facilities and said they felt like \u201cprisoners.\u201d Many slept in tents on the ground, where some said liquid from portable toilets leaked. Badilla said that facilities have since been improved, but the government has denied journalists access to the building.",
      "The facility will also be processing a \u201creverse flow\u201d of migrants from Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador that previously sought asylum in the U.S. and now want to return home. Badilla said Costa Rica has seen between 50 and 75 migrants headed south entering the country a day.",
      "IOM said in a statement to the AP that \u201cwe do not have direct involvement in the detention or restriction of movement of individuals\u201d and that it was providing humanitarian support and supporting voluntary returns to their countries and \u201cidentifying safe alternatives for others.\u201d",

      "Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine three years ago has turned into Europe\u2019s largest conflict since World War II",
      "When Russian troops rolled into Ukraine three years ago, they brought their parade uniforms with them on the push to Kyiv. President Vladimir Putin expected a quick victory.",
      "What Putin dubbed the \u201cspecial military operation\u201d has turned into Europe\u2019s largest conflict since World War II. Tens of thousands have been killed, entire cities have been reduced to smoldering ruins, millions of Ukrainians became refugees, and Russia was isolated from the West.",
      "Now as senior Russian and U.S. officials are talking again and setting the stage for summit meeting, Putin appears closer than ever to cementing Moscow\u2019s gains of about a fifth of Ukraine\u2019s territory and keeping it out of NATO.",
      "President Donald Trump sharply reversed the three-year U.S. policy of isolating Russia when he called Putin and said afterward they agreed \u201cto work together very closely\u201d to end the war. He said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy \u201cwill be involved\u201d in negotiations but didn't elaborate.",
      "Trump also expressed understanding of Putin\u2019s key demand on the pivotal issue of Ukraine\u2019s prospective NATO membership that the U.S. and other alliance members previously described as irreversible. \u201dThey\u2019ve been saying that for a long time that Ukraine cannot go into NATO,\u201d Trump said of Russia. \u201cAnd I\u2019m OK with that.\u201d",
      "Putin invaded on Feb. 24, 2022, after demanding that NATO abandon membership for Ukraine and pull back the alliance\u2019s troops on NATO\u2019s eastern flank -- actions rejected by the West.",
      "He claimed his move was necessary to safeguard Russia\u2019s security interests and protect Russian speakers in Ukraine. Kyiv and its allies denounced his move as an unprovoked act of aggression. Ukrainians saw it as Moscow's attempt to destroy their national sovereignty and identity.",
      "Russian troops reached the outskirts of Kyiv early in the invasion but pulled back a month later amid heavy losses and Ukraine's attacks on supply lines. More humiliating setbacks came in September and October 2022, when a Ukrainian counteroffensive forced Russia to pull back from large parts of the Kharkiv region in the northeast and the Kherson region in the south.",
      "Fortunes changed in 2023 when a Ukrainian counteroffensive in the south failed to cut Russia's land route to the Crimea Peninsula, which Moscow illegally annexed from Kyiv in 2014.",
      "Russia seized the combat initiative last year with offensives along the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front, making slow but persistent gains. In the fall, Russian forces captured the most territory since the opening of the war.",
      "Moscow also pummeled Ukrainian infrastructure with waves of missiles and drones, destroying much of its power generating capacity.",
      "Ukraine struck back in August with an incursion into Russia's Kursk region to try to distract Moscow's forces in the east and gain more leverage in potential peace talks. Ukraine still holds some of those gains, but its limited resources are stretched, making it difficult to defend strongholds in the east.",
      "While Zelenskyy earlier demanded Russia\u2019s full withdrawal from all occupied areas as a precondition for talks, he later acknowledged Kyiv can\u2019t immediately reclaim all its territory. He said Ukraine won't abandon its goal of joining NATO \u2014 even though Trump dismissed that as \u201cimpractical\u201d \u2014 and Zelenskyy emphasized needing reliable Western security guarantees and a robust European peacekeeping force to prevent Russian attacks.",
      "Trump\u2019s call with Putin and ensuing Russia-U.S. talks in Saudi Arabia shattered the Biden administration's \u201cnothing about Ukraine without Ukraine\u201d policy. Trump blamed Kyiv for failing to make a deal with Moscow that could have prevented the war, praised Russia's military might and even suggested that Ukraine \u201cmay be Russian someday.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy said Ukraine won\u2019t accept any deal negotiated without Kyiv and insisted that European allies must participate in peace talks. He dismissed a U.S.-proposed draft agreement that would give Washington a large share of Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals as too focused on U.S. interests and had no security guarantees for Kyiv.",
      "Trump\u2019s approach stunned European allies, whose shock deepened when Vice President JD Vance sharply rebuked them at the Munich security conference over free speech and migration.",
      "While the Trump administration said European allies weren't welcome at the peace talks, it encouraged them to provide security guarantees for Kyiv in what former British ambassador Nigel Gould-Davies called a contradictory approach.",
      "Washington \"has signaled that the U.S. alone will negotiate an end to the war but also that Europe alone must pay for and enforce an outcome it has not played a role in deciding,\u201d said Gould-Davies, a senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia with the International Institute for Strategic Studies.",
      "Putin's key goals remain much the same \u2014 that Ukraine renounce joining NATO and enforce the use of the Russian language to keep the country in Moscow's orbit \u2014 but now wants Kyiv to withdraw its forces from the four regions Moscow has seized but doesn't fully control.",
      "He said a peace agreement could be broadly based on a draft negotiated early in the war that obliged Ukraine to declare neutrality, scale down its military and protect Russian language and culture. Those talks collapsed in April 2022 with no deal.",
      "Putin ruled out a truce, arguing it would benefit Kyiv. But some Kremlin-watchers believe he could accept it if Kyiv agrees to hold elections after a ceasefire.",
      "Trump echoed Putin's line that Zelenskyy, whose term expired last year, needs to face voters, while Kyiv maintains elections are impossible to hold amid a war. Trump escalated that notion Wednesday by posting on social media that Zelenskyy was \u201ca Dictator without Elections.\u201d",
      "Putin could hope an election would weaken Zelenskyy and lead to political instability, said Tatiana Stanovaya, senior fellow at Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.",

      "It's unclear who would monitor any potential ceasefire.",
      "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said NATO should play no role and that any European troops taking part should not be covered by NATO\u2019s charter obliging allies to aid of any member under attack -\u2013 conditions that could dampen European enthusiasm about the mission.",
      "While the U.K. and others signal readiness to deploy troops for such a mission, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said after the U.S.-Russian talks in Saudi Arabia that Moscow won't accept troops from any NATO members in a peacekeeping force.",

      "\u201cPutin has repeatedly made it clear that he believes Russia can achieve its goals in Ukraine without any U.S.-brokered deal,\u201d Stanovaya noted. \u201cAs far as he is concerned, Moscow simply needs to wait until Ukraine falls apart of its own accord, after which the Russian army will crush any remaining resistance among the Ukrainian army.\u201d",

      "A court in Argentina has dropped charges of criminal negligence against three of the five people indicted in connection with the death of Liam Payne, the former One Direction singer who fell from a third-floor hotel balcony in Buenos Aires last October",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- A court in Argentina dropped charges of criminal negligence against three of the five people indicted in connection with the death of Liam Payne, the former One Direction singer who fell from a third-floor hotel balcony in Buenos Aires last October, according to a ruling obtained by The Associated Press on Thursday.",
      "In its decision issued Wednesday, the Argentine federal appeals court ordered the other two defendants in the case to remain in custody. They are facing prosecution on charges they supplied the famed British boyband star with narcotics.",
      "The ruling drops charges against three key defendants: Rogelio Nores, an Argentine businessman with U.S. citizenship who had accompanied Payne during his trip in Buenos Aires; Gilda Martin, the manager of the Casa Sur Palermo Hotel where Payne died on Oct. 16; and Esteban Grassi, the hotel\u2019s main receptionist.",
      "The charge of negligent homicide carries a sentence of one to five years in prison in Argentina.",
      "A toxicology report from tests taken after an autopsy revealed that Payne, 31, had alcohol, cocaine and a prescription antidepressant in his system when he fell from the balcony.",
      "Prosecutors argued that Nores had failed to comply with his duties of care by leaving Payne alone while inebriated. The court sided with defense attorneys who contended that Nores had no legal, moral or social duty to care for Payne. He also was outside the hotel at the time of his friend's death.",
      "The two hotel employees, Martin and Grassi, were in the Casa Sur lobby on Oct. 16 when they saw Payne severely intoxicated and decided to take him to his room with the help of others, investigators determined.",
      "Prosecutors said that the men should have kept Payne away from his hotel room, where a balcony posed a clear danger, until the singer could receive proper medical care. On Wednesday, the court ruled that prosecutors failed to prove how taking Payne to his hotel room \u201cconstituted unlawful, unruly, clumsy, reckless, imprudent or negligent conduct.\"",
      "The court also ordered the other two defendants in the case \u2014 Ezequiel David Pereyra, a former employee at Casa Sur Hotel and Braian Paiz, a waiter who had served Payne at an upscale Buenos Aires restaurant \u2014 to remain in detention on charges that they supplied Payne with narcotics in the days, even hours, leading up to his death.",
      "Because the charge they face carries a sentence of four to 15 years in prison, the court said that preventative detention was justified.",
      "Payne's sudden death drew an outpouring of grief around the world from heartbroken fans of One Direction, among the best-selling boy bands of all time.",

      "U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres says he will request that the United Nations assumes funding for the structural and logistical expenses of a multinational force in Haiti that is struggling to fight violent gangs",
      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said that he would request that the United Nations assumes funding for the structural and logistical expenses of a multinational force in Haiti that is struggling to fight violent gangs.",
      "Guterres made the announcement late Wednesday in Barbados, where leaders of a 15-member Caribbean trade bloc known as Caricom gathered for a three-day conference to tackle regional issues, including gang violence in Haiti.",
      "\u201cIf the Security Council will accept this proposal, we will have the conditions to finally have an effective force to defeat the gangs in Haiti and create the conditions for democracy to thrive,\u201d Guterres said.",
      "He added that the salaries for the multinational force would be paid through an already existing trust fund.",
      "The U.N.-backed mission is led by a contingent of around 800 Kenyan police joined by soldiers and police from countries including Jamaica, Guatemala and El Salvador who are working alongside Haiti\u2019s National Police.",
      "The U.S. and other countries have warned that the mission that began last June is lacking personnel and resources as they keep pushing for a U.N. peacekeeping mission to replace the current one.",
      "Guterres called the situation in Haiti \u201cappalling.\u201d",
      "\u201cGangs are inflicting intolerable suffering on a desperate and frightened people,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must keep working for a political process owned and led by the Haitians that restores democratic institutions through elections.\u201d",
      "But Belgium-based International Crisis Group warned in a new report that it could be dangerous to hold elections prematurely given a surge in gang violence.",
      "Haiti is led by Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aim\u00e9 and a nine-member transitional presidential council whose mandate expires on Feb. 7, 2026.",
      "Haiti hasn\u2019t held elections in almost a decade, and no president has been elected since the June 2021 assassination of Jovenel Mo\u00efse.",
      "The council has previously pledged to hold elections by February 2026, but critics say that\u2019s an unrealistic goal since gangs that already control 85% of Haiti\u2019s capital are on a renewed rampage to seize more territory.",
      "Council President Leslie Voltaire recently said that he believes Haiti can hold elections on Nov. 15 and runoffs early next year, but in only eight of 10 regions in Haiti that are free of gangs.",
      "International Crisis Group noted that the pace of elections depends on funds allocated by the Haitian government and foreign donors, with only $45 million available so far out of an estimated $90 million to $120 million needed.",
      "The group also warned that multiple challenges to holding elections persist.",
      "\u201cPartisan infighting and corruption allegations have prolonged political dysfunction,\u201d it said. \u201cViolence rages, with gangs perpetrating some of the worst massacres ever as the understaffed, underfunded foreign mission struggles to rein them in.\u201d",
      "The group also warned that holding elections too soon could trigger even more violence by gangs \u201cto ensure that their allies win positions of power.\u201d",
      "More than 5,600 people were reported killed in Haiti last year, with gang violence displacing more than 1 million Haitians in recent years, according to the U.N.",
      "\u201cTheir situation continues to be of major concern to us,\u201d said Mia Amor Mottley, Barbados\u2019 prime minister and Caricom chairperson. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not going to be sufficient just to be able to say that Haiti will have an election on Nov. 15. It is not going to be sufficient to just stabilize the security situation of Haiti.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "U.N. special envoy for Syria Geir Pedersen has said that formation of a \u201cnew inclusive government\u201d in Damascus by March 1 could pave the way for lifting sanctions imposed by western countries",
      "DAMASCUS, Syria -- Creating an inclusive government in Syria in coming weeks will help determine whether Western sanctions are lifted as the country rebuilds after the ouster of former President Bashar Assad, the U.N. special envoy to Syria said Thursday.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019m hoping is that with a truly new inclusive government in place on the 1st of March, this will help us in lifting sanctions\u201d imposed on Syria by Western countries during Assad's rule, Geir Pedersen told The Associated Press in an interview during a visit to Damascus.",
      "After Assad was toppled in a lightning rebel offensive in December, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, the main former rebel group now in control of Syria, set up an interim administration comprising mainly members of its \u201csalvation government\u201d that had ruled in northwestern Syria.",
      "The country\u2019s de facto authorities said at the time that a new government would be formed through an inclusive process by March. In January, former HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa was named Syria\u2019s interim president after a meeting of most of the country\u2019s former rebel factions.",
      "In recent weeks, a committee has been holding meetings in different parts of Syria in preparation for a national dialogue conference to chart the country's political future, the date of which has not yet been announced.",
      "Pedersen said that in his first meeting with al-Sharaa in December, al-Sharaa had insisted that the interim government would rule for only three months, although Pedersen warned him the timeline was tight.",
      "\u201cI think the important thing is not whether it is three months or not, but it is whether they will deliver on what they have said all along, that this is going to be an inclusive process where all Syrians will be included,\u201d Pedersen said.",
      "The U.S. and European countries have not lifted sanctions that were imposed on the Syrian government under Assad\u2019s rule, which the new authorities have said is handicapping their ability to rebuild the country after nearly 14 years of civil war and restore essential services like state electricity. Officials from some Western countries have said they want to see if the interim rulers will follow through on their promises of inclusive governance and protecting minorities.",
      "Organizers of the national dialogue have said the conference will include all segments of Syrian society except for Assad loyalists and the Syrian Democratic Forces, a Kurdish-led force in the northeast that has so far refused to dissolve and be absorbed into the new national army. The SDF is currently in negotiations with the central government, and Pedersen said he hopes to see a \u201cpolitical solution\u201d to the impasse.",
      "Pedersen said he is also concerned about a security vacuum following the disbanding of the former national army and security services by the country\u2019s new rulers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very important that the new structures of the state are coming in place quickly and that there is an offer to those who are no longer in service of the army or the security services, that there are other job opportunities and that people do not feel that they are excluded from the future of Syria,\u201d he said.",
      "The U.N. envoy said he also remains concerned about Israel\u2019s incursions into Syrian territory since the fall of Assad. The Israeli army has seized a U.N.-patrolled buffer zone in the Golan Heights established by a 1974 ceasefire agreement with Syria and has also made forays beyond the buffer zone. The U.N. has said that Israel is violating the agreement.",
      "Israeli officials have said they took the action to protect Israel\u2019s security and that their presence would be temporary.",
      "Pedersen said the security concerns are being addressed and \u201cthere is really, in my opinion, no argument for why the Israelis should be staying.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe solution is very simple. The Israelis need to withdraw,\u201d he said."

      "Hong Kong\u2019s largest pro-democracy party took an initial step toward dissolving on Thursday",
      "HONG KONG -- Hong Kong\u2019s largest pro-democracy party took an initial step toward dissolving Thursday, in the latest sign of the Chinese territory's narrowing space for civil society groups following Beijng's crackdown on dissent.",
      "The Democratic Party's central committee decided to set up a task force to look into the procedures involved in dissolving the party. A final decision would require approval of the party's members.",
      "Party Chairperson Lo Kin-hei said at a news conference late Thursday that party leaders made the decision based the current political situation and social climate, and said the party did not have any acute financial burdens.",
      "\u201cWhen we have to move toward this direction, we, of course, feel it is a pity. I believe every member cherishes the existence of the Democratic Party in Hong Kong,\u201d he said.",
      "Founded in 1994, the Democratic Party is one of the few pro-democracy parties in Hong Kong, where political activism has faced a stern crackdown from China's central government in Beijing following anti-government protests by Hong Kongers in 2019.",
      "Its prominent party members include Martin Lee, nicknamed the city\u2019s \u201cFather of Democracy,\u201d Albert Ho, former leader of a now-defunct group that organized Tiananmen vigils, and journalist-turned-activist Emily Lau.",
      "Over the years, the party has long been seen as a moderate opposition party that once maintained friendly relationships even with Beijing officials. Some of its former members had become top government officials, while radical members had criticized the party for being too mild.",
      "But following the massive protests that rocked the Chinese territory in 2019, the city's political environment changed drastically. Months of social unrest triggered Beijing to impose a national security law \u2014 which authorities insist is necessary for the city\u2019s stability.",
      "Since the law took effect in 2020, dozens of civil society groups have shut down, including the city\u2019s once second-largest pro-democracy party and a decades-old group that organized the annual vigil to commemorate Beijing\u2019s Tiananmen crackdown in 1989. Many leading activists were prosecuted under the law, including members of the Democratic Party. Others were forced into self-exile or silenced.",
      "Last year, some of the party\u2019s former lawmakers were convicted and sentenced over their roles in an unofficial primary election in the city\u2019s largest national security case. That verdict drew criticism from foreign governments though Beijing defended it.",
      "In recent years, the party has had limited influence over the city\u2019s politics after the authorities overhauled the electoral rules in changes they said ensured that \u201cpatriots\u201d administered Hong Kong, and that effectively barred pro-democracy candidates from running for seats in district councils.",
      "Despite the changing climate, the party pressed on with its work. It continued holding news briefings on livelihood issues and even submitted opinions on proposed national security legislation to the government before the law was enacted last March.",
      "In Thursday\u2019s news conference, Lo said disbandment would require support from 75% of the attending members of a general assembly. The party now has 400 members, but typically not all members attend general meetings. In the past, the party has had both successful and failed attempts to secure enough votes to change its constitution, he said.",
      "When the former British colony was returned to China's rule in 1997, the governing principle of \u201cone country, two systems\u201d was supposed to guarantee Western-style civil liberties and autonomy not enjoyed by mainland Chinese territories.",
      "But Lo said his party's interpretation of this governing principle may differ from that of the Beijing government. He said he hoped these different views could remain in society, saying that societies improve only with diverse voices.",
      "\u201cThe path to democracy is always difficult,\u201d Lo said. \u201cI have confidence in Hong Kongers and Hong Kongers can always find ways to handle different matters.\u201d"

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol appeared in court Thursday for a hearing where his lawyers contested his arrest on a criminal charge alleging he was orchestrating a rebellion when he briefly imposed martial law in December.",
      "Security was heightened as the motorcade transporting Yoon arrived at the Seoul Central District Court and dozens of his supporters rallied nearby.",
      "The preliminary hearing will involve discussions of witnesses and other preparations for his criminal trial, and the court was also to review the request by Yoon\u2019s lawyers to cancel his arrest and release him from custody. Such challenges are rarely successful.",
      "Yoon was indicted Jan. 26 on the rebellion charge carrying a potential punishment of death or life in prison. In South Korea, presidents have immunity from most criminal prosecutions, but not on charges of rebellion or treason.",
      "The indictment alleges his imposition of martial law was an illegal attempt to shut down the National Assembly and arrest politicians and election authorities. The conservative Yoon has said his martial law declaration was intended as a temporary warning to the liberal opposition and that he had always planned to respect lawmakers\u2019 will if they voted to lift the measure.",
      "Yoon's presidential powers were suspended when he was impeached Dec. 14, and South Korea's Constitutional Court is nearing a decision on whether to formally remove him from office or dismiss the Assembly\u2019s impeachment and reinstate him.",
      "Martial law was lifted about six hours after Yoon declared it but has caused political turmoil, disrupted high-level diplomacy and tested the resiliency of the country\u2019s democracy. Yoon\u2019s conservative supporters rioted at the Seoul Western District Court after it authorized his arrest last month, while his lawyers and ruling party have openly questioned the credibility of courts and law enforcement institutions handling the case.",
      "Yoon has continued to express contempt for his liberal rivals for obstructing his agenda and endorsed baseless conspiracy theories about election fraud to justify his ill-fated authoritarian push.",
      "Yoon\u2019s defense minister, police chief and several military commanders have also been arrested and indicted on rebellion, abuse of power and other charges related to the martial law decree, which involved hundreds of heavily armed troops deployed to the National Assembly and National Election Commission offices.",

Doctors on Tuesday diagnosed pneumonia in both lungs, on top of a polymicrobial infection in his respiratory tract, meaning a combination of bacteria, viral and other organisms. He is taking a combination of antibiotics and cortisone for what doctors also diagnosed as asthmatic bronchitis.",
      "Doctors say pneumonia in such a fragile, elderly patient makes him particularly prone to complications given the difficulty in being able to effectively expel fluid from his lungs. While his heart is strong, Francis isn\u2019t a particularly healthy 88-year-old. He isn't physically active, uses a wheelchair because of bad knees, had part of one lung removed as a young man, and has admitted to being a not-terribly-cooperative patient in the past.",

      "In July 2024, De Moraes ordered both X and Meta to block and ban the account and provide the data.

      "Canada is listing seven Latin American criminal organizations as terrorist entities under the criminal code, giving Canadian law enforcement another tool in the fight against fentanyl trafficking, authorities say",
      "OTTAWA, Ontario -- Canada is designating seven Latin American criminal organizations as terrorist entities under the country's Criminal Code, giving Canadian law enforcement another tool in the fight against fentanyl trafficking, Public Safety Minister David McGuinty said Thursday.",
      "The list includes Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel, Jalisco New Generation Cartel and La Nueva Familia Michoacana, and was announced a day after the U.S. government formally designated eight Latin American organized crime groups as \u201cforeign terrorist organizations.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe measures will help keep fentanyl off Canadian streets and from entering the United States,\u201d McGuinty told a news conference.",
      "The announcement was Canada's latest response to U.S. President Donald Trump 's claim that the flow of fentanyl and illegal immigration into the U.S. were behind his threats of imposing a 25% tariff on all Canadian goods \u2013 with the exception of 10% on energy.",
      "Trump has paused the implementation of those tariffs until at least March 4.",
      "U.S. border patrol statistics show that less than 1% of all fentanyl seized is found at the northern border. But Canadian officials have expressed a willingness to do more to combat the deadly synthetic opioid.",
      "The other organizations designated as terrorist groups are Cartel del Golfo and Carteles Unidos, also from Mexico; Tren de Aragua, in Venezuela, and the Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, which started in California but became a dominant criminal force in El Salvador.",
      "The designation effectively freezes a group\u2019s assets and property.",
      "\u201cBanks and brokerages will freeze these entities' assets, which can then be the subject of seizure, restraint or forfeiture,\u201d said McGuinty.",
      "It is also an offense to knowingly participate in, or contribute to, any activity of a listed terrorist group.",
      "The listing process begins with intelligence reports that indicate whether an organization has knowingly carried out, attempted to carry out, participated in or facilitated a terrorist activity.",
      "McGuinty said listing a group as a terrorist entity follows a rigorous process that \u201cmust meet a legal threshold.\u201d",
      "If the public safety minister believes that threshold has been met, the minister may recommend to the federal cabinet that the organization be added to the list.",

      "After their initial shock at Trump\u2019s false claims this week that Ukraine is led by a \u201cdictator\u201d who started the war with Russia, the Ukrainian people are rallying around a defiant President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who publicly criticized Trump for promoting Russian \u201cdisinformation.\u201d",
      "\u201cYes, he\u2019s not a perfect president, but he\u2019s not a dictator,\u201d said Kateryna Karaush, a 25-year-old tech worker from Kyiv who like many Ukrainians \u2014 and even some Republicans in Congress \u2014 is struggling to wrap her head around Trump's embrace of Russia, which represents a major about-face in U.S. foreign policy.",
      "\u201cIt feels like the whole world is against us,\" Karaush said.",
      "Against long odds, Ukrainians \u2013 with massive military support from the U.S. \u2013 have prevented Russia from overtaking their country, even if roughly one fifth of it is now under Russia control.",
      "But after three years of war, both civilians and soldiers are exhausted. Hundreds of thousands have been killed or wounded, tens of thousands are missing, and millions have fled the country.",
      "The mood only became gloomier in recent days as Trump signaled his desire to rapidly bring the fighting to a close on terms that Zelenskyy and many in the West say are too favorable to Russia.",
      "After Trump called Zelenskyy a \u201cdictator\u201d \u2013 for legally postponing an election last year -- and as reports emerged of U.S. and Russian officials meeting in Saudi Arabia to discuss a possible ceasefire without input from Ukraine, even some of Zelenskyy\u2019s harshest domestic critics have begun defending him.",
      "\u201cWe may have different opinions about Zelenskyy, but only Ukrainian citizens have the right to judge his support,\u201d said Yaroslav Zhelezniak, a lawmaker from the opposition party Holos. \u201cAnd to publicly criticize him too, because, in the end, he is our elected leader.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s harsh words for Zelenskyy have drawn criticism from Democrats and even some Republicans in the U.S. Congress, where defending Ukraine from Russia \u2014 with tens of billions of dollars in military aid \u2014 has had bipartisan support. But Vice President JD Vance admonished Zelenskyy for publicly warning Trump about falling for Russian disinformation.",
      "On Thursday, the deepening tensions led to the cancelation of a news conference that had been planned to follow talks between Zelenskyy and Trump's Ukraine envoy over how to end the war.",
      "A poll released Wednesday by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology put public trust in Zelenskyy at 57%. The survey was conducted Feb. 4 to Feb. 9 among 1,000 people living across Ukraine in regions and territories controlled by the Ukrainian government.",
      "\u201cWe have a president whom we support. During war, we are united,\u201d said Larysa, a 52-year-old resident from the northeastern city of Kharkiv, who refused to give her last name due to security concerns.",
      "The political rift with the U.S. comes as Ukrainian forces, outnumbered and outgunned, increasingly struggle to hold back Russia\u2019s slow but steady advances.",
      "Speaking from the front lines, some Ukrainian soldiers said they were not panicking yet, and not ready to give up the fight.",
      "\u201cEven if we don\u2019t get enough weapons or if funding is cut, that doesn\u2019t change our duty to (fight),\u201d said a Ukrainian officer who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with military rules. \u201cNo shells? We\u2019ll take up rifles. No rifles? We\u2019ll grab shovels.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, Trump echoed one of Putin\u2019s frequent talking points, claiming Zelenskyy, whose term expired last year, must hold elections. But the idea has little traction within Ukraine \u2014 even among opposition politicians, who recognize Zelenskyy\u2019s right to postpone elections during wartime.",
      "\u201cElections are not needed right now because they should only take place when we understand the framework of (a peace) agreement with Russia,\u201d said Volodymyr Ariev, a lawmaker from the opposition European Solidarity party. \u201cHolding elections now would only benefit the Kremlin, further dividing Ukrainians and installing a new president who could sign a deal favorable to Moscow.\u201d",
      "An adviser to Zelenskyy, Mykhailo Podolyak, gave an additional reason for holding off any election until there is peace: Russia might seek to interfere in an electoral process that would already face significant challenges.",
      "Millions of displaced Ukrainians living abroad would struggle to participate \u2014 not to mention the hundreds of thousands Ukrainians living in Russian-occupied territories, whose ability to vote would be virtually impossible.",
      "Around 800,000 Ukrainians are currently serving in the armed forces, making it difficult for them to cast ballots without weakening the military. And those fighting would be unable to run for office \u2014 a right guaranteed under Ukrainian law.",
      "\u201cHolding elections before a peace agreement with security guarantees is signed would be devastating for Ukraine,\u201d said Valerii Pekar, a professor at Kyiv-Mohyla Business School. \u201cThe U.S. and Russia are now united in promoting the idea of \u2018elections first, then peace\u2019 \u2014 which is the quickest and cheapest way to bring Ukraine down.\u201d",

      "KAMPALA, Uganda -- Ugandan opposition figure Kizza Besigye was charged with treason on Friday in an escalation of legal troubles stemming from allegations he plotted to remove the country\u2019s long-time leader by force.",
      "Besigye, a four-time presidential candidate in the east African country, sat in a wheelchair as he faced the charges in a courtroom in the capital, Kampala. Treason carries the death penalty in Uganda.",
      "Besigye has been in custody since Nov. 16, when he went missing in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi. Days later, he was presented before a military tribunal in Kampala to face charges over threatening national security.",
      "The Supreme Court stopped his military trial last month, saying court-martial panels cannot try civilians. Besigye\u2019s family, supporters and others wanted him freed immediately, but he was kept in a maximum-security prison and later started a hunger strike.",
      "Besigye has looked frail in recent court appearances, leading to concerns that any harm to him in prison could trigger deadly unrest. Many Ugandans are urging authorities to release him on compassionate grounds.",
      "Amnesty International also called for Besigye\u2019s release, saying his \u201cabduction clearly violated international human rights law and the process of extradition with its requisite fair trial protections.\u201d",
      "This is the second time Besigye has faced treason charges stemming from allegations he tried to overthrow the government. The first case, brought in 2005, failed to take off. This time, he and others are accused of attending meetings, in European cities and elsewhere, during which Besigye allegedly solicited \u201cmilitary, financial and other logistical support to overturn the government of Uganda as by law established,\u201d according to the charge sheet.",
      "Besigye\u2019s attorneys say the charges are politically motivated.",
      "But President Yoweri Museveni has said his political rival must answer for \u201cthe very serious offenses he is alleged to have been planning.\u201d Museveni rejected calls by some for forgiveness and instead urged \u201ca quick trial so that facts come out.\u201d",
      "Besigye\u2019s case is being watched closely by Ugandans anxious about political maneuvers ahead of presidential elections next year. Although Museveni is expected to seek re-election, some observers believe he may step aside in favor of his son, Muhoozi Kainerugaba, the top army commander, in a bloodless coup.",
      "Many expect an unpredictable political transition because Museveni has no obvious successor within the ranks of the ruling National Resistance Movement party.",
      "Besigye, a physician who retired from Uganda\u2019s military at the rank of colonel, is a former president of the Forum for Democratic Change party, for many years Uganda\u2019s most prominent opposition group. He is a fierce critic of Museveni, for whom he once served as a military assistant and personal doctor.",
      "Uganda has never witnessed a peaceful transfer of presidential power since independence from colonial rule six decades ago."

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- The Australian and New Zealand militaries were monitoring three Chinese warships moving unusually far south along Australia\u2019s east coast on an unknown mission, officials said Thursday.",
      "The Australian government revealed a week ago that the warships had traveled through Southeast Asia and the Coral Sea and were approaching northeast Australia.",
      "Defense Minister Richard Marles said Thursday that the Chinese ships \u2014 the naval frigate Hengyang, cruiser Zunyi and replenishment vessel Weishanhu \u2014 were \u201coff the east coast of Australia.\u201d",
      "Defense officials did not respond to a request for comment on a Financial Times report that the task group from China's military, the People's Liberation Army, was 150 nautical miles (278 kilometers) east of Sydney.",
      "\u201cThere is no doubt that this is, not unprecedented, but an unusual event,\u201d Marles told Sky News television.",
      "Marles said Australian navy ships and air force planes were monitoring the Chinese ships\u2019 movements through international waters that are in Australia's exclusive economic zone, the area beyond its territorial waters where a nation has exclusive economic rights.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re entitled to be where they are; Australia is also entitled to be prudent and we are monitoring very closely what the activities of the task group are,\u201d Marles told reporters.",
      "\u201cWhat we will do whenever this mission is over on the part of the Chinese task group is engage in a full assessment of what the Chinese were seeking to achieve in respect of this mission,\u201d he added.",
      "In Beijing, China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun was asked at a media briefing on Wednesday about the Chinese warships' location and replied he was not aware of the situation. The Chinese Embassy in Australia did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.",
      "Marles said Australia had engaged with its nearest neighbor Papua New Guinea over its response because the Chinese had traveled around the South Pacific island nation\u2019s coast on their way to Australia\u2019s exclusive economic zone.",
      "Australia was also \u201cworking very closely\u201d with New Zealand, which is separated from the Australian east coast by the Tasman Sea, he said.",
      "New Zealand\u2019s military was also monitoring the Chinese ships \u201cin coordination with Australia,\u201d New Zealand Defense Minister Judith Collins said in a statement.",
      "\u201cWe have not been informed by the Chinese government why this task group has been deployed into our region, and we have not been informed what its future plans are,\u201d she added. \u201cWe will continue to monitor these vessels.\u201d",
      "She did not specify how the New Zealand military would monitor the Chinese shipping.",
      "Jennifer Parker, an expert associate of Australia\u2019s National Security College and a former Australian naval officer, said Chinese warships rarely traveled so far south along the nation\u2019s east coast.",
      "\u201cThis is part of a broader power projection from the PLA-Navy and we should expect to see more of this in the Pacific and in the Indian Ocean,\u201d Parker said.",
      "The Chinese deployment comes as the head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command Adm. Samuel Paparo visits Australia this week.",
      "Parker said the timing was likely coincidental given the Chinese deployment would have been planned well in advance and the United States doesn\u2019t release information about their senior officers\u2019 travel until close to the visit.",
      "\u201cWithout knowing exactly where the ships are going, the point of this deployment, I think, is to demonstrate to Australia that they have the capability to come down and operate in our maritime domain,\u201d Parker said.",
      "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told a news conference he was not worried by reports of Chinese warships off Sydney.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese naval ships are complying with international law, but as we do, we are monitoring the situation and observing what is going on, as you would expect,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "Three Chinese warships visited Sydney Harbor in 2019. But their voyage had been approved by the Australian government.",
      "Australia\u2019s diplomatic and trade relations with China have improved in recent years, but relations between the two militaries are dangerous.",

      "After months of quiet discussions, the proposal has become increasingly public. It will likely be on the agenda when U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron, two major backers of the idea, visit Washington on separate days next week for talks with U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Starmer, who will visit Thursday, has stressed that the force won\u2019t work without American military might to back it up. Persuading Trump to provide it could be a tall order.",
      "The security guarantee that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy really wants is NATO membership. European members of the military alliance still back that goal, but the U.S. looks to have taken it off the table, along with Ukrainian hopes of regaining the 20% of its territory seized by Russia.",
      "In the absence of NATO membership, Zelenskyy has said that more than 100,000 European troops could be needed in Ukraine to guarantee the conflict doesn't flare up again after a ceasefire.",

      "Under the plan, the front line would largely be monitored remotely, with drones and other technology. Air power based outside Ukraine \u2014 perhaps in Poland or Romania \u2014 would be in reserve to deter breaches and reopen Ukrainian airspace to commercial flights.",

      "The success of the plan depends on the nature of any agreement to stop the fighting. Russia has around 600,000 troops in Ukraine, and analysts say any ceasefire deal that leaves the bulk of them there is a recipe for renewed conflict.",
      "France's military has just over 200,000 personnel, while the U.K. has less than 150,000. Matthew Savill, director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute, said that Europe would struggle to mount a force even in the tens of thousands.",

      "\u201cMy heart just sank ... knowing that was his reality was absolutely shocking to me and really brought it home,\u201d said Nolan, a paramedic chief in a county north of Ottawa.",
      "Instead of just attending a convention about the role paramedics play in the world, the two men found themselves in the middle of a real-life emergency.",
      "Nolan rushed to a triage area to assist in treating injured passengers, greeting his friend of over a decade with a big hug.",
      "Carlson's paramedic instincts also kicked in, even though he\u2019s held a so-called desk job for the past decade.",
      "\u201cI was comfortable with how my body and mind empowered me to do what I needed to do at that point,\u201d he said. \u201cI was able to see the objective nature of the challenge in front of us, which was to get away from the threat.\u201d",
      "Though credited for helping in the evacuation, Carlson deferred praise to the four crew members who shepherded the passengers to safety. That everyone survived astounds him, especially after seeing videos posted online of the Mitsubishi CRJ-900 jet touching down heavily and skidding down the runway before flipping over.",
      "\u201cEven without seeing that, it\u2019s remarkable,\u201d Carlson said, noting he bruised his ribs and has several cuts and bruises on his legs.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m deserving of going into miracle territory, but it sure feels ...\u201d he added, before pausing to find the appropriate word. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d",
      "The last of the 21 injured passengers was released from the hospital on Thursday.",
      "The cuts and bruises will heal, but the mental trauma left Carlson wondering whether he could muster enough resolve on Wednesday to still deliver his address.",
      "\u201cIt took me a lot of personal motivation to leave my room,\u201d he said. \u201cThis morning, I just couldn\u2019t. I was quite emotional about this whole thing and just really want to be home.\u201d",
      "And yet, deliver Carlson did \u2014 giving a 20-minute speech in which he outlined his background and influences in paramedicine, the significance of the job and the difference paramedics can make.",
      "Whatever anxieties he felt didn\u2019t show.",
      "Though Carlson longed to be back home in Minneapolis, Minnesota, with his wife and three children, his nerves were eased being among his working family of paramedics and Nolan.",
      "National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations Cindy Woodhouse welcomed Carlson on Tuesday into a drumming circle of healing.",
      "A day later, Ontario paramedic chiefs association president Greg Sage honored Carlson's efforts on the airplane with a certificate.",
      "\u201cI think every single one of us in this room would hope that if we personally were faced with what Pete was, that we would respond in a similar manner,\u201d Sage said. \u201cI think he\u2019s inspired all of us.\u201d",
      "Carlson's trip to Toronto began with a hug with Nolan during a very trying time. Two days later, the two shared a more joyous hug onstage after Carlson accepted his award to a standing ovation.",
      "\u201cI was not as present the last couple of days as I had hoped to be,\u201d Carlson apologized to the crowd.",
      "\u201cGiven the events as they've played out, I can't think of a better group of people in terms of taking care of one another in their community and myself,\" Carlson said. \"So just a very big thank you.\u201d"

      "This arid, wind-swept region, dotted with cacti and roaming herds of goats, holds immense potential to position Colombia as a wind and solar energy leader. However, resistance from the Wayuu community has stalled many proposed projects by multinational companies and the government. The Wayuu have concerns about the environmental and cultural impacts and the lack of prior consultation in what's one of the nation\u2019s poorest regions. Now, these companies are also eyeing the region\u2019s offshore wind farm prospects.",
      "\u201cThis cemetery is sacred to us, the Wayuu,\u201d 64-year-old Velasquez said in Spanish, though she is more comfortable speaking in her native Wayuunaiki. Wayuu leaders say what is threatened isn\u2019t the cemetery itself but the spirituality of the territory. \u201cIt is here that the bones of our ancestors rest. That's what matters most to us.\u201d",
      "The region could generate approximately 15 gigawatts of wind energy, according to Colombia\u2019s Mining and Energy Planning Unit, which could power up to an estimated 37.5 million homes annually. It's part of Colombia\u2019s just energy transition, aiming to replace fossil fuels with renewables while supporting vulnerable groups like Indigenous peoples. The Wayuu say this isn\u2019t happening.",
      "Construction started on the La Guajira 1 wind farm \u2014 which looms over the cemetery near Cabo de la Vela \u2014 in 2020 after a mix of legal processes, government backing, and controversial negotiations and unsatisfactory prior consultation. It faced significant opposition from the Wayuu and has been producing electricity since 2022, but is not yet hooked up to the interconnected system.",
      "\u201cWayuu spirituality is the fundamental base of our life and existence,\u201d said An\u00edbal Mercado, a \u201cPalabrero,\u201d head of the regional Wayuu council. He wasn't part of the consultations due to his staunch opposition. \u201cIf something disturbs the peacefulness of our dead, they\u2019re affecting spiritual peace and tranquility.

There\u2019s been a slowdown in the progress of these energy transition projects precisely because of that conflict,\u201d Lanao said. \u201cI believe that the national government plays an important role in achieving a community-company agreement.\u201d",
      "Colombia\u2019s environment ministry did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The region is home to Cerrejon, one of the largest open-pit coal mines in the world and a major player in Latin America\u2019s mining sector, which has been in operation since 1985. The mine has just nine years left in its lifespan, and its closure, without alternative plans in place, will deal a significant blow to the region\u2019s economy.",

      "The AP spoke to several Wayuu families living near wind turbines who do not oppose the companies operating there, as they have received financial assistance and housing.",
      "Others are not convinced.",
      "\u201cAn old saying goes that if you\u2019ve never owned a chicken, manure looks like an egg to you,\u201d Mercado, the Palabrero, said when asked about those in the community who accept help from the companies, which is much less than what he'd consider fair compensation.",
      "\u201cThere are many communities that have never had anything. In the midst of so much need, so much crisis, so much hunger, any little penny that they are being offered now seems like a miracle cure and the greatest wealth in the world to them,\u201d he said.",
      "Companies are now carrying out studies for offshore wind farms, which is also enraging the Wayuu, especially traditional fishers, known as Apalanchii.",
      "Lanao, of the environmental authority, says just because the project is in the sea, it does not mean the communities do not have influence.",
      "The Apalanchii use traditional fishing techniques, with nets, hooks and sometimes spearfishing. It is not only a means of sustenance but also a culturally important activity which they say ties them to their ancestors and the land.",
      "\u201cWe are really worried about the offshore wind farms,\u201d said fisherman Aaron Laguna Ipuana, 57, during an early morning fishing trip in Cabo de la Vela with his crew. \u201cThey're going to displace us and the sea is everything to us. It sustains us.\"",
      "Mercado says the government needs to do more to ensure Wayuu people are involved.",
      "\u201cWe are concerned that these projects continue and that the government is letting them go ahead, without even coming to say what is going to happen and what is in the interest of the Wayuu people,\" said Mercado.",

      "Walmart delivered another year of strong sales and profits with its competitive prices an increasingly strong magnet for inflation-weary shoppers, but this year appears to come with new challenges in an uncertain economic landscape",
      "NEW YORK -- Walmart delivered another year of strong sales and profits with its competitive prices an increasingly strong magnet for inflation-weary shoppers, but 2025 appears to come with new challenges in an uncertain economic landscape.",
      "The outlook from the nation's largest retailer for 2025 is as much as 27 cents below analyst projections for per-share earnings and for the quarter, Walmart's expectations are as much as 7 cents below Wall Street projections.",
      "Its sales outlook is also disappointing, potentially a reflection of rising challenges ahead as consumers pull back on spending and President Donald Trump's tariffs on China and other countries threaten the low-price model that is the core of Walmart's success.",
      "Walmart has built in hedges against some tariff threats. Groceries account for roughly 60%, of its U.S. business, according to the company\u2019s most recent annual report, meaning a huge chunk of sales are not reliant on goods made in China or elsewhere.",
      "Still, shares tumbled nearly 9% before the opening bell Thursday and it pulled other big retailers down with it. The retail sector is the biggest decliner in premarket trading and Target slid 2%.",
      "Walmart is among the first major U.S. retailers to report quarterly financial results and numbers could provide a hint as to the mood of the American shopper, particularly amid new trade barriers that according to most economists threaten to reignite inflation. Consumers over the past year have increasingly focused more on necessities rather than TVs, furniture or appliances. They've become much more discerning about big-ticket purchases because of higher costs for credit as well as for groceries.",
      "Walmart has flourished in that environment, using its clout to keep prices down. It's gained market share, notably among households with incomes over $100,000. Walmart\u2019s online offerings and paid membership, Walmart +, have also drawn wealthier customers",
      "\u201cWe have momentum driven by our low prices, a growing assortment, and an eCommerce business driven by faster delivery times,\u201d said CEO Doug McMillon. \u201cWe\u2019re gaining market share, our top line is healthy, and we\u2019re in great shape with inventory.\u201d",
      "Still, Walmart could be faced with challenges with the new tariffs carrying more economic risks than during Trump's first term. If Americans are hit by a new wave of price increases, economists say, and with 70% of the U.S. economy driven by consumers a broad pullback in spending would have ramifications beyond Walmart\u2019s sales.",
      "Government data last week revealed a sharp drop in January retail sales as cold weather kept more Americans indoors. But it was a much bigger drop than economists expected and the biggest in a year. Sales were revised higher for December, possibly indicating a pullback by consumers after a holiday season splurge.",
      "Yet grocery prices, a sore point for American households, continued to rise.",
      "Walmart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, reported earnings of $5.25 billion, or 65 cents per share, in the quarter ended Jan. 31. That compares with $5.49 billion, or 68 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings per share for the most recent quarter was 66 cents.",
      "Sales rose 4.1% to $180.55 billion in the quarter.",
      "Analysts expected 65 cents per share on sales of $180.07 billion in the fourth quarter, according to FactSet.",
      "For Walmart\u2019s U.S. division, comparable store sales \u2014 which include online and stores open for the past 12 months \u2014 rose 4.6% in the U.S., a bit lower than the 5.3% in the previous quarter. The retailer had a 4.2% jump in the U.S. in the second quarter and 3.8% in the first quarter.",
      "Global e-commerce sales rose 16% in the latest quarter, notably slower than the 27% increase in the third quarter.",
      "Walmart expects first quarter earnings per share of between 57 cents and 58 cents, well below the 64 cents Wall Street was expecting, and for the year. Walmart expects earnings per share in the range of $2.50 to $2.60. That\u2019s also off the $2.77 that analysts are predicting, according to FactSet.",
      "It forecast a 3% to 4% increase in quarterly sales or between $166.35 billion and $167.97 billion. That could be a letdown for industry analysts, who had expected sales of $167.05 billion, according to FactSet.",
      "Walmart expects sales to be up anywhere between 3% to 4% for the current year, or between $667.57 billion and $674.05 billion. That too falls short of the $708.72 billion that analysts predicted, according to FactSet.",

      "Refugees had been arriving in the United States at levels unseen in nearly three decades, aided by nonprofits and ordinary people across the political spectrum",
      "MIAMI -- Refugees had been arriving in the United States at levels unseen in nearly three decades, assisted by nonprofits and ordinary people across the political spectrum.",
      "More than 160,000 Americans across every state signed up to resettle newcomers through the Welcome Corps, a public-private effort launched two years ago. More than 800,000 new arrivals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Ukraine and Afghanistan were also welcomed with help from financial supporters through a legal tool known as humanitarian parole.",
      "That screeched to a halt after President Donald Trump's inauguration and his administration\u2019s immediate 90-day suspension of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program \u2014 a move that stranded thousands of vetted refugees, cut nonprofits' staffing and left sponsors uneasy about the future of fledgling programs they felt had enriched their own lives.",
      "Rivly Breus is among those feeling anxious. Working from a pastel peach house in South Florida, the crisis counselor has backed the resettlement of more than 30 people from Haiti, Ukraine and Cuba. She wanted to show them how to \u201cthrive,\u201d she said, rather than \u201cbeing in survival mode all the time.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s also left us in limbo because we\u2019re not able to answer some of the questions that our sponsees have,\u201d Breus said. \u201cWe\u2019re not able to give them the encouragement that we usually do, or the hope.\u201d",
      "New sponsorship pathways increased U.S. resettlement capacity in recent years.",
      "Humanitarian parole had been applied for seven decades towards migrants unable to use standard routes. The Biden administration expanded it for Ukrainians and with another program known as CHNV allowing up to 30,000 monthly entrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. Migrants needed to clear security checks and have U.S.-based financial supporters. The intention was to dissuade illegal border crossings by providing two-year work authorizations, though they weren't a path to citizenship.",
      "The State Department allowed private sponsors to ease refugees\u2019 transition through the Welcome Corps beginning in January 2023. Groups of five or more sponsors had to secure at least $2,425 per refugee and commit to planning transportation, housing, education and employment. They could match with pre-approved applicants or name a specific refugee.",
      "\u201cPrivate sponsorship means we\u2019re not asking a government or the taxpayer to fund this,\" Ed Shapiro, a leading Welcome Corps funder, said in an email. \u201cWe\u2019re saying, \u2018Let us do this for our citizens, religious organizations, businesses and universities who want (or in some cases, need) to do this.'\u201d",
      "More than 9,000 sponsors have welcomed over 4,500 refugees since the program\u2019s first arrivals in June 2023. The nonprofit platform Welcome.US launched to help refugees identify sponsors. Private philanthropists and GoFundMe.org established a fund to overcome financial barriers.",
      "The idea was that sponsor circles could provide instant social capital and aid assimilation in a more meaningful way than government case workers.",
      "\u201cIt was an initiative that I think was really energizing for folks,\u201d said Marissa Tirona, president of Grantmakers Concerned with Immigrants and Refugees. \u201c(For) everyday folks, neighbors, communities to establish more welcoming localities across the United States.\u201d",
      "Proponents pitched sponsorship as an intimate form of service that enabled ordinary people to supplement the resettlement agencies' work and take an active role in reshaping their communities.",
      "However, the Department of Homeland Security now says its predecessors abused humanitarian parole. When asked about Welcome Corps, a State Department spokesperson said Secretary of State Marco Rubio is ensuring all foreign assistance programs are \u201cefficient and consistent\u201d with the \u201cAmerica First\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery dollar we spend, every program we fund, and every policy we pursue must be justified with the answer to three simple questions: Does it make America safer? Does it make America stronger? Does it make America more prosperous?\u201d Rubio said in a statement.",
      "Breus keeps busy helping.",
      "When she's not meeting patients or filling out grant applications in the afternoons for the antipoverty nonprofit, the Erzule Paul Foundation, where she runs operations, Breus said she enjoys taking new arrivals on outings around Miami like this winter's photo session with a mall Santa. Her mother helps. They jumped at the opportunity to be a \u201cstepping stone,\" according to Breus.",
      "She said ten foundation employees formed a \u201csponsor circle\u201d and created an online profile that prospective migrants could browse. They indicated how many people they could sponsor and what resources they could offer. Together, the sponsors help with transportation, interpretation, job applications and school enrollment.",
      "\u201cJust the basics to help get them off their feet,\u201d Breus said.",
      "The experience was rewarding enough that Breus used Welcome.US to help Ukrainians resettle, but she says it has been pretty \u201cshaky\u201d lately. She's been attending webinars so she can best advise her \u201csponsees,\u201d some of whom are exploring moves to other countries.",
      "Among them is Flor, who studied psychology in Haiti and works part time as an overnight stocker while taking English language classes. Flor asked to be identified only by her nickname because she fears deportation.",
      "Flor had hoped her 5-year-old daughter, still in Haiti, might join her with Breus' help.",
      "\u201cThis week, with the news, I don\u2019t even have the courage when I\u2019m talking to her to look at her because I feel like I\u2019m failing her,\" she said Jan. 23 through a Creole-language interpreter.",
      "After frantically trying to expedite applications, sponsors are now sitting with growing uncertainty.",
      "Provoked by the urgency of their refugees\u2019 circumstances, some participants are lobbying lawmakers to uphold initiatives they say have broad appeal and praying they meet the unexplained \u201ccase-by-case\u201d basis on which arrivals are now allowed.",
      "Clydie Wakefield, 72, flew to D.C. this month. The retired teacher, who described herself as \u201cconservative leaning but open,\u201d began sponsoring an Afghan family after virtually tutoring their sister in English. She thought her representatives\u2019 offices might help obtain an exception for the woman and her siblings.",
      "Wakefield said she's not a \u201cmover and shaker.\" She just wanted to follow her Mormon faith\u2019s calling to \u201cgive comfort to those in need of comfort.\u201d She\u2019d spent the holiday season finding housing and making final arrangements. Bedding and other necessities bought by her church community sit in a storage unit.",
      "The family was maybe one month away from flying over when Wakefield said the executive order hit.",
      "\u201cIt was really discouraging. But she just keeps hoping,\" Wakefield said. \"And I\u2019m inspired by her. I\u2019m going to continue to hope.\u201d",
      "Chuck Pugh, 78, said he felt \u201cincreasing pressure\u201d to get an Afghan arrival\u2019s parents, three sisters and two brothers from Pakistan to the Philadelphia area.",
      "A political independent, Pugh said he gathered a bipartisan Welcome Corps group last July, including a Trump supporter. The family underwent an hours-long interview at the U.S. embassy in Islamabad, he said, and reported for medical checks in November. He raised all the money required to cover post-arrival expenses for the seven-person family.",
      "They redoubled their efforts this January because he felt they were \"so very close.\u201d Pugh said he can\u2019t afford to give up \u2014 though he expects the family will be stuck for the near future.",
      "\u201cIf we can be at the airport to welcome this family, that would really be one of the greatest days of my life,\u201d Pugh said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said Wednesday he is considering buying used Boeing aircraft \u2014 perhaps from an overseas seller \u2014 to use as Air Force One when he's aboard, as he fumes over the U.S. plane-maker's delays in producing two specially modified ones for presidential use.",
      "Speaking to reporters aboard one of the two nearly 35-year-old Boeing 747-200 aircraft in current use, Trump said, \u201cWe\u2019re looking at alternatives, because it\u2019s taking Boeing too long.\u201d",

And sending out a round of checks \u2014 similar to the stimulus payments distributed by Trump and then President Joe Biden during the pandemic \u2014 could fuel inflation, economists warn, though White House officials dismiss that concern.",
      "With the annual budget deficit at $1.8 trillion last year and Trump proposing extensive tax cuts, there will also be significant pressure to use all the savings to reduce that deficit, rather than pass on part of it.",
      "Here's what to know about the proposal:",
      "James Fishback, founder of investment firm Azoria Partners which he launched at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, promoted the idea Tuesday on X, formerly known as Twitter, prompting Musk to respond that he would \u201ccheck with the president.\u201d Fishback said there have also been \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d conversations about the issue with White House officials.",
      "Musk has estimated that his Department of Government Efficiency has cut $55 billion so far \u2014 a tiny fraction of the $6.8 trillion federal budget. But DOGE\u2019s public statements so far haven't verified the presumed savings, and its claims that tens of millions of dead people are fraudulently receiving Social Security have been disproven.",
      "Fishback supports having the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office determine how much DOGE saved. If DOGE cuts $500 billion by July 2026, he said, then the checks would be $1,250, rather than $5,000.",
      "\u201cWe uncovered enormous waste, fraud and abuse,\u201d Fishback said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cAnd we are going to make good and pay restitution and then rewrite the social contract between the taxpayer and the federal government.\u201d",
      "Fishback supports sending out checks, rather than using all the money to reduce the deficit, because it would encourage Americans to seek out wasteful government spending \u201cin their communities, and report it to DOGE.\u201d",
      "OK, let\u2019s slow down. According to the proposal, DOGE must first complete its work, slated to be done by July 2026. Once that happens, one-fifth of any savings could be distributed later that year to the roughly 79 million households that pay income taxes. About 40% of Americans don\u2019t pay such taxes, so they wouldn\u2019t get a check.",
      "Color most economists and budget experts skeptical that its focus on \u201cwaste, fraud, and abuse\u201d can actually reduce government spending by much. Budget-cutters from both parties have sought to eliminate \u201cwaste\u201d \u2014 which doesn't have much of a political constituency \u2014 for decades, with little success in reducing the deficit.",
      "One of the biggest moves by the Trump administration so far has been to fire tens of thousands of government workers, but such changes aren't likely to produce big savings.",
      "\u201cOnly a small share of total spending goes to federal employees,\u201d said Douglas Elmendorf, former director of the Congressional Budget Office. \u201cThe big money is in federal benefits and in federal taxes and those are not in DOGE\u2019s purview.\u201d",
      "In November, John DiIulio Jr., a political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote in an essay for the Brookings Institution that \"eliminating the entire federal civilian workforce would leave in place about 95% of all federal spending and the $34 trillion national debt.\u2019\u2019 DiIulio noted that government contractors and nonprofits that receive government funds now employ three times as many people as the federal government's 2.2 million employees.",
      "Trump and his economists blame Biden's $1,200 stimulus checks, distributed in the spring of 2021, for fueling the worst spike in inflation in four decades. Yet they maintain that sending checks stemming from reduced government spending wouldn't boost inflation.",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the White House's National Economic Council, said Thursday that since the money would have been spent by the government anyway, having it spent by consumers would be a wash. Biden and Trump's stimulus checks during the pandemic were deficit-financed, which can be more inflationary.",
      "But Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab, and an economist in the Biden White House, said that more government checks are \u201cthe last thing we need economically right now.\u201d",
      "The U.S. unemployment rate is now much lower than in 2021, Tedeschi said, which means that businesses could struggle to hire enough workers to meet the additional demand created by a round of checks. Worker shortages can push up prices.",
      "Yet some Democrats agree with Hassett, but for different reasons.",
      "\"I can\u2019t imagine they\u2019d be inflationary because I can\u2019t imagine they\u2019d be big enough,\u2019\u2019 said Elaine Kamarck, senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution.",
      "Kamarck, who worked with Vice President Al Gore to cut government waste in the Clinton administration, dismissed the DOGE dividend as \u201cridiculous.\"",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no money there, and certainly not enough money to make a big contribution to taxpayers,\" she said. \u201cThe guy just says things,\" she added, referring to Musk."

      "U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy says he saw no appetite for peace from Russia in Ukraine after listening to a speech by Russia\u2019s top diplomat at a tense Group of 20 meeting in South Africa",
      "JOHANNESBURG -- JOHANNESBURG (AP) \u2014 U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said he saw no appetite for peace from Russia in Ukraine after listening to a speech by Russia's top diplomat at a tense Group of 20 meeting in South Africa on Thursday.",
      "Lammy was speaking to reporters after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov addressed other senior diplomats in a closed-door session at the G20 foreign ministers meeting in Johannesburg.",
      "\"I have to say when I listened to what the Russians and what Lavrov have just said in the chamber this afternoon, I don\u2019t see an appetite to really get to that peace,\u201d Lammy said.",
      "Lammy said Lavrov left his seat in the meeting room when it was Lammy's turn to speak. No details of Lavrov's speech were released.",
      "The two-day G20 gathering on Thursday and Friday comes days after landmark bilateral talks between the United States and Russia over ending the war in Ukraine. Those talks sidelined Washington\u2019s European allies and Ukraine, who weren\u2019t involved.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump has further upended the West\u2019s position by criticizing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and falsely blaming Ukraine for the full-scale invasion by Russia. The war\u2019s third anniversary is next week.",
      "\u201cAt the moment, we\u2019ve had talks effectively about talks,\" Lammy said. \u201cWe\u2019ve not got anywhere near a negotiated settlement.\"",
      "In his own speech, which was released by the U.K. Foreign Office, Lammy criticized Russia for what he called \u201cTsarist imperialism.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou know, mature countries learn from their colonial failures and their wars, and Europeans have had much to learn over the generations and the centuries,\u201d Lammy said, according to the transcript from the U.K. Foreign Office. \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid to say that Russia has learned nothing.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was hoping to hear some sympathy for the innocent victims of the aggression. I was hoping to hear some readiness to seek a durable peace. What I heard was the logic of imperialism dressed up as a realpolitik, and I say to you all, we should not be surprised, but neither should we be fooled.\u201d",
      "Lammy referred to Lavrov's speech as \u201cthe Russian gentleman\u2019s tired fabrications.\u201d",
      "Tensions at the meeting were underlined when a photo opportunity for the foreign ministers to pose together for pictures was canceled with no reason given.",
      "The United Kingdom, France, Germany and the European Union have all pledged continued support for Ukraine and were expected to reinforce that position at the G20 meeting.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who led those talks with Lavrov in Saudi Arabia this week, was a high-profile absentee from the meeting. Rubio boycotted amid U.S. tensions with host South Africa over some of its policies, which the Trump administration has labeled anti-American. The U.S. was represented by Dana Brown, its acting ambassador to South Africa.",
      "The G20 is made up of 19 of the world's major economies, the European Union and the African Union. Others attending the meeting in South Africa included EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot, who repeated France's condemnation of Russia in an op-ed published by several media outlets.",
      "The Russian Foreign Ministry did release details of a bilateral meeting Lavrov held with China's Wang. Afterwards, Lavrov said Russia's relations with China \"have become and remain an increasingly significant factor in stabilizing the international situation and preventing it from sliding into total confrontation,\u201d according to a statement from the ministry.",
      "The G20 is supposed to bring developed and developing countries together to foster global cooperation. But the grouping often struggles to reach any meaningful consensus because of the disparate interests of the U.S., Europe, Russia and China. Cooperation was further undermined by Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.",
      "South Africa holds the G20's rotating presidency this year and in a speech opening the meeting, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said that it was an opportunity for the G20 \u201cto engage in serious dialogue\u201d against a backdrop of geopolitical tensions and war, climate change, pandemics and energy and food insecurity.",
      "\"There is a lack of consensus among major powers, including in the G20, on how to respond to these issues,\u201d Ramaphosa said.",
      "Rubio's decision to boycott and his pledge to also skip the main G20 summit in South Africa in November threatens to further undermine the G20's effectiveness.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also said that he won't attend a G20 finance ministers meeting in South Africa next week because of commitments in Washington, which many saw as another indication of Trump's indifference to international collaboration in favor of his \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy.",

      "Etihad attributed its higher profit to increased passenger numbers, a recovery in its cargo operations and cutting its costs. It flew 18.5 million passengers in 2024, up 32%. Its cargo revenues for the year were $1.1 billion, up 24%.",
      "\u201cThese results are testament to the dedication of our people who have worked together for a purpose: delivering our strategy,\" CEO Antonoaldo Neves said in a statement. \u201cLooking ahead, I am confident we will continue to be a financially strong airline delivering extraordinary customer experiences, fulfilling our shareholders' mandate and contributing to the long-term prosperity and success of the UAE.\u201d",

      "A judge has approved an emergency plan to keep Britain\u2019s largest water company afloat and averted a possible temporary government takeover",
      "LONDON -- A judge approved an emergency plan Tuesday to keep Britain\u2019s largest water company afloat, averting the possibility of a temporary government takeover.",
      "Thames Water, which serves 16 million customers in and around London, was seeking court approval for about 3 billion pounds ($3.8 billion) in rescue loans to prevent it from being nationalized when it runs out of cash next month.",
      "Justice Thomas Leech ruled in the High Court in London that the company's restructuring proposal was a better alternative for the public than having Thames Water become insolvent and come under government administration, or a competing plan by a small group of investors.",
      "\u201cThere is a public policy in favor of rescuing the Thames Water Group and giving the market a chance to agree a permanent restructuring plan before the government is forced to fund a special administrator,\" Leech said.",
      "Leech gave permission to appeal to the smaller group of creditors who had proposed a plan that they said would be cheaper and a member of Parliament pushing for a government takeover.",
      "Without the funding, Thames Water would run out of money next month, which could force the government to temporarily take the reins. Both the government and Thames Water said water would continue flowing to customers regardless of what happens.",
      "The decision was applauded by Thames Water Chairman Adrian Montague as a \u201csignificant milestone\u201d to strengthen the company's finances.",
      "Thames Water has been the focus of criticism from consumers and politicians who say the company was the author of its own misfortune, paying overly generous dividends to investors and high salaries and bonuses to executives while failing to invest in pipelines, pumps and reservoirs.",
      "Company executives say the fault lies with regulators who kept bills too low for too long, starving the company of the cash it needed to fund improvements.",
      "Thames Water and the industry that manages water and wastewater services have been the subject of nationwide disgust and outrage over rampant sewage spills in rivers and along the coast.",
      "\u201cThis national scandal is a disaster for Thames Water billpayers and the environment,\" said Charles Watson, chairman of River Action, an environmental group. \u201cInstead of recognizing now is the time for a special administration of Thames Water, the decision saddles customers with the responsibility for funding billions of junk-rated debt while its executives, investors and shareholders escape responsibility.\"",
      "Ofwat, which regulates water companies in England and Wales, in December approved a 35% increase in Thames Water\u2019s consumer charges over the next five years. The company argued that bills needed to rise by 53% in order to finance needed projects and provide the financial returns necessary to attract investors.",
      "The company faces massive penalties for sewage discharges, including a fine of more than 100 million pounds ($126 million) by Ofwat in August for failing to manage its wastewater treatment.",
      "Leech had been considering competing proposals to provide credit to the cash-strapped utility \u2014 one from Thames Water and a second supported by a smaller group that claimed the company's plan was too expensive and favored bigger investors. Creditors holding most of the company\u2019s debt backed the company deal.",
      "Critics of the plan said the high interest rate \u2014 9.75% \u2014 would enrich creditors who are making the loans, a point noted by the judge.",
      "\u201cThe costs of finance and adviser fees in the present case are very high. Indeed, they might be described as eye-watering,\u201d Leech said. \u201c50% of the scheduled loans go round in a circle and back into the pockets of the plan creditors.\u201d",
      "Still, Leech said the alternative of government administration, which he said was preferable to the so-called Plan B, wasn't as attractive as the company plan.",
      "Charlie Maynard, a member of Parliament from the Liberal Democrat party who had argued in court for the government takeover, said he planned to appeal the ruling, insisting that the short-term bailout wasn't in the long-term interest.",
      "\u201cThis restructuring is simply throwing good money after bad,\" Maynard said. \u201cThe money from our bills which is being spent on interest repayments is desperately needed to repair water infrastructure, improve customer service and clean up our rivers.\u201d"

      "Johor in Malaysia is being transformed by the construction of giant data centers",
      "JOHOR BAHRU, Malaysia -- Winson Lau has always had contingency plans. But he wasn't prepared for data centers.",
      "Lau relies on water and electricity to operate his thriving export business in Malaysia\u2019s Johor province, where he raises a kaleidoscope of tropical fish in rows of aquariums, including albino fish with red spots that can fetch up to $10,000 from collectors. His contingency plans in the event of an outage involve an intricate system of purifying wastewater through friendly bacteria and an alarm system to quickly switch to backup power.",
      "But these measures can\u2019t compete with the gigantic, power-guzzling and thirsty data centers being built in Johor. The province is on track to have at least 1.6 gigawatts of data centers at any given moment from nearly nothing in 2019, making it the fastest-growing data center market in Southeast Asia, according to a report published in April.",
      "Data centers are large, windowless buildings filled with racks of computers that need lots of electricity. To prevent overheating, they rely on energy-intensive air conditioning systems using pumped water. Increasingly used by tech companies for running artificial intelligence systems, the power demand from future facilities in Malaysia may rise to over 5 gigawatts by 2035, according to researchers at Malaysia\u2019s Kenanga Investment Bank. This is more than half of Malaysia\u2019s entire renewable capacity in 2023.",
      "Over 95% of the energy available to Malaysia in 2022 was from fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency. The country is now fifth-largest exporter of liquefied natural gas globally. And with planned renewable projects, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said in September that the country was \u201cconfident of a surplus of energy\u201d to fuel large projects and keep exporting.",
      "But Lau doesn't fancy the chances of his homegrown business competing against the foreign-funded behemoths for energy. Even without data centers, Malaysia is susceptible to power interruptions because of storms, including one that lasted 30 minutes last year and killed 300,000 fish, costing Lau over $1 million. He worries that data centers would result in longer outages.",
      "To survive, he is moving to Thailand and already scouting potential locations for a new fish farm.",
      "\u201cBig data center is coming and there is shortage of power,\" he said. \"It\u2019ll be crazy.\u201d",
      "Malaysia is betting that potential economic growth from data centers justifies the risk. Once touted as an Asian tiger on the cusp of becoming rich, its industries shrunk in the late 1990s after the Asian financial crisis. It has since languished in the middle-income trap. Data centers, the government hopes, will modernize its economy and indirectly create thousands of high-paying jobs.",
      "But experts worry that Malaysia, and others like Vietnam, Indonesia and India vying for billion-dollar investments from tech giants, may be overstating data centers' transformative capabilities that also come at a price: Data centers gobble up land, water and electricity while creating far fewer jobs than they promise. Most data centers provide 30 to 50 permanent jobs while the larger ones create 200 jobs at most, according to a report by the American nonprofit Good Jobs First.",
      "Add to this the rapid increase in power and water use and some experts like Sofia Scasserra, who researches digital economies at the Amsterdam-based think tank Transnational Institute, said that tech companies exploiting resources in poorer countries while extracting data from their populations to get rich is akin to \u201cdigital colonialism.\u201d She compared data extraction to silver mining in Bolivia, which enriched colonial Spain but left nothing behind for Latin America.",
      "\u201cThey are extracting data in the same way. Data doesn\u2019t even leave (behind) taxes,\u201d she said.",
      "Indeed, only a small portion of Malaysia's data center capacity is actually for Malaysian users. Through a network of submarine cables that fans out into the world, they service East Asia, China and Europe. And the data centers themselves are run by foreign companies like America\u2019s Equinix and Microsoft as well as Chinese competitor GDS Holdings that works with tech giants like Alibaba.",
      "These data centers are also on the front lines of AI competition between the U.S. and China. Shortly before he left office, U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s administration proposed new rules that would limit exports of advanced AI chips made by U.S. companies like Nvidia, part of a strategy to deprive China and other U.S. adversaries from gaining access to AI technology through data centers in places likes Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Although it\u2019s unclear if the Trump administration will retain the policy, which hasn\u2019t yet taken effect, GDS Holdings saw its stock drop more than 18% on the day of the announcement.",
      "For now, artificial intelligence is driving the hunger for even more data centers, with tech companies seeking out bigger \u2014 and cheaper \u2014 sites worldwide as a part of a \u201cglobal strategy,\u201d said Rangu Salgame, chairman and CEO of Singapore\u2019s Princeton Digital Group, which is building a 170-megawatt site in Johor. Data centers larger than 40 megawatt typically need land the size of seven football fields \u2014 about enough power for 36,000 American homes, according to data center service provider Stream Data Centers.",
      "That\u2019s costly to build in rich nations like the U.S., which over time has built more data centers than any other country but where land comes at a high price. Enter Malaysia, with its inexpensive land, excess power capacity and tax incentives. The country was the fastest growing data center market in Asia Pacific in the first half of 2024, according to global real estate firm Cushman and Wakefield. This makes Malaysia the eighth-largest data center market in terms of operations and the fifth-largest behind China, India, Japan and Australia when accounting for projects already in the pipeline.",
      "Globally Malaysia ranks 14th in terms of operational capacity \u2014 still smaller than Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, Paris and Dublin \u2014 but it is on track to be among the top 10 markets in five to seven years, according to Pritesh Swamy, who heads research on data centers in Asia for the real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield.",
      "\u201cWe are talking about a region that really grew at a pace that nowhere in the world has seen,\u201d Salgame said.",
      "Next door to Malaysia is Singapore, which paused the construction of new data centers in 2019. The moratorium was over concerns that the energy-guzzling infrastructure was straining the tiny country\u2019s limited resources. In 2019, data centers consumed 7% of the total electricity in the city-state that imports both power and water while aiming to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. They have been trying to build data centers sustainably since 2022, when the moratorium ended.",
      "In the meantime, Malaysia has stepped in to fill the void, attracting investments of over $31 billion \u2014 three times the investments for 2023 \u2014 in the first 10 months of 2024, according to research by real estate firm Knight Frank. Johor already has 22 mostly foreign data centers spanning over 21 hectares, according to the research firm Baxtel. That's the equivalent of nearly 40 football fields, although not all of the data centers are operational.",
      "The data centers that are running look anonymous from the outside. But they can be identified by the tell-tale signs of barbed wire fences, CCTV cameras and patrolling security guards. Elsewhere, a thicket of cranes and workers operating construction machinery is transforming the landscape in the sleepy province.",
      "Salgame said that he hoped data centers could accelerate clean energy growth and experts like Putra Adhiguna of the Jakarta-based think tank Energy Shift Institute agreed that this could happen, but warned that the sheer volume of unforeseen, future demand complicates the transition.",
      "\u201cAdd data centers on top of that, it just becomes much more challenging,\u201d he said.",
      "Tropical Malaysia is warmer than the countries that were initially preferred by data centers, including Ireland, and would require more water and power for cooling, said Alex de Vries, the founder of Digiconomist, a research company studying the unintended consequences of digital trends. He said that these companies are moving to new countries after their promises of economic growth were found to be \u201cempty.\" And while new solar or wind farms can be built faster than other forms of energy, data centers need a lot of electricity from the get-go.",
      "\u201cThese big tech companies are trying to distract you from the really simple math,\u201d he said.",
      "Malaysia acknowledges that the energy demand from data centers is \u201csubstantial\u201d but believes that Johor\u2019s rise as a \u201cdata center powerhouse\u201d will make it a \u201ckey player in Southeast Asia\u2019s digital ecosystem,\u201d said Malaysian Investment, Trade and Industry minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz in an email. He added that Malaysia was writing efficiency guidelines for data centers and has a policy to let them buy clean energy directly from producers.",
      "But concerns are rising among residents about potential water shortages in the future \u2014 echoing the concerns of other developing countries like Chile. Malaysia, like much of Southeast Asia, is at risk of extreme weather including drought, according to a 2022 U.N. climate change report. Francis Hutchinson, an analyst at Singapore\u2019s ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, said that Johor has faced recent disruptions and new stressors, like a growing population and water parks to boost tourism, could exacerbate the crisis.",
      "\u201cWater, more than power, is a potential issue,\u201d he said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The heads of four major labor unions on Wednesday called on President Donald Trump to boost American shipbuilding and enforce tariffs and other \u201cstrong penalties\u201d against China for its increasing dominance in that sphere.",
      "The presidents of the United Steelworkers, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, International Brotherhood of Boilermakers and International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers argue that China's efforts have hurt American workers and national security.",
      "In the letter obtained by The Associated Press, they urged Trump to \u201cimpose tough penalties against vessels built according to the plans, policies, and actions of the Chinese Communist Party and to adopt complementary policies that rebuild America's shipbuilding capacity and workforce.\u201d",
      "Last year under President Joe Biden, the unions filed a petition seeking to address China\u2019s shipbuilding under Section 301 of the 1974 U.S. Trade Act, hoping to start a process by which tariffs and other measures could be enacted.",
      "The letter notes China manufactured more than 1,000 ocean-going vessels in 2023, while the United States made fewer than 10 ships. It adds that the Chinese shipbuilding industry received more than $100 billion in government support from 2010 to 2018, such that Chinese shipyards accounted for the majority of worldwide orders last year.",
      "\u201cAs a shipyard worker myself, out of Bath Iron Works in Maine, I have seen firsthand the crippling impacts of China\u2019s predatory actions on our domestic shipbuilding industry,\u201d Brian Bryant, the machinists and aerospace workers union president, said in a separate statement. \u201cFor decades, we\u2019ve seen everything from layoffs to shipyard closures to atrophy of our domestic shipbuilding industrial base.",
      "Trump has made control of the Panama Canal and resetting the global terms of trade with tariffs a key priority. But many of his concerns have been directed at U.S. allies such as Canada, Mexico and the European Union, while he has imposed an additional 10% tariff on imports from China due to its role in making the opioid fentanyl.",
      "In January, Trump floated the possibility of more shipbuilding in an interview with Hugh Hewitt, the conservative radio talk show host.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t build ships anymore,\" Trump said. \"We want to get that started. And maybe we\u2019ll use allies, also, in terms of building ships. We might have to.\u201d",
      "In a Fox News Channel interview that aired Tuesday night, Trump noted the decline in American shipbuilding and indicated he wanted that to change.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t build the way we used to build. Yeah, we used to build like a ship a day, and now to build a ship is like a big deal,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to get this country back on track.\u201d",

      "South Africa\u2019s budget announcement by the finance minister has been abruptly canceled and rescheduled for next month over a dispute among parties in the governing coalition",
      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- The South African government's annual presentation of its budget was abruptly canceled Wednesday and rescheduled for next month over a dispute among parties in the governing coalition.",
      "The finance minister's budget speech normally takes place in February. Parliament Speaker Thoko Didiza said it was the first time that the presentation had been canceled over such a disagreement in the 31 years of South Africa\u2019s democracy after the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994.",
      "South Africa has a 10-party coalition in government after the long-ruling African National Congress, or ANC, lost its majority in an election last year for the first time since apartheid ended. That means it cannot pass the budget without support from other parties in Parliament.",
      "The Democratic Alliance, the country\u2019s second biggest party, said the budget postponement was over a 2% increase in value-added tax proposed by the ANC. The DA said in a statement that the tax increase \u201cwould have broken the back of our economy.\u201d",
      "The budget delay came just over a week after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered U.S. aid and assistance to South Africa to be cut over a contentious land law. The move by Trump was expected to put pressure on South Africa\u2019s government to find funds to plug gaps, especially in the public health service. South Africa was already impacted by Trump\u2019s 90-day global freeze on U.S. aid.",
      "Africa\u2019s most advanced economy has barely grown in recent years. Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana told reporters that the government was facing fiscal challenges.",
      "\u201cDo we borrow more, and what are the implications of that?\u201d Godongwana said. \u201cDo we continue cutting expenditure? What are the implications of that? Do we raise tax and what are the implications of that?\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is general agreement that in the current environment, we need to find ways of funding our priorities.\u201d",
      "The opposition Umkhonto we Sizwe Party said the government\u2019s failure to propose a budget was proof that \u201cthis country has no leadership.\"",
      "Most recently the ANC and the DA disagreed over the passing of the Land Expropriation Act, which empowers the government to seize private land for public benefit.",
      "The parties have also fallen out over an education bill, which would give the government more control over white minority language schools.",
      "The Black Business Council, which advocates for Black-owned businesses' inclusion in the country's economy, has cautioned that the budget postponement might cause uncertainty among investors.",
      "\u201cWe are busy dealing with the Trump issue, and we are working on sending envoys to the world to say (South Africa) is intact, but when you have something like this that you can control, and you just basically throw your arms in the air, it doesn\u2019t bode very well for South Africa and for the government,\" said the council's CEO Kganki Matabane.",

      "Car companies are always introducing compelling new models, making it harder to decide if you should get a new car, truck or SUV now or wait to see what else might be available within the year",
      "Ready to buy a new car? Well, you might want to wait because there are some cool and compelling models coming soon to a showroom near you. They range from a retro-themed performance sedan with a traditional gasoline engine to a rugged off-road SUV powered by electricity. There\u2019s even a pickup truck that offers a gas engine and electric propulsion simultaneously, which could be a game changer. Edmunds\u2019 editors highlight what they think will be the most interesting vehicles for car shoppers coming out later this year.",
      "Maybe you\u2019ve seen the Charger Daytona R/T, Dodge\u2019s new electric performance coupe that draws design inspiration from the classic 1969 Charger. But what if you don\u2019t want an EV? And what if you need four doors? Good news is on the horizon, and it takes the form of the 2026 Charger Sixpack four-door sedan equipped with a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline six-cylinder gas engine.",
      "Dubbed the \u201cHurricane,\u201d the engine makes 420 horsepower in standard-output specification, more than the 5.7-liter V8 available in the old Charger. We also expect Dodge will follow it up later with a high-output engine making 550 horsepower.",
      "The Honda Prelude was a showcase of Honda design and engineering in the 1980s and 1990s. But after the 2001 model year, it disappeared from the automaker\u2019s lineup. A quarter of a century later, it\u2019s finally coming back.",
      "The all-new 2026 Honda Prelude will be a hybrid. We expect Honda will use the hybrid powertrain that it uses in the hybrid versions of the CR-V and Civic. Honda hasn\u2019t said how much power it will make or what kind of fuel economy you can expect. However, the Prelude will come with a Honda S+ Shift feature that the company says will make the it more fun to drive than your typical hybrid.",
      "With few exceptions, most electric SUVs are best driven on the pavement instead of off-road. Jeep plans to change that with the upcoming 2026 Recon, a bold and boxy EV with promising trail-rated off-roading capability and a similar open-air driving experience to a Wrangler.",
      "Jeep recently featured the Recon in a commercial starring Harrison Ford. Beyond that, however, the company has provided few details. We don\u2019t know how much range the Recon will have or how much it will cost. But we do know it will come with all-terrain tires, skid plates, a power-opening top, and removable windows and doors. And with trail guide maps embedded into the infotainment system and electronic locking axles, the Jeep Recon should be ready to rock on the path less traveled.",
      "Boasting one of the most appropriate vehicle names in history, the Ram Ramcharger is a full-size pickup truck equipped with electric motors and a battery pack. So far, that\u2019s just like a Ford F-150 Lightning. The trick is that it also has a gasoline-fueled V6 engine to eliminate the problem of range anxiety.",
      "Ram\u2019s range-extending powertrain solution sounds complex, but there is a simple explanation of how it works. When the battery is out of charge, the gas engine serves as a backup generator, allowing the Ramcharger to travel an estimated 690 miles before requiring electricity or gasoline to continue the journey. In theory, you can drive the Ramcharger without ever visiting an EV charging station, or you can skip traditional gas stations altogether.",
      "Better yet, there aren\u2019t any downsides when it comes to capability. Ram says the Ramcharger can tow up to 14,000 pounds and zoom to 60 mph in 4.4 seconds.",
      "Current Rivian trucks and SUVs are expensive, but the upcoming R2 SUV addresses that with a target price of $45,000. Smaller than the existing R1S but equipped with the same rugged, high-tech good looks, the Rivian R2 holds five people and travels more than 300 miles on a full battery. It comes with all-wheel drive and a healthy 9.8 inches of maximum ground clearance to help you out when going off-road.",
      "With rear vent windows and back glass that powers down into the tailgate, the Rivian R2 will give the Jeep Recon some competition. Just remember the R2\u2019s doors don\u2019t come off like the Recon\u2019s. As for timing, it should be available in the first half of 2026.",
      "We like these five upcoming models for their nostalgic appeal, technological innovation, or promise of fun no matter where you\u2019re going or what you\u2019re doing. At least one of them, the Jeep Recon, delivers all three of those traits.",

      "Inflation in the U.K. rose to a 10-month high in January, an increase that will likely diminish expectations of rapid interest rate reductions from the Bank of England",
      "LONDON -- Inflation in the U.K. rose to a 10-month high in January, official figures showed Wednesday, an increase that will likely diminish expectations of rapid interest rate reductions from the Bank of England.",
      "The Office for National Statistics said inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index, rose to 3% in the year to January, up from the equivalent 2.5% rate the month before.",
      "The spike, which took inflation further above the bank's target of 2%, was largely due to increases in airfares, food casts and private school fees in the wake of the new Labour government's decision to impose a sales tax.",
      "Economists had anticipated an increase to 2.8% but the scale of the spike has come as a big surprise and will likely cause concern among rate-setters at the central bank at a time when they are voicing worries about about the U.K.'s tepid economic growth.",
      "Earlier this month, the bank cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.50%, its third reduction in six months, as it halved its 2025 growth forecast for the U.K. to 0.75%.",
      "If growth remains that modest, it will be hugely disappointing news for the U.K.\u2019s new Labour government, which has made growth its number one mission as it will boost living standards and generate funds for cash-starved public services. With growth proving elusive, the party\u2019s popularity has fallen sharply since its election victory in July.",
      "The government will no doubt be hoping that the central bank helps it out by cutting interest rates further as it will contribute to lower mortgage rates and cheaper loans, though reducing the returns offered to savers.",
      "Most economists think that inflation will rise further in the coming months as a result of higher domestic energy bills but start to trend lower in the second half of the year, which will give -policymakers room to cut interest rates again \u2014 but maybe not as many times as previously thought.",
      "\u201cAnother rate cut in March looks pretty unlikely, with the bank continuing with its gradual pace of easing for now,\u201d said Luke Bartholomew, deputy chief economist at abrdn, formerly Aberdeen Asset Management. \"But any speeding up of the pace of rate cuts in the second half of the year will depend on inflation pressures heading back towards 2%\u201d"

      "President Donald Trump says his administration will ensure a major natural gas pipeline in Alaska gets built",
      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- Since his election, President Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed support for a major natural gas pipeline in Alaska \u2014 comments that have drawn fresh attention to a project that's floundered for years despite support from state leaders.",
      "Trump mentioned the pipeline at a news conference with Japan\u2019s prime minister earlier this month, drawing praise from Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy and U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, both Republicans. As proposed, the nearly 810-mile (1,300-kilometer) pipeline would funnel gas from Alaska\u2019s vast North Slope to port, with an eye largely on exports to Asian countries.",
      "Critics, however, see this as a repackaged version of a decades-old effort that has struggled to gain traction. Hurdles include the cost \u2014 an estimated $44 billion for the pipeline and related infrastructure \u2014 competition from other projects and questions about its economic feasibility. One state senator said Alaska has put around $1 billion over the years into trying to get a pipeline built.",
      "It\u2019s natural gas that\u2019s been cooled to a liquid form for shipping and storage. Natural gas, a fossil fuel, is extracted from underground.",
      "The Alaska project calls for a pipeline from the gas fields of the North Slope to south-central Alaska. A liquefaction facility in Nikiski, southwest of Anchorage, would process and export the liquefied natural gas.",
      "Trump, following his election, said his administration would ensure the project gets built \u201cto provide affordable energy to Alaska and allies all over the world.\u201d He highlighted it as a priority in an Alaska-specific executive order aimed at spurring resource development he signed on his first day in office. And during a recent news conference with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba of Japan, Trump touted the Alaska project's relative proximity to that country and said there were talks \u201cabout a joint venture of some type.\u201d He did not elaborate.",
      "Japan's Foreign Ministry, in a statement, said the meeting between the leaders \u201cwas carried out in a way that would be beneficial to both sides and confirmed that the two nations will cooperate bilaterally toward strengthening energy security, including increasing LNG exports to Japan.\u201d It did not specifically reference the Alaska project.",
      "Trump was a booster of the project during his first term. In 2017, he was there for the signing in Beijing of an agreement between then-Alaska Gov. Bill Walker and representatives of Chinese companies that called for the parties to work together on elements of the project. That effort ultimately fizzled: Walker, an independent, left office in 2018, and his successor, Dunleavy, took the project in a different direction. The project has a history of new governors taking a different tack than their predecessors; Walker did it, too.",
      "Walker called Trump\u2019s recent actions significant: \u201cWhat he has done is a tremendous boost to the awareness of the project worldwide.\u201d",
      "Currently, there is no way to bring Alaska's large gas reserves to market. The focus for decades by major companies on the North Slope has been on producing more profitable oil. The 800-mile (1,280-kilometer) trans-Alaska oil pipeline \u2014 which began operating in 1977 \u2014 is the state's economic lifeline. Gas that occurs with deposits of oil is reinjected into the fields.",
      "Changing markets and costs have been major obstacles, too.",
      "State leaders are facing the likelihood that Alaska could have to import gas to help meet the needs of its most populous region due to production constraints in the aging Cook Inlet basin in south-central Alaska, hundreds of miles (kilometers) from the North Slope. Cook Inlet is Alaska's oldest producing oil and gas basin, dating to the 1950s.",
      "Even a year ago, the idea of importing gas was widely seen by lawmakers as a humiliating possibility. But it's now being met with resignation and hopes by some that it might simply be a short-term solution until a gas line is built.",
      "Alaska House Majority Leader Chuck Kopp, a Republican, said Alaskans \u201cneed to be hopeful\" and cautioned against negative thinking.",
      "\u201cWe need to watch how we talk because it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and an energy project of this size, if it was successful, would be transformative to the economic security of our state,\u201d he said.",
      "Roger Marks, an oil and gas economist in Alaska, said he can't see the pipeline project happening and said more energy should be devoted to preparing for possible imports. \u201cCreating these false expectations has just been a big distraction from what needs to be done,\u201d he said.",

The participation will be limited to the Charter of Cooperation, a permanent forum for OPEC and OPEC+ countries to discuss industry-related issues. The South American country will not participate in decisions.",
      "Silveira called the charter merely \u201ca forum for discussing strategies among oil-producing countries. We should not be ashamed of being oil producers. Brazil needs to grow, develop and create income and jobs.\u201d",
      "President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva began his third term in 2023 touting himself as an environmental defender, and has worked to reduce deforestation in the Amazon rainforest and to protect Indigenous rights.

      "LUBBOCK, Texas -- The Republican attorney general in Texas wants the NCAA to take its transgender policy a step further and require gender testing for athletes who compete in women's sports.",
      "AG Ken Paxon filed a lawsuit in December in state district court and on Thursday added a filing that seeks a court order requiring gender screening for athletes and an injunction intended to prevent the NCAA from \u201cfalsely and deceptively claiming that only biological women may participate in female-specific competitions.\u201d",
      "Earlier this month, the NCAA changed its participation policy for transgender athletes, limiting competition in women's sports to athletes who were assigned female at birth. The move came a day after President Donald Trump signed an executive order intended to ban transgender athletes from women's and girls' sports.",
      "Paxton doesn't think the NCAA move goes far enough because, saying the NCAA has no mechanism for screening the sex of athletes.",
      "\u201cIn practice, the NCAA\u2019s lack of sex-screening has allowed (and will continue to allow) biological men to surreptitiously participate in \u2018women\u2019s\u2019 sports categories,\u201d the lawsuit claims.",
      "Over the past year, transgender athletes have become a target of critics who say their participation in women\u2019s sports is unfair and a potential safety risk. The topic became a major talking point in Trump\u2019s re-election campaign even though there is believed to be a very small number of transgender athletes; NCAA President Charlie Baker in December said he knew of only 10 transgender athletes out of more than 500,000 across the NCAA.",
      "The NCAA\u2019s revised policy permits athletes assigned male at birth to practice with women\u2019s teams and receive benefits such as medical care. An athlete assigned female at birth who has begun hormone therapy can practice with a women\u2019s team but cannot compete on a women\u2019s team without risking the team\u2019s eligibility for championships.",
      "Paxton also said the NCAA has left \u201cample opportunity for biological men to alter their birth records and participate in women\u2019s sports,\u201d a claim the organization said is not true.",
      "\u201cThe policy is clear that there are no waivers available, and student-athlete assigned male at birth may not compete on a women\u2019s team with amended birth certificates or other forms of ID,\" the NCAA said in an emailed response to The Associated Press.",
      "Member schools \u2014 there are 1,100 in the NCAA \u2014 are responsible for certifying athlete eligibility for practice and competition. Local, state and federal legislation can supersede NCAA rules.",
      "Paxton's filing refers to last week's announcement by World Athletics that part of its new recommneded guidelines would bring back gender testing, a practice that hasn't been part of track and field since the 1990s. Most of the screenings can be done by swabbing the inside of an athlete's cheek.",

      "Acrobatics and tumbling is one of the NCAA's fastest-growing sports",
      "PITTSBURGH -- Abby McDermott has grown accustomed to the looks she gets whenever she starts talking to someone about her chosen sport. The slight turn of the head. The brief pause in the conversation.",
      "\u201cWhen you say \u2018acrobatics and tumbling,\u2019 especially \u2018acrobatics,\u2019 people think of the circus,\u201d McDermott said with a laugh.",
      "The Duquesne graduate student gets it. It happens a lot. It wasn't that long ago that the former artistic gymnast counted herself among the uninitiated. So she's perfected a shorthand definition designed to turn confusion into curiosity.",
      "\u201cWhen I describe it to people, it's cool but it's sometimes like weird because people are like, \u2018What?\u2019\" McDermott said. \u201cThen you have to do the whole \u2018Well, it\u2019s kind of like gymnastics and kind of like cheerleading but we don't cheer.'\u201d",
      "There are no balance beams or vaulting tables. No pompoms or megaphones. Just a massive foam mat rolled across an arena floor and a few dozen athletes on both sides ready to spend two hours flipping, soaring, yelling and finding joy in something that feels familiar yet is decidedly not.",
      "It began in 2009 with a half-dozen schools searching for a way to incorporate elements of those two well-known disciplines \u2014 gymnastics and cheerleading \u2014 into a showcase for female athletes. Acro, which operates in a similar space with a more traditional cheerleading-centric approach called STUNT, has become one of the fastest-growing collegiate sports in the country.",
      "Membership in the National Collegiate Acrobatics and Tumbling Association has risen from 14 teams a decade ago to over 50 schools representing over 1,200 athletes, including Duquesne, which made its debut earlier this month. The NCAA labeled \u201cacro\u201d an emerging sport in 2020. There's a chance it could be considered for NCAA championship status as early as the 2027-28 academic year.",
      "On the surface, acro's ascension seems sudden and perhaps in lockstep with a spike in interest in women's sports. The reality is it has been hiding in plain sight all along.",
      "There are currently more than 3 million girls participating in cheerleading or gymnastics (or both) in the United States. Only a small fraction, however, move on to compete collegiately.",
      "Enter the NCATA, which promotes acro as an attractive option for athletic departments. With roster sizes that can swell to as large as 50 and low overhead \u2014 the floor mat is the only piece of equipment required \u2014 acro offers schools a chance to be better positioned for Title IX compliance while allowing athletes to extend their careers.",
      "\u201cThere was an unmet need,\u201d said Janell Cook, executive director of the NCATA. \u201cThis came and bridged the gap.\u201d",
      "Duquesne, a Catholic university that sits on a bluff overlooking downtown Pittsburgh, has an undergraduate student population that is well over 60% female. When the school began exploring adding women's sports earlier this decade, the more athletic director Dave Harper looked into acro, the more it appeared to be \u201ca perfect fit.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe goal was to not only have competitive rosters but boost our numbers on the women's sports side,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's aligned well for us.\u201d",
      "Harper hired Michaela Soper \u2014 a former artistic gymnast who transitioned to acro after she broke her back during her senior year of high school \u2014 in the spring of 2023.",
      "Soper cast a wide net over the next year, eventually recruiting a team of 34 athletes (nearly all of them freshmen) from 15 different states. The 120-member Dukes football team, which competes at the FCS level, features players from 18 states.",
      "\u201cShe's gone into places that certainly the Duquesne name is not familiar but now will be, which is fantastic,\" Harper said.",
      "Growing up in the Baltimore suburbs, Soper had her sights set on becoming a college gymnast. An awkward fall on the balance beam scuttled those plans. A few months before graduation, Gannon \u2014 a small private school in Erie, Pennsylvania \u2014 reached out to see if Soper wanted to become part of its fledgling program.",
      "\u201cI kind of thought it was a hoax,\u201d said Soper. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was real because I hadn\u2019t heard of it before.\u201d",
      "She brushed aside her initial skepticism, in part because Gannon made her feel like \u201csomebody actually wants me.\u201d Soper fell in love with the team aspect of a sport that requires trust above all else.",
      "It was much the same for McDermott, by far the most experienced athlete on the Duquesne roster after four years at Glenville State in West Virginia. She's embraced becoming a de facto assistant coach and sounding board for her freshmen-laden team. It wasn't always that way.",
      "\u201cLearning to rely on someone else (in acro) was a big challenge, a big change for me,\" said McDermott. \"But doing it for the person next to me and not just myself really makes me work like 10 times harder.\u201d",
      "It also provided McDermott with an unexpected benefit: improved mental health. She was a gymnast for 15 years before getting into acro. She loved it, sure. Yet it was also an unforgiving and sometimes monotonous grind. Acro provided a jolt.",
      "\u201cGetting to learn a whole new sport, it was frustrating at times,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it was also awesome. Just like on my body, my mind. Everything was so nice and refreshing.\u201d",
      "There are a handful of specific roles on each team, with every athlete wearing a number. \u201cBases\u201d provide support through lifts or by doing backbends that allow teammates to stand on their stomachs (yes, really) while creating pyramids. \u201cTops\u201d can be lifted as high as 10-15 feet in the air and then dismount by flipping or twisting into the arms of \u201cback spots\" (like something you might see at a football game). Tumblers somersault their way from one end of the mat to the other, sometimes in synchronicity with each other.",
      "Meets are broken down into six events. The first five \u2014 compulsory, acro, pyramid, toss and tumbling \u2014 consist of multiple heats, with each heat requiring different elements. Most include at least one member of the team counting out \u201cone, two, three, four\u201d drill sergeant-style to create a tempo designed to keep everyone on time.",
      "Each routine is assigned a specific start value based on its difficulty, with a max of 10.0 like in college gymnastics. The scores are added up as the meet goes along and teams go one at a time, giving it a kind of ebb and flow you might find in a traditional \u201cball\u201d sport.",
      "It ends with the team event, in which 24 athletes spend nearly 3 minutes showcasing the skills highlighted throughout the meet, all of it set to music, not unlike competitive cheerleading.",
      "On the surface, it's a lot. Duquesne did its best during its first-ever meet on Feb. 7 against Gannon, offering a video tutorial between every event to the hundreds in the stands, a mixture of students, alumni and families with young children.",
      "Against a nonstop backbeat of up-tempo music (think Beyonce), the schools went back and forth, every routine ending with hugs and high-fives regardless of the result. Gannon, runner-up to NCATA national champion Baylor last spring, led through four events before the Dukes surged ahead after the tumbling portion.",
      "When Duquesne finished off its inaugural win with a rousing shout of \u201cGo Dukes!\u201d during the team event, Soper \u2014 sporting a red blazer and high heels \u2014 raced to celebrate with the group she reminds regularly is making history one routine at a time.",
      "Maybe some of them didn't know what acro was before Soper approached them. They only knew they didn't want their athletic careers to end, and acro allowed them to pivot.",
      "It's not gymnastics. It's not cheerleading. And it's definitely not the circus.",
      "It is something new. Something uniquely theirs.",
      "\u201cHere you're still able to find a home for yourself and a home that supports and accepts you regardless of what you look like, how talented you are,\u201d Soper said. \u201cThere's going to be a place on the team for athletes that love the sport and are passionate about it.\u201d",

      "A nostalgic time for Phoenix's All-Star forward continues Thursday, when Durant and the Suns play San Antonio in Austin, Texas \u2014 a home game for the Spurs and a homecoming for Durant, since the game brings him back to where he played his one college season with the Longhorns.",
      "\u201cIt does mean a lot to me,\u201d Durant said. \u201cI\u2019m excited that we get to go back to play a regular-season game there. Austin is a place where I kind of started this journey, and to have so many friends and family that are still there from, what, 16, 17 years ago is pretty sweet. So, I appreciate the NBA for setting this up. This is a unique time.\u201d",
      "Durant\u2019s lone season in Austin was 2006-07, and he was college basketball\u2019s best player that year. He averaged 25.8 points and 11.1 rebounds, finishing the season ranked fourth nationally in both of those categories on his way to being selected as player of the year by The Associated Press and a number of other outlets.",
      "He declared for the draft after that season, went No. 2 overall to Seattle in 2007 and the accolades keep piling up. Durant is the only men's player in USA Basketball history to win four Olympic gold medals, he won two championships with Golden State \u2014 returning to the Bay this past weekend after being selected as an All-Star for the 15th time \u2014 and just became the eighth player in NBA history to eclipse the 30,000-point mark.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s an awesome opportunity for himself \u2014 and for the city of Austin to come out and support one of our great players who is still in the prime of his career right now,\" Texas coach Rodney Terry said. \"He's scored over 30,000 points, he's one of the all-time scorers at the next level, one of the all-time scorers at the collegiate level. But to have an opportunity come back where you played collegiately, to play a professional game against one of the best organizations in all of professional sports in the Spurs, you can\u2019t ask for a better scenario.\u201d",
      "This is the third consecutive season where the Spurs have played two home games in Austin, about 75 miles northeast of San Antonio. The Spurs see Austin as part of a mega-region that they've been cultivating for years, even stretching into Mexico \u2014 and this year's home games help break up the annual rodeo road trip. The San Antonio Stock Show and Rodeo typically sends the Spurs on the road for much of February, so this year's games in Austin break up that window.",
      "The Spurs also play in Austin on Friday against Detroit. The Suns got to Austin on Tuesday and one of Durant's first stops was the Longhorns' practice.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to try to roam around the city a little bit,\u201d Durant said this past weekend when asked if he had plans to check out some of his favorite places in Austin. \u201cI don\u2019t have a set schedule, but I\u2019ve got some stuff I want to see.\u201d",
      "Austin is very much a Spurs town; the team's G League affiliate plays there and plenty of fans at the Moody Center on Thursday and Friday will surely be wearing Victor Wembanyama jerseys. But there's going to be a slew of Texas jerseys and Durant garb visible in the crowd on Thursday, for good reason.",
      "\u201cTo have him come back here and be here this week and be around our guys and see our guys, I mean, you can\u2019t ask for anything better than that,\" Terry said. \"A lot of our guys' favorite player is Kevin Durant. Why they chose to come to Texas was Kevin Durant. He's had an incredible impact not only on our basketball program but also on our athletic program as a whole. He\u2019s an incredible ambassador for Texas athletics.\u201d",

      "The loss to the rival Tigers in a 1-vs-2 matchup started a run of seven straight games against ranked opponents to close the regular-season schedule, a withering stretch even by the such-is-life standards of an Southeastern Conference with nine ranked teams. It continues with Wednesday's trip to No. 15 Missouri and Saturday's visit from No. 17 Kentucky to headline the AP Top 25 national schedule.",
      "\u201cIt's not an easy stretch, the last seven games, is probably the hardest seven-game stretch of anybody in the country at any point,\u201d Oats told reporters after the Auburn loss.",
      "\u201cWe've got three home games and three road games left in the last six games of the year. And we've got to bring it.\u201d",
      "Oats is right: no other ranked team has a remaining schedule quite like the Tide.",
      "After this week, Alabama (21-4, 10-2) hosts No. 21 Mississippi State, visits No. 6 Tennessee, hosts No. 2 Florida and then returns the trip to Auburn.",
      "As of Monday afternoon, only one team \u2014 No. 14 Michigan State \u2014 had as many as five ranked teams left on its schedule. In fact, 21 teams in the latest AP Top 25 poll had three or fewer remaining games against ranked opponents.",
      "Or, to put it another way: Alabama has more ranked opponents ahead than No. 3 Duke, No. 10 St. John's, No. 11 Wisconsin, No. 13 Purdue, No. 16 Marquette, No. 18 Clemson, No. 22 Memphis and No. 25 Louisville have combined (four).",
      "Alabama earned the No. 2 overall seed during Saturday's preliminary rankings from the committee that selects the NCAA Tournament's 68-team field. And that schedule resonated with committee chairman Bubba Cunningham when asked about what could come for Alabama.",
      "\u201cThe Alabama schedule that they have in front of them is absolutely incredible,\u201d said Cunningham, North Carolina's athletic director.",
      "The Tide are in line for a 1-seed, and maybe the chance to chase down the Tigers atop the SEC standings.",
      "They've just got to get through the next few weeks on solid footing.",
      "Seventh-ranked Texas A&M joined Auburn in having four ranked teams still ahead. Two come this week, first with Tuesday's trip to Mississippi State and then Saturday's visit from Tennessee.",
      "The Aggies (20-5, 9-3 SEC) rose one spot in Monday's poll to hit the highest mark of the Buzz Williams era, as well as the program's highest ranking since sitting at No. 5 on Christmas Day in 2017.",
      "Michigan State has its own doubleheader against ranked teams this week, including the latest meeting with its instate rival.",
      "The Spartans (20-5, 11-3 Big Ten) host No. 13 Purdue on Tuesday before visiting No. 12 Michigan on Friday. Michigan State won both meetings with Michigan last year, the first season sweep in the series since the Spartans took all three meetings in 2019.",
      "Round 2 of that rivalry comes with the Wolverines visiting East Lansing in the March 9 regular-season finale.",
      "No. 5 Houston is positioned to win the Big 12's regular-season race with a strong finish. The Cougars can clear a significant hurdle with Saturday's visit from No. 8 Iowa State after visiting Arizona State.",
      "The Cougars (21-1, 13-1) entered the week two games up in the loss column on No. 9 Texas Tech and No. 19 Arizona, with the Red Raiders having handed Houston its only league loss this year.",
      "Those teams, by the way, have a rematch at Texas Tech next Monday.",
      "New Mexico was the top vote-getter among unranked teams in Monday's poll. The Lobos (22-4, 14-1 Mountain West Conference) play only once this week, visiting Boise State on Wednesday.",
      "Next up is Saint Mary's, which could lock up the regular-season race in the West Coast Conference. The Gaels (23-4, 13-1) host Portland on Wednesday before visiting second-place Gonzaga (20-7, 11-3) on Saturday.",

      "The U.S. Tennis Association says participation in the sport around the United States rose to 25.7 million players in 2024",
      "Tennis participation in the United States rose to 25.7 million players in 2024, the sport's fifth consecutive year of growth, the U.S. Tennis Association said Wednesday, citing an analysis of numbers drawn from two studies not yet fully released.",
      "The jump of 1.9 million players from 2023's total of 23.8 million participants represents an 8% increase and means one in 12 Americans played tennis last year, the USTA said.",

      "To help reach it, the USTA on Wednesday pledged $10 million in grants in 2025 \u201cto help build, refurbish and extend playable hours on courts across the United States.\u201d That is up from last year's commitment of $1.2 million, which covered more than 500 courts open to the public.",
      "This is all against a backdrop of the surging popularity of pickleball, which has jumped from nearly no presence in the U.S. to more than 13 million Americans over three years, with its participation figures growing more than 200% in that span.",
      "The statistics the USTA touted Wednesday are based on the National Golf Foundation's compilation of data from two surveys that the USTA helps fund, each of 18,000 people aged 6 and over: The Physical Activity Council (PAC) Study on Sports and Physical Activity, and the PLAY study.",
      "Other findings noted by the USTA include:",
      "\u2014 Players under age 25 drove 45% of the growth in tennis participation last year, while those under 35 accounted for more than 60%.",
      "\u2014 There was 26% growth among Black players and 15% among Hispanic players for tennis in 2024.",

      "Bobby Hull's widow says the Hall of Famer and two-time NHL MVP who helped the Chicago Blackhawks win the 1961 Stanley Cup had chronic traumatic encephalopathy when he died two years ago",
      "CHICAGO -- Bobby Hull, the Hall of Fame forward and two-time NHL MVP who helped the Chicago Blackhawks win the Stanley Cup in 1961, had chronic traumatic encephalopathy when he died two years ago, his widow said in a statement released on Wednesday.",
      "Researchers at Boston University\u2019s CTE Center found that Hull had stage 2 CTE when he died in 2023. He was 84.",
      "Hull struggled with short-term memory loss and impaired judgment over his final decade. He chose to donate his brain after seeing former teammate and fellow Hall of Famer Stan Mikita decline late in his life.",
      "\u201cSeeing the pain and heartache suffered by his lifetime friend Stan Mikita\u2019s family, Bobby felt strongly no other family should have to endure CTE,\u201d Deborah Hull, his wife of 39 years, said in a statement. \u201cHe insisted on donating his brain, feeling as though it was his duty to help advance research on this agonizing disease.\u201d",
      "Nicknamed \u201cThe Golden Jet\u201d for his speed and blond hair, Hull was one of the most prolific forwards in NHL history, scoring 610 times over 16 seasons with Chicago, Hartford and Winnipeg. He dazzled generations of Blackhawks fans with his shooting and skating skills and remains the franchise's career leader with 604 goals. Hull also had 303 goals while playing for the Jets in the World Hockey Association for seven seasons.",
      "\u201cWe are grateful to Bobby Hull and all of the NHL players and families who are helping us learn how to prevent, diagnose, and treat CTE,\u201d said Dr. Ann McKee, director of the Boston University CTE Center. \u201cWe encourage retired players and their families to reach out for help and care if they are concerned about CTE, as we are learning how to effectively treat symptoms, especially in mid-life.\u201d",
      "The National Hockey League Players\u2019 Association announced in November it was forming an advisory committee to help hockey players better understand CTE and the damage that concussions can do to the brain. In December, researchers at Boston University published a study of deceased male hockey players that showed 18 of the 19 NHL players examined \u2014 including Hull, Mikita, Ralph Backstrom, Bob Probert, and Derek Boogaard \u2014 had CTE. It also found the odds of developing CTE increased by 34% for each year of hockey played.",

      "DOHA, Qatar -- Novak Djokovic says a majority of tennis players have lost faith in the anti-doping authorities following Jannik Sinner's three-month ban, and there's a widespread feeling that \u201cfavoritism\u201d is being shown to the sport's biggest stars.",
      "The 24-time major winner called on the World Anti-Doping Agency and the International Tennis Integrity Agency to overhaul their processes for dealing with doping cases \u201cbecause the system and the structure obviously doesn't work.\u201d",
      "\u201cRight now there is a lack of trust generally from the tennis players, both male and female, toward WADA and ITIA and the whole process,\u201d Djokovic said at the Qatar Open.",
      "Top-ranked Sinner reached a deal with WADA on Saturday to accept a ban that will have him back playing in time for the French Open in May without having to miss a single Grand Slam tournament. That came after the International Tennis Integrity Agency had decided not to suspend Sinner for what it judged was accidental contamination by a banned anabolic steroid last March.",
      "The short ban for Sinner came after five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek accepted a one-month suspension in November after testing positive for a banned substance that she said was accidentally consumed because of a contaminated nonprescription medication. Both bans are much shorter than what other athletes in tennis and in other sports have normally received in similar cases.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a good image for our sport, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Djokovic, the long-time No. 1 in men's tennis, said. \u201cThere\u2019s a majority of the players that I\u2019ve talked to in the locker room, not just in the last few days, but also last few months, that are not happy with the way this whole process (for Sinner) has been handled.",
      "\"A majority of the players don\u2019t feel that it\u2019s fair. A majority of the players feel like there is favoritism happening. It appears that you can almost affect the outcome if you are a top player, if you have access to the top lawyers and whatnot.\u201d",
      "Sinner had been scheduled to play in Qatar before accepting the ban.",
      "The handling of Sinner\u2019s case had already raised questions about double standards, and when the ban was announced it was widely criticized by other players. The positive tests weren\u2019t publicly revealed until August because Sinner successfully appealed against being provisionally banned from playing. He then won the U.S. Open in September and the Australian Open in January.",
      "Sinner\u2019s explanation for the positive test was that trace amounts of Clostebol in his doping sample was due to a massage from a trainer who used the substance after cutting his own finger, which WADA accepted.",
      "Djokovic said he didn't question Sinner's and Swiatek's innocence but that he and other players are frustrated about the inconsistent handling of doping cases.",
      "He pointed to the case of former women's No. 1 Simona Halep \u2014 who was given a four-year ban by the ITIA in 2022 after a positive test before it was later reduced to nine months \u2014 and British player Tara Moore, who was suspended in May 2022 while an investigation lasted 18 months before an independent tribunal determined that her positive test for a banned substance was caused by contaminated meat.",
      "\u201cRight now it\u2019s a ripe time for us to really address the system, because the system and the structure obviously doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s obvious,\" Djokovic said. \u201cSo, I hope that in the ... near future that the governing bodies are going to come together of our tours and the tennis ecosystem and try to find a more effective way to to deal with these processes.\"",

    "story": [
      "A bill to ban the sale of so-called lab-grown meat might seem like a no-brainer in Nebraska, where beef is king",
      "LINCOLN, Neb. -- The prospect of banning the sale of so-called lab-grown meat might seem like a no-brainer in Nebraska, where beef is king, but some of the proposal's staunchest opposition has come from ranchers and farming groups who say they can compete without the government\u2019s help.",
      "Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen \u2014 one of the largest pork producers in the country \u2014 is behind the push to ban cultivated meat, saying he wants to protect ranchers and meat producers. The Republican governor signed an executive order last August to keep state agencies and contractors from procuring lab-created meat, even though it could be years before such products are on store shelves.",
      "A number of ranchers and meat industry groups are pushing back on the governor's plan.",
      "Dan Morgan is a fourth-generation cattle rancher from central Nebraska who supplies high-end beef to all 50 states and six countries. He welcomes companies seeking to produce lab-grown meat to \u201cjump into the pool\u201d and try to compete with his Waygu beef. Stifling competition in a free market should be anathema in a Republican-dominated state like Nebraska, he said.",
      "\u201cIt sounds like a bunch of right-wing Republicans echoing a bunch of left-wing Democrats,\u201d he said, adding that the government should be limited to regulating the new product's labels and inspecting its facilities to ensure food safety.",
      "\u201cAfter that, it's up to the consumer to make the decision about what they buy and eat.\u201d",
      "Nebraska is among about a dozen states that have introduced measures to ban the manufacture, sale or distribution of lab-grown products, according to . Two states \u2014 Florida and Alabama \u2014 have already enacted such bans.",
      "The target of the bills is \u201ccell-cultivated\u201d or \u201ccell-cultured\u201d meat, which is grown from the cells of animals in bioreactor steel tanks. The cells are bathed for weeks in nutrients, prompting them to grow and divide, turning them into skeletal muscle, fat and connective tissues.",
      "The push to ban cultivated meat comes well before the innovation could be considered an industry. While more than two dozen companies are working to develop such meat products, only two \u2014 Upside Foods and Good Meat, both based in California \u2014 have been approved by the federal government to sell cultivated chicken in the U.S. Even then, none of the companies are close to mass producing and selling the products on store shelves.",
      "In recent weeks, supporters of the Nebraska bill have shifted their arguments from industry protection to questions of safety surrounding cell-cultured meat. That includes its sponsor, state Sen. Barry DeKay, a Nebraska rancher, and Sherry Vinton, the director of the Nebraska Department of Agriculture. Both testified in support of the bill at a committee hearing earlier this week, calling cultured meat \u201csynthetic food\u201d and voicing concern about possible health implications from eating it.",
      "But it's been no secret that the push for a ban is rooted in shielding Nebraska's traditional meat industry. Nebraska tops all other states for beef production and beef exports, according to the Nebraska Department of Agriculture.",
      "Pillen named the ban among his top priorities during his State of the State address last month.",
      "\u201cThe backers of these products are cut from the same cloth as the anti-farmer activists who want to put our agriculture producers out of business, and we need to recognize them as such,\u201d he said.",
      "The Association for Meat, Poultry and Seafood Innovation, the lobbying group for the emerging cultured meat industry, disputes Pillen's insistence that it's a threat to the traditional meat industry, noting studies that show global demand for meat-based protein will double by 2050.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really a complementary component here,\u201d said Suzi Gerber, executive director of the association. \u201cSo it\u2019s a little bit mystifying to me why any individual stakeholder would see this as a threat.\u201d",
      "Several farm organizations, including Nebraska Farm Bureau, Nebraska Cattlemen and the Nebraska Pork Producers, agree they're not worried about competition from the emerging industry. Those groups prefer a sister bill that would only require they be clearly labeled as lab-grown products to separate them from traditional meat. More than a dozen states have also issued similar labeling bills, and some \u2014 like Colorado \u2014 have seen ban efforts abandoned in favor of labeling measures.",
      "Paul Sherman is an attorney with the Institute for Justice, which is representing Upside Foods in its lawsuit challenging the Florida ban. He said it's no surprise most of the proposed bans are being pushed by those with connections to traditional agriculture.",
      "\u201cI think it certainly shows that the purpose of these laws isn\u2019t about protecting public health and safety,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about protecting traditional agriculture from economic competition. And that is not a legitimate use of government power.\u201d"

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 23:14:25 -0500",
    "summary": "Health care facilities in Utah would be required to let patients bring their own blood or choose their own donor for medical procedures under legislation gaining momentum in Utah",
    "story": [
      "Health care facilities in Utah would be required to let patients bring their own blood or choose their own donor for medical procedures under legislation gaining momentum in Utah",
      "SALT LAKE CITY -- Utah may soon loosen its B.Y.O.B. rules, but not in the way some might hope. The acronym has taken on a new meaning in the state Legislature: \u201cBring Your Own Blood.\u201d",
      "Health care facilities in Utah would be required to let patients use their own blood for procedures or choose their own donor under a bill that passed the state House with unanimous support Wednesday, despite concerns from the American Red Cross.",
      "Directed donations, which typically involve a patient\u2019s friend or family member giving blood for their procedure, are allowed under federal law. But the requests undergo a rigorous screening process that the bill's sponsor, an outspoken opponent of vaccines, said does not give patients enough personal choice in their medical decisions.",
      "Hospitals and blood collectors like the American Red Cross currently have broad discretion to decide whether it's safe and feasible for a patient to use their own blood or that of a chosen donor. Many facilities saw a rise in requests during the COVID-19 pandemic due to concerns about vaccine transmission that medical professionals say are unfounded.",
      "The Republican proposal, which now heads to the Senate, makes it so Utah health providers can no longer block someone from supplying their own blood, except in emergencies. Hospitals would not be liable for any injuries or deaths that may result from using the blood.",
      "Similar legislation is being considered in Texas and was floated in past legislative sessions in Iowa and Kentucky, but did not pass.",
      "\u201cThis bill was brought to me by patients who have requested to use directed blood donation, including their own blood, at Utah hospitals and have been denied,\u201d said freshman Rep. Kristen Chevrier, the bill's sponsor. \u201cTheir situations are serious and delicate.\u201d",
      "The Republican from Highland argued patients should be able to receive blood from people they trust, rather than go through blood banks that do not disclose to patients their donor's medical history.",
      "Before her election to the Legislature, Chevrier led multiple anti-vaccine organizations that warned against taking COVID-19 shots and fought against vaccination requirements imposed by schools and employers. She and other supporters have acknowledged that the bill would let patients who are weary of COVID-19 vaccines handpick donors with a similarly unvaccinated status.",
      "According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, justification for such requests \u201cis not supported by any medical or scientific evidence.\u201d Vaccine components do not replicate through blood transfusions or alter a blood recipient's DNA, meaning an unvaccinated patient could not receive the COVID-19 vaccine via a vaccinated donor's blood.",
      "Requests to use blood from a known donor are often driven by a patient\u2019s preference rather than a medical need, said Daniel Parra of the American Red Cross, the largest blood collector in Utah. An increase in those requests would divert resources away from those requiring lifesaving care, he cautioned.",
      "\u201cThis bill would create unnecessary and harmful impacts on the delivery of lifesaving blood to patients,\u201d Parra told The Associated Press. \u201cWhile this bill may be well-intentioned, it offers no public health benefit and could negatively impact patient care.\u201d",
      "Kristina Pexton, a blood transfusion specialist at a Utah hospital, told lawmakers at a recent committee hearing that she worried the bill would place a strain on the system.",
      "Directed donations also carry a greater risk than the community blood supply, Parra warned. Family and friends may feel pressure to donate and might not be fully transparent about their health history, which he said increases the risk of the recipient contracting an infectious disease.",
      "There is no evidence that patients can select safer donors than the volunteer blood system provides. Still, several residents told lawmakers the choice was important to them.",
      "\u201cSomething so personal as our health care, something that is especially as personal as blood, we should always have that choice,\u201d said Gayle Ruzicka."

    "story": [
      "A new and massive study finds that climate change is melting the world\u2019s mountain glaciers faster than ever",
      "Climate change is accelerating the melting of the world's mountain glaciers, according to a massive new study that found them shrinking more than twice as fast as in the early 2000s.",
      "The world's glaciers lost ice at the rate of about 255 billion tons (231 billion metric tons) annual from 2000 to 2011, but that quickened to about 346 billion tons (314 billion metric tons) annually over about the next decade, according to the study in this week\u2019s journal Nature.",
      "And the last few years, the melt has accelerated even more, hitting a record 604 billion tons (548 billion metric tons) lost in 2023, the last year analyzed.",
      "The study drew on an international effort that included 233 estimates of changes in glacier weight. In all, the world's glaciers have lost more than 7 trillion tons of ice (6.5 trillion metric tons) since 2000, according to the study.",
      "\u201cThe thing that people should be aware of and perhaps worried about is that yes, the glaciers are indeed retreating and disappearing as we said they would. The rate of that loss seems to be accelerating,\u201d said William Colgan, a glaciologist for the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland and one of about 60 authors of the study.",
      "Glaciers in Alaska are melting at the fastest rate of any of the 19 regions studied, losing about 67 billion tons (61 billion metric tons) of ice a year, producing the biggest net ice loss, the study found.",
      "In the past 24 years, Central Europe\u2019s glaciers have lost the highest percentage of ice of any region, now 39% smaller than they were in 2000, the paper said. Colgan said he worries most about the Alps because \u201celevated summer temperatures have been hammering the Alps. \u201d",
      "Fifteen years ago, scientists were worried most about the Andes and the Patagonia glaciers, but the Alps have shrunk so fast they could eventually disappear, Colgan said.",
      "\u201cGlaciers are apolitical and unbiased sentinels of climate change, and their decline paints a clear picture of accelerated warming,\u201d said Gwenn Flowers, a professor of Earth Sciences at Simon Fraser University in Canada, who wasn't part of the study.",
      "University of Colorado ice scientist Ted Scambos, who also wasn't part of the study, said glaciers shrank and grew in the past for local, well-understood reasons that were not climate change. What's happening now is different and clear, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s due to greenhouse gas increases caused directly by coal, oil, and natural gas burning. ... No amount of rhetoric, tweeting, or proclamation will change that.\u201d",
      "Scambos, Flowers and other outside scientists called the assessment sobering and accurate but not surprising.",
      "Colgan said that many places \u2014 such as those in the U.S. West \u2014 are seeing extra water now from fast-melting glaciers and benefiting from that boost, but that will soon disappear as the glaciers melt beyond a point of no return.",
      "Melting glaciers contribute more to sea level rise than ice loss in either Greenland or Antarctica. Only the expansion of water as it warms plays a bigger role in sea level rise, the paper said.",
      "The overall glacier loss rate is similar, if maybe slightly less, than that found by earlier and less comprehensive studies. But this new work will probably trigger new predictions that will be even gloomier in the future because of better information and worsening warming, Colgan said.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re losing 5.5% of the global ice volume in just over 20 years, clearly that\u2019s not sustainable,\u201d Colgan said. \u201cThat's going to catch up with you.\u201d",
      "The more than 600 billion tons of glacier loss in 2023 \u201csounds incredible now, but it might sound pretty normal in 10 years from now,\u201d Colgan said. \u201cMountain glaciers as a whole can flip into collective ice loss pretty darn quick.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration is investigating delays and cost overruns in California\u2019s high-speed rail project",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The Trump administration is once again targeting California's controversial high-speed rail project, with federal transportation officials on Thursday announcing an investigation and possible withdrawal of about $4 billion in federal funding.",
      "Voters first approved $10 billion in bond money in 2008 for a project designed to shuttle riders between San Francisco and Los Angeles in less than three hours. It was slated to cost $33 billion and be finished by 2020. But the project has been beset by funding challenges, cost overruns and delays.",
      "Now, state officials are focused on a 171-mile (275-kilometer) stretch connecting the Central Valley cities of Bakersfield and Merced, which is set to be operating by 2033. The entire San Francisco to Los Angeles line will now cost an estimated $106 billion to finish and officials hope to complete it in the next 20 years if there is money.",
      "\u201cI am directing my staff to review and determine whether the (California High-Speed Rail Authority) has followed through on the commitments it made to receive billions of dollars in federal funding. If not, I will have to consider whether that money could be given to deserving infrastructure projects elsewhere in the United States,\u201d Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said at a news conference in Los Angeles.",
      "President Donald Trump canceled nearly $1 billion in federal funding for the high-speed rail project in 2019, during his first term. The Biden administration later restored the funding and, in December 2023, allocated $3.3 billion more.",
      "Losing that money would be a major blow to the project. The rail authority's most recent business plan counts on receiving up to $8 billion in federal money to help close a funding gap.",
      "Ian Choudri, CEO of the California\u2019s High-Speed Rail Authority, which oversees planning and funding for the project, said he welcomes the investigation.",
      "\u201cWith multiple independent federal and state audits completed, every dollar is accounted for, and we stand by the progress and impact of this project,\u201d Choudri said.",
      "He said the project has created nearly 15,000 jobs and that more than 50 major structures have been completed so far.",
      "Several Republican Congress members have taken aim at the project over its costs. On Thursday, Republican Rep. Kevin Kiley, who represents 3rd Congressional District that stretches alongside much of the state\u2019s border with Nevada and includes Sacramento\u2019s northeastern suburbs, called the California high-speed rail \u201cthe worst public infrastructure failure in U.S. history.\u201d",
      "\"There is no plausible scenario where the cost to federal or state taxpayers can be justified. It is past time to stop throwing good money after bad, and we must formally end this project,\u201d said Kiley, who introduced a bill earlier this year to make the project ineligible for further federal funding.",
      "Kiley joined Duffy in Los Angeles' Union Station for the announcement of the probe. Those present were interrupted at times by booing by about 30 demonstrators. The protesters also chanted \u201cbuild the rail!\u201d and held up signs that read \u201cCA has no king\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t delay our train.\u201d",
      "Eli Lipmen, executive director of Move LA, an organization that advocates for efficient public transit systems, said the high-speed train project remains popular among many Californians.",
      "\u201cThey said they\u2019re going to start an investigation, but come on, this is a sham investigation,\u201d Lipmen, who was at Union Station during the announcement, told KABC-TV.",
      "Greg Regan and Shari Semelsberger, president and secretary-treasurer of the Transportation Trades Department coalition that includes all the country's rail unions, said the project is the most ambitious and innovative transportation project in the country and urged Trump to become \u201ca Builder-in-Chief by bringing high-speed rail to America.\u201d",
      "\u201cBuilding ambitious projects requires bold leadership and a commitment to getting the job done. Just last year, President Trump complained that the United States does not have bullet trains similar to Japan. We agree with him that it is past time for our country to have these kinds of modern, efficient, high-capacity transportation systems,\" they said in a statement.",

      "The delays in making the iPhone\u2019s AI \u2014 dubbed \u201cApple Intelligence\u2019\" \u2014 more widely available through free software updates dinged the Cupertino, California, company during the past holiday when sales of the device dipped slightly from their 2023 levels.",
      "Apple has primarily been losing the ground in China, where it hasn\u2019t yet specified when the iPhone's AI technology will be available. But the company recently struck an AI partnership with Alibaba in China that could pave the way for the technology coming to iPhones in that country this spring.",
      "Besides being able to handle AI for the first time, the iPhone 16e has a different look from previous SE models. It boasts a 6.1-inch display screen, slightly larger than the 4.7-inch display on SE model and no longer has a home screen button like the SE had. The new iPhone 16e will rely include a facial recognition option for unlocking the device, just like the higher priced models do.",
      "Apple's shares edged up during Wednesday's late mornng trading to nearly $245, below the stock's peak price of roughly $260 reached in late December.",

      "Chinese tech giant Huawei has held a global launch for the industry\u2019s first tri-foldable phone",
      "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Huawei on Tuesday held a global launch for the industry\u2019s first tri-foldable phone, which analysts said marked a symbolic victory for the Chinese tech giant amid U.S. technology curbs. But challenges over pricing, longevity, supply and app constraints may limit its success.",
      "Huawei said at a launch event in Kuala Lumpur that the Huawei Mate XT, first unveiled in China five months ago, will be priced at 3,499 euros ($3,662). Although dubbed a trifold, the phone has three mini-panels and folds only twice. The company says it's the thinnest foldable phone at 3.6 millimeters (0.14 inches), with a 10.2-inch screen similar to an Apple iPad.",
      "\u201cRight now, Huawei kind of stands alone as an innovator\" with the trifold design, said Bryan Ma, vice president of device research with the market intelligence firm International Data Corporation.",
      "Huawei reached the position despite \u201cnot getting access to chips, to Google services. All these things basically have been huge roadblocks in front of Huawei,\u201d Ma said, adding that the \u201cresurgence we're seeing from them over the past year has been quite a bit of a victory.\"",
      "Huawei, China\u2019s first global tech brand, is at the center of a U.S.-China battle over trade and technology. Washington in 2019 severed Huawei\u2019s access to U.S. components and technology, including Google\u2019s music and other smartphone services, making Huawei's phone less appealing to users. It has also barred global vendors from using U.S. technology to produce components for Huawei.",
      "American officials say Huawei is a security risk, which the company denies. China\u2019s government has accused Washington of misusing security warnings to contain a rising competitor to U.S. technology companies.",
      "Huawei launched the Mate XT in China on Sept. 20 last year, the same day Apple launched its iPhone 16 series in global markets. But with its steep price tag, the Mate XT \u201cis not a mainstream product that people are going to jump for,\u201d Ma said.",
      "At the Kuala Lumpur event, Huawei also unveiled its MatePad Pro tablet and Free Arc, its first open-ear earbuds with ear hooks and other wearable devices.",
      "While Huawei\u2019s cutting-edge devices showcase its technological prowess, its long-term success remains uncertain given ongoing challenges over global supply chain constraints, chip availability and limitations on the software ecosystem, said Ruby Lu, an analyst with the research firm TrendForce.",
      "\"System limitations, particularly the lack of Google Mobile Services, means its international market potential remains constrained,\u201d Lu said.",
      "IDC's Ma said Huawei dominated the foldable phone market in China with 49% market share last year. In the global market, it had 23% market share, trailing behind Samsung's 33% share in 2024, he said. IDC predicted that total foldable phone shipments worldwide could surge to 45.7 million units by 2028, from over 20 million last year.",
      "While most major brands have entered the foldable segments, Lu said Apple has yet to release a competing product.",
      "\u201cOnce Apple enters the market, it is expected to significantly influence and stimulate further growth in the foldable phone sector,\u201d Lu added."

      "Why did humans start speaking",
      "Why did humans start speaking? Scientists suggest genetics played a big role \u2013 and they say the evolution of this singular ability was key to our survival.",
      "A new study links a particular gene to the ancient origins of spoken language, proposing that a protein variant found only in humans may have helped us communicate in a novel way. Speech allowed us to share information, coordinate activities and pass down knowledge, giving us an edge over extinct cousins like Neanderthals and Denisovans.",
      "The new study is \u201ca good first step to start looking at the specific genes\u201d that may affect speech and language development, said Liza Finestack at the University of Minnesota, who was not involved with the research.",
      "What scientists learn may someday even help people with speech problems.",
      "The genetic variant researchers were looking at was one of a variety of genes \"that contributed to the emergence of Homo sapiens as the dominant species, which we are today\u201d said Dr. Robert Darnell, an author of the study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "Darnell has been studying the protein \u2013 called NOVA1 and known to be crucial to brain development \u2013 since the early 1990s. For the latest research, scientists in his lab at New York's Rockefeller University used CRISPR gene editing to replace the NOVA1 protein found in mice with the exclusively human type to test the real-life effects of the genetic variant. To their surprise, it changed the way the animals vocalized when they called out to each other.",
      "Baby mice with the human variant squeaked differently than normal littermates when their mom came around. Adult male mice with the variant chirped differently than their normal counterparts when they saw a female in heat.",
      "Both are settings where mice are motivated to speak, Darnell said, \u201cand they spoke differently\" with the human variant, illustrating its role in speech.",
      "This isn't the first time a gene has been linked to speech. In 2001, British scientists said they had discovered the first gene tied to a language and speech disorder.",
      "Called FOXP2, it was referred to as the human language gene. But though FOXP2 is involved in human language, it turned out that the variant in modern humans wasn't unique to us. Later research found it was shared with Neanderthals. The NOVA1 variant in modern humans, on the other hand, is found exclusively in our species, Darnell said.",
      "The presence of a gene variant isn't the only reason people can speak. The ability also depends on things like anatomical features in the human throat and areas of the brain that work together to allow people to speak and understand language.",
      "Darnell hopes the recent work not only helps people better understand their origins but also eventually leads to new ways to treat speech-related problems.",
      "University of Minnesota's Finestack said it\u2019s more likely the genetic findings might someday allow scientists to detect, very early in life, who might need speech and language interventions.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s certainly a possibility,\u201d she said.",

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- The Agriculture Department is scrambling to rehire several workers who were involved in the government's response to the ongoing bird flu outbreak that has devastated egg and poultry farms over the past three years.",
      "The workers were among the thousands of federal employees eliminated on the recommendations of billionaire Elon Musk 's Department of Government Efficiency, which is working to carry out Trump\u2019s promise to streamline and reshape the federal government.",
      "Republican Rep. Don Bacon said the administration should be more careful in how it carries out the cuts.",
      "\u201cWhile President Trump is fulfilling his promise to shed light on waste, fraud, and abuse in government, DOGE needs to measure twice and cut once. Downsizing decisions must be narrowly tailored to preserve critical missions,\u201d said Bacon, who represents a swing district in Nebraska.",
      "The bird flu outbreak has prompted the slaughter of roughly 160 million birds to help control the virus since the outbreak began in 2022. Most of the birds killed were egg-laying chickens, so that has driven egg prices up to a record high of $4.95 per dozen on average. The federal government has spent nearly $2 billion on the response, including nearly $1.2 billion in payments to farmers to compensate them for their lost birds.",
      "A USDA spokesperson said the department \u201ccontinues to prioritize the response to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)\u201d and several key jobs like veterinarians, animal health technicians and other emergency response personnel involved in the effort were protected from the cuts. But some employees of the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service were eliminated.",
      "\u201cAlthough several APHIS positions supporting HPAI were notified of their terminations over the weekend, we are working to swiftly rectify the situation and rescind those letters,\u201d the department spokesperson said.",
      "Politico and NBC News reported that the jobs that were eliminated were part of an office that helps oversee the national network of labs USDA relies on to confirm cases of bird flu and other animal diseases. It wasn't immediately clear how many workers the department might be trying to rehire and whether any of them worked at the main USDA lab in Ames, Iowa.",
      "\u201cAt a time when producers are already grappling with the bird flu, the public is facing high prices, and all Americans are on edge about what broader spread of this virus could mean, the last thing the administration should have done was to eliminate these positions,\" Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar said. \"USDA must rehire these crucial personnel immediately.\u201d",
      "Trump administration officials said this week that the USDA might change its approach to the bird flu outbreak, so that maybe entire flocks wouldn't have to be slaughtered when the disease is found, but they have yet to offer many details of their plan.",

    "story": [
      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker is planning to endorse a statewide ban on cellular devices in public schools",
      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker is aiming to improve student achievement, social interaction and the mental health of public school students by proposing a statewide ban on cellphones in classrooms, an idea that is rapidly gaining traction nationally regardless of political persuasion.",
      "The Democrat's top education aide, Martin Torres, said Pritzker is expected to endorse \u201cscreen-free schools\u201d during his combined State of the State/Budget address at noon Wednesday.",
      "Legislation introduced in both houses of the General Assembly would require school districts to set policies that ban personal wireless devices during class time, with notable exceptions, create a means for secure but accessible storage of phones and tablets, and review those guidelines at least every three years.",
      "Eight states have policies that ban or limit schoolhouse cellphone use. Indiana, Minnesota, Ohio. Iowa, Kentucky and Michigan are among the 15 states where bans or other restrictions have been proposed.",
      "The Pew Research Center has found that seven in 10 high school teachers in the U.S. consider cellphone distraction a major classroom problem.",
      "Torres, Pritzker's deputy governor for education, told The Associated Press that at least 10 Illinois school districts have adopted screen-free policies, and they have had positive results.",
      "\u201cStudents are more engaged, they\u2019re more attentive in class. There\u2019s improved participation in classroom dynamics,\u201d Torres said. \u201cThis is a proposal that\u2019s going to help teachers with instruction. It\u2019s going to reduce screen time. It\u2019s going to reduce social media exposure. And there\u2019s research that suggests that social media is linked with anxiety, depression, body dissatisfaction.\u201d",
      "The legislation, which would require policies be in place by the 2026-2027 school year, has enough flexibility in the plan to allow school districts to develop a policy that best suits them.",
      "Pritzker's idea is to ban wireless devices during instructional periods unless there is an emergency or a need to respond to a threat. They would also be allowed when a teacher approves their use, when a physician deems it essential for a student, for an individual special education plan or to help English learners.",
      "This school year, Peoria schools adopted a plan in which each student is issued a neoprene pouch with a magnetized lock that only teachers or administrators can open. Midway through the school year, a survey of 8,000 students from grades 5 to 12 found they had more focus, more engagement and reduced distractions, Superintendent Sharon Desmoulin-Kherat said.",
      "She said that in an email, a teacher reported: \u201cI am looking into students' eyes who have never looked up from a screen before.\u201d",
      "Illinois was way ahead of the curve on the issue, but it then backpedaled. Legislation banned cellphones as early as the 1990s when cellular devices were new, expensive and thought to be the domain of drug dealers. As technology improved, they were seen as vital links to the outside, particularly family, and in 2002, the Legislature reversed itself and approved their presence in schools.",
      "Despite being turned off and locked up, Peoria students retain ready access when necessary, Desmoulin-Kherat said, noting one of the few concerns parents had was being able to reach their children in an emergency.",
      "\u201cJust like the old days, you can call the office,\u201d Desmoulin-Kherat said. \u201cYou can send an email. You don't need a cellphone to be able to communicate with your family.\u201d",

      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- U.S. tech giants have quietly empowered Israel to track and kill many more alleged militants more quickly in Gaza and Lebanon through a sharp spike in artificial intelligence and computing services. But the number of civilians killed has also soared, fueling fears that these tools are contributing to the deaths of innocent people.",
      "Militaries have for years hired private companies to build custom autonomous weapons. However, Israel's recent wars mark a leading instance in which commercial AI models made in the United States have been used in active warfare, despite concerns that they were not originally developed to help decide who lives and who dies.",
      "The Israeli military uses AI to sift through vast troves of intelligence, intercepted communications and surveillance to find suspicious speech or behavior and learn the movements of its enemies. After a deadly surprise attack by Hamas militants on Oct. 7, 2023, its use of Microsoft and OpenAI technology skyrocketed, an Associated Press investigation found. The investigation also revealed new details of how AI systems select targets and ways they can go wrong, including faulty data or flawed algorithms. It was based on internal documents, data and exclusive interviews with current and former Israeli officials and company employees.",
      "\u201cThis is the first confirmation we have gotten that commercial AI models are directly being used in warfare,\u201d said Heidy Khlaaf, chief AI scientist at the AI Now Institute and former senior safety engineer at OpenAI. \u201cThe implications are enormous for the role of tech in enabling this type of unethical and unlawful warfare going forward.\u201d",

      "The Israeli military\u2019s usage of Microsoft and OpenAI artificial intelligence spiked last March to nearly 200 times higher than before the week leading up to the Oct. 7 attack, the AP found in reviewing internal company information. The amount of data it stored on Microsoft servers doubled between that time and July 2024 to more than 13.6 petabytes \u2014 roughly 350 times the digital memory needed to store every book in the Library of Congress. Usage of Microsoft\u2019s huge banks of computer servers by the military also rose by almost two-thirds in the first two months of the war alone.",
      "Israel\u2019s goal after the attack that killed about 1,200 people and took over 250 hostages was to eradicate Hamas, and its military has called AI a \u201cgame changer\u201d in yielding targets more swiftly. Since the war started, more than 50,000 people have died in Gaza and Lebanon and nearly 70% of the buildings in Gaza have been devastated, according to health ministries in Gaza and Lebanon.",
      "The AP\u2019s investigation drew on interviews with six current and former members of the Israeli army, including three reserve intelligence officers. Most spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss sensitive military operations.",
      "The AP also interviewed 14 current and former employees inside Microsoft, OpenAI, Google and Amazon, most of whom also spoke anonymously for fear of retribution. Journalists reviewed internal company data and documents, including one detailing the terms of a $133 million contract between Microsoft and Israel\u2019s Ministry of Defense.",
      "The Israeli military says its analysts use AI-enabled systems to help identify targets but independently examine them together with high-ranking officers to meet international law, weighing the military advantage against the collateral damage. A senior Israeli intelligence official authorized to speak to the AP said lawful military targets may include combatants fighting against Israel, wherever they are, and buildings used by militants. Officials insist that even when AI plays a role, there are always several layers of humans in the loop.",
      "\u201cThese AI tools make the intelligence process more accurate and more effective,\u201d said an Israeli military statement to the AP. \u201c\u2060They make more targets faster, but not at the expense of accuracy, and many times in this war they\u2019ve been able to minimize civilian casualties.\u201d",
      "The Israeli military declined to answer detailed written questions from the AP about its use of commercial AI products from American tech companies.",
      "Microsoft declined to comment for this story and did not respond to a detailed list of written questions about cloud and AI services provided to the Israeli military. In a statement on its website, the company says it is committed \u201cto champion the positive role of technology across the globe.\u201d In its 40-page Responsible AI Transparency Report for 2024, Microsoft pledges to manage the risks of AI throughout development \u201cto reduce the risk of harm,\u201d and does not mention its lucrative military contracts.",
      "Advanced AI models are provided through OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, through Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud platform, where they are purchased by the Israeli military, the documents and data show. Microsoft has been OpenAI's largest investor. OpenAI said it does not have a partnership with Israel's military, and its usage policies say its customers should not use its products to develop weapons, destroy property or harm people.

      "Before they left, the adults told the girls to play in front of the house so that Israeli drones would know they were traveling with children. The women and girls drove alongside Hijazi\u2019s uncle, Samir Ayoub, a journalist with a leftist radio station, who was caravanning in his own car. They heard the frenetic buzz of a drone very low overhead.",
      "Soon, an airstrike hit the car Hijazi was driving. It careened down a slope and burst into flames. Ayoub managed to pull Hijazi out, but her mother \u2014 Ayoub\u2019s sister \u2014 and the three girls \u2014 Rimas, 14, Taline, 12, and Liane, 10 \u2014 were dead.",
      "Before they left their home, Hijazi recalled, one of the girls had insisted on taking pictures of the cats in the garden \u201cbecause maybe we won\u2019t see them again.\u201d",
      "In the end, she said, \u201cthe cats survived and the girls are gone.\u201d",
      "Video footage from a security camera at a convenience store shortly before the strike showed the Hijazi family in a Hyundai SUV, with the mother and one of the girls loading jugs of water. The family says the video proves Israeli drones should have seen the women and children.",
      "The day after the family was hit, the Israeli military released video of the strike along with a package of similar videos and photos. A statement released with the images said Israeli fighter jets had \u201cstruck just over 450 Hamas targets.\" The AP\u2019s visual analysis matched the road and other geographical features in the Israeli military video to satellite imagery of the location where the three girls died, 1 mile (1.7 kilometers) from the store.",
      "An Israeli intelligence officer told the AP that AI has been used to help pinpoint all targets in the past three years. In this case, AI likely pinpointed a residence, and other intelligence gathering could have placed a person there. At some point, the car left the residence.",
      "Humans in the target room would have decided to strike. The error could have happened at any point, he said: Previous faulty information could have flagged the wrong residence, or they could have hit the wrong vehicle.",
      "The AP also saw a message from a second source with knowledge of that airstrike who confirmed it was a mistake, but didn\u2019t elaborate.",
      "A spokesperson for the Israeli military denied that AI systems were used during the airstrike itself, but refused to answer whether AI helped select the target or whether it was wrong. The military told the AP that officials examined the incident and expressed \u201csorrow for the outcome.\u201d",
      "Microsoft and the San Francisco-based startup OpenAI are among a legion of U.S. tech firms that have supported Israel\u2019s wars in recent years.",
      "Google and Amazon provide cloud computing and AI services to the Israeli military under \u201cProject Nimbus,\u201d a $1.2 billion contract signed in 2021 when Israel first tested out its in-house AI-powered targeting systems. The military has used Cisco and Dell server farms or data centers. Red Hat, an independent IBM subsidiary, also has provided cloud computing technologies to the Israeli military, and Palantir Technologies, a Microsoft partner in U.S. defense contracts, has a \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d providing AI systems to help Israel\u2019s war efforts.",
      "Google said it is committed to responsibly developing and deploying AI \u201cthat protects people, promotes global growth, and supports national security.\u201d Dell provided a statement saying the company commits to the highest standards in working with public and private organizations globally, including in Israel. Red Hat spokesperson Allison Showalter said the company is proud of its global customers, who comply with Red Hat's terms to adhere to applicable laws and regulations.",
      "Palantir, Cisco and Oracle did not respond to requests for comment. Amazon declined to comment.",
      "The Israeli military uses Microsoft Azure to compile information gathered through mass surveillance, which it transcribes and translates, including phone calls, texts and audio messages, according to an Israeli intelligence officer who works with the systems. That data can then be cross-checked with Israel\u2019s in-house targeting systems and vice versa.",
      "He said he relies on Azure to quickly search for terms and patterns within massive text troves, such as finding conversations between two people within a 50-page document. Azure also can find people giving directions to one another in the text, which can then be cross-referenced with the military\u2019s own AI systems to pinpoint locations.",
      "The Microsoft data AP reviewed shows that since the Oct. 7 attack, the Israeli military has made heavy use of transcription and translation tools and OpenAI models, although it does not detail which. Typically, AI models that transcribe and translate perform best in English. OpenAI has acknowledged that its popular AI-powered translation model Whisper, which can transcribe and translate into multiple languages including Arabic, can make up text that no one said, including adding racial commentary and violent rhetoric.",
      "\u201cShould we be basing these decisions on things that the model could be making up?\u201d said Joshua Kroll, an assistant professor of computer science at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, who spoke to the AP in his personal capacity, not reflecting the views of the U.S. government.",
      "The Israeli military said any phone conversation translated from Arabic or intelligence used in identifying a target has to be reviewed by an Arabic-speaking officer.",
      "Errors can still happen for many reasons involving AI, said Israeli military officers who have worked with the targeting systems and other tech experts. One intelligence officer said he had seen targeting mistakes that relied on incorrect machine translations from Arabic to Hebrew.",
      "The Arabic word describing the grip on the launch tube for a rocket-propelled grenade is the same as the word for \u201cpayment.\u201d In one instance the machine translated it wrong, and the person verifying the translation initially didn\u2019t catch the error, he said, which could have added people speaking about payments to target lists. The officer was there by chance and caught the problem, he said.",
      "Intercepted phone calls tied to a person\u2019s profile also include the time the person called and the names and numbers of those on the call. But it takes an extra step to listen to and verify the original audio, or to see a translated transcript.",
      "Sometimes the data attached to people\u2019s profiles is wrong. For example, the system misidentified a list of high school students as potential militants, according to the officer. An Excel spreadsheet attached to several people\u2019s profiles titled \u201cfinals\u201d in Arabic, contained at least 1,000 students\u2019 names on an exam list in one area of Gaza, he said. This was the only piece of incriminating evidence attached to people\u2019s files, he said, and had he not caught the mistake, those Palestinians could have been wrongly flagged.",
      "He said he also worried that young officers, some still younger than 20, under pressure to find targets quickly with the help of AI would jump to conclusions.",
      "AI alone could lead to the wrong conclusion, said another soldier who worked with the targeting systems. For example, AI might flag a house owned by someone linked to Hamas who does not live there. Before the house is hit, humans must confirm who is actually in it, he said.",
      "\u201cObviously there are things that I live peacefully with and things that I could have done better in some targeted attacks that I\u2019m responsible for,\u201d the soldier told the AP. \u201cIt\u2019s war, things happen, mistakes happen, we are human.\u201d",
      "Tal Mimran served 10 years as a reserve legal officer for the Israeli military, and on three NATO working groups examining the use of new technologies, including AI, in warfare. Previously, he said, it took a team of up to 20 people a day or more to review and approve a single airstrike. Now, with AI systems, the military is approving hundreds a week.",
      "Mimran said over-reliance on AI could harden people\u2019s existing biases.",
      "\u201cConfirmation bias can prevent people from investigating on their own,\u201d said Mimran, who teaches cyber law policy. \u201cSome people might be lazy, but others might be afraid to go against the machine and be wrong and make a mistake.\u201d",
      "Among U.S. tech firms, Microsoft has had an especially close relationship with the Israeli military spanning decades.",
      "That relationship, alongside those with other tech companies, stepped up after the Hamas attack. Israel\u2019s war response strained its own servers and increased its reliance on outside, third-party vendors, according to a presentation last year by the military\u2019s top information technology officer. As she described how AI had provided Israel \u201cvery significant operational effectiveness\u201d in Gaza, the logos of Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services appeared on a large screen behind her.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve already reached a point where our systems really need it,\u201d said Col. Racheli Dembinsky, commander of the Center of Computing and Information Systems, known by its Hebrew acronym, Mamram.",
      "One three-year contract between Microsoft and the Israeli Ministry of Defense began in 2021 and was worth $133 million, making it the company's second largest military customer globally after the U.S., according to a document reviewed by the AP. The Israeli military is classified within Microsoft as an \u201cS500\u201d client, meaning that it gets top priority as one of the company's most important customers globally.",
      "The Israeli military's service agreements with Microsoft include at least 635 individual subscriptions listed under specific divisions, units, bases or project code words. Subscription names reviewed by the AP included \u201cMamram\u201d and \u201c8200,\u201d an elite intelligence unit known for its technological prowess.",
      "One urgent Azure support ticket filed about two weeks after the Oct. 7 attack asked for delays of planned maintenance outages for the rest of the year due to the war, because any downtime could have \u201ca direct impact on life-saving systems.\u201d The request was flagged as being from \u201cGlilot \u2013 8200,\u201d a highly secure army base that houses Unit 8200, responsible for clandestine operations, collecting signal intelligence and code decryption, cyber warfare and surveillance.",
      "Records show Microsoft\u2019s global Azure support team responded to about 130 direct requests from the Israeli military through the first 10 months of the war. Microsoft\u2019s consulting services unit also works closely with Israel\u2019s military, which represented half of that section\u2019s overall revenue, an internal document said.",
      "Within Israel, a team of at least nine Microsoft employees is dedicated to serving the military\u2019s account. Among them is a senior executive who served 14 years in Unit 8200 and a former IT leader for military intelligence, according to their online resumes. Microsoft data is housed in server farms within two massive buildings outside Tel Aviv, enclosed behind high walls topped with barbed wire. Microsoft also operates a 46,000-square-meter corporate campus in Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv, and another office in Gav-Yam in southern Israel, which has displayed a large Israeli flag.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces has long been at the forefront of deploying artificial intelligence for military use. In early 2021, it launched Gospel, an AI tool that sorts through Israel\u2019s vast array of digitized information to suggest targets for potential strikes. It also developed Lavender, which uses machine learning to filter out requested criteria from intelligence databases and narrow down lists of potential targets, including people.",
      "Lavender ranks people between 0 and 100 based on how likely it is they are a militant, said an intelligence officer who used the systems. The ranking is based on intelligence, such as the person\u2019s family tree, if someone\u2019s father is a known militant who served time, and intercepted phone calls, he said.",
      "In May 2021, the Israeli military launched what Israeli intelligence officials described as their \u201cFirst AI War,\u201d an 11-day bombing campaign against Hamas. At the time, Israeli military officials described AI as a \u201cforce-multiplier,\u201d allowing them to carry out far more airstrikes than in prior conflicts.",
      "A 2021 post by the Israeli military also described the stakes surrounding the use of AI in war: \u201cUnlike in the realms of AdTech and Gaming, wrong decisions in the realm of intelligence may cost lives,\u201d it read. The same post described the military\u2019s incorporation of AI approaches to analyze the emotional tone of communications, a technique experts have found can fail to pick slang, jargon or nuance in people\u2019s speech.",
      "The relationship between tech companies and the Israeli military also has ramifications in the U.S., where some employees have raised ethical concerns.",
      "In October, Microsoft fired two workers for helping organize an unauthorized lunchtime vigil for Palestinian refugees at its corporate campus in Redmond, Washington. Microsoft said at the time that it ended the employment of some people \u201cin accordance with internal policy\u201d but declined to give details.",
      "Hossam Nasr, one of the employees fired by Microsoft who works with the advocacy group No Azure for Apartheid, said he and former colleagues are pushing for Microsoft to stop selling cloud and AI services to the Israeli military.",
      "\u201cCloud and AI are the bombs and bullets of the 21st century,\u201d Nasr said. \u201cMicrosoft is providing the Israeli military with digital weapons to kill, maim and displace Palestinians, in the gravest moral travesty of our time.\u201d",
      "In April, Google fired about 50 of its workers over a sit-in at the company\u2019s California headquarters protesting the war in Gaza.",
      "Former Google software engineer Emaan Haseem was among those fired. Haseem said she worked on a team that helped test the reliability of a \u201csovereign cloud\u201d \u2014 a secure system of servers kept so separate from the rest of Google\u2019s global cloud infrastructure that even the company itself couldn't access or track the data it stores. She later learned through media reports that Google was building a sovereign cloud for Israel.",
      "\u201cIt seemed to be more and more obvious that we are literally just trying to design something where we won\u2019t have to care about how our clients are using it, and if they\u2019re using it unfairly or unethically,\u201d Haseem said.",
      "Google said the employees were fired because they disrupted work spaces and made colleagues feel unsafe. Google did not respond to specific questions about whether it was contracted to build a sovereign cloud for the Israeli military and whether it provided restrictions on the wartime use of its AI models.",
      "Gaza is now in an uneasy ceasefire. But recently, the Israeli government announced it would expand its artificial intelligence developments across all its military branches.",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. tech titans keep consolidating power in Washington. Microsoft gave $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund. Google CEO Sundar Pichai got a prime seat at the president\u2019s inauguration. And OpenAI CEO Sam Altman met with the president on Trump\u2019s second full day in office to talk up a joint venture investing up to $500 billion for AI infrastructure.",
      "In a new book set to be published Tuesday, Palantir CEO Alexander Karp calls for the U.S. military and its allies to work closely with Silicon Valley to design, build and acquire AI weaponry, including \u201cthe unmanned drone swarms and robots that will dominate the coming battlefield.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe fate of the United States, and its allies, depends on the ability of their defense and intelligence agencies to evolve, and briskly,\u201d Karp wrote, according to an advance copy obtained by the AP.",
      "After OpenAI changed its terms of use last year to allow for national security purposes, Google followed suit earlier this month with a similar change to its public ethics policy to remove language saying it wouldn\u2019t use its AI for weapons and surveillance. Google said it is committed to responsibly developing and deploying AI \u201cthat protects people, promotes global growth, and supports national security.\u201d",

      "Unfavorable ocean and weather conditions, which prevented the whales from being rescued on Wednesday, were forecast to persist for days, incident controller Shelley Graham said.",
      "\"We have been out in the water this morning and have relocated and attempted to refloat two whales but didn\u2019t have success as the ocean conditions weren\u2019t allowing the animals to get past the break. The animals are continuously restranding,\u201d Graham said in a statement.",

      "The young whales weighed as little as 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds), while the adults weighed 3 metric tons (3.3 U.S. tons).",
      "Department liaison officer Brendon Clark said the stranding was the first by false killer whales in Tasmania in since 1974. That was a pod of more than 160 whales that landed on a beach near Stanley on the northwest coast. Strandings in Tasmania are usually pilot whales.",

Mark Kennedy wrote in his AP review that \u201c\u2019The Crow\u2019 isn\u2019t bad \u2014 and it gets better as it goes \u2014 but it\u2019s an exercise in folly. It cannot escape Lee and the 1994 original even as it builds a more allegorical scaffolding for the smartphone generation.\u201d",

      "William Ray Lucas, who led the NASA facility that shouldered much of the blame for the 1986 explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, has died. Lucas was 102.",
      "Lucas died Monday at his home in Huntsville, Alabama, according to an obituary published Friday by Laughlin Service Funeral Home in Huntsville. A funeral service has been set for March 1 on what would have been his 103rd birthday, funeral director Bryan Peek said Saturday.",
      "Lucas was director of the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville when the Challenger exploded on Jan. 28, 1986, just 73 seconds after liftoff from Cape Canaveral, Florida. It was the deadliest U.S. space flight disaster at that time.",
      "The explosion killed all seven crew members, including schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe, who had been tapped to become the first U.S. civilian to travel to space. Her inclusion on the flight meant thousands of schoolchildren across the country were watching the Challenger's launch and witnessed the televised disaster in real time.",
      "A presidential commission charged with investigating the cause of the explosion pointed to the shuttle's solid-fuel booster rockets as the likely culprit and criticized NASA managers for not taking safety concerns surrounding the rockets more seriously. The Marshall center had supervised development of the rockets.",
      "Lucas pushed back on the criticism, telling reporters a month after the explosion that it was too soon to pinpoint the cause of the explosion, adding, \u201cI think it was a sound decision to launch.\"",
      "But within months he had resigned, just days ahead of the release of a commission report blaming faulty design of the booster rockets.",
      "The explosion and resulting shakeup within NASA overshadowed what was an otherwise stellar career for Lucas, who was born and raised in rural western Tennessee and graduated from high school in 1939 as the class valedictorian. He earned a bachelor of science degree from Memphis State College, served in the U.S. Navy during World War II and later earned a doctorate in metallurgy from Vanderbilt University.",
      "Lucas began his career in the guided missile development division of the U.S. Army's Redstone Arsenal near Huntsville. He became a charter member of the Marshall Space Flight Center when it was established in 1960 before rising through the ranks to become its director in 1974."

      "President Claudia Sheinbaum shared a letter addressed to her government from Cris Turner, Google\u2019s vice president of government affairs and public policy. It says that Google will not change the policy it outlined after U.S. President Donald Trump declared the body of water the Gulf of America.",
      "\u201cWe will wait for Google\u2019s response and if not, we will proceed to court,\u201d Sheinbaum said Monday during a morning press briefing.",
      "As it stands, the gulf appears in Google Maps as Gulf of America within the United States, as Gulf of Mexico within Mexico and Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America) elsewhere. Turner in his letter said the company was using Gulf of America to follow \u201clongstanding maps policies impartially and consistently across all regions\" and that the company was willing to meet in person with the Mexican government.",
      "\u201cWhile international treaties and conventions are not intended to regulate how private mapping providers represent geographic features, it is our consistent policy to consult multiple authoritative sources to provide the most up to date and accurate representation of the world,\" he wrote.",
      "Mexico has argued that the mapping policy violates Mexican sovereignty because the U.S. only has jurisdiction over around 46% of the Gulf. The rest is controlled by Mexico, which controls 49% and Cuba, which controls around 5%. The name Gulf of Mexico dates back to 1607 and is recognized by the United Nations.",
      "In response to Google's letter, Mexican authorities said they would take legal action, writing that \u201cunder no circumstance will Mexico accept the renaming of a geographic zone within its own territory and under its jurisdiction.\"",
      "The renaming of the body of water by Trump has flared tensions between Mexico and the U.S. at a pivotal time for the neighboring allies.",
      "Sheinbaum has had to walk a fine line with Trump amid threats of tariffs and Mexico and other Latin American countries have braced themselves for promised mass deportations, the brunt of which has still not been felt.",
      "Along with the legal threat to Google, the Mexican president also announced Monday that Mexico and the U.S. would hold high-level meetings this week on trade and security in an effort to maintain a \u201clong-term plan of collaboration\" between the two countries.",
      "It's the latest round of talks between the two countries in which Mexico hopes to hold off a larger geopolitical crisis.",
      "The renaming of the water body has fueled strife within the U.S. as well.",
      "Last week, the White House barred Associated Press reporters from several events, including some in the Oval Office, saying it was because of the news agency\u2019s policy on the name. The AP is using Gulf of Mexico to ensure that names of geographical features are recognizable around the world but also acknowledging Trump\u2019s renaming of it as well.",
      "Other journalistic organizations such as the White House Correspondents' Organization and the New York Times have echoed the AP in raising alarm about press freedom violations.",

    "summary": "Investigators are looking into how all 76 passengers and four crew members aboard Delta Air Lines Flight 4819 survived after the plane crash-landed in Toronto on Monday.",
    "story": [
      "An ABC News Visual Investigation examines how the catastrophe had no casualties.",
      "Investigators are attempting to determine how all 76 passengers and four crew members aboard Delta Air Lines Flight 4819 survived after their plane crash-landed at Toronto Pearson International Airport on Monday.",
      "Despite the plane skidding down the runway at over 100 mph, flipping over and losing a wing, all 80 people onboard walked away with minimal injuries.",
      "ABC News spoke with aviation experts who pointed to three key elements that begin to explain how the passengers survived the crash: the plane's landing gear, its wing and its fuselage.",
      "'We hit pretty hard'",
      "The regional jet was a Canadian-built Bombardier CRJ-900. Experts described the 16-year-old narrow-body plane as a workhorse plane for flights between midsized cities.",
      "Delta Flight 4819, traveling from Minneapolis to Toronto, was operated by Endeavor Air. Chris Finlayson used to fly that route for Endeavor.",
      "\"When you come into land and then you roll out, it's very easy to end up pulling the nose a little bit too high,\" Finlayson said, adding that angling the plane too high can cause \"motion where you end up driving your main landing gear into the runway.\"",
      "Brian Erickson, one of the 76 passengers, described experiencing a particularly hard landing, something experts say could have caused the collapse of the CRJ-900's right landing gear.",
      "\"When we hit down, it seemed like we hit pretty hard. And I thought, 'OK, this is a pretty rough landing, but I've had that before.' And then all of a sudden, the plane started listing and turning to the right,\" he said.",
      "John Nance, an ABC News aviation analyst who examined video of the landing, said that the angle of the landing placed stress on the right landing gear, potentially contributing to its collapse.",
      "\"The impact on the right main gear has driven the gear past its limitations, and in the vernacular, it's driven the gear up through the wing,\" Nance said.",
      "'I could actually feel the heat'",
      "After the right-side landing gear appeared to collapse, the plane's starboard wing began to scrape the runway and was ripped from the fuselage. Images taken after the crash clearly show the right wing cleanly snapped off the fuselage, while the right landing gear is ripped off the plane.",
      "Inside the cabin, passengers described feeling the heat emanating from a fire outside the fuselage as they skidded down the runway.",
      "\"It was just incredibly fast. There was a giant firewall down the side. I could actually feel the heat through the glass,\" passenger John Nelson said.",
      "According to multiple aviation experts, the split-second loss of the wing \u2013 which holds half the jet's fuel \u2013 might have helped ensure the structural integrity of the cabin and the safety of passengers.",
      "\"If you are actually experiencing such a hard impact that you know the plane is crashing, which would have been the case here, then you would want it to snap off, because the alternative is that your fuselage would have been structurally the weakest point, in which case it would have crunched and torsioned,\" explained Ella Atkins, a Virginia Tech aerospace professor.",
      "'I was hanging by the seat belt'",
      "As the plane slowed to a stop, passengers found themselves hanging upside-down in the cabin. They were locked in place thanks to modern seats and belts that can withstand the force of the crash, experts said.",
      "\"I was hanging by the seat belt, which are very sturdy because I'm not a little fella. And, you know, everybody was helping their neighbor,\" said Erickson.",
      "The final factor that saved the lives of DL4819's passengers was likely its well-trained crew and the fast response from airport firefighters, experts said.",
      "\"When you have something that is so abnormal and so outside of what your psyche can kind of deal with, you go to your foundational knowledge,\" explained Finlayson. \"And that's what that's what you do as an airline employee, you have a strong foundational knowledge, so that way when emergencies happen, you just go to your instinct, and your instincts are to get people out safely.\"",
      "Many passengers reported the intense smell of jet fuel in the cabin. However, by 2:21 p.m. \u2013 less than 10 minutes after the crash landing \u2013 every passenger and crew member safely exited the plane, escaping before the fuel reignited.",
      "The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is beginning to uncover clues about the cause of the crash, though the investigation will likely take months to complete.",

      "The proposal hanging between the two countries comes at a critical time in the U.S. and Ukraine's relationship under the Trump administration and an even more critical time in the almost three-year war since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Zelenskyy's team was presented with the initial document with almost no warning when U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent visited Kyiv on Feb. 12, prompting widespread criticism that the Trump administration was seeking to strong-arm the country into an exploitative deal, a Ukrainian official said. The purported original draft document, reviewed by ABC News, contained no mention of future security guarantees for Ukraine, suggesting the country should give up access to its resources as payback for the American aid already rendered.",

      "A proposed agreement",
      "A couple of hours before Zelenskyy met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in Kyiv on Feb. 12, a proposed agreement from the U.S. asking Ukraine to agree to give the U.S. 50% of the revenue from some of its most valuable natural resources was sent over. Zelenskyy and his team had almost no time to review the document, but they were asked to sign it during the meeting that day, a Ukrainian official told ABC News.",
      "The official said Zelenskyy refused.",
      "Zelenskyy was due to meet two days later with Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Munich, Germany. But after Zelenskyy sent a revised proposal ahead of the meeting, Vance and Rubio threatened to cancel it, a Ukrainian official said. Zelenskyy's team asked them to read it first, the official said, and the meeting eventually went ahead. A U.S. official familiar with the discussions denied these details.",
      "An alleged draft document, reviewed by ABC News, of the initial proposal from the U.S. government dated Feb. 7 requests the U.S. government receive \"50% of the financial value received\" by the government of Ukraine from \"resources of Ukraine, including: mineral resources, oil and gas resources, ports\" and \"other infrastructure (as agreed),\" the draft document states. A U.S. official familiar with the matter said these details align with the US's initial proposal to Ukraine.",
      "The alleged draft document, at the top, states the U.S. \"has provided significant financial and material support to Ukraine since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in Feb. 2022.\"",
      "\"We won't confirm or deny terms of ongoing discussions. These discussions work best between the interested parties, not through the media,\" a White House official said when asked about the authenticity of the document.",
      "Trump has since slammed Zelensky for not signing the deal, on Wednesday accusing the Ukrainian President of treating Treasury Secretary Bessent rudely during his visit, claiming without evidence that Zelensky had kept Bessent waiting because he was \"sleeping.\"",
      "Trump officials on Thursday also defended the deal and said the President was \"frustrated\" that Zelenskyy was refusing to agree to what they called a \"historic opportunity.\"",
      "\"Look, President Trump is obviously very frustrated right now with President Zelenskyy. The fact that he hasn't come to the table, that he hasn't been willing to take this opportunity that we have offered. I think he eventually will get to that point, and I hope so very quickly.\" Trump's National Security Advisor Michael Waltz said Thursday at a White House briefing.",
      "\"There can be, in my view, nothing better, for Ukraine's future and for their security than to have the United States invested in their prosperity long term,\" Waltz said.",
      "It was unclear what changes the Ukrainian side had proposed during their discussions with Kellogg on Thursday.",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 05:01:32 -0500",
    "summary": "Republican senators pushed a $340 billion budget framework to passage over Democratic objections after a nearly all-night vote",

      "Republican senators pushed a $340 billion budget framework to passage over Democratic objections after a nearly all-night vote",
      "WASHINGTON -- Republican senators pushed a $340 billion budget framework to passage early Friday, chugging through an all-night session and Democratic opposition in a step toward unleashing money the Trump administration says it needs for mass deportations and border security that top their agenda.",
      "The hours-long \u201cvote-a-rama\u201d rambled along, in a dreaded, but crucial part of the budget process, as senators considered one amendment after another, largely from Democrats trying to halt it. But Republicans used their majority power to muscle the package to approval on a largely party-line vote, 52-48.",
      "\u201cWhat we're doing today is jumpstarting a process that will allow the Republican Party to meet President Trump's immigration agenda,\u201d Senate Budget Committee chair Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said while opening the debate.",
      "Graham said President Donald Trump's top immigration czar, Tom Homan, told senators that the administration's deportation operations are \u201cout of money\u201d and need more funding from Congress to detain and deport immigrants.",
      "With little power in the minority to stop the onslaught, Democrats instead used the all-night debate to force GOP senators into potentially embarrassing votes \u2014 including the first one, on blocking tax breaks to billionaires. It was turned back, on procedural grounds. So were many others.",
      "\u201cThis is going to be a long, drawn-out fight,\u201d warned Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York.",
      "The package is what Republicans view as a down payment on Trump\u2019s agenda, part of a broader effort that will eventually include legislation to extend some $4.5 trillion in tax breaks and other priorities. That's being assembled by House Speaker Mike Johnson in a separate budget package that also seeks up to $2 trillion in reductions to health care and other programs.",
      "Trump has preferred what he calls one \u201cbig, beautiful bill,\u201d but the White House is open to the Senate\u2019s strategy of working on the border package first, then turning to tax cuts later this year.",
      "As voting began, the president signaled his go-ahead, posting a thank you to Senate Majority Leader John Thune \u201cand the Republican Senate, for working so hard on funding the Trump Border Agenda.\u201d",
      "The Republican Senate package would allow up to $175 billion to be spent on border security, including money for mass deportation operations and building the U.S.-Mexico border wall, in addition to a $150 billion boost to the Pentagon and about $20 billion for the Coast Guard.",
      "But there won't be any money flowing just yet, as the process has several steps ahead. The budget resolution is simply a framework that sends instructions to the various Senate committees \u2014 Homeland Security, Armed Services, Judiciary \u2014 to hammer out the details. Everything will eventually be assembled in another package, with another vote-a-rama down the road.",
      "Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., the No. 2-ranking Senate Republican, said GOP lawmakers are acting quickly to get the administration the resources they have requested and need to curb illegal border crossings.",
      "\u201cThe budget will allow us to finish the wall. It also takes the steps we need toward more border agents,\u201d Barrasso said. \u201cIt means more detention beds. ... It means more deportation flights.\u201d",
      "Republicans insist the whole thing will be paid for, rather than piled onto debt, with potential spending cuts and new revenues.",
      "The committees are expected to consider rolling back the Biden administration\u2019s methane emissions fee, which was approved by Democrats as part of climate change strategies in the Inflation Reduction Act, and hoping to draw new revenue from energy leases as they aim to spur domestic energy production.",
      "One amendment that was accepted after several hours of debate was actually a Republican effort to fend off criticism that the package would be paid for by cutting safety net programs. The amendment from Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, said Medicaid and Medicare would be strengthened during the budget process.",
      "First up from Democrats was a vote to prevent tax breaks for billionaires \u2014 an amendment that was repeated in various forms throughout the night.",
      "Democrats argue that the GOP tax cuts approved in 2017 flowed to the wealthiest Americans, and extending them as Trump wants Congress to do later this year would prolong the giveaway. Even though the billionaire amendments failed, they picked up some Republican support. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine voted for several of them, and Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri voted for another.",
      "Schumer launched a strategy earlier this week to use the budget debate to focus on both the implications of the tax policy and the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, which is slashing across the federal government.",
      "It's a better approach for Democrats than arguing against tougher border security and deportations, which divides the party.",
      "All told, senators processed almost three dozen amendments on reversing DOGE cuts, protecting federal workers from being fired, ensuring U.S. support for Ukraine as it battles Russia and others.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said the single biggest driver of the national debt since 2001 has been a series of Republican-led tax cuts.",
      "\u201cAnd you\u2019ll never guess what our Republican colleagues on the other side of the aisle are focused on right now, nothing to lower the cost of eggs, it\u2019s actually more Republican tax cuts,\u201d Murray said.",
      "She called the budget plan a \u201croadmap for painful cuts to programs families count on each and every day, all so they can give billionaires more tax cuts.\u201d",
      "The budget resolution is setting up what's called the reconciliation process, which used to be rare, but is now the tool often used to pass big bills on party-line votes when one party has control of the White House and Congress, as Republicans do now.",
      "But Republicans are arguing with themselves over how to proceed. The House is marching ahead on its \u201cbig, beautiful bill,\u201d believing they have one chance to get it right. The Senate views its two-bill strategy as more practical, delivering on border security first, then turning to taxes later.",
      "Budget rules allow for passage by a simple majority vote, which is key in the Senate, where it typically takes 60 votes to break a filibuster on big items. During Trump\u2019s first term, Republicans used the reconciliation process to pass GOP tax cuts in 2017. Democrats used reconciliation during Joe Biden's presidency to approve COVID-19 relief and the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "Trump appears to be stirring the fight, pitting Republicans in the House and Senate against each other to see which one delivers fastest.",

    "summary": "A judge has denied labor unions' request to temporarily block the administration from carrying out mass firing of probationary employees and deferred resignation offers.",
    "story": [
      "The judge said the court \"likely lacks subject matter jurisdiction.\"",
      "A federal judge has denied federal labor unions' request to temporarily block the Trump administration from carrying out mass firing of probationary employees and deferred resignation offers, saying the court \"likely lacks subject matter jurisdiction\" over the matter.",
      "Instead, Judge Christopher Cooper, overseeing the matter, wrote in his ruling that the matter should be brought before the Federal Labor Relations Authority.",
      "\"The Court will now deny the motion because it likely lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the unions' claims,\" the judge wrote.",
      "\"They must pursue their challenges instead through the scheme established by Congress in the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute ('FSLMRS'), which provides for administrative review by the Federal Labor Relations Authority ('FLRA') in the first instance, followed by judicial review in the courts of appeals,\" he added.",
      "The ruling comes after a status hearing on Tuesday in which the judge questioned the plaintiffs, which consisted of five federal unions, including the National Treasury Employees Union, about why they would bring the case before the court instead of going to the FLRA.",
      "During the hearing, the Treasury Department employee union contended that it brought the case to court instead of going to the FLRA because of the scale of the firings and the urgency of the situation.",
      "In his ruling, however, the judge wrote: \"NTEU claims that the relief it seeks would be harder to get if it proceeds first before the FLRA, not that it has a right to avoid proceeding before the FLRA at all.\"",
      "\"The Court acknowledges that district court review of these sweeping executive actions may be more expedient. But NTEU provides no reason why it could not seek relief from the FLRA on behalf of a class of plaintiffs and admits that it would ask other agencies to follow an administrative judge's ruling in its favor,\" he added.",
      "The suit, filed last week, is one of several lawsuits challenging Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency's large-scale effort to slash the federal workforce.",
      "The suit alleged the Trump administration's effort to fire massive numbers of federal employees across multiple agencies, including its recent deferred resignation offer to more than 2 million federal employees, violates Congress' power to establish a federal workforce, as well as federal procedures that dictate how the workforce should be reduced.",
      "\"The Executive Branch acting as the 'woodchipper for bureaucracy' conflicts with Congress's role as the creator, funder, and mission setter for the executive branch agencies,\" the lawsuit said.",
      "The unions, which represent hundreds of thousands of employees across dozens of federal agencies and departments, sought a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, claiming that the mass reduction of the federal workforce would lead to a \"critical\" loss of revenues for unions, as well as their influence at the bargaining table.",
      "The National Treasury Employees Union, the unions claimed, stands to lose \"as much as half of its dues revenue and around half of the workers that it represents.\"",
      "Lawyers with the Department of Justice pushed back against the allegations, arguing that an order blocking the changes would \"interfere with the President's ability to manage, shape, and streamline the federal workforce to more closely reflect policy preferences and the needs of the American public.\"",
      "\"The President is charged with directing the Executive Branch workforce, and he has determined that the politically accountable heads of his agencies should take steps to streamline and modernize the workforce through measures including voluntary deferred resignations, removal of certain probationary employees, and RIFs [reductions in force],\" the Justice Department wrote in a court filing.",
      "The government also claimed that Trump's executive action ordering the reductions is \"consistent with applicable law\" and dismissed the unions' concerns over their potential loss of revenues and bargaining power as \"speculative.\"",
      "Since Trump returned to the White House, Musk has been spearheading efforts to reduce the size of government, slash thousands of federal contracts, cut programs deemed to be wasteful and root out fraud.",
      "After ending its deferred resignation offer earlier this month amid court battles challenging the program, the Trump administration has begun layoffs by targeting mostly probationary employees -- recent hires who joined the federal workforce within the last one to two years, depending on the agency, and have fewer protections.",
      "This initial round of layoffs could affect more than 200,000 workers hired by the federal government within the last two years, according to data from the Office of Personnel Management.",

    "story": [
      "Workers caught up in the mass firings have received conflicting information.",
      "When Laura, a federal employee for the Department of Agriculture in the Midwest, got an email offering her a chance to resign with pay through September or otherwise face the prospect of termination, she took it.",
      "Laura had been in rural development, helping people access home ownership, for about six months. She knew mass terminations were likely to effect her because she was a probationary worker, a government status for employees with less than a year in their role.",
      "\"I saw the writing on the wall,\" said Laura, who declined to use her last name out of fear of retaliation.",
      "But one week after she received confirmation of her acceptance into the \"deferred resignation program,\" she woke up to an email informing her she'd been terminated anyway.",
      "\"No phone call, no nothing,\" she said. Then, like many federal employees, Laura immediately lost access to her work communications.",
      "Laura is part of a group of federal employees across multiple agencies who were suddenly fired last week due to their probationary status, despite having accepted the offer from a government-wide email titled \"Fork in the Road.\"",
      "The federal workers have since faced days of conflicting information from their agencies about their futures, with many, like Laura, in the dark without access to their work email.",
      "Roughly 200,000 government employees were categorized as probationary, the group targeted by the Trump administration's first wave of mass firings last week. Neither the White House nor the federal agencies have publicly disclosed how many of them were laid off, and within that group, it's not clear how many people were mistakenly terminated despite accepting the \"Fork in the Road\" offer, which about 75,000 workers did, according to the White House.",
      "Some federal workers have since been contacted by their agencies on their personal email and cell phone, informing them that they still qualify and need to opt-in again by Friday. But they worry that others who were terminated will slip through the cracks, unaware that they can still qualify for the deferred resignation program.",
      "\"It's all very disorganized,\" Laura said. \"My best piece of advice is definitely reach out to your leadership.\"",
      "For Laura, it was only through her own patchwork research that she found out that she might still be eligible for the offer and then called her supervisor, who confirmed.",
      "She'd found a colleague on LinkedIn, Nick Detter, who worked as a natural resource specialist for the Department of Agriculture in Kansas. Detter, also a probationary employee, had taken the deferred resignation program for the same reason as Laura -- and, like her, still received a termination notice.",
      "But Detter had refused to turn in his work laptop, hanging on to his email communications until there was more clarity on the deferred resignation program.",
      "Detter told Laura he'd received an email on Tuesday afternoon, days after she'd been terminated and had to turn in her access to work communications, which said that the department \"intend[ed] to honor the terms of the [deferred resignation program].\"",
      "Detter, who'd spoken to multiple news outlets about his situation, continued to get a flood of messages from colleagues who were in the same position.",
      "One colleague said his supervisor had explicitly told him that probationary employees were never supposed to qualify for the deferred resignation program, so to take the termination letter as final.",
      "But then Detter and his colleagues received another email, nearly a week after their initial terminations, apologizing for the \"lack of, or conflicting information\" and the \"confusion\" that being fired may have caused.",
      "\"This notice serves to clarify that as an employee on probationary or trial period status who may have opted into the Deferred Resignation Program (DRP), you are NOW eligible to participate in DRP,\" the email said.",
      "\"We apologize for the lack of, or conflicting information, surrounding the DRP and any confusion your termination notice may have caused.\"",
      "The email instructed recipients to reply by Feb. 21 with \"your continued intention to participate,\" and said employees would be reinstated by Feb. 24.",
      "Still, many questions remain for the federal workers, like whether they'll receive a paycheck for the days they were unsure of their work status, or whether they can have confidence that they'll receive one going forward.",
      "Already, the process had been tumultuous. They had watched as the Office of Personnel Management, the human resources arm of the government, sent FAQs reassuring federal workers that the program was legitimate and encouraging them to take it. Billionaire Elon Musk, who had sent a near-identical email to employees at Twitter after he took it over, also enthusiastically supported the offer.",
      "But many unions pushed back, warning their employees that there was no precedent for such a move and that people who accepted it could be left high and dry. A legal challenge delayed the program timeline, pausing it and pushing the deadline to accept the offer to Feb. 12, but ultimately allowing it to proceed. And then, mass terminations across dozens of agencies began.",
      "\"I don't know that I have a ton of confidence in the offer after this experience,\" Laura said. At this point, she said, she's holding on to the benefit of being able to at least say she resigned, rather than was terminated, if she needs to filed for unemployment or apply for other jobs.",
      "Detter said he initially had high hopes for the restructuring outlined in the Fork in the Road email, encouraged by pledges to increase efficiency and have more merit-based systems for promotions and pay.",
      "\"But in my experience over the last month with this whole thing, that's not what this has been. This has just been slash and burn,\" he said.",
      "Even after receiving the email apologizing for the mistake, a lawyer for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, said he still felt that he was in the same situation as when he'd first been fired a week ago.",
      "The former CFPB employee said he took the deferred resignation offer because he was working remotely, which the Fork in the Road email warned would no longer be tolerated. As the primary income earner for his wife and young children, he wanted to \"play it conservatively,\" he said.",
      "\"But the sand keeps shifting every day,\" he said.",
      "Though his supervisors have told him that he will now get the deferred resignation offer despite his termination last Tuesday and he has signed a contract, he said there is reason to be skeptical.",
      "He's watching closely for his next paycheck, and he worries about the future of his agency, which has been all but shuttered by the Trump administration in the last few weeks.",
      "\"If our agency is fully dismantled and the assets end up being moved away, I don't know what my agency is paying me with,\" he said.",
      "\"I'm effectively in the same position I was a week ago when I was just terminated, feeling like I need to support a family of four. I still need to find a job, I still need to find a sure thing,\" he said.",

      "The stampede of Argentines traveling abroad for their summer vacations is driven by several factors, including the recent devaluation of various foreign currencies, the convenience of nearby destinations accessible by car and the prohibitively high cost of domestic vacations, especially along the Argentine Atlantic coast.",

      "The move is designed to give President Donald Trump an early policy win and put pressure on House Republicans to join rather than pursue a separate, more comprehensive effort that also risks taking far longer to pass, if at all.",
      "Trump undercut the Senate GOP's efforts on Wednesday, calling on both chambers to pass the House budget resolution. \u201cThe House Resolution implements my FULL America First Agenda, EVERYTHING, not just parts of it,\u201d Trump wrote on social media.",

      "The resolution is not a bill and does not get signed into law by the president, but its passage unlocks a process that allows Republicans to enact their priorities later this year even if Democrats unanimously oppose it.",

      "The budget resolution advanced out of committee last week on a party-line vote. It directs the Senate Homeland Security Committee to increase spending by up to $175 billion, the Senate Armed Services Committee to spend up to $150 billion more and the Senate Commerce panel to increase spending by about $20 billion. This is on top of the annual spending that Congress provides through a separate legislative process.",
      "\u201cBuild the wall, deport illegal aliens, and create additional detention space so we don\u2019t have to release illegal immigrants into the community,\" Graham said. \u201cAnd God knows the military needs more money in these dangerous times.\u201d",
      "The Senate proceeded to Graham's budget plan on Tuesday evening, opening it up to 50 hours of debate. Once the debate time has expired \u2014 but before a vote on final passage \u2014 senators will hold what's known in Congress as a \u201cvote-arama.\u201d It's a whirlwind series of votes over several hours in which senators seek to amend the plan.",
      "The votes often last into the early morning hours before exhausted lawmakers decide they've had enough and move to a final vote.",
      "The amendments often are designed to force lawmakers from the other party to take difficult votes on hot-button issues that could prove difficult to explain in the next election cycle.",

      "Once a budget plan is approved, committees would draft legislation consistent with their instructions to find savings or increase spending in programs under their jurisdiction. But the formal work needed to advance those recommendations can't take place until both the House and Senate pass identical budget plans.",
      "At some point, Republicans in the House and Senate will have to resolve their differences for them to use the tool that will allow the package to pass with a simple majority in the Senate and sidestep a Democratic filibuster. For now, they are competing with each other to win Trump's favor.",
      "The House does have momentum for its efforts after a few weeks of delay. The chamber's Budget panel has advanced its more comprehensive budget plan to the floor on a party-line vote.

The Department of Health and Human Services Department, which oversees unaccompanied migrant children, did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "At a San Diego immigration court Wednesday, a 5-year-old girl from Mexico facing deportation sat before Judge Olga Attia. Attia asked if the girl could have some coloring books \u2014 \u201cthat may be a little more fun,\u201d she told her.",
      "As the girl drew, the judge explained the case to her, her 13-year-old sister and her 15-year-old brother. All three children were arrested for crossing the border illegally, without their parents, in March 2024. Their mother attended the hearing -- she entered the U.S. at a different time than her children, who have their own immigration cases.",
      "And they were navigating it all without a lawyer.",
      "The mother said they couldn't afford one. Attia recommended a nonprofit that might give guidance and scheduled another hearing in May.",
      "But with the contract that was ended Tuesday, options for affordable legal guidance are narrowing for this family and thousands of others involving unaccompanied children.",
      "Acacia has a network of 85 organizations nationwide that work with children under 18. About 26,000 migrant children get direct legal representation under the contract while roughly 100,000 get some kind of legal advice, often through presentations lawyers hold for children while they are in government-run shelters just after arriving in the U.S.",
      "People fighting deportation do not have the same right to representation as people going through criminal courts, although they can hire private attorneys.",
      "But there has been some recognition that children navigating the immigration court system without a parent or guardian are especially vulnerable.",
      "The Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2008 created special protections for children who arrive in the U.S. without a parent or a legal guardian. It said the government should facilitate legal representation for the children put into deportation proceedings, though it did not mandate every child have a lawyer.",
      "Acacia and its subcontractors recruit and train lawyers and work with private attorneys who provide free legal representation for the children.",
      "Unaccompanied children can request asylum, juvenile immigration status, or visas for victims of sexual exploitation. Most of the children don\u2019t speak English and need interpreters.",
      "\u201cYou have these kids who are thrust into this adult-like situation with very severe consequences,\u201d said Jennifer Podkul, vice president for policy and advocacy at Kids In Need of Defense, citing that about 50% of children have legal representation in immigration court.",
      "Children will be stuck in the system or off the grid, and cases won't be processed, attorneys and experts said.",
      "Melissa L. Lopez is executive director of a group that receives funding through the program that was suspended, and she said they have a legal and ethical obligation to continue helping the estimated 2,000 children they represent.",
      "\u201cWe will do what is best for our clients,\u201d said Lopez, of El Paso, Texas-based Estrella del Paso. The group also gives legal presentations in shelters so children know their rights, but they've been barred from doing that, she said.",
      "\u201cThey will be expected to go to court alone and uninformed,\u201d she said.",

      "The flight of 135 deportees, half of them minors, added Costa Rica to a growing list of Latin American nations to serve as a stopover for migrants as U.S. President Donald Trump \u2019s administration seeks to step up deportations.",
      "While Costa Rica joins Panama in holding deportees from mostly Asian origin until their repatriation can be arranged or they can seek protection somewhere, Honduras on Thursday also facilitated a handoff of deportees between the U.S. and Venezuela from a flight coming from Guantanamo Bay.",

The U.S. government will cover the costs.",
      "The arrangement is part of a deal the Trump administration struck with Costa Rica during U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's visit earlier this month.

      "Panama this week became the first such country to accept 299 deportees from other nations, with the government holding them in hotel rooms guarded by police. About one-third of those who refused to voluntarily return to their countries were sent to a remote camp in Darien province bordering Colombia on Wednesday. The rest were awaiting commercial flights back home.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve thrown out the possibility of a hotel, precisely to avoid a situation similar to that in Panama,\u201d Badilla, the Costa Rican official, told The Associated Press.",

      "A U.S. flight carrying 170 Venezuelans landed Thursday in a joint U.S.-Honduran military base in central Honduras, and within hours were transferred to a Venezuelan aircraft. An official with Honduras\u2019 foreign ministry said this was not a routine arrangement, but that the Central American nation remains open to facilitating more transfers between the two adversaries.",
      "Badilla said that Thursday's deportation flight from San Diego is largely made up of families, including 65 children, two pregnant women and an elderly woman. He said Costa Rica was told by the Trump administration that most of the deportees have agreed to voluntarily return to their countries.",
      "If they refuse, Costa Rica is open to offering deportees refuge or will work with the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration, IOM, to facilitate travel to another third country.",
      "\u201cCosta Rica is a country that guarantees human rights,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to guarantee that they are returned to safe countries. We cannot leave that to chance because of an ethical and moral commitment of our country.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, migrants will be detained in the border facility, where they will be accompanied by U.N. officials, the Red Cross and other aid-focused government entities to \u201cguarantee their rights,\u201d Badilla said.",
      "The facility being used to hold migrants, a former factory, has faced criticisms for its conditions in the past.",
      "During a visit by the AP in October 2023, migrants were fenced off in cramped facilities and said they felt like \u201cprisoners.\u201d Many slept in tents on the ground, where some said liquid from portable toilets leaked. Badilla said that facilities have since been improved, but the government has denied journalists access to the building.",
      "The facility will also be processing a \u201creverse flow\u201d of migrants from Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador that previously sought asylum in the U.S. and now want to return home. Badilla said Costa Rica has seen between 50 and 75 migrants headed south entering the country a day.",

      "Among the defendants in the lawsuit are the departments of State and Health and Human Services as well as their respective secretaries, Marco Rubio and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Both departments have roles in delegating resettlement work to the bishops conference.",

      "Vice President JD Vance, a Catholic convert, recently accused the bishops conference of resettling \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d in order to get millions in federal funding \u2014 an apparent reference to the resettlement program, which involves actually legally approved refugees.",
      "Vance followed up his criticisms by appealing to Catholic teaching as justifying immigration restrictions. That drew rejoinders not only from U.S. bishops but an implicit rebuke from Pope Francis, who said Christian charity requires helping those in need, not just those in one\u2019s closest circles.",

    "story": [
      "David Boren, the former Oklahoma governor and longtime U.S. Senate intelligence chief who went on to lead the University of Oklahoma after his retirement from politics, has died",
      "OKLAHOMA CITY -- Former Oklahoma Gov. David Boren, who became one of the nation's youngest governors in the 1970s at age 33 and later helped shape national intelligence as a U.S. senator, has died. He was 83.",
      "Boren, who went on to serve as president of the University of Oklahoma after retiring from politics, died early Thursday at his home near Newcastle, said Bob Burke, a longtime family friend. He said Boren's death was the result of complications from diabetes.",
      "The son of a Democratic congressman, Boren quickly followed in his father's footsteps into elected office and oversaw a dramatic downsizing of government in Oklahoma, where over decades in legislative corridors and university offices he became one of the state's most influential figures. His son, Dan Boren, also served four terms as an Oklahoma congressman.",
      "In 2019, David Boren cut ties with the university he had led for 24 years amid a probe into allegations that he had sexually harassed male subordinates. Boren denied wrongdoing and the allegations never resulted in charges or civil litigation.",
      "\u201cHe was the smartest person I ever knew,\u201d Burke, an attorney and author who managed Boren\u2019s first campaign for the U.S. Senate in 1978. \u201cHe was a Rhodes Scholar, yet he could communicate with a farmer in overalls on the Main Street of a small Oklahoma town.",
      "\u201cNo Oklahoman had more influence on the state\u2019s progress in its first century than David Boren,\u201d he said.",
      "Boren served in the U.S. Senate between 1979 and 1994 and was the longest-serving chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. He became president of Oklahoma's largest public university after leaving the Senate and held the position until stepping down in 2018.",
      "\u201cHe saw public service as a noble calling and dedicated his life to it,\u201d Boren's son, Dan Boren, said in a statement. \"The countless heartwarming stories I hear almost daily from people across this state who he helped are reminders of his remarkable life. We shall cherish the memory of his service and remarkable life.\u201d",
      "A year after leaving the University of Oklahoma, a former student alleged he was touched and kissed inappropriately by Boren on several occasions about a decade earlier, allegations that Boren repeatedly denied.",
      "An investigation into Boren\u2019s alleged misconduct by the Jones Day law firm, which ended when Boren severed ties to the university in 2019, was never publicly released. The allegations against Boren tarnished his reputation and led him to withdraw from public life.",
      "Boren served four terms in the Oklahoma House before being elected governor at the age of 33 in 1974, which at the time made him the youngest governor in the country. He ran a reformist campaign that became known as the \u201cBoren Broom Brigade\u201d to demonstrate his pledge to \u201csweep out the old guard.\u201d",
      "As governor, Boren worked to eliminate the inheritance tax, cut the state income tax and reorganize a state government he described as \u201ccluttered\u201d with 214 boards, agencies and commissions.",
      "\u201cThis excessive red tape in government is a constant drain on taxpayer dollars,\u201d Boren once said, adding that the government needed to \u201cget out of the horse and buggy era.\u201d",
      "While in the U.S. Senate, Boren forged close relationships with the leaders of the nation's intelligence community, including former CIA Director George Tenet, whom Boren tapped as the Intelligence Committee's chief of staff prior to Tenet's appointment as CIA director.",
      "On the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, Boren was having breakfast with Tenet at a Washington hotel when Tenet, then CIA director, learned that an aircraft had flown into the World Trade Center tower in New York City. Boren later recalled that neither he nor Tenet was \u201ctotally shocked\u201d by the terrorist attack because the two men had spoken frequently about the possibility of international terrorists launching an attack in the U.S.",
      "\u201cI thought George was obsessed with Osama bin Laden and terrorism around the world,\u201d Boren told The Oklahoman months after the attacks. \u201cI don\u2019t think everything changed Sept. 11; only our perception and understanding changed.\u201d",
      "In the Senate, Boren also helped build bipartisan support to oppose South Africa's oppressive racial apartheid regime ahead of Nelson Mandela\u2019s release from prison in 1990. Shortly after his release, Mandela traveled to the U.S. and appeared as a guest on an ABC News town hall moderated by Ted Koppel. Boren was in the audience and Mandela led a standing ovation after Boren summed up the evils of apartheid and called for its end.",
      "\u201cHe has said all the things that are required to be said in regards to the problems of South Africa,\u201d Mandela said.",
      "During his tenure in the U.S. Senate, Boren also said he was heavily involved with helping influence U.S. policy in Central America, particularly in Nicaragua, during conflict in that country between the right-wing Contras and the leftist Sandinistas, working as an \u201cinformal emissary\u201d for former President George H.W. Bush.",
      "\u201cThe fact that I was in a different party \u2014 and the fact that we trusted each other -- was a big benefit,\u201d Boren told The Oklahoman in 1994.",
      "In 2016, Boren spearheaded a campaign in Oklahoma to adopt a 1 percent sales tax increase that would have raised about $550 million annually for public education, including pay raises for school teachers who were at the time among the lowest paid in the nation. But it was defeated in a statewide referendum.",
      "David Lyle Boren was born on April 21, 1941, in Washington, the son of U.S. Rep. Lyle Hagler Boren and the former Christine McKown. He was married twice, to the late Janna Little Robbins and then to Molly Shi Boren, a former judge, English teacher and president emeritus of the Oklahoma Arts Institute.",
      "Boren suffered from a minor stroke at a statue dedication ceremony in April 2018 and was hospitalized for several days. Boren also underwent heart bypass surgery in March 2017.",
      "Boren is survived by two children, including Dan Boren, the former Oklahoma congressman who is currently secretary of commerce for the Chickasaw Nation.",

      "Trump has thrown the decades long partnership between the U.S. and Europe into turmoil by pledging to charge higher taxes on imports from Europe that he says would match the tariffs faced by American products.",
      "But Trump's plan for fair tariffs would also include the value added tax \u2014 which is akin to a sales tax \u2014 charged in Europe that could drastically push up import taxes and potentially trigger a broader trade conflict if the EU imposed retaliatory measures. A broader trade war risks both an economic slowdown and higher inflation that could create financial challenges for millions of families and potentially hurt political support for Trump, as voters in 2024's election specifically wanted him to lower price pressures.",
      "Trump has also proposed separate sectoral tariffs on autos, pharmaceutical drugs and computer chips, in addition to having already imposed 25% steel and aluminum tariffs with no avenues to provide exceptions or exemptions.",
      "The EU official tried in his conversation with White House officials to equate the value added tax as similar to a sales tax as its paid by the final consumer, but he said that the issue had not been resolved.",
      "\u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d also said they discussed the industrial overcapacity of China, particularly in steel, and that the U.S. and EU should work together to tackle that problem, instead of targeting each other.",

      "\u201cI\u2019m glad that it happened and that we could have such an intense meeting,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, I think we will both be thinking how to keep the momentum going on and how to hopefully avoid I would say, the pain.\u201d"

      "Mangione also faces federal charges that could carry the possibility of the death penalty. He is being held in a Brooklyn federal jail alongside several other high-profile defendants, including Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs and Sam Bankman-Fried.",
      "Prosecutors have said the two cases will proceed on parallel tracks, with the state charges expected to go to trial first. The maximum sentence for the state charges is life in prison without parole. A Feb. 24 hearing in Pennsylvania on charges of possessing an unlicensed firearm, forgery and providing false identification to police was canceled.",

    "story": [
      "California state lawmakers have announced a bill that would ban the sale of new or refurbished disposable electronic cigarettes",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California could ban the sale of disposable vapes under a bill lawmakers announced Wednesday that is aimed at curbing plastic pollution in the state.",
      "The state has also passed laws in recent years banning single-use plastic bottles in hotels, the sale of Styrofoam food containers and single-use plastic carryout bags at grocery stores.",
      "Vapes, sometimes called electronic cigarettes, are battery-operated devices that contain aerosolized nicotine or cannabis, often with flavorings and other chemicals. Refillable and disposable options are sold, and California's proposal would specifically tackle those that are meant to be thrown away after a single use.",
      "Other countries have considered or approved bans on single-use vape sales, with one taking effect in Belgium on Jan. 1 and another set to begin in the United Kingdom in June. But California would likely be the first U.S. state to enact such a rule. Previous efforts in California and New York have failed.",
      "The California bill would ban the sale or distribution of new or refurbished disposable vapes in the state, beginning Jan. 1, 2026. The proposal would allow local governments or the state to fine people $500 for their first violation of the ban, $1,000 for their second infringement and $2,000 for subsequent offenses.",
      "Assemblymember Jacqui Irwin, who authored the bill, said it will help prevent battery acid from single-use vapes from leaching into lands and waterways.",
      "\u201cWe must transition away from these harmful single-use devices, and AB 762 will do just that,\u201d the Southern California Democrat said at a news conference in Sacramento.",
      "The California Grocers Association argued against a similar 2022 proposal, saying that it could lead to increased tobacco smuggling.",
      "Arkan Somo, who co-founded the Neighborhood Market Association, a group of California small businesses, said the new bill would burden family-owned shops that sell tobacco products.",
      "\u201cIf we're going to take the environment as an excuse to keep banning these products, where is that going to stop?\u201d Somo said. \u201cThey're really putting California at a huge disadvantage.\u201d",
      "The state has approved other measures in recent years regulating vape sales. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law in 2020 that banned the sale of most flavored tobacco products with the goal of preventing their use among children.",
      "Many of the recent vape regulations in states have been targeted at addressing risks they pose to public health. California and more than 30 other states have passed laws requiring a tax on e-cigarettes, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. All states in the U.S. already ban the sale of e-cigarettes to minors.",
      "\u201cWhile these products pollute our planet, they're also targeting our most vulnerable among us \u2014 our children,\u201d said Tony Hackett, a policy associate with Californians Against Waste, a nonprofit group supporting the bill. \u201cDisposable vapes are designed for maximum addiction and minimum accountability.\u201d",
      "Part of the appeal of disposable vapes is that they are often more easily accessible and cheaper than refillable devices, said Carolina Saavedra, a staff attorney with the Public Health Law Center at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law in Minnesota.",
      "But waste from e-cigarettes can contain heavy metals, hazardous lithium-ion batteries that can spark fires and chemical toxins, according to the CDC. The California bill is an \u201cexciting step\u201d to tackle that problem, Saavedra said.",
      "\u201cContinuing to push this conversation and highlight the costliness of this problem and how little \u2014 if any \u2014 benefits at all these items bring, that's going to be huge,\u201d she said.",

      "A Michigan appeals court has ruled that Enbridge Energy's plans to build a tunnel around an aging pipeline that runs beneath a Great Lakes channel can continue",
      "Enbridge Energy's plans to build a protective tunnel around an aging pipeline that runs beneath a channel connecting two Great Lakes can continue, a Michigan appeals court ruled.",
      "The state Public Service Commission properly issued permits for the $500 million project, the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled Wednesday in rejecting arguments from environmental groups and Native American tribes that commissioners failed to consider the overall need for the pipeline.",
      "Enbridge wants to build a protective tunnel around a 4-mile (6-kilometer) section of its Line 5 pipeline that runs along the bottom of the Straits of Mackinac, which link Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. Enbridge has been using the pipeline since 1953 to transport crude oil and natural gas liquids between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario.",
      "Concerns about a potentially catastrophic spill in the straits have been building since 2017, when Enbridge officials revealed that engineers had known about gaps in the pipeline's coating in the straits since 2014. Fears of a spill escalated in 2018 when a boat anchor damaged the line.",
      "Enbridge officials maintain that the line is structurally sound, but they still reached an agreement with then-Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder\u2019s administration in 2018 that calls for the company to build the protective tunnel.",
      "The Michigan Public Service Commission issued state permits for the project in December 2023. Environmental groups including the Michigan Environmental Council and the National Wildlife Federation, along with the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, Bay Mills Indian Community, Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, and the Nottawseppi Huron band of the Potawatomi asked the appellate court last year to reverse the commission's decision.",
      "The groups and the tribes alleged that the commission improperly considered only the public need for the tunnel rather than whether the entire pipeline as a whole is still necessary. They also argued the commission failed to adequately consider petroleum products' greenhouse gas impacts.",
      "The appellate court found that the commission issued a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d opinion and acted reasonably. It said there was no basis for a reversal or to order the commission to revisit its decision.",
      "David Scott, a senior attorney for the Environmental Law & Policy Center and the Michigan Climate Action Network, which are also plaintiffs in the case, said in an email that he was disappointed with the ruling and considering further moves. He didn't elaborate. Enbridge spokesperson Ryan Duffy praised the decision, saying the tunnel will make a safe pipeline even safer.",
      "The ruling Wednesday doesn't end the legal battle over the tunnel. Current Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, opposes the continued operation of Line 5 even if it's encased in a tunnel. Democratic Attorney General Dana Nessel filed a lawsuit in 2019 seeking to void the easement that allows the line to run beneath the straits. That case is pending in state court in Ingham County. A ruling could come any day.",
      "Enbridge still needs federal construction permits from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, although environmentalists fear that President Donald Trump's administration will fast-track that process after Trump declared a national energy emergency on his first day in office."

      "SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective, which is the lead plaintiff, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Its lawyers at the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia did not immediately have a comment on the ruling.",
      "McBurney had ruled in September that Georgia unconstitutionally prohibits abortions beyond about six weeks of pregnancy, often before women realize they are pregnant. McBurney reasoned that privacy rights under Georgia\u2019s state constitution include the right to make personal healthcare decisions.",
      "Georgia\u2019s law, signed by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp in 2019, was one of a wave of restrictive abortion measures that took effect in Republican-controlled states after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and ended a national right to abortion. It prohibits most abortions once a \u201cdetectable human heartbeat\u201d was present. At around six weeks into a pregnancy, cardiac activity can be detected by ultrasound in an embryo\u2019s cells that will eventually become the heart.",
      "Twelve U.S. states are now enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, and four states ban abortions around the sixth week of pregnancy. Voters in Missouri overturned a near total ban on abortions in November, and abortions resumed there last week.",
      "McBurney wrote in his ruling that \u201cliberty in Georgia includes in its meaning, in its protections, and in its bundle of rights the power of a woman to control her own body, to decide what happens to it and in it, and to reject state interference with her healthcare choices.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen a fetus growing inside a woman reaches viability, when society can assume care and responsibility for that separate life, then \u2014 and only then \u2014 may society intervene,\u201d McBurney wrote.",

      "An Arkansas woman whose stillborn child was among the human remains that were sold as part of a national scheme is pushing for a state law",
      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- A year had passed since Doneysha Smith suffered a stillbirth and the memories of her loss lingered in 2023. The cremated remains of her child were kept in a tiny urn in her house and on a necklace she wore, and a memorial service had marked her family's loss with mourners releasing blue, white and yellow balloons into the sky.",
      "But the FBI had reached out to the Arkansas woman with shocking news: The urn and necklace didn't contain her child's ashes and the body had been sold as part of a multistate scheme that bought and sold human remains.",
      "\u201cMy son wasn't even able to get to his final resting place,\u201d Smith said during an interview at her home in Sherwood, located outside Little Rock.",
      "Now Smith and her mother are advocating for a new law in Arkansas that would make selling human remains that were supposed to be cremated or buried a felony. The proposal is called Lux's Law, after the name she gave her child. The Senate passed the measure this week and it's pending before a House panel.",
      "Candace Chapman Scott, a former mortuary worker, pleaded guilty in federal court last year to charges that she sold 24 boxes of stolen body parts and fetal remains to a Pennsylvania man for nearly $11,000. The remains included Lux's body.",
      "Scott, who was sentenced last month to 15 years in federal prison, was among several charged in what prosecutors have called a nationwide scheme to steal and sell human body parts from an Arkansas mortuary and Harvard Medical School.",
      "State Sen. Fred Love, a Democrat from Little Rock, said he introduced the measure after speaking with Smith's mother, Lynnell Logan, at a community event and learning there weren't any state laws specifically barring the sale of stolen human remains.",
      "Love said such a law is needed at the state level, noting how the scheme included people in multiple states exchanging messages and pictures on Facebook about the body parts being sold. Love's proposal calls for a fine of up to $10,000 and between three and 10 years in prison for anyone convicted.",
      "\u201cThis is another form of trafficking,\u201d Love said. \u201cWe must do something to stop it.\u201d",
      "Smith and her mother said the news that Lux's body had been sold and that the ashes they received weren't his reopened wounds. To this day, the family doesn't know whether the ashes they received were human remains, Logan said.",
      "\u201cIt was like reliving his passing all over again and then you're thinking about how he was shipped everywhere, and who all handled him,\u201d Logan said. \u201cWho would do this to a baby?\u201d",
      "Only eight states broadly prohibit the sale of human remains, according to Tanya Marsh, a law professor at Wake Forest University School of Law who is an expert in laws regarding human remains.",
      "The Arkansas proposal isn't as broad as those measures since it only applies to bodies that were intended to be cremated or buried. Arkansas already has laws prohibiting the \u201cabuse of a corpse.\u201d",
      "Minnesota last year enacted a law making it a felony to buy and sell human bones, and the lawmaker behind the measure cited examples of oddities shops and websites selling human skulls.",
      "Many people are surprised when they learn that there's a private market for human remains, Marsh said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s such a shadow area of commerce that most of us don't have exposure to this,\u201d Marsh said.",
      "Lux's remains have been returned to Smith, and his ashes now are in a tiny urn inside a lantern that sits on the mantle.",
      "\u201cWhen tomorrow starts without me don't think we're far apart for every time you think of me I'm right here in your heart,\u201d the glass door of the lantern read.",
      "Smith also has a gold necklace that contains some of his ashes, and she keeps it on a teddy bear in her bedroom when she's not wearing it. The FBI returned Lux's body to the family the same day as last year's eclipse \u2014 something the family views as symbolic.",

      "But the figure was much lower than the \u00a320.5bn predicted by the UK's official forecaster, reigniting speculation that Rachel Reeves will either have to cut public spending or raise taxes further next month to meet her self-imposed rules for the economy.",
      "The government reiterated on Friday that its so-called fiscal rules were \"non-negotiable\".",
      "The chancellor has two main rules which she has argued will bring stability to the UK economy:",

      "At the same time, Reeves will announce her Spring Forecast.",
      "Last October, the watchdog said she had \u00a39.9bn in headroom to meet her rules following her first Budget.",

      "Isabel Stockton, senior research economist at the IFS, said: \"This extra borrowing in the short term is coupled with the promise of fiscal restraint in future, but it remains to be seen whether this will be enough to meet her 'non-negotiable' fiscal rules without further tax rises or even tighter spending plans.",
      "\"If \u2013 and it is still very much an if \u2013 the forecast moves against the chancellor, she'll face a truly unenviable set of choices, none of which are made easier by the upwards pressures on defence spending,\" she said, referring to the uncertainty over the outcome of the war in Ukraine.",
      "Liz Martins, senior UK economist at HSBC, told the BBC's Today Programme the higher borrowing was a \"little bit worrying\", adding \"if we're off track now the OBR might judge that that's going to persist... then the government might need to make further changes\" on its spending and taxation policies.",
      "The government tends to take more in tax than it spends in January compared with other times of the year due to the amount it receives in self-assessed taxes in the month.",
      "Despite last month's \u00a315.4bn being a record figure for a surplus, it undershot forecasts due to lower-than-expected tax receipts, suggesting weakness in the UK economy.",
      "The OBR said the shortfall was mainly due to lower-than-expected self-assessed tax receipts and an upward revision of debt interest payments over the year to date.",
      "Spending on public services, benefits and debt interest were all higher than last year, the ONS added.",
      "Separate figures from the ONS showed retail sales in the UK rebounded in January, largely due to strong food sales.",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:40:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Quantum computers will be able to crack existing encryption and threaten critical infrastructure.",
    "story": [
      "Twenty five years ago computer programmers were racing to fix the millennium bug amidst fears that it would cause banking systems to crash and planes to fall out of the sky.",
      "Much to everyone's relief the impact turned out to be minimal.",
      "Today, some fear there is a new critical threat to the world\u2019s digital infrastructure. But this time, we cannot predict exactly when it will move from theory to reality, while the ubiquity of digital technology means fixing the problem is even more complicated.",
      "That\u2019s because the arrival of quantum computing means that many of the encryption algorithms that underpin and secure our hyperconnected world will be trivially easy to crack.",
      "Quantum computing is radically different to the \u201cclassical\u201d computing used today. Instead of processing binary bits which exist in one of two states \u2013 one or zero, on or off \u2013 quantum computing uses qubits, which can exist in multiple states, or superpositions.",
      "\u201cThe reason why it's so powerful is because you're doing all those possible computations simultaneously,\u201d Prof Nishanth Sastry, director of research for computer science at the University of Surrey, explains. This means it's \u201cmuch, much more efficient, much, much more powerful.\u201d",
      "This means quantum systems offer the possibility of solving key problems that are beyond classical computers, is areas such as medical research and materials science, or cracking particularly complex mathematical problems.",
      "The problem is some of those same mathematical problems underpin the encryption algorithms that help to ensure trust, confidentiality and privacy across today\u2019s computer networks.",
      "Today\u2019s computers would take thousands, even millions of years, to crack current encryption standards, such as RSA. A suitably powerful quantum computer could, theoretically, do the job in minutes.",
      "This has implications for everything from electronic payments and ecommerce to satellite communications. \u201cAnything that's protected by something that's vulnerable becomes fair game for people that have access to quantum relevant computers,\u201d says Jon France, chief information security officer at non-profit cybersecurity organization ISC2.",
      "Quantum computers capable of breaking asymmetric encryption are thought to be years away.",
      "But progress is being made.",
      "In December, Google said its new quantum chip incorporates key \"breakthroughs\" and \"paves the way to a useful, large-scale quantum computer\".",
      "Some estimates say a quantum device capable of breaking current encryption would require 10,000 qubits, while others say millions would be needed. Today\u2019s systems have a few hundred at most.",
      "But businesses and governments face a problem right now, as attackers could harvest encrypted information and decrypt it later when they do gain access to suitably powerful devices.",
      "Greg Wetmore, vice president for software development at security firm Entrust, says if such devices could emerge in the next decade, technology leaders need to ask, \u201cWhat data in your organization is valuable for that period of time?\u201d",
      "That could be national security information, personal data, strategic plans, and intellectual property and secrets - think of a soft drink company\u2019s \u201csecret\u201d formula or the precise balance of herbs and spices in a fast food recipe.",
      "Mr France adds, if quantum computing becomes widespread, the threat becomes more immediate with the encryption that protects our daily banking transactions, for example, potentially trivial to break.",
      "The good news is that researchers and the technology industry have been working on solutions to the problem. In August, the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the US released three post quantum encryption standards.",
      "The agency said these would \u201csecure a wide range of electronic information, from confidential email messages to e-commerce transactions that propel the modern economy.\u201d It is encouraging computer system administrators to transition to the new standards as soon as possible, and said a further 18 algorithms are being evaluated as backup standards.",
      "The problem is this means a massive upgrade process touching virtually all our technology infrastructure.",
      "\u201cIf you think about the number of things out there with asymmetric encryption in them, it's billions of things. We're facing a really big change problem,\u201d says Mr France.",
      "Some digital infrastructure will be relatively easy to upgrade. Your browser, for example, will simply receive an update from the vendor says Mr France. \u201cThe challenge really comes in discrete devices and the internet of things (IOT),\u201d he continues.",
      "These might be hard to track down, and geographically inaccessible. Some equipment \u2013 legacy devices in critical national infrastructure such as water systems, for example \u2013 might not be powerful enough to handle the new encryption standards.",
      "Mr Wetmore says the industry has managed encryption transitions in the past, but \u201cIt's the sharper discontinuity that makes this threat more serious.\u201d",
      "So, it is trying to help customers build \u201ccrypto agility\u201d by setting out policies now and using automation to identify and manage their cryptographic assets. \u201cThat's the secret to making this transition an orderly one and not a chaotic one.\u201d",
      "And the challenge extends into space. Prof Sastry says many satellites \u2013 such as the Starlink network \u2013 should be relatively straightforward to upgrade, even if it means briefly taking an individual device offline temporarily.",
      "\u201cAt any given point in time, especially with the LEO (low earth orbit) satellites, you've got 10 to 20 satellites above your head,\u201d Prof Sastry says. \u201cSo, if one can't serve you, well so what? There are nine others that can serve you.\u201d",
      "More challenging, he says, are \u201cremote sensing\u201d satellites, which include those used for geographical or intelligence purposes. These carry a lot more compute power on board and typically include some sort of secure computing module. A hardware upgrade effectively means replacing the whole device. However, says Prof Sastry, this is now less of a problem thanks to more frequent and lower cost satellite launches.",

    "story": [
      "Birkenstocks may be cool enough for Barbie but the sandals do not qualify as works of art, a German court has ruled.",
      "The company had claimed its footwear could be classified as art and so was protected by copyright laws in a case it put forward to stop rivals selling copycat versions of the cork-soled sandals.",
      "But a judge dismissed the claim, saying the shoes were practical design items - a decision Birkenstock called a \"missed opportunity for the protection of intellectual property\".",
      "The firm's shoes were once deemed uncool but in recent years have become hugely popular, and gained more attention after actress Margot Robbie wore a pink pair in the final scene of the 2023 hit Barbie movie.",
      "The sandals, which feature a moulded footbed, have been praised for being comfortable and sturdy, and many colour options and strap styles have evolved since the original leather-strapped version in the 1960s.",
      "Even though it was initially rejected from the catwalks, it soon became a fashionable item, scoring a seal of approval from supermodel Kate Moss in the 1990s, and even appeared on celebrity feet at the Academy Awards.",

      "In this case, Birkenstock took three manufacturers and retailers to court, seeking to protect four of its sandal designs.",

      "His ruling added that for copyright protection, \"a degree of design must be achieved that shows individuality\".",
      "Birkenstock said in a statement that it \"continues its fight against copycats with undiminished vigour\" by exhausting \"all legal means to defend itself against imitations\".",
      "This ruling by the Federal Court of Justice, Germany's top civil court, is the final judgement which comes after two lower courts had heard the case and disagreed on the issue.",

    "story": [
      "A meeting between Chinese president Xi Jinping and some of the country's foremost business leaders this week has fuelled excitement and speculation, after Alibaba founder Jack Ma was pictured at the event.",
      "The charismatic and colourful Mr Ma, who was one of China's most prominent businessmen, had withdrawn from public life after criticising China's financial sector in 2020.",
      "His reappearance at Monday's event has sparked a wave of discussion, with experts and analysts wondering what it means for him, China's tech sector and the economy in general.",
      "The response has been overwhelmingly positive - tech stocks, including those of Alibaba, rallied soon after the event.",
      "On Thursday, the e-commerce giant reported financial results that beat expectations, with shares ending the trading day in New York more than 8% higher. The company's shares are up 60% since the beginning of the year.",
      "So what are analysts reading into Mr Ma's appearance at the event alongside other high-profile guests - including DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng?",
      "Is Jack Ma 'rehabilitated'?",
      "Analysts began looking for clues about the significance of the meeting as soon as Chinese state media started releasing pictures of the event.",
      "\"Jack Ma's attendance, his seating in the front row, even though he did not speak, and his handshake with Xi are clear signs he has been rehabilitated,\" China analyst Bill Bishop wrote.",
      "Social media was abuzz with users praising Mr Ma for his return to the public spotlight.",
      "\"Congratulations [Jack] Ma for the safe landing,\" said one user on Chinese social media platform Weibo.",
      "\"The comeback of [Jack] Ma is a shot in the arm to the current Chinese economy,\" said another.",
      "It is unsurprising that observers have attached so much significance to an appearance by Mr Ma.",
      "Before his disappearance from public life in 2020 - following comments at a financial conference that China's state-owned banks had a \"pawn-shop mentality\" - Mr Ma was the poster boy for China's tech industry.",
      "An English teacher with no background in computing, Mr Ma co-founded Alibaba in his apartment more than two decades ago after convincing a group of friends to invest in his online marketplace.",
      "He went on to build one of China's largest tech conglomerates and become one of the country's richest men.",
      "That was before his \"pawn shop\" comment, when he also lamented the \"lack of innovation\" in the country's banks.",
      "It led to the cancellation of his $34.5bn (\u00a327.4bn) stock market flotation of  Ant Group, his financial technology giant.",
      "This was seen at the time as an attempt by Beijing to humble a company that had become too powerful, and a leader who had become too outspoken.",
      "Analysts agree that the fact he's back in the spotlight, at a symposium where Xi Jinping himself presided, is a very good sign for Mr Ma.",
      "Some caution, however, that the fact he was not among the speakers may show that he has not fully returned to the exalted status he once enjoyed.",
      "Also, the lack of coverage his attendance received in Chinese media outlets seems to confirm he has not been completely rehabilitated.",
      "Is the crackdown on the tech industry over?",
      "Xi Jinping told participants at the symposium that their companies needed to innovate, grow and remain confident despite China's economic challenges, which he described as \"temporary\" and \"localised\".",
      "He also said it was the \"right time for private enterprises and private entrepreneurs to fully display their talents\".",
      "This has been widely interpreted as the government telling private tech firms that they too are back in good graces.",
      "Mr Ma's downfall had preceded a broader crackdown on China's tech industry.",
      "Companies came to face much tighter enforcement of data security and competition rules, as well as state control over important digital assets.",
      "Other companies across the private sector, ranging from education to real estate, also ended up being targeted in what came to be known as the \"common prosperity\" campaign.",
      "The measures put in place by the common prosperity policies were seen by some as a way to rein in the billionaire owners of some of China's biggest companies, to instead give customers and workers more of a say in how firms operate and distribute their earnings.",
      "But as Beijing imposed tough new regulations, billions of dollars were wiped off the value of some of these companies - many of them tech firms - rattling international investors.",
      "This, along with a worsening global economy that was affected by the pandemic as well as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has contributed to considerable changes in China's economic situation.",
      "Growth has slowed, jobs for the country's youth have become more scarce and, amid a property sector downturn, people are not spending enough.",
      "As rumours that Mr Ma would attend Monday's meeting began to spread, so did a glimmer of hope. Richard Windsor, director of technology at research firm Counterpoint, said Mr Ma's presence would be a sign that China's leadership \"had enough of stagnation and could be prepared to let the private sector have a much freer hand\".",
      "Aside from Mr Ma and Mr Liang, the list of guests also included key figures from companies such as telecommunications and smartphone firm Huawei, electric-vehicle (EV) giant BYD, and many others from across the tech and industrial sectors.",
      "\"The [guest] list showcased the importance of internet/tech/AI/EV sectors given their representation of innovation and achievement,\" said a note from market analysts at Citi.",
      "\"[It] likely indicates the importance of technology... and the contribution of private enterprises to the development and growth of China's economy.\"",
      "Those present at the meeting seemed to share that sentiment. Lei Jun, the chief executive of consumer electronics giant Xiaomi, told state media that he senses the president's \"care and support\" for businesses.",
      "Is it because of US sanctions?",
      "The symposium took place after the country experienced what some observers have described as a \"Sputnik moment\": the arrival of DeepSeek's disruptive R1 artificial intelligence (AI) model at the end of last month.",
      "Soon after its release, the Chinese-made AI chatbot rose through the ranks to become one of the most downloaded in the world. It also triggered a sudden sell-off of major US tech stocks, as fears mounted over America's leadership in the sector.",
      "Back in China, the app's global success has sparked a wave of national pride that has quickly spread to financial markets. Investment has been pouring into Chinese stocks - particularly those of tech companies - listed in Hong Kong and mainland China.",
      "Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs has also upgraded its outlook for Chinese stocks, saying rapid AI adoption could boost companies' revenues and attract as much as $200bn of investment.",
      "But the biggest significance of this innovation was that it came as a result of DeepSeek having to innovate due to a ban on the export of advanced chips and technology to China.",
      "Now, with Trump back in the White House and his fondness of trade tariffs, Mr Xi may have found it necessary to recalibrate his approach to China's entrepreneurs.",
      "Instead of a return to an era of unregulated growth, some analysts believe Monday's meeting signalled an attempt to steer investors and businesses toward Mr Xi's national priorities.",
      "The Chinese president has been increasingly emphasising policies that the government has referred to as \"high-quality development\" and \"new productive forces\".",
      "Such ideas have been used to reflect a switch from what were previously fast drivers of growth, such as property and infrastructure investment, towards high-end industries such as semiconductors, clean energy and AI.",
      "The goal is to achieve \"socialist modernisation\" by 2035 - higher living standards for everyone, and an economy driven by advanced manufacturing and less reliant on imports of foreign technology.",
      "Mr Xi knows that to get there he will need the private sector fully on board.",
      "\"Rather than marking the end of tech sector scrutiny, [Jack Ma's] reappearance suggests that Beijing is pivoting from crackdowns to controlled engagement,\" an associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney, Marina Zhang told the BBC.",
      "\"While the private sector remains a critical pillar of China's economic ambitions, it must align with national priorities - including self-reliance in key technologies and strategic industries.\""

    "story": [
      "Microsoft has unveiled a new chip called Majorana 1 that it says will enable the creation of quantum computers able to solve \"meaningful, industrial-scale problems in years, not decades\".",
      "It is the latest development in quantum computing - tech which uses principles of particle physics to create a new type of computer able to solve problems ordinary computers cannot.",
      "Creating quantum computers powerful enough to solve important real-world problems is very challenging - and some experts believe them to be decades away.",

      "The firm believes its topoconductor has the potential to be as revolutionary as the semiconductor was in the history of computing.",
      "But experts have told the BBC more data is needed before the significance of the new research - and its effect on quantum computing - can be fully assessed.",
      "Jensen Huang - boss of the leading chip firm, Nvidia - said in January he believed \"very useful\" quantum computing would come in 20 years.",
      "Chetan Nayak, a technical fellow of quantum hardware at Microsoft, said he believed the developments would shake up conventional thinking about the future of quantum computers.",
      "\"Many people have said that quantum computing, that is to say useful quantum computers, are decades away,\" he said. \"I think that this brings us into years rather than decades.\"",

      "What is quantum computing?",
      "Quantum computing holds the promise of carrying out calculations that would take today's systems millions of years and could unlock discoveries in medicine, chemistry and many other fields.",
      "There are numerous important problems that \"classical\" computers, of the sort we use every day in our phones, and laptops and power most modern applications, cannot solve.",

      "A host of technology firms, including the silicon valley giants, are currently engaged in a multi-billion dollar race to develop a quantum computer powerful enough to solve these problems.",
      "Microsoft is approaching the problem differently to most of its rivals.",
      "Its path to building a quantum computer relied upon being able to create a \"topoconductor\" or topological conductor.",
      "It uses the newly developed material to create a new state of matter- a so-called \"topological state\" which isn't a gas, liquid or solid and, until relatively recently, had existed only in theory.",
      "Specifically, it relies on so-called Majorana particles, which themselves were previously considered theoretical - work claiming that they had been discovered in 2018 had to be retracted.",
      "High risk, high reward?",
      "While rivals produced a steady stream of announcements - notably Google's \"Willow\" at the end of 2024 - Microsoft seemed to be taking longer.",
      "Pursuing this approach was, in the company's own words, a \"high-risk, high-rewards\" strategy, but one it now believes is going to pay off.",
      "\"In the same way that the invention of semiconductors made today's smartphones, computers and electronics possible, topoconductors and the new type of chip they enable offer a path to developing quantum system,\" Microsoft said.",
      "The biggest challenge of quantum computers relates to their fundamental building block, called a qubit, which is incredibly fast but also extremely difficult to control and prone to errors.",

      "Microsoft says it has put eight of its new topological qubits on its new chip - considerably less than the chips created by some of its rivals.",

      "Professor Paul Stevenson of Surrey University said the research published by Microsoft was a \"significant step\", but he felt it had tough challenges ahead.",
      "\"Until the next steps have been achieved, it is too soon to be anything more than cautiously optimistic,\" he said.",
      "Chris Heunen, Professor of Quantum Programming at the University of Edinburgh, told the BBC he felt Microsoft's plans were \"credible\".",

      "But the unsolicited bid might not be a failure - at least as far as Musk is concerned, experts say.",
      "That's because the offer could still complicate CEO Sam Altman's plans to transform OpenAI from a non-profit controlled entity to a for-profit company.",
      "Musk is \"basically trying to stymie OpenAI's growth trajectory,\" said University of Cambridge associate teaching professor Johnnie Penn in an interview with the BBC.",
      "Profit & non-profit",
      "Last week, Musk and a consortium of investors including Hollywood superagent Ari Emanuel tabled a $97.4bn (\u00a378.4bn) offer for all of OpenAI's assets.",
      "It was a huge sum - but less than the $157bn the firm was valued at in a funding round just four months ago, and much lower than the $300bn that some think it is worth now.",
      "Complicating all of this is OpenAI's unusual structure which involves a partnership between non-profit and for-profit arms.",
      "Mr Altman is understood to want to change that, stripping it of its non-profit board.",
      "That involves costs which Mr Musk is seemingly trying to inflate.",
      "\"What Musk is trying to do here is raise the perceived value of the non-profit arm of OpenAI, so that OpenAI has to pay more to get out of the obligations it has to its own non-profit,\" said Dr Penn.",

      "\"Musk has missed the AI train, somewhat. He's behind, and he has made several attempts to catch up,\" Mr Finger said.",
      "Now, Mr Finger says, Mr Musk is trying to kneecap his most formidable competitor.",
      "An already-tense relationship appeared to worsen further last week with Mr Altman taunting Mr Musk's offer on X, and Mr Musk retorting by calling his onetime partner a \"swindler\".",

      "Transparency International (TI) Georgia, the anti-corruption watchdog, wrote at the time that the change \u2013 which allows tax-free transfer of assets from offshore accounts to Georgia \u2013 may have been introduced to serve the interests of the country's richest person and former prime minister, Bidzina Ivanishvili.",
      "He is the founder and honorary chairman of the country's ruling party, Georgian Dream.",
      "\"Now it is clear, those changes were made for him,\" says senior economics analyst at TI Georgia, Beso Namchavadze.",
      "With an estimated wealth of $4.9bn (\u00a33.9bn), Mr Ivanishvili made his money in 1990s Russia, in computing, metals and banking. Most of his wealth is believed to be tucked away in offshore companies.",
      "Georgia was plunged into political crisis and daily street protests last May when the country's MPs passed the contentious \"transparency on foreign influence bill\", often dubbed the \"foreign agents law\".",
      "Under this legislation, media and non-governmental organisations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad have to register as \"organisations acting in the interest of a foreign power\", submit themselves to stringent audits, or face punitive fines. It was widely seen as a move to prevent US and other Western influence on the country.",
      "Protests then continued when the Georgian Dream-led government won disputed parliamentary elections in October. Protests were spurred again at the start of December when it said it would be putting EU accession talks on hold.",
      "Hundreds of peaceful protesters were arrested and severely beaten up by the police.",
      "In response to this crackdown, the US government announced sanctions against Mr Ivanishvili at the end of last year.",
      "There is also the possibility of sanctions from the UK. Last month James MacCleary, a Liberal Democrat MP, introduced an Early Day Motion in the UK parliament calling on the government to impose sanctions on Mr Ivanishvili.",
      "The motion expressed \"deep concern at the suspension of Georgia's EU accession process and the increasing use of excessive force against peaceful protesters\".",
      "TI Georgia estimates that if the UK imposed sanctions on Mr Ivanishvili his entire business empire would be affected, because he has holding companies registered in two British Overseas Territories - British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands.",

      "The US sanctions on Mr Ivanishvili call for his assets to be frozen, and place restrictions on US citizens and companies from doing business personally with him, but they do not affect his companies or family members.",
      "For more than a decade Mr Ivanishvili has been involved in legal battles with another Swiss bank, Credit Suisse, over fraud and mismanagement of his money.",
      "Some believe that the billionaire's mistrust of the West and increased use of conspiracy theories at home, such as accusing adversaries of being part of the \"global war party\", or \"deep state\", originate in his long-standing financial grievances.",
      "Ever since he became convinced that Credit Suisse was part of a grand conspiracy against him, says Tina Khdasheli. \"Bidzina Ivanishvili held Georgia hostage to his personal financial issues.\"",

      "The closing credits of 2021's No Time To Die, the most recent film in the 007 series, ended with a familiar message: \"James Bond will return.\"",
      "But for the last few years, fans haven't been so sure.",
      "A year after the release of Daniel Craig's final film in the franchise, Amazon bought the series' parent company MGM. Since then, very little has happened.",
      "That finally changed on Thursday, when Amazon announced a new joint venture that will see long-term Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson step back, and Jeff Bezos's company take full creative control.",
      "In the intervening years, it's been widely reported that there was tension between Amazon, who understandably wanted a return on their investment, and Wilson and Broccoli, whose top priority remained protecting the Bond brand.",
      "The news of the deal has been met with mixed reaction from 007 fans.",
      "\"I'm in two minds,\" says David Zaritsky, creator of The Bond Experience fan channel on YouTube and Instagram.",
      "\"The nostalgic part of my mind feels a little bit of sadness. Broccoli and Wilson have been the custodians for all these years, so it feels like a bit of royal blood in lineage has been severed.",
      "\"That being said, nobody likes inactivity. And there's been a lot of inactivity around the James Bond franchise for many years, and I know that Amazon as a company will not have patience for inactivity.",
      "\"So I'm very hopeful, and dare I say even a little bit excited, that they're going to do something with the franchise that will be interesting nonetheless.\"",
      "Other franchises which have drastically expanded perhaps offer some clues about what we can expect from the forthcoming Amazon era of Bond.",
      "Lancelot Narayan, a James Bond historian, journalist and filmmaker, told BBC Radio 5 Live a good comparison is George Lucas selling Lucasfilm to Disney in 2012, giving the company control of the Star Wars brand.",
      "\"They went off and made that sequel trilogy, and whether you like it or not, it got made rather quickly,\" he notes. \"There wasn't a three-year wait between films.\"",
      "However, despite the explosion in productivity, there is a feeling that both Marvel and Star Wars have overstretched themselves with their spin-off products.",
      "Narayan says he believes Star Wars has become \"creatively redundant\" since the explosion in productivity.",
      "\"The Star Wars TV series have been very hit and miss \u2013 Andor is fantastic, The Mandalorian is OK, I haven't seen Skeleton Crew... but there are very disparate creative voices going on there,\" he notes. \"So this is the worry, you need the correct creative people to run the show.\"",
      "Similarly, the Marvel Cinematic Universe built on the films by launching a string of Disney+ TV shows.",
      "The subsequent decline in Marvel's popularity arguably owes much to fan fatigue, something which won't have been helped by the huge number of story strands they had to keep up with.",
      "Both cases, Marvel and Star Wars, highlight the risks of brand expansion, which can cause long-term damage for short-term financial gain.",
      "Fans will be hoping any Bond extensions will be better than 2023's dubious game show 007: Road to a Million, hosted by Succession's Brian Cox, which was poorly received.",
      "The James Bond franchise, and particularly the subject of which actor will take over from Craig, is of such fascination to the public that it's the focus of a new show currently playing in Cirencester, called A Role To Die For.",
      "\"There are a lot of people who have grown up with it, for whom James Bond has been part of their culture their entire lives,\" says the appropriately named Derek Bond, who directs the show.",
      "\"As time has gone on, being able to reinvent that character and have him perhaps change with the times, has been the secret to his longevity.",
      "\"But I wonder if we're now in a situation where the times have changed so much, that James Bond now feels as if he belongs in a different era, and it needs something really radical to keep him relevant today.\"",
      "Character origin stories",
      "One area the company will almost certainly be looking at now they're in creative control is the potential for character origin stories, in a similar vein to other famous and beloved film characters who have received their own spin-off films.",
      "Cruella, an extension of the 101 Dalmatians villain, and Wonka, of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, have both been hugely successful film spin-offs in their own right in the last five years, with Emma Stone and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet respectively bringing the characters and worlds to a whole new audience.",
      "It's not hard to imagine the popularity of a similar film or show based on famous Bond villains such as Jaws, Oddjob, Blofeld, Goldfinger or May Day - all big brands in their own right.",
      "\"I mean, why has nobody made Moneypenny?!\" laughs Derek Bond. \"There's a great series to made about her and her journey.",
      "\"Also M, I'd love to know how Judi Dench's M ended up in that role. And the villains especially, it's a very rich universe, and it's easy to imagine the Marvelisation of it, where you have a kind of spin-off for every character that James Bond ever passed in a corridor.\"",
      "But Zaritsky notes: \"I think Amazon will stop short of doing it ad nauseum, to the point where they're having spin-offs about the MI6 janitor that sleeps in the corner. If they do have spin-offs, I think it's going to be prime characters.\"",
      "Not everyone is a fan of the idea. \"This is quite possibly the WORST thing to happen to this franchise,\" tweeted Griffin Schiller of Film Speak after Amazon's announcement.",
      "\"James Bond was more than your average franchise. It had class, prestige, they were indie films made as blockbusters... now? It'll be milked dry. It's truly the end.\"",
      "Broccoli has been seen as a steward of the brand throughout her tenure; a safe pair of hands who protected the traditions of the original character.",
      "That may not necessarily have been compatible with Amazon, who were presumably looking to buy a brand rather than only a film franchise, in an effort to maximise profit.",
      "\"It does tend to be a slightly older generation that it skews to, and there's a whole generation of people who have not experienced a James Bond film, and now, I wonder if they will,\" Bond says.",
      "In her own tenure, Broccoli has made efforts to keep attracting young audiences in other ways, however, such as selecting popular young artists such as Billie Eilish to sing the theme songs.",
      "A repositioning of of the brand could see Amazon try to take the franchise in a direction that appeals more to a younger audience as well as an American market, which is culturally slightly cooler on the Bond brand than the UK.",
      "\"I think it's quite bad news for the franchise, and British film as a whole,\" movie journalist Hannah Strong told Radio 4's PM following Amazon's announcement.",
      "\"It's the premier British film property, and I think the control reverting to an American company, not least one that hasn't shown that much commitment to great cinema, is probably quite a worrying sign.\"",
      "That said, Amazon will be aware that Bond makes a huge amount of money as it currently is - and that altering the core product itself in a way that appeals more to an American audience would be a huge risk.",
      "Strong added: \"When Amazon bought MGM, Barbara Broccoli was quite outspoken about the fact she was finding it difficult to come to a middle ground with Amazon. I suspect the middle ground involves an awful lot of money.\"",
      "The biggest decision remains who will replace Craig in the leading role.",
      "Broccoli previously said James Bond could be any race, but that he would remain male. That guarantee may no longer stand now she is has handed over the reins, although her approach was widely regarded as sensible and Amazon are unlikely to rock the boat too much.",
      "How long could it be until we see the first new Bond product? Zaritsky suggests Amazon won't wait around, although the first thing to launch may not be a film.",
      "\"It could be with merchandise, or in the form of fan outreach,\" he says. \"Whatever it is, I think we might see something extremely fast.\"",

      "Christina Fulton accuses her 34-year-old son, Weston Cage, whom she described as a \"300-pound professional fighter\", of attacking her without provocation.",
      "According to the lawsuit, Fulton, 57, is suing her son for assault and battery and Cage, 61, for negligence, claiming he failed to prevent their son's alleged behaviour.",
      "The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for the \"catastrophic physical, emotional, and economic harm she has endured due to an unprovoked attack by their son, Weston\". Nicolas Cage's lawyers called the lawsuit \"frivolous\".",
      "Weston Cage was arrested in June last year and charged with two felony counts of assault with a deadly weapon following accusations that he attacked his mother and another individual.",
      "He pleaded not guilty to both charges.",
      "Ms Fulton claims she visited her son on 28 April 2024 after receiving \"urgent messages\" from his friends, according to the civil complaint submitted to the Los Angeles County Superior Court.",
      "Upon arriving, she alleges he attacked her in a \"manic rage\", assaulting her in the car park, lift and lobby of his residence. The lawsuit says she was left with a concussion, multiple contusions, neck and throat injuries, dental trauma, tinnitus, abdominal trauma and PTSD.",
      "Ms Fulton alleges that Nicolas Cage was aware of their son's \"long history of mental and psychological disorder\" and previous alleged acts of \"violent assault and battery\", but continued to enable such behaviour by providing financial support.",
      "The lawsuit adds that Mr Cage bought an apartment for their son next door to his own residence, bailed him out of jail multiple times, and drank alcohol with him despite knowing about his alleged struggles with substance abuse.",
      "In a statement to the BBC, Nicolas Cage's lawyer, Brian Wolf, said the lawsuit was \"absurd\".",
      "\"Weston Coppola is a 34 year old man,\" Mr Wolf said. \"Mr Cage does not control Weston's behavior in any manner and is not responsible for Weston's alleged assault of his mother.\"",
      "Weston Cage's lawyer, Michael A Goldstein, said Ms Fulton's decision to file a lawsuit against her own son was not surprising, given what he described as her past history of litigation against family members.",
      "\"It appears to be nothing short of a money grab and call for attention,\" said Mr Goldstein. Ms Fulton correctly advised the responding LAPD officers that her son was in the midst of a mental health crisis at the time of the incident, he added.",
      "In an interview with the BBC, Joseph Farzam, the attorney representing Ms Fulton, agreed that most people are not responsible for their adult children's actions.",
      "But he said the law was very clear that a parent can be responsible for an adult child with any mental disability if they cannot support themselves.",
      "\"This is a unique situation,\" he told the BBC. \"Weston has a history of violence and his father has not stopped him, but enabled him, bailed him and made the situation much worse.\"",
      "Ms Fulton, who was in a relationship with Nicolas Cage from 1988-91, previously sued the actor in 2009 over a financial dispute.",
      "She alleged he owed her $13m (\u00a310m) and had reneged on a promise to buy her a home in Hancock Park, a wealthy LA enclave. That case was settled in 2011 under undisclosed terms.",
      "This is not the first bout of legal trouble for Weston Cage.",
      "In 2011, he and his then-wife, Nikki Williams, were arrested on felony domestic violence charges.",
      "In 2017, he was detained on suspicion of driving under the influence and hit-and-run. He pleaded no contest, was given three years of probation and had to go to a recovery programme and complete community service."

      "The Bond films were launched by Albert \"Cubby\" Broccoli in 1962, before his daughter and stepson took over.",
      "The pair will now give creative control to Amazon MGM Studios, which was formed when Amazon bought Bond's parent studio in 2022.",
      "The new deal comes after mounting speculation about the fate of the British spy, four years after his last outing in No Time to Die, which was also Daniel Craig's final appearance in the role.",
      "How an American takeover could change James Bond forever",
      "How an American takeover could change James Bond forever",
      "Amazon will now decide which actor will take over the famous character, but there is still no timescale for when that that will happen or when the next film will be made.",
      "James Norton, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Theo James are among the bookmakers' favourites to fill Craig's shoes.",
      "After Thursday's announcement, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos canvassed fans' opinion on social media, asking: \"Who'd you pick as the next Bond?\"",
      "A statement said Broccoli and Wilson will \"remain co-owners of the franchise\" as part of a new joint venture but Amazon MGM Studios \"will gain creative control\".",
      "Wilson, 83, said: \"With my 007 career spanning nearly 60 incredible years, I am stepping back from producing the James Bond films to focus on art and charitable projects.",
      "\"Therefore, Barbara and I agree, it is time for our trusted partner, Amazon MGM Studios, to lead James Bond into the future.\"",
      "Broccoli, 64, added: \"My life has been dedicated to maintaining and building upon the extraordinary legacy that was handed to Michael and me by our father, producer Cubby Broccoli.",
      "\"I have had the honour of working closely with four of the tremendously talented actors who have played 007 and thousands of wonderful artists within the industry.",
      "\"With the conclusion of No Time to Die and Michael retiring from the films, I feel it is time to focus on my other projects.\"",
      "Cubby Broccoli launched the iconic franchise with co-producer Harry Saltzman, and was joined by Wilson as a producing partner for 1985's A View to a Kill.",
      "Barbara took over from her father to join Wilson as a producer for 1995's GoldenEye, and the pair have overseen every Bond film since through their Eon production house.",
      "They kept tight control of the character - something that was acknowledged by Craig when he presented them with honorary Oscars in November. \"Over the years many people and organisations have tried to put their own footprint on Bond,\" he said.",
      "\"Barbara, Michael, I can't tell you how much I admire your integrity in holding on to your singular vision as you brought Bond into the 21st Century with a passionate and a protective determination to honour the heart of this franchise.\"",
      "'Next phase' for 007",
      "In 2021, when Amazon agreed to take over MGM, which shared the rights to Bond with Eon, Broccoli and Wilson said they would keep creative control.",
      "However, they have now relinquished the reins, and the deal raises the prospect of a rethink and an expansion of the franchise.",
      "The US giant could commission more streaming spin-offs, for example, such as how the Star Wars universe has been expanded on Disney+.",
      "Mike Hopkins, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios, said: \"We are honoured to continue this treasured heritage, and look forward to ushering in the next phase of the legendary 007 for audiences around the world.\"",
      "Last year, Amazon launched the first spin-off TV series, 007: Road to a Million, hosted by Succession star Brian Cox.",
      "It featured nine teams in a race to win \u00a31m each through a series of spy-themed challenges. However, that series was poorly received by some fans and critics and Cox later joked that he signed on to the project thinking it was the next James Bond film.",
      "News of Thursday's deal helps to explain why there has been a long delay without any announcement about a 26th official Bond film, or its star.",
      "Given how much time it takes to make a blockbuster movie, the gap between No Time To Die and the next film could break the six-year record for the longest period between Bond releases.",

      "Malian film director Souleymane Ciss\u00e9, one of the pioneers of African cinema, has died aged 84.",
      "His daughter, Mariam Ciss\u00e9, confirmed his death at a clinic in the capital Bamako, expressing shock and mourning \"the loss of a man who dedicated his life to film and art\".",
      "The cause of his death has not been announced.",
      "Ciss\u00e9 gained international recognition in 1987 when his film Yeelen (The Light) won the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, making him the first film-maker from sub-Saharan Africa to win an award at the prestigious festival.",
      "His trailblazing career spanned more than 50 years, winning many accolades along the way.",
      "In 2023, Ciss\u00e9 was honoured by Cannes with a Carrosse d'Or award, usually given to directors who have \"marked the history of cinema with their boldness, their exacting standards and their intransigence in staging\".",
      "Ciss\u00e9 was also a double winner of the grand prize at the biennial Pan-African Film Festival, Fespaco.",

      "Tributes have been pouring in for Ciss\u00e9 for his dedication to African storytelling.",
      "Mali's Culture Minister Mamou Daff\u00e9 lamented the loss \"of this monument of African cinema\", while fellow Malian director Boubacar Sidib\u00e9 said the country's film industry was in \"mourning\".",
      "Compassionate firebrand",
      "Film lovers have praised Ciss\u00e9's works for their complexity, political engagement and deep humanity.",
      "His first feature film, Den Muso (The Young Girl) shot in 1975, was in the local Bambara language, and is considered an African classic.",
      "The film is about a young girl who is raped, becomes pregnant and is rejected by her family.",
      "The film was banned by the Malian authorities, and Ciss\u00e9 was jailed for having accepted French funding. He wrote the screenplay for his second film, Baara (Work), while in prison.",
      "He made other films including Finy\u00e8 (The Wind) in 1981, and Yeelen (The Light), which won the Jury Prize in Cannes in 1987. His last film in 1995 was Waati (Time).",
      "Ciss\u00e9 was born in Bamako, and spent part of his childhood in neighbouring Senegal.",
      "Later, he studied film in Russia's capital Moscow, becoming one of the first generation of African film-makers.",
      "Ciss\u00e9 went on to champion government support for and investment in the film industry.",
      "He was the founding president of the union representing West Africa's entrepreneurs in cinema and audiovisual arts.",
      "Ciss\u00e9 was often outspoken about other barriers to the spread of African cinema - criticising \"censorship\" and \"contempt\", and urging young film-makers not to act like \"beggars who must plead every time for financing from Europe\" but instead seek greater independence.",
      "Hours before his death, he reportedly urged Mali's military government to help the country's industry catch up with its continental rivals.",
      "\"It is not enough to make cinema, the works must also be visible,\" the AFP news agency quoted Ciss\u00e9 as saying.",

    "summary": "The landlord of legendary Sheffield music venue The Leadmill is granted possession of the building.",
    "story": [
      "A judge has ruled the tenants of The Leadmill music venue in Sheffield must leave the premises.",
      "Electric Group, the owners of the much-loved 900-capacity building, served an eviction notice on their tenants, The Leadmill Ltd, in March 2022 and plan to run the business themselves.",
      "Both sides had been locked in a long-running legal battle to determine who should operate the venue, with the case heard at the The Business and Property Courts in Leeds in December.",
      "His Honour Justice Sir Alastair Norris ruled in favour of the Electric Group on Wednesday, meaning The Leadmill Ltd has three months and 21 days to leave the site. The Leadmill said it was seeking legal advice over its next steps.",
      "The venue opened in 1980 and has played host to the likes of Oasis, Coldplay and Sheffield's own Arctic Monkeys.",
      "A plaque on the building marks Pulp's first ever gig, which was at The Leadmill in August 1980.",
      "The Leadmill Ltd owns the trademark for the venue's name, meaning the site, on Leadmill Road, will likely be renamed under the Electric Group.",
      "In his ruling, Justice Norris said the \"present intention\" was to rebrand the famous venue as SK 35. The significance of the name was not clarified and the BBC has asked Electric Group for comment.",
      "An Electric Group spokesperson said the judge's decision \"paves the way for a bright future for this venue, ensuring it will receive the substantial investment it needs to thrive\".",
      "\"It will continue to be a cornerstone of the live music scene in Sheffield, supporting artists, fans, and community projects for the next 100 years.\"",
      "'More polished'",
      "Electric Group also runs Electric Brixton in London and venues in Bristol and Newcastle.",
      "Boss Dominic Madden told the eviction hearing that under his ownership the venue \"will be a slightly more polished, probably modernised, version of the same thing\".",
      "\"It will still be hosting concerts and nightclub events [but] it's different insofar as it's plugged into a national network of music venues.\"",
      "Mr Madden said the venue could be operational under his ownership by September - a claim disputed by The Leadmill.",
      "Lawyers acting on behalf of The Leadmill claimed the cost of a refurbishment would be up to \u00a34.1m, money they said Mr Madden could not prove he had.",
      "Mr Madden's legal team estimated the cost of the works to be just over \u00a32m, a claim Justice Norris concluded was \"more coherent and more consistent\" than that of The Leadmill, and one they could afford.",
      "He also said there was \"no need\" to believe the work would take longer than the 35 weeks estimated by Electric Group.",
      "The judge rejected an argument that it would be a violation of the Human Rights Act - protecting a person's right to property - if Electric Group was to be allowed to \"exploit\" the \"good will\" built up by the current management by running the venue in \"precisely the same way\".",
      "\"There is nothing peculiar to music venues,\" he said.",
      "In a statement, The Leadmill said they were \"actively consulting with our legal advisers to assess our next steps\".",
      "\"We remain committed to exhausting every possible legal avenue to secure our future, retain our staff and protect our venue.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 17:10:53 GMT",
    "summary": "A Kuala Lumpur festival is suing the band after singer Matty Healy attacked Malaysia's anti-LGBT laws.",
    "story": [
      "Individual members of The 1975 should not be held responsible for Malaysian authorities closing down a Kuala Lumpur festival after frontman Matty Healy kissed one of his male bandmates on-stage, the High Court has heard.",
      "During the band's performance at the Good Vibes Festival in July 2023, Healy addressed the audience in a profanity-laden speech before kissing bass player Ross MacDonald.",
      "Homosexuality remains a crime in Malaysia which is punishable by up to 20 years in prison and caning.",
      "The weekend festival was cancelled on its opening night as a result, with the Malaysian government criticising Healy's conduct while blacklisting the band from the country.",
      "'Challenge and provoke'",
      "Festival organisers Future Sound Asia (FSA) claim The 1975 Productions LLP breached their contract following the incident and that all four band members owed a duty of care.",
      "FSA is seeking damages of \u00a31.9 million in \"substantial losses\".",
      "In a hearing on Wednesday, the band's lawyer Edmund Cullen KC described the claim as an \"illegitimate, artificial and incoherent\" attempt \"to pin liability on individuals\", the PA news agency reported.",
      "He said it was \"really quite bizarre\" that the individual members should be held liable as FSA had a contract with the band's company only.",
      "\"The allegations of breaches of a duty of care are not breaches of a duty of care at all,\" he said.",
      "\"They are breaches of Malaysian statutes and guidelines. That is why this claim is completely artificial against my clients.\"",
      "He asked the court to strike out the claim against the band members as individuals and for it to proceed against the company only.",
      "In written submissions for FSA, Andrew Burns KC, said The 1975 - who were due to be paid 350,000 dollars (\u00a3274,000) for a one-hour performance - \"deliberately behaved in a way to challenge and provoke the Malaysian authorities\".",
      "The band first played the festival in 2016, agreeing at the time not to swear, smoke, drink, take off clothes or talk about religion and politics on stage, he noted.",
      "But they \"planned provocative conduct\" in 2023, which included a bottle of wine being \"smuggled\" on stage, a \"second-rate set of songs\" to \"punish and upset the Malaysian audience and authorities\" and an \"obscene speech\"; as well as the kiss which courted much publicity online, the submissions claimed.",
      "\"This is also a case where they could be argued to have been on a frolic of their own rather than simply acting within the course of their ordinary role as LLP members,\" he said in the document.",
      "\"It is therefore fair, just and reasonable for the duty of care to be imposed and for them to answer for their acts of procuring breaches of contract.\"",
      "The court heard that Malaysian authorities had initially refused to let the band perform amid reports about Healy's recent recovery from drug addiction.",
      "But they agreed to allow the performance to take place after the band promised Healy would adhere to all guidelines and regulations, Mr Burns added.",
      "\"The band should be held liable as the loss was caused by their intentional misbehaviour breaching the express assurances that were given which gave rise to their personal duties of care and their responsibility for their own personal behaviour.\"",
      "The court hearing is expected to conclude on Wednesday.",
      "The 1975 sued over Malaysia concert with Matty Healy kiss",
      "Festival axed as 1975 singer attacks Malaysian LGBT laws",
      "What happened on the night and in the aftermath?",
      "In footage shared online, Healy could be seen telling the crowd that the band's decision to appear in Malaysia had been a \"mistake\".",
      "\"When we were booking shows, I wasn't looking into it,\" Healy said. \"I do not see the point of inviting the 1975 to a country and then telling us who we can have sex with.",
      "\"Unfortunately you don't get a set of loads of uplifting songs because I'm [expletive] furious,\" the frontman continued. \"And that's not fair on you, because you're not representative of your government. Because you're young people, and I'm sure a lot of you are gay and progressive and cool.\"",
      "Healy and MacDonald then kissed as the band played the song I Like America & America Likes Me.",
      "Soon after - just 30 minutes into the set - Healy and the band walked off stage, with the singer telling the audience: \"Alright, we just got banned from Kuala Lumpur, see you later.\"",
      "Healy's protest stunt sparked a backlash from some LGBT activists and allies in the country, with many calling it an act of \"performative activism\" that would make their lives even harder. Some said it displayed a \"white saviour complex\".",
      "In a statement after the show, a source close to the band said Healy had wanted to stand up for the LGBT community.",
      "After their Malaysian festival appearance had been cut short, the band cancelled further concerts in Indonesia and Taiwan.",
      "Several months later, Healy defended the kiss in a 10-minute speech delivered at a 1975 concert in Dallas, Texas.",
      "Healy said it was \"not a stunt simply meant to provoke the government\" but an \"ongoing part of the 1975 stage show which had been performed many times prior\".",
      "He described online anger over the performance as \"liberal outrage\", and said criticism of the band for \"remaining consistent\" by performing its \"pro-LGBT stage show\" was puzzling."

    "story": [
      "From playing Anthony in Bridgerton to Fiyero in Wicked, Jonathan Bailey has nailed the art of portraying regal characters.",
      "The trend continues as he now takes on the role of Shakespeare's Richard II at the Bridge Theatre in London.",
      "He tells the BBC that his portrayal of the authoritarian king who ruled in the 1300s was inspired by HBO's Succession, which explores the power struggle between the children of media mogul Logan Roy.",
      "\"I channelled many Roys,\" Bailey explains, adding that Richard II \"explores inherited power in a very similar way to Succession but also expands on it and takes it to a new level\".",
      "The first of Shakespeare's Henriad plays, Richard II sees the unlikeable and corrupt king be usurped by his cousin Henry Bolingbroke who goes on to become Henry IV.",
      "Directed by Nicholas Hytner, the modern-dress production sees Bailey as a cocaine-snorting and camp king.",
      "The 36-year-old said he chose to take on the role of Richard II as there was \"so much to explore with his character\".",
      "\"It's a feast of a play and really speaks to our times - it's fascinating to explore a king who has a cast iron right to rule.\"",
      "'Commands the stage'",
      "Bailey's performance has been positively received by most critics.",
      "The Guardian's three star review said his \"words glitter with feeling\" and added that he \"singularly shines, his luminosity putting the others slightly in the shade\".",
      "The Evening Standard's review added that Bailey \"commands the stage and even allows a little camp to seep into the character\" while the Independent said, in a four-star review, that Bailey has \"an infectious spirit of camp naughtiness, he hugs his crown like a teddy bear, aims wry put-downs at dull courtiers, and bosses his court around like they're actors in a play\".",
      "However, in a three-star review, Dominic Cavendish from the Telegraph suggestedthat Bailey \"doesn't attain the greatness of Ben Whishaw and David Tennant\".",
      "There was also praise for some of the other actors, notably Michael Simkins. The Times said his Duke of York is \"stateliness personified\", but also awarded three stars overall.",
      "The New York Times also commended Simkins: \"His finger-wagging exasperation, verging at times on slapstick, gives an audience-friendly commentary on the unfolding intrigue.\"",
      "Newer fans of Bailey may not realise that he is first and foremost a theatre actor.",
      "In 2013, he played Cassio in Hytner's Othello at the National Theatre and has also performed alongside Ian McKellen in King Lear.",
      "Productions of Shakespeare's plays rarely have a large audience of young women, but Bailey's appeal among that demographic seems to have inspired them to visit the theatre.",
      "\"It makes me so happy to inspire a new generation of young people coming to the theatre,\" he says.",
      "\"If 10 people per show come and see Shakespeare for the first time then I'm doing something right.\""

      "It comes after Pearce - one of the stars of the recent Bafta-winning film The Brutalist - this week expanded on his alleged experiences with the US actor having previously called him \"a handsy guy\" in 2018.",
      "Spacey - whose career was brought to a halt by a string of allegations - admitted to \"being too handsy\" and \"pushing the boundaries\", in an interview last year with Piers Morgan, while saying he'd not done anything illegal.",
      "In 2023 the actor was found not guilty of all charges of sexual assault against four men between 2001 and 2013 after a trial in London; and in 2022 a US court dismissed a sexual assault lawsuit against him.",

      "\"He holds a room remarkably. But I was young and susceptible, and he targeted me, no question.\"",
      "Pearce revealed he had told his wife at the time that he felt safe on set when his co-star Simon Baker was present, because Spacey allegedly focused his attentions on him instead.",
      "He said the #MeToo movement, which saw allegations made against many men in Hollywood from 2017 onwards, had been \"a really incredible wake-up call\" for him.",
      "The actor said he \"broke down and sobbed\" and \"couldn't stop\" after he saw the allegations against Spacey in the news headlines. \"I think it really dawned on me the impact that had occurred and how I sort of brushed it off and how I had either shelved it or blocked it out or whatever.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Spacey responded directly to Pearce in a video posted on X, saying: \"If I did something then that upset you, you could have reached out to me.",
      "\"We could have had that conversation, but instead, you've decided to speak to the press, who are now, of course, coming after me, because they would like to know what my response is to the things that you said.",
      "\"You really want to know what my response is? Grow up.\"",
      "Spacey claimed Pearce omitted to mention he had flown to Georgia a year after LA Confidential was made \"just to spend time with me\" while he was filming another movie, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.",
      "\"I mean, did you tell the press that too, or does that not fit into the victim narrative you have going?\" he added.",
      "\"I apologise that I didn't get the message that you don't like spending time with me. Maybe there was another reason, I don't know, but that doesn't make any sense. That you would have just been leading me on, right? But here you are now on a mission, some 28 years later, after I've been through hell and back.\"",
      "Spacey concluded his message by saying he was happy to have a \"conversation\" with Pearce \"anytime, anyplace\".",
      "\"I've got nothing to hide,\" he said. \"But Guy - you need to grow up. You are not a victim.\"",
      "Pearce earlier told the US publication he had raised Spacey's alleged behaviour with him years later, and had \"had a couple of confrontations with Kevin\" that \"got ugly\".",
      "His new strategy these days, he noted, was \"just try to be more honest about it now and call it for what it is\"."

      "Joe Tacopina, the rapper's defence attorney, said Mr Mayers tried to shield Rihanna and their family from the criminal proceedings, but said that \"wild horses couldn't keep her away\" from the trial.",
      "Though she was often stoic and staring straight ahead while in court, she never flinched or showed emotion when prosecutors made negative comments about her partner.",
      "Following his acquittal, Rihanna expressed her gratitude on social media, stating, \"The glory belongs to God and God alone! Thankful, humbled by his mercy!\"",
      "2) A$AP Mob falling apart?",
      "The A$AP Mob is a hip-hop collective founded in 2006 in Harlem by a group of high school friends in New York.",
      "They adopted the \"A$AP\" title, which means \"Always Strive and Prosper\".",
      "The group, which has had more than 20 members over the years, have presented themselves as a family, but they've been plagued by jealousy, rivalries and disagreements since the death of its founder, A$AP Yams.",
      "Though there have been fallouts and issues between some members, this trial is the most notable instance of a complete dismantling of a relationship between members.",
      "A$AP Relli, whose legal name is Terell Ephron, was once a close friend and member of the Mob, accused Mr Mayers, known as A$AP Rocky, of shooting him during an altercation in 2021.",
      "During the trial, his defence team argued that Mr Ephron harboured resentment toward his former friend, feeling sidelined as A$AP Rocky's fame grew and saw mainstream musical success. They argued Mr Ephron was after money.",
      "Several members of the A$AP Mob testified during the trial in favour of Mr Mayers.",
      "A$AP Twelvyy challenged Mr Ephron's account of the events and suggested that he was the aggressor during the altercation, not Mr Mayers.",
      "A$AP Lou also took the stand, telling jurors that a Glock 43 magazine found during a search of Mr Mayers's home belonged to him, not the rapper.",
      "None of the A$AP members publicly testified for Relli.",
      "3) 'AWGE' still a mystery?",
      "Do you know what AWGE stands for? If you know, I think both me and the jury would love to still know.",
      "During the trial, AWGE came up when A$AP Twelvyy was on the stand. He was asked by prosecutors about its meaning. But before he could answer, A$AP Rocky - who was seated with his attorneys - cut in and shouted, \"Don't say!\"",
      "Twelvvy abided and responded, \"I just know it's AWGE\".",
      "It was an astonishing moment. Criminal defendants don't typically say much during trials - let alone halt a witness from answering a question during their criminal trial.",
      "A$AP Rocky not guilty of firearm assault on LA street",
      "When asked about this exchange after the trial, A$AP Rocky's attorney Joe Tacopina explained what happened.",
      "He said it was an \"acronym for his company that had to do with his family. I'm gonna leave it at that.\" Mr Tacopina went on to explain it was a private thing that the rapper didn't want revealed publicly to millions, especially in a criminal court case.",
      "But the answer really led to more questions. What does it mean and why is it so secretive?",
      "Here's what we do know: AWGE is the name of A$AP Rocky's mysterious creative collective and record label, and it's long been the subject of intrigue.",
      "Founded in 2014, the group operates across music, fashion and art, collaborating with brands like Mercedes-Benz and PacSun. Members include artists, designers and directors, and everyone remains loyal to one rule: no one publicly reveals what \"AWGE\" actually stands for.",
      "On the company's website there are two rules listed: \"#1 Never reveal what AWGE means. #2 When in doubt always refer to rule #1.\"",
      "A$AP Rocky's fans do have some guesses though:",
      "\"A$AP Worldwide Global Enterprises\" \u2013 A possible nod to the A$AP Mob's broader brand and business ambitions.\"Ain't Wanna Go Explicit\" \u2013 This suggests that AWGE represents an inside joke or personal mantra within Rocky's circle.\"All We Got is Everything\" \u2013 A phrase that aligns with Rocky's philosophy of creativity and collaboration.\"A$AP Worldwide Genius Elite\" \u2013 Another theory that frames AWGE as a highly curated group of artists and visionaries.",

      "\"A$AP Worldwide Genius Elite\" \u2013 Another theory that frames AWGE as a highly curated group of artists and visionaries.",
      "Despite the guesses, the rapper and his team have never officially confirmed any meaning.",
      "Instead, they've leaned into the secrecy, with members often responding to questions about AWGE with the phrase, \"If you know, you know.\"",
      "4) The height of A$AP Rocky's fame",
      "A$AP Rocky's trial unfolded at a pivotal moment in his career, with the rapper riding a wave of creative and commercial success.",
      "The rapper is set to release his first solo album in nearly a decade and is scheduled to co-headline Los Angeles' Rolling Loud festival in March 2025.",
      "Additionally, he is starring in a summer blockbuster alongside Denzel Washington. Director Spike Lee's upcoming film \"Highest 2 Lowest\" is slated for a summer release.",
      "But his influence extends beyond music\u2014his AWGE collective has been collaborating with brands like Mercedes-Benz and Puma. He's been celebrated for his fashion sense, too, and is known as being one of music's best-dressed men.",
      "In May, he is set to co-chair the 2025 Met Gala - one of fashion's biggest nights - alongside big names like Anna Wintour, British race car driver Lewis Hamilton, singer Pharrell Williams and basketball superstar LeBron James.",
      "His relationship with Rihanna, one of the most famous singers, has further cemented his cultural relevance.",
      "The couple welcomed their second child, Riot Rose, in August 2023, and their growing family had become a symbol of hip-hop royalty.",
      "5) Beef between the lawyers",
      "The trial wasn't just a battleground for the rapper's freedom\u2014it also saw intense clashes between legal teams.",
      "Celebrity defence attorney Joe Tacopina, known for his aggressive courtroom style, relentlessly challenged the credibility of the prosecution's key witness, A$AP Relli, whose legal name is Terell Ephron.",
      "He painted Mr Ephron as an opportunist seeking financial gain and called the prosecution's case flimsy due to a lack of physical evidence. Mr Ephron got so fed up with the rapper's attorney during questioning that he called Mr Tacopina \"annoying\".",
      "Meanwhile, prosecutors pushed back, accusing Mr Tacopina of attempting to intimidate witnesses and dismiss key testimonies.",
      "Both sides were very liberal with their use of objections in court, and it sometimes felt as though both sides were trying to throw the other off their game, rather than being based on legal guidelines.",
      "It also got personal between the two sides.",
      "At one point during closing arguments, Mr Tacopina and prosecutor John Lewin traded misconduct allegations, with Mr Lewin accusing Mr Tacopina of using steroids and Mr Tacopina firing back by calling Lewin a \"hunchback\".",
      "After a short break, the judge attempted to lighten the mood by theatrically introducing the attorneys like boxers before resuming the trial.",

    "story": [
      "Actress Kim Sae-ron's death in an apparent suicide has renewed criticism of South Korea's entertainment industry, which churns out stars but also subjects them to immense pressure and scrutiny.",
      "Kim - who was found dead aged 24 at her home in Seoul on Sunday - had been bombarded with negative press coverage and hate online after a drink-driving conviction in 2022. Police have not provided further details about her death.",
      "Experts found the circumstances leading to it depressingly familiar. Other celebrities also ended up taking their lives after careers upended by cyberbullying.",
      "As Kim was laid to rest on Wednesday, analysts say they are not optimistic her death will lead to  meaningful change.",
      "South Korea's entertainment industry is enjoying massive popularity. Today, there are more than an estimated 220 million fans of Korean entertainment around the world \u2013 that's four times the population of South Korea.",
      "But there is also increasing spotlight on the less glamorous side of the entertainment industry.",
      "South Korea is known for its hyper-competitive culture in most spheres of life - from education to careers. It has one of the highest suicide rates among developed countries. While its overall suicide rate is falling, deaths of those in their 20s are rising.",
      "This pressure is heightened in the case of celebrities. They face immense pressure to be perfect, and are subjected to the demands of obsessive \"super fans\" who can make or break careers.",
      "That is why even the slightest perceived misstep can be career ending. Kim Sae-ron became so unpopular, scenes featuring her were edited out of shows such as Netflix's 2023 drama Bloodhounds.",
      "\"It is not enough that the celebrities be punished by the law. They become targets of relentless criticism,\" Korean culture critic Kim Hern-sik told the BBC.",
      "He referred to K-pop artists Sulli and Goo Hara, who died by suicide in 2019 after long battles with internet trolls, even though they did not have known brushes with the law.",
      "Sulli had offended fans for not conforming to the K-pop mould, while an internet mob had targeted Goo Hara over her relationship with an ex-boyfriend.",
      "'A real life Squid Game'",
      "Cyberbullying has also become a money-making gig for some,  Kim Hern-sik told the BBC.",
      "\"YouTubers get the views, forums get the engagement, news outlets get the traffic. I don't think [Kim's death] will change the situation.",
      "\"There needs to be harsher criminal punishment against leaving nasty comments,\" he says.",
      "Kim Sae-ron's father has blamed a YouTuber for her death, claiming the controversial videos they published caused her deep emotional distress.",
      "Others have pointed fingers at some local media outlets, who reportedly fuelled public animosity against Kim by reporting the unverified claims.",
      "\"This cycle of media-driven character assassination must stop,\" civic group Citizens' Coalition for Democratic Media said in a statement on Tuesday.",
      "Na Jong-ho, a psychiatry professor at Yale University, likened the spate of celebrity deaths in South Korea to a real-life version of Squid Game, the South Korean Netflix blockbuster which sees the indebted fighting to the death for a huge cash prize.",
      "\"Our society abandons those who stumble and moves on as if nothing happened.. How many more lives must be lost before we stop inflicting this destructive, suffocating shame on people?\" he wrote on Facebook.",
      "\"Drunk driving is a big mistake. There would be a problem with our legal system if that goes unpunished. However, a society that buries people who make mistakes without giving them a second chance is not a healthy one,\" Prof Na added.",
      "Last year, the BBC reported on how \"super fans\" in the notorious K-pop industry try to dictate their idols' private lives - from their romantic relationships to their daily activities outside of work - and can be unforgiving when things go off script.",
      "It is no surprise that Kim Sae-ron chose to withdraw from the public eye after her DUI conviction, for which she was fined 20 million won (\u00a311,000) in April 2023.",
      "It is worth noting however, that not all public figures are subject to the same treatment. Politicians, including opposition leader Lee Jae-myung, also have past drink-driving convictions but have been able to bounce back - polls show Lee is now the country's top presidential contender.",
      "In South Korea, it is \"extremely tough\" for artistes to recover when they do something that puts a crack in their \"idol\" image, says K-pop columnist Jeff Benjamin.",
      "He contrasts this to entertainment industries in the West, where controversies and scandals sometimes even \"add a rockstar-like edge\" to celebrities' reputations.",
      "\"While no one cheers when a Hollywood celebrity is arrested for DUI [driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs] or sent to jail for significant crimes, it's not necessarily career-ending,\" he says.",
      "While the Korean entertainment industry has made moves to address performers' mental health concerns, it is unclear how effective these have been.",
      "Real change can only happen when there is no more financial or attention incentives to continue with such intrusive reporting, says Mr Benjamin.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 01:43:21 GMT",
    "summary": "EastEnders stars and commentators reflect on times the soap tackled social taboos over 40 years.",
    "story": [
      "Over its 40-year run, EastEnders hasn't just been plot twists, emotions and gripping \"doof doof\" cliffhangers.",
      "It's also tackled social issues head-on, its stars say.",
      "The series has \"done more to create social awareness\" on these issues \"than probably any documentary\", says actor Ross Kemp, who plays leather-jacket-wearing Grant Mitchell.",
      "Kemp, who is hosting a BBC documentary on the history of the soap, says over the last four decades EastEnders has been able to take on subjects many feel are taboo - and it continues to do so with recent storylines including topics such as spiking.",
      "\"You can introduce those things through a continuing drama, a soap like EastEnders, and inform more people than you possibly would do with a government campaign,\" he says.",
      "First gay kiss",
      "On 17 November 1987, EastEnders aired a kiss between characters Colin Russell (played by Lord Michael Cashman) and his boyfriend Barry Clark (Gary Hailes) on the side of the head.",
      "There was a \"furore\" after the kiss was broadcast, Kemp recalls, adding \"it wasn't even a kiss on the lips\".",
      "Former actor Lord Cashman speaks to Kemp about the reaction during the new documentary EastEnders: 40 Years on the Square.",
      "\"The media went berserk,\" he says. \"There were calls for 'this kind of filth to be taken off our screens'.\"",
      "Lord Cashman says \"it was a weird and dark time,\" adding \"there was rampant homophobia\".",
      "In 1988, Section 28 of the Local Government Act was introduced, which banned places like schools and libraries from \"promoting homosexuality\".",
      "Lord Cashman's character Colin went on to share the first mouth-to-mouth kiss between two gay men on a British soap with character Guido Smith (Nicholas Donovan) in 1989.",
      "However, the former actor, later an activist and politician, recalls the reaction from fans: \"There was one guy and he said: 'I used to stand behind the sofa so that my mum and dad couldn't see me looking at you and I knew I wasn't alone.' It made a difference.\"",
      "Domestic violence",
      "According to Ofcom's first review of public service television broadcasting, audiences said early evening programmes, like soaps, had an important social role in airing complex and controversial issues.",
      "One example came in the early 2000s, when the soap featured a domestic violence and coercive control storyline featuring Little Mo Slater (Kacey Ainsworth) and her brutal partner Trevor Morgan (Alex Ferns).",
      "Actor Ainsworth says members of the public would often confuse her for her character and offer sympathy to her in the street. \"People would try and sit me down in places, they'd put their arms around me,\" she says. \"They'd want to look after me.\"",
      "The actor adds she received \"hundreds\" of letters a week from victims of similar violence.",
      "Though one watchdog at the time said the show went \"too far\" for pre-watershed TV, research for a national domestic violence helpline highlighted the storyline as the most significant TV portrayal of violence in the home in 30 years.",
      "Colourism",
      "Molly Rainford, who plays Anna Knight, was introduced to the Square in 2023. She is the daughter of George Knight and Cindy Beale and is part of the first black and dual heritage family to run a pub on any UK soap.",
      "In February 2024, the soap aired scenes of Molly and her on-screen sister, Gina Knight (Francesca Henry), discussing colourism and how differently they are treated because of their different skin tones.",
      "Colourism is prejudice against people who have a darker skin tone or the preferential treatment of those who are the same race but have lighter skin.",
      "Speaking about the storyline, Rainford says: \"These are conversations that happen in every mixed-raced family's life. All of these conversations are so important and so valid, especially right now.\"",
      "Rainford says parents told her their children had \"conversations on the playground that day after seeing that\".",
      "Transgender representation",
      "In 2015, Riley Carter Millington became the first transgender man to play a recurring trans character in a British soap, with his portrayal of Kyle Slater in EastEnders.",
      "Carter Millington says \"there wasn't a lot of on-screen representation\" for trans people and he was \"overwhelmed\" and grateful to have been cast in the role.",
      "\"I understood the weight of it and I didn't take it lightly,\" the actor says, adding that despite leaving the soap in 2016, he still gets messages from fans about his character.",
      "Kemp adds that EastEnders is \"ever-evolving\" with society - and that while there will \"always be a certain crowd that will poo poo it and look down upon it\", it has made some \"landmark television\" over the last 40 years.",
      "If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story, you can visit BBC Action Line, including for issues related to sexual abuse and violence and domestic abuse.",
      "As part of EastEnders' 40th anniversary week, BBC News will be hosting live coverage of the live episode on Thursday 20 February, which you can watch on BBC One and iPlayer, and follow on our live page.",
      "From Wednesday, you'll be able to cast your vote here on who Denise decides her future is with, Jack or Ravi.",

      "With EastEnders celebrating its 40th anniversary and ITV cutting back soaps in the schedule, I decided it was time to finally watch a soap opera. I watched a week of EastEnders, Emmerdale, and Coronation Street to see whether there's a place for them in the lives of Gen Z.",

      "Her experience was not too dissimilar from mine, except instead of watching soaps, my friends and I crammed onto the sofa eager to find out who had been behaving badly at Casa Amor or which Bushtucker trial awaited a group of intrepid celebrities.",
      "Sitting down to a watch a soap for the first time, I was unsure what to expect. I had never heard anyone my age talk about them before and navigating to ITVX and having to sit through three minutes of adverts was a very different experience from what I'm used to.",
      "I didn't want to do too much research into the shows but I did ask my parents, who are soap fans, to give me a bit of an explainer of who's who.",
      "After the opening titles and iconic theme songs that even I had heard of, I was surprised with how quickly the drama started. There was no scene-setting and I was thrust straight into the middle of some passive aggressive arguing in all three shows.",
      "Although the drama gets progressively more absurd, the sheer amount of scheming and fighting that is crammed into such a short episode means I was hooked for most of the show.",
      "But, I also had a lot of questions about how true the shows are to reality.",
      "How is everyone out and about all day? Don't they have to go to work?",

      "It feels hard to care about Cindy and Ian Beale's fractious relationship on EastEnders when I can watch a real couple break up because one of their heads has been turned by a bombshell contestant entering the Love Island villa.",
      "Only last week, a clip from a Spanish reality TV programme showing a man having a meltdown as he watches a clip of his girlfriend cheating on him went viral.",
      "You can't convince me that watching a man run along a beach howling after learning about his partner's infidelity doesn't make for more engaging TV than a couple shouting faux insults at each other in the laundrette.",
      "Competition with high-budget dramas",
      "Not only are soaps competing with reality TV, but they also face fierce competition from dramas produced by streaming services.",
      "\"It feels like this was filmed 20 years ago,\" my boyfriend says within the first five minutes of watching Coronation Street. Shots are dimly lit, characters stand around in dated kitchens and conversations last a few minutes before flitting to another storyline entirely.",
      "There's nothing wrong with this per se as it adds an element of gritty reality to the shows, but people are now used to high-budget, high-stake dramas with cinematic visuals and star-studded casts.",
      "In just 12 episodes across three soaps there were more plots than I could count - the storylines covered everything from depression to infidelity to knife crime.",
      "In the past, these storylines would have undoubtedly influenced national conversations but for me, it felt like the issues were dealt with heavy-handedly and often felt shoehorned into plotlines.",
      "In comparison to shows such as Sex Education, Euphoria, and Top Boy which resonate with younger audiences by addressing themes like mental health, identity, and social justice in a way that feels authentic and visually compelling, the teenage angst of characters like Betsy and Max in Coronation Street feel unrealistic.",
      "I realise it's unfair to compare the big-budget streamer hits with soaps. The first season of Euphoria which consisted of just eight episodes reportedly cost $165m (\u00a3130m) to produce which is far greater than the budget of soaps.",
      "But, even up against shows such as Made in Chelsea, which likely has a similar budget, soaps still perform poorly with young audiences. Around a quarter of Made in Chelsea's audience is aged 16 to 34.",
      "Perhaps I'm being slightly unfair to the soaps. After all, I am jumping in decades after they first aired with no prior knowledge, so naturally it's harder to build a connection with the characters.",
      "But the longevity of the shows is part of the problem.",
      "I recognised Ian Beale from the meme of him crying \"I've got nothing left\" and I understand the Dingles are one of the most important families in Emmerdale - but I know nothing about their backstories.",

      "While I might not have many thoughts about Phil Mitchell, some young people are massive soap enthusiasts.",
      "Natalie Altman, 25, is an EastEnders fanatic. She started watching it a year ago after seeing clips of the show on TikTok and while it was confusing at first to follow the plots, she immersed herself with learning about their backstories on social media. She says the show feels more authentic than reality TV.",
      "\"I love it so much I've planned my week around the 40th anniversary and even cancelled plans to make sure I can watch it live.\"",
      "Despite none of her friends watching the show and thinking she's a \"loser for watching it\", she says she loves the escapism it provides. \"I'm quite an anxious person so being stressed about things that aren't real is really good for me.\"",
      "Data suggests the London-based drama has more than double the number of young viewers than Emmerdale.",
      "But, in contrast to Natalie, 25-year-old Ryan says EastEnders is a \"bit too doom-and-gloom\" and prefers the other two soaps.",
      "\"They feel more like real life where there are positive and negative storylines.\"",
      "He adds that he doesn't live in a big city so it's nice to watch shows such as Emmerdale that reflect rural life and aren't London-centric.",
      "By the end of the week, I found myself quite enjoying EastEnders more than the other two soaps - which could be partly because I grew up in London and therefore felt more of an inherent connection.",
      "But overall I struggled with the lack of cathartic ending for all of them.",
      "I don't mind a series having multiple episodes but I have to know that all the storylines will eventually be resolved.",
      "With soaps, there is no ending. Storylines carry on even when you think they're over. A character reappears years later or someone's brother's cousin's daughter from five years ago starts digging up the drama again.",
      "I'm unlikely to continue watching soaps after this week but I can see the appeal of them for the people who have been watching it for some time.",
      "There's something impressive about their longevity - will Love Island be celebrating its 40th anniversary in 2055 and will I be tuning in as a pensioner to watch a 21-year-old man tell someone their behaviour is muggy? Probably not.",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 02:19:54 GMT",
    "summary": "Four toddlers born with a rare eye condition have seen \"life-changing improvements\", say UK doctors.",
    "story": [
      "An experimental trial of gene therapy has helped four toddlers - born with one of the most severe forms of childhood blindness - gain \"life-changing improvements\" to their sight, according to doctors at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London.",
      "The rare genetic condition means the babies' vision deteriorated very rapidly from birth.",
      "Before the therapy, they were registered legally blind and only just able to distinguish between dark and light. After the infusion, all parents reported improvements - with some of their young children now able to begin to draw and write.",
      "Further work is being done to confirm the early study, which appears in the Lancet medical journal.",
      "Gene therapy for another form of genetic blindness has been available on the NHS since 2020.",
      "The new work builds on that success by injecting healthy copies of a defective gene into the back of a child's eye, very early in life, to treat a severe form of the condition.",
      "Jace, from Connecticut in the United States, had the gene therapy in London when he was just two years old.",
      "As a young baby, his parents noticed something wasn't right about his eyesight.",
      "\"Around eight weeks old when babies should start looking at you and smiling, Jace wasn't doing that yet,\" says his mum DJ.",
      "She knew instinctively there was an issue and began to search for the reason, which took 10 months.",
      "After several visits to doctors and many tests, the family were told Jace had the ultra rare condition. It's caused by a mutation to a gene called AIPL1 and there is no established treatment.",
      "\"It was a shock,\" Jace's dad Brendan says of his first child.",
      "\"You never think it's going to happen to you, of course, but there was a lot of comfort and relief to finally find out... because it gave us a way to move forward.\"",
      "The family was lucky to hear about an experimental trial being carried out in London - just by chance - when they were at a conference about the eye condition.",
      "Jace's surgery was quick and \"pretty easy\", his mum says. He had four tiny scars in his eye where healthy copies of the gene were injected into the retina at the back of the eye through keyhole surgery.",
      "These copies are contained inside a harmless virus, which goes through the retinal cells and replaces the defective gene. The healthy, working genes then kick start a process which helps the cells at the back of the eye work better and survive longer.",
      "In the first month following treatment, Brendan noticed Jace squint for the first time on seeing bright sunshine streaming through the windows of their house.",
      "His son's progress has been \"pretty amazing\", he says.",
      "\"Pre-surgery, we could have held up an object near his face and he wouldn't be able to track it at all.",
      "\"Now he's picking things off the floor, he's hauling out toys, doing things driven by his sight that he wouldn't have done before.\"",
      "This may not be the last treatment he needs in his life, his parents say, but the improvements so far are helping him to know the world better.",
      "\"It's really hard to undersell the impact of having a little bit of vision,\" Brendan says.",
      "No other options",
      "Prof James Bainbridge, a retinal surgeon at Moorfields Eye Hospital, who helped lead the trial, said giving children the chance of sight improvement this early on could make a big difference to their development and ability to interact with people.",
      "\"Sight impairment in young children has a devastating effect on their development.",
      "\"Treatment in infancy with this new genetic medicine can transform the lives of those most severely affected,\" he said.",
      "The four children, from the United States, Turkey and Tunisia, were all born with an aggressive form of Leber Congenital Amaurosis, where a genetic fault means the cells at the back of their eyes -  that normally help distinguish light and colour- malfunction and rapidly die out.",
      "Scientists at University College London developed the innovative procedure, which involves infusing healthy copies of the gene into the back of the eye, and Great Ormond Street Hospital specialists led on giving the procedure in the trial.",
      "Unlike traditional scientific trials, families were offered this experimental therapy under a special licence designed for compassionate use, when there are no other options readily available.",
      "Children had one eye treated each - a measure taken in case the treatment had any adverse effects.",
      "They were aged between one and three when they had the procedure and their vision was then checked at intervals over the next four years, in a variety of ways - including moving down corridors and identifying doors.",
      "Given their age, some children found the more formal eye tests challenging.",
      "'Hugely impressive'",
      "According to Moorfields' doctors, the results of the tests they completed, alongside the parent's reports of their improvements, give \"compelling evidence\" that all four benefited from the treatment and were seeing more than would be expected with the normal course of the disease.",
      "Vision in their untreated eyes, meanwhile, deteriorated, as expected.",
      "Consultant eye surgeon, Prof Michel Michaelides, at the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, added: \"The outcomes for these children are hugely impressive and show the power of gene therapy to change lives.\"",
      "The team plans to monitor the children to see how long-lasting the results are.",
      "The results so far give them hope that intervening early in other childhood genetic eye conditions could offer the \"greatest benefit\" and ultimately transform children's lives.",

      "Her team has seen an increase in the amount of young people referred for hearing services in the last year. She said: \"There is a difference between hearing and listening. We can see that listening skills are suffering.\"",
      "Noise-cancelling headphones do have their benefits, particularly for long-term ear health where their soundproofing feature can prevent high frequency and loud noise from reaching and damaging the ear - even while listening to music.",
      "Lisa Barber, technology editor at Which?, said the devices had \"exploded in popularity\" in recent years. But the level of transparency can vary from model to model.",
      "\"Some simply offer passive noise cancelling, where the acoustic seal between the headphones and your ears reduces nearby noise,\" she said. Others have a transparency mode that allows you to hear partial background noise.",
      "A false reality?",
      "But Claire Benton, vice-president of the British Academy of Audiology, suggests that by blocking everyday sounds such as cars beeping, there is a possibility the brain can \"forget\" to filter out the noise.",
      "\"You have almost created this false environment by wearing those headphones of only listening to what you want to listen to. You are not having to work at it,\" she said.",
      "\"Those more complex, high-level listening skills in your brain only really finish developing towards your late teens. So, if you have only been wearing noise-cancelling headphones and been in this false world for your late teens then you are slightly delaying your ability to process speech and noise,\" Benton suggests.",
      "For those experiencing difficulties with sound processing in England, APD care in the NHS is limited.",
      "A UK-wide survey from 2024, distributed by the BAA and ENT UK, the professional body representing ear, nose and throat surgery, found that only 4% of audiologists consider themselves to be well-informed on APD.",
      "And, for those who are 16 years and over, the Royal National ENT and Eastman Hospital is the only NHS provider in England offering a full APD assessment and the waiting list is nine months long.",
      "Prof Doris-Eva Bamiou, who carries out the assessments there, says this is partially down to the time it takes to diagnose APD. \"It is a costly service because it is not just an audiogram, the test can take up to two hours and it requires additional assessments. In adults I also refer them for a cognitive assessment and in children I may also need to speak to an educational psychologist.\"",
      "Particularly after the pandemic, behaviours and engagement with visuals and audio has changed. This comes in part due to new products and technology, as well as increased anxiety in noisy environments after the lockdown.",
      "It is now common to see people walking outside wearing their noise-cancelling headphones and watching videos online with subtitles, despite perfectly hearing the sound. One YouGov survey showed that 61% of 18-24 year olds prefer to watch TV with the subtitles on.",
      "Dr Angela Alexander, audiologist and owner of APD Support, a private organisation, is among the audiologists calling for more research into the impact of noise-cancelling headphones on auditory processing, particularly in children.",
      "\"What does the future look like if we don't investigate this link? There are a lot of well-meaning parents and teachers who think the answer to children having problems with noise is to wear ear plugs or having noise-cancelling headphones on.\"",
      "Dr Amjad Mahmood, the head of audiology at Great Ormond Street Hospital supported the call for more research.",
      "He said there had been a \"significant increase in demand\" for assessments at the hospital's large APD clinic for under-16s. \"especially with difficulties noticed at school\".",
      "'Having a hearing dog is like winning the lottery'",
      "Could solar-powered headphones be the next must-have?",
      "Study finds 18m people in the UK have hearing loss",
      "Treatment for APD can make a significant positive difference, with some patients able to make a full recovery.",
      "So-called \"word in noise\" training exercises on mobile apps have become a popular way of practising pulling speech from background noise. But training can vary and includes practice with auditory discrimination too, such as how to distinguish separate sounds in words like seventy and seventeen, and free and three.",
      "Microphones and low-gain hearing aids can also be provided to help the patient in certain situations, such as a meeting or classroom work, but adults outside the education system are not entitled to these products on the NHS.",
      "\"Right now I can hear there is a fan above my head but my brain is telling me that is not something I need to worry about,\" says Dr Alexander, describing what is called auditory scene analysis.",
      "\"It's the way we identify threats in our environment, so it makes sense to me that there would be an increase in anxiety if a person's brain no longer has those inputs helping tell them what is a concern and what is not.\"",
      "To improve this, Dr Alexander suggests reducing headphone use time and using the transparency mode which can amplify the background noise as well as wearing headphones that don't completely occlude or block the ears.",
      "Limited research",
      "Wayne Wilson, an associate professor in the school of health and rehabilitation sciences at The University of Queensland, says more research needs to be done on the possible link.",
      "However, he points out that doing controlled research with so many variables could prove tricky.",
      "\"The devil is in the detail as the answer probably depends on which sounds, which scenes, which noise, which noise cancellation, what period of noise cancellation, what age of child, etc.\"",
      "Sophie is set to start treatment for her APD in the next few months, and feels excited for the future.",
      "\"If me and my boyfriend go out to a bar, sometimes we will leave early because of the noise. It's nice to know maybe after this treatment, I will be able to go to busier places and handle it a bit better.\"",

      "It is into this cauldron of ideological enmity that Sir Keir will seek a hearing when he meets the president and his team at the White House.",
      "So what can and should the prime minister do?",
      "Diplomats say he has one advantage over European allies, namely his permanence. Trump, they say, knows Sir Keir is one of the few European leaders who will stay in power throughout his presidency. Trump, it is said, likes the fact the prime minister has a healthy parliamentary majority.",
      "\"I get along with him well,\" Trump told the BBC a few weeks ago. \"I like him a lot. He's liberal, which is a bit different from me, but I think he's a very good person and I think he's done a very good job thus far.\"",

      "This angered some European leaders who thought it premature and divisive. It also risked Europe getting excluded from discussions about more fundamental issues such as Ukraine's territory and sovereignty. But the troops offer may gain Sir Keir some diplomatic brownie points in the West Wing.",
      "The other thing Sir Keir could offer Trump is the strongest possible language he can muster promising to increase UK defence spending. Starmer is not expected to announce when he will meet his target of spending 2.5% of national income on defence. But he may talk up both the UK's commitment and his calls for other European allies to do likewise.",
      "Sir Alex Younger, former chief of MI6, told BBC Two's Newsnight: \"We need to demonstrate that we are prepared to play a role, take control of our own environment, recognise that we have got to develop our power and that has got to happen quickly.\"",
      "But diplomats say the main argument Starmer must make is to convince Trump that a fast deal on Russian terms would be against his own interests. Namely that the terms of any ceasefire - its fairness, its permanence, its safeguards - were as important as any short term cessation of hostilities. In other words, that there is no point in having a triumphant ceasefire agreement which does not survive for long, risking Trump's reputation.",

      "Key to that would be urging Trump to put pressure on Vladmir Putin by threatening to seize frozen Russian assets, increase support for Ukraine and tighten up sanctions.",
      "Huge risks",
      "But the risks of the prime minister's trip are huge. The famously thin-skinned president could take offence at Sir Keir's outright contradiction of his claim that Zelensky is a dictator. He could be irritated by Sir Keir's insistence that any European reassurance force deployed to Ukraine must have a US \"backstop\", expected in the form of aircover.",
      "The diplomatic pitfalls of cross words and cancelled press conferences will be troubling the minds of British officials as they prepare for the trip. They will be acutely aware President Emmanuel Macron of France will be in Washington before them on Monday, competing for Mr Trump's ear.",
      "Sir Keir likes to say that in these troubled times, the UK can once again become a bridge between Europe and the US. France may be keen for that role too.",
      "Another potential point of tension will be trade. Team Trump is promising to impose tariffs on UK goods entering the US that match VAT levied on American goods entering the UK. One argument the UK could make is that hitting British and European trade will make it harder for them to spend more on defence. But officials say that would be a hard argument to make to a president who thinks Europe is ripping off the US both economically and militarily.",
      "The greatest risk, however, is that no manner of charm, politics or diplomacy may touch the sides of this new administration, that there is simply no transactional offer that can bridge the vast ideological divide that now exists between Europe and the US. That may be the cold hard lesson the British delegation learns in Washington.",

    "story": [
      "UK inflation jumped sharply in the year to January, driven by rising food prices, air fares and an increase in private school fees.",
      "The higher-than-expected jump to 3% from 2.5% in December, means prices rose at the fastest pace for 10 months.",
      "Food staples such as meat, eggs, butter and cereals were all more expensive than a year ago and comes as many households prepare for higher energy and water bills later this year.",
      "Following the latest figures, the government warned that the road back to low inflation would be \"bumpy\", but the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats argued Labour's tax rises and spending plans had caused the latest spike.",
      "Rising food prices last month mean, on average, the cost of buying groceries is 3.3% more expensive than it was a year ago.",
      "While many staples have edged up in price, some items such as olive oil and lamb have increased markedly, by 17% and 16% respectively.",
      "The rise in inflation, which is a measure used to give a general picture of how living costs have changed over a year, comes ahead of predicted increases to energy bills in April.",
      "Water and council tax bills are also slated to rise in two months' time, which will push up the cost of living for households.",
      "The government has raised the minimum wage for all age groups from April. Benefits and the state pension will also increase.",
      "But some businesses have warned that higher pay, as well as a rise in National Insurance, will mean increased prices for customers as companies attempt to cover increased costs.",
      "\"Life is a struggle\"",
      "\"Life is a struggle,\" said Gaby Cowley. The young mum told the BBC that she could already \"barely make both ends meet\" but food prices are now \"ridiculous\" \u2013 something that keeps her up at night.",
      "\"Food shopping has almost doubled from about three years ago,\" she said. \"We spend, maybe, a minimum of \u00a390 a month now and that doesn't include \u00a320-\u00a330 topping up during the week with fruit, veg and milk.\"",

      "She hopes the rise in minimum wage will see her pay go up, although she thinks the struggle is far from over.",
      "UK wages continue to outpace inflation",
      "When will interest rates go down again?",
      "As well as food, inflation was fuelled last month by plane tickets. Air fares tend to rise into December and fall into January, but the drop was less than in previous years, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).",
      "It also said that private school fees grew by about 13% at the beginning of the year due to VAT being added from 1 January after the government removed the tax exemption.",
      "The sharper rise in inflation - it had been expected to climb to 2.8% - has also led to speculation over how the Bank of England will react in terms of interest rates.",
      "High inflation in recent years, peaking at 11.1% in October 2022, saw the bank raise interest rates, which pushed up the cost of loans, credit cards and mortgages.",
      "As price rises have eased, borrowing costs have fallen and the Bank decided to cut rates earlier this month to 4.5%.",
      "But with the rate remaining above the Bank's 2% target, some economists suggest further cuts could be made at a slower pace.",
      "Professor Jonathan Haskel, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate-setting committee, told the BBC that policymakers could \"take no signal\" from the inflation spike and carry on cutting rates gradually or view it as a \"harbinger of more to come\" and change course.",
      "Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the ONS, said because the VAT charge on private schools came into effect last month, the impact on inflation was a \"one-off\".",
      "But Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the threat of higher wage bills for supermarkets and producers meant there was \"every chance\" food price rises in January would not be the last.",
      "\"This is on top of rises in everything from water bills and council tax - which is why it has become known as Awful April,\" she said.",
      "James Murray, exchequer secretary to the Treasury, admitted that getting inflation back down to the 2% target would be \"bumpy\".",
      "\"We are in a different world than we were a few years ago under the previous government, where inflation was routinely double digits,\"  he said.",
      "\"The Bank of England has been clear that they expected inflation to be slightly higher in the first half of this year....but we're confident in our plan for change to make sure that we're kick-starting economic growth by making the reforms that are necessary to boost economic growth right across the country,\" he added.",
      "But shadow chancellor Mel Stride said Labour's \"tax hikes and inflation-busting pay rises\" were to blame for the scale of January's rise.",
      "Liberal Democrat Leader Ed Davey added: \"The chancellor's misguided policies are putting us at risk of a new era of stagflation. The economy still isn't growing, and now people are being hit in their pockets too.\"",
      "Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said January's figure would be \"uncomfortable\" for the Bank of England, but said she doubted it would prevent further rate cuts.",
      "\"The risk is that the rise in inflation proves more persistent and rates are cut more slowly than we expect, or not as far,\" she added."

      "Capturing water from fog - on a large scale - could provide some of the driest cities in the world with drinking water.",
      "This is what researchers in Chile have concluded after studying the potential of fog harvesting in the desert city of Alto Hospicio in the north of the country.",
      "Average rainfall in the region is less than 0.19in (5mm) per year.",
      "\"Like a lot of cities, Alto Hospicio has its social problems,\" said lead researcher Dr Virginia Carter Gamberini, from Universidad Mayor. \"There is a lot of poverty\", she explained, and many people there have no direct access to the networks that supply clean water.",
      "Many who live in the city's poorest communities rely on drinking water that is delivered by truck.",
      "However, clouds of fog that regularly gather over the mountain city are an untapped source, researchers say.",
      "How do you harvest fog?",
      "Capturing fog water is remarkably simple - a mesh is hung between poles, and when the moisture-laden clouds pass through that fine mesh, droplets form. The water is then channelled into pipes and storage tanks.",
      "It has been used at a small scale for several decades, mainly in rural South and Central America - in places with the right foggy conditions. One of the biggest fog water harvesting systems is in Morocco, on the edge of the Sahara Desert.",
      "However, Dr Carter says a \"new era\" of much larger-scale fog harvesting could provide a more  secure and sustainable supply of water in urban environments where it is most needed.",
      "She and her colleagues carried out assessments of how much water can be produced by fog harvesting, and combined that information with studies of cloud formation in satellite images and with weather forecasts.",
      "From this, they concluded that the clouds that regularly form over the Pacific - and are blown across the coastal mountain city - could provide the people of Alto Hospicio's slums with a sustainable source of drinking water.

    "summary": "The planet's glaciers have lost 5% of their ice in little over 20 years, according to a major study.",
    "story": [
      "The world's glaciers are melting faster than ever recorded under the impact of climate change, according to the most comprehensive scientific analysis to date.",
      "Mountain glaciers - frozen rivers of ice \u2013 act as a freshwater resource for millions of people worldwide and lock up enough water to raise global sea-levels by 32cm (13in) if they melted entirely.",
      "But since the turn of the century, they have lost more than 6,500 billion tonnes \u2013 or 5% \u2013 of their ice.",
      "And the pace of melting is increasing. Over the past decade or so, glacier losses were more than a third higher than during the period 2000-2011.",
      "The study combined more than 230 regional estimates from 35 research teams around the world, making scientists even more confident about exactly how fast glaciers are melting, and how they will evolve in the future.",
      "Glaciers are excellent indicators of climate change.",
      "In a stable climate, they remain roughly the same size, gaining about as much ice through snowfall as they lose through melting.",
      "But glaciers have been shrinking pretty much everywhere over the past 20 years as temperatures have risen due to human activities, principally burning fossil fuels.",
      "Between 2000 and 2023, glaciers outside the major ice-sheets of Greenland and Antarctica lost around 270 billion tonnes of ice a year on average.",
      "These numbers aren't easy to get your head around. So Michael Zemp, director of the World Glacier Monitoring Service and lead author of the study, uses an analogy.",
      "The 270 billion tonnes of ice lost in a single year \"corresponds to the [water] consumption of the entire global population in 30 years, assuming 3 litres per person and day\", he told BBC News.",
      "The rate of change in some regions has been particularly extreme. Central Europe, for example, has lost 39% of its glacier ice in little over 20 years.",
      "The novelty of this study, published in the journal Nature, is not so much finding that glaciers are melting faster and faster \u2013 we already knew that. Instead, its strength lies in drawing together evidence from across the research community.",
      "There are various ways of estimating how glaciers are changing, from field measurements to different types of satellite data. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.",
      "Direct measurements on glaciers, for example, give very detailed information, but are only available for a tiny fraction of the more than 200,000 glaciers worldwide.",
      "By systematically combining these different approaches, scientists can be much more certain about what's going on.",
      "These community estimates \"are vital as they give people confidence to make use of their findings\", said Andy Shepherd, head of the Department of Geography and Environment at Northumbria University, who was not an author of the recent study.",
      "\"That includes other climate scientists, governments, and industry, plus of course anyone who is concerned about the impacts of global warming.\"",
      "Glaciers take time to fully respond to a changing climate \u2013 depending on their size, anywhere between a few years and many decades.",
      "That means they will continue to melt in the years ahead.",
      "But, crucially, the amount of ice lost by the end of the century will strongly depend on how much humanity continues to warm the planet by releasing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.",
      "This could be the difference between losing a quarter of the world's glacier ice, if global climate targets are met, and nearly half if warming continues uncontrolled, the study warns.",
      "\"Every tenth of a degree of warming that we can avoid will save some glaciers, and will save us from a lot of damage,\" Prof Zemp explained.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "What is the Paris climate agreement?",
      "These consequences go beyond local changes to landscapes and ecosystems \u2013 or \"what happens on the glacier doesn't stay there\", as Prof Zemp puts it.",
      "Hundreds of millions of people worldwide rely to some extent on seasonal meltwater from glaciers, which act like giant reservoirs to help buffer populations from drought. When the glaciers disappear, so does their supply of water.",
      "And there are global consequences too. Even seemingly small increases to global sea-level \u2013 from mountain glaciers, the major Greenland and Antarctic ice-sheets, and warmer ocean waters taking up more space - can significantly increase the frequency of coastal flooding.",
      "\"Every centimetre of sea-level rise exposes another 2 million people to annual flooding somewhere on our planet,\" said Prof Shepherd.",
      "Global sea-levels have already risen by more than 20cm (8in) since 1900, with around half of that coming since the early 1990s, and faster increases are expected in the decades ahead.",

    "title": "What is a sinkhole and how are they formed?",
    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 19:45:17 GMT",
    "summary": "Two sinkholes have appeared in the Surrey village of Godstone, but how have they formed and are they dangerous?",
    "story": [
      "Residents in the Surrey village of Godstone have been evacuated after two sinkholes opened up this week along large parts of the high street.",
      "The original hole first appeared late on Monday night, growing to at least 65ft (20m) long by Tuesday lunchtime.",
      "Sinkholes are not uncommon in the UK but can sometimes appear suddenly. What might be the causes and should we be more worried about them?",
      "What is a sinkhole?",
      "A sinkhole is a depression in the surface because the underlying rock has collapsed.",
      "They can be saucer-shaped or appear deeper more like shafts. If they occur in built-up areas they can appear more irregular as a road or another structure above can distort the shape.",
      "In Godstone, the collapsed ground is under a road which is partially concealing the size of the depression.",
      "How are they formed?",
      "Sinkholes can appear for many different reasons - it is often due to the geology but human factors can also be a cause.",
      "One of the most common reasons for a sinkhole is when rocks like limestone or chalk break down. This happens because carbon dioxide from the air dissolves in rainwater to form carbonic acid - this then percolates through the rock and reacts with it, causing it to dissolve.",
      "Sometimes this process can happen gradually, where the depression becomes larger over time.",
      "In other instances, the limestone sits below another layer of rock, which means that as it gets dissolved there are no immediate signs at the surface.",
      "The overlying rock, sometimes clay or sandstone, will then suddenly collapse into the depression beneath - called a 'collapse sinkhole'.",
      "These are most common in South Wales where sandstone rocks lie above caves in the limestone.",
      "But human activities can also accelerate the formation of sinkholes or cause the ground to collapse in a similar way.",
      "Dr Andrew Farrant, British Geological Survey regional geologist for south-east England, suspects that is what has happened in Godstone and it is not a true sinkhole.",
      "He said that one theory is that a burst water main has caused a sudden influx of water into the sandstone bed and has \"flushed\" weak sand out the way.",
      "Pete Burgess, of the Wealden Cave and Mines Society, said a quarry marked \"sand pit\" can be seen on 19th century maps of land directly under the sinkhole.",
      "He added that sand from the pit was dug out and used for building and gardening purposes.",
      "Dr Farrant said that sand pit had been filled in but he added unrecorded underground sand mines may be present in the area, and it is possible that a leaking pipe may have triggered the collapse of these underground mines and allowed sediment to be flushed out from beneath the road.",
      "How common are sinkholes in the UK?",
      "They are common in the UK because of the abundance of limestone and chalk rock and historic mining activities.",
      "Limestone and chalk are formed from the deposit and compression of micro-organisms found in shallow warm seas. Millions of years ago the UK was located further south towards the equator and was much warmer with parts of the country submerged - creating the ideal conditions for these rock types to form.",
      "Dr Vanessa Banks, expert in shallow geohazards and risks at the British Geological Survey, told the BBC's Radio 4 PM programme: \"Sinkholes occur in spates but many are not recorded as they occur in remote areas.\"",
      "She added that meteorological conditions play a role as extreme downpours can flush water through the rocks or put pressure on infrastructure like water mains.",
      "Last December, about 30 homes were evacuated in Merthyr Tydfil after the ground collapsed, and in 2014 sinkholes occurred at five to ten times the normal rate across south-east England after intense storm conditions.",
      "Are they dangerous?",
      "\"Collapse sinkholes\" which can appear suddenly and without any warnings at the surface, like cracks or subsidence, can be dangerous.",
      "In 2010, a sinkhole measuring 20m in diameter and 90m deep, appeared in Guatemala City which resulted in the death of one person. In this case heavy rains and poor drainage are thought to have weakened the underlying rock.",
      "And in January a truck cabin was swallowed by a sinkhole in the Japanese city of Yashio, apparently as the result of a sewer rupture. The truck's 74-year-old driver was reported missing.",
      "In the case of dissolution sinkholes geologists can indicate which areas are more at risk if the underlying rock is made up of chalk or limestone. For any new development in the UK the local planning authority does review the geology and any potential risks.",
      "But Dr Collins, reader in geology and geotechnical engineering at Brunel University, said that in this case where water infrastructure plays a role it is harder to predict potential ground collapses.",
      "\"The pipe rupture does highlight the challenge that comes with having buried infrastructure as they are often buried at depths in excess of a metre. The depth is to reduce the impact of deep freeze during a very cold winter.",
      "\"Unfortunately, this makes them hard to monitor and repairs can be difficult, including the replacement of soil in the excavated hole once the repair is complete,\" he said.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 06:56:31 GMT",
    "summary": "Though 90 of the 157 stranded whales survived, they could not be saved due to complex conditions.",
    "story": [
      "Australian authorities are euthanising about 90 false killer whales which survived a mass stranding on a remote beach in Tasmania.",
      "A team of experts at the site said complex conditions have made it impossible to save them.",
      "They are part of a pod of 157 whales that had beached near Arthur River, in the island's north west. The rest had died shortly after the stranding.",
      "Tasmania has seen a series of mass whale strandings in recent years - including the country's worst-ever in 2020 - but false killer whales haven't mass stranded there in over 50 years.",
      "False killer whales are technically one of world's largest dolphin species, like their orca namesakes. They can grow up to 6m (19ft) and weigh 1.5 tonnes.",
      "Authorities on Wednesday said the pod had been stranded at the site for 24 to 48 hours, and the surviving animals were already under extreme stress.",
      "Local resident Jocelyn Flint told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation she had travelled to the site on Wednesday morning after her son noticed the pod while out shark fishing overnight.",
      "\"There are babies... There's just families of them. Their eyes are open, they're looking at me, like 'help'.\"",
      "\"It's just absolutely horrific.\"",
      "The site - about 300km (186 miles) from the city of Launceston - is extremely difficult to access and transport any rescue equipment to, marine biologist Kris Carlyon told media.",
      "\"This is possibly the trickiest location I've seen in 16 years of doing this role in Tasmania,\" he said.",
      "\"We're talking a very rough, steep, single lane road into the site. We can get four-wheel drives in there, but not a lot else.\"",
      "Rough conditions meant returning the animals to the sea at the location they stranded was impossible, so an expert team tried to relocate two and refloat them, but were unsuccessful.",
      "\"The animals just can't get past the break to get out. They just keep turning around and coming back towards the beach,\" said Shelley Graham, from Tasmania's Parks and Wildlife Service.",
      "With conditions for the next two days forecast to be similar, expert wildlife veterinarians made the \"tough\" and \"confronting\" decision to euthanise the remaining whales.",
      "\"The longer these animals are out stranded, the longer they are suffering. All alternative options have been unsuccessful, euthanasia is always a last resort,\" Dr Carlyon said.",
      "That grim task - which involves shooting the animals -  is expected to begin on Wednesday but continue on Thursday.",
      "Authorities are still working out how to dispose of the carcasses. The site has important cultural heritage for Aboriginal people so a department spokesperson earlier suggested \"it may be a case of... letting nature run its course\".",
      "Authorities have asked members of the public to avoid the site, with bushfires burning nearby and limited road access.",
      "More than 80% of Australian whale strandings take place in Tasmania - often on its west coast.",
      "Around 470 pilot whales were stranded further south at Macquarie Harbour in 2020 and about 350 of them died despite rescue efforts. Another 200 become stranded in the same harbour in 2022.",
      "Whales are highly social mammals and are well known for stranding in groups because they travel in large, close-knit communities which rely on constant communication.",
      "There are a range of theories for why beachings occur. Some experts say the animals can become disorientated after following fish they hunt to the shore.",
      "Others believe that one individual can mistakenly lead whole groups to shore.",

    "published": "Sat, 15 Feb 2025 00:45:06 GMT",
    "summary": "The world's frozen oceans keep the planet cool, but they currently have less ice than ever recorded before.",
    "story": [
      "The world's frozen oceans, which help to keep the planet cool, currently have less ice than ever previously recorded, satellite data shows.",
      "Sea-ice around the north and south poles acts like a giant mirror by reflecting much of the Sun's energy back into space.",
      "But as rising temperatures cause this bright layer to shrink, the dark ocean below can absorb more heat, warming the planet further.",
      "This latest sea-ice low appears to have been driven by a combination of warm air, warm seas and winds breaking apart the ice.",
      "Over the 5 days to 13 February, the combined extent of Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice was 15.76 million sq km (6.08 million sq miles), according to BBC analysis of data from the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC).",
      "This breaks the previous 5-day record low of 15.93 million sq km (6.15 million sq miles) from January-February 2023.",
      "Arctic sea-ice is currently at its smallest recorded extent for the time of year, while Antarctic sea-ice is close to a new low in satellite records going back to the late 1970s.",
      "The decline of Arctic sea-ice in response to a warming planet is well-established. Its end-of-summer extent fell from an average of 7 million sq km in the 1980s to 4.5 million sq km in the 2010s.",
      "But until the mid-2010s, Antarctic sea-ice had been remarkably resilient, defying predictions that it would shrink.",
      "Since then, Antarctica has shown a series of very low sea-ice extents, although there is still lots of natural variability.",
      "\"Every year, every data point that we get suggests that this isn't a temporary shift, but something more permanent, like what we've seen in the Arctic,\" Walter Meier, senior research scientist at NSIDC, told BBC News.",
      "\"It is indicating that the Antarctic has moved into a new regime of lower ice extents.\"",
      "Antarctic sea-ice is relatively thin and mobile - being surrounded by ocean rather than continents like the Arctic - so it can be particularly sensitive to winds breaking up the ice.",
      "But warmer air and warmer waters look to have played a key role in this latest 2025 low, towards the end of the southern hemisphere summer.",
      "The Antarctic ice-shelves \u2013 ice flowing off the Antarctic continent, rather than sea-ice \u2013 appear to have had a particularly extreme season of surface melting, driven by high air temperatures.",
      "\"Atmospheric conditions in December and January looked like they were strongly promoting surface melting on the ice-shelves,\" said Tom Bracegirdle, research scientist at the British Antarctic Survey.",
      "\"That could also have contributed to what we've seen in Antarctic sea-ice, and ongoing ocean warming is setting the backdrop to all of this as well.\"",
      "Antarctica's record sea-ice low of 2023 would have been a one-in-2,000 year event without climate change, according to a recent study. Yet 2025 is not far from eclipsing it.",
      "At the other end of the planet, the Arctic should be reaching its annual maximum, with cold winter temperatures helping the oceans to freeze over.",
      "But current sea-ice extent is nearly 0.2 million sq km below anything previously recorded for the time of year, and has been tracking very low since late 2024.",
      "This is partly as a result of a late freeze-up of ice around Hudson Bay, with unusually warm ocean waters taking a long time to cool down.",
      "As well as warmer seas, some storms also disrupted ice around the Barents and Bering Seas, with the consequences likely amplified by long-term reductions in sea-ice thickness.",
      "\"A thinner ice cover is more responsive to weather [\u2026 so] weather events can have a stronger impact than they used to,\" said Julienne Stroeve, professor of polar observation and modelling at University College London.",
      "In recent weeks, Arctic sea-ice has moved even further below average. Temperatures around the north pole were about 20C above normal in early February, leading to melting conditions in places like Svalbard.",
      "This \"is quite astonishing\" for the time of year, according to Dr Bracegirdle.",
      "This very low winter extent doesn't necessarily mean the Arctic will end up with record conditions throughout 2025, as conditions can change quickly at the poles.",
      "But, with the Arctic warming nearly four times faster than the global average, declines over the coming decades are almost inevitable.",
      "The Arctic is expected to be essentially free of sea-ice at the end of its summer at least once before 2050, according to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Some recent studies suggest it could happen sooner.",
      "Declining sea-ice at both poles not only has implications for local wildlife like polar bears and penguins, but also the Earth's climate.",
      "Polar sea-ice has already lost around 14% of its natural cooling effect since the early-to-mid 1980s, as the area of bright, reflective ice has declined, according to a study published last year.",
      "\"If you significantly change the sea ice distribution in and around Antarctica, you modify that part of the planet which is actually helping us fight against climate change,\" said Simon Josey, a professor at the National Oceanography Centre.",
      "Sea-ice also plays an important role in the great ocean conveyor, the mass movement of water that helps distribute heat around the planet and keeps places like the UK and north-west Europe relatively mild.",
      "\"If we see another strong winter loss [of Antarctic sea-ice], people are going to start to worry about what it's doing to the ocean circulation,\" said Prof Josey.",

    "summary": "The planet's glaciers have lost 5% of their ice in little over 20 years, according to a major study.",
    "story": [
      "The world's glaciers are melting faster than ever recorded under the impact of climate change, according to the most comprehensive scientific analysis to date.",
      "Mountain glaciers - frozen rivers of ice \u2013 act as a freshwater resource for millions of people worldwide and lock up enough water to raise global sea-levels by 32cm (13in) if they melted entirely.",
      "But since the turn of the century, they have lost more than 6,500 billion tonnes \u2013 or 5% \u2013 of their ice.",
      "And the pace of melting is increasing. Over the past decade or so, glacier losses were more than a third higher than during the period 2000-2011.",
      "The study combined more than 230 regional estimates from 35 research teams around the world, making scientists even more confident about exactly how fast glaciers are melting, and how they will evolve in the future.",
      "Glaciers are excellent indicators of climate change.",
      "In a stable climate, they remain roughly the same size, gaining about as much ice through snowfall as they lose through melting.",
      "But glaciers have been shrinking pretty much everywhere over the past 20 years as temperatures have risen due to human activities, principally burning fossil fuels.",
      "Between 2000 and 2023, glaciers outside the major ice-sheets of Greenland and Antarctica lost around 270 billion tonnes of ice a year on average.",
      "These numbers aren't easy to get your head around. So Michael Zemp, director of the World Glacier Monitoring Service and lead author of the study, uses an analogy.",
      "The 270 billion tonnes of ice lost in a single year \"corresponds to the [water] consumption of the entire global population in 30 years, assuming 3 litres per person and day\", he told BBC News.",
      "The rate of change in some regions has been particularly extreme. Central Europe, for example, has lost 39% of its glacier ice in little over 20 years.",
      "The novelty of this study, published in the journal Nature, is not so much finding that glaciers are melting faster and faster \u2013 we already knew that. Instead, its strength lies in drawing together evidence from across the research community.",
      "There are various ways of estimating how glaciers are changing, from field measurements to different types of satellite data. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.",
      "Direct measurements on glaciers, for example, give very detailed information, but are only available for a tiny fraction of the more than 200,000 glaciers worldwide.",
      "By systematically combining these different approaches, scientists can be much more certain about what's going on.",
      "These community estimates \"are vital as they give people confidence to make use of their findings\", said Andy Shepherd, head of the Department of Geography and Environment at Northumbria University, who was not an author of the recent study.",
      "\"That includes other climate scientists, governments, and industry, plus of course anyone who is concerned about the impacts of global warming.\"",
      "Glaciers take time to fully respond to a changing climate \u2013 depending on their size, anywhere between a few years and many decades.",
      "That means they will continue to melt in the years ahead.",
      "But, crucially, the amount of ice lost by the end of the century will strongly depend on how much humanity continues to warm the planet by releasing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.",
      "This could be the difference between losing a quarter of the world's glacier ice, if global climate targets are met, and nearly half if warming continues uncontrolled, the study warns.",
      "\"Every tenth of a degree of warming that we can avoid will save some glaciers, and will save us from a lot of damage,\" Prof Zemp explained.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "What is the Paris climate agreement?",
      "These consequences go beyond local changes to landscapes and ecosystems \u2013 or \"what happens on the glacier doesn't stay there\", as Prof Zemp puts it.",
      "Hundreds of millions of people worldwide rely to some extent on seasonal meltwater from glaciers, which act like giant reservoirs to help buffer populations from drought. When the glaciers disappear, so does their supply of water.",
      "And there are global consequences too. Even seemingly small increases to global sea-level \u2013 from mountain glaciers, the major Greenland and Antarctic ice-sheets, and warmer ocean waters taking up more space - can significantly increase the frequency of coastal flooding.",
      "\"Every centimetre of sea-level rise exposes another 2 million people to annual flooding somewhere on our planet,\" said Prof Shepherd.",
      "Global sea-levels have already risen by more than 20cm (8in) since 1900, with around half of that coming since the early 1990s, and faster increases are expected in the decades ahead.",

      "A few days after Trump's inauguration, South Korea, the world's third largest liquified natural gas importer, has hinted its intention to buy more American oil and gas aimed at reducing a trade surplus with the US and improving energy security, international media have reported from Seoul.",
      "Officials with Japan's largest power generator, JERA, have told Reuters they too want to increase purchases of liquified natural gas from the US to diversify supply, as it currently imports half of it from the Asia-Pacific region.",
      "\"There is certainly a threat that if the US seeks to either flood markets with cheap fossil fuels, or bully countries into buying more of its fossil fuels, or both, the global energy transition might be slowed,\" said Lorne Stockman, research director with Oil Change International, a research and advocacy organisation for transition to clean energy.",
      "Scientists have said there can be no new fossil fuel extraction and there needs to be a rapid reduction of carbon emissions (around 45% by 2030 from the 2019 level) if the world is to limit warming to 1.5 Celsius compared to the pre-industrial period.",
      "\"The economics of energy supply are a key driver of decarbonisation,\" said David Brown, director of energy transition practice at Wood Mackenzie, a global energy think-tank.",
      "\"The resource base of US energy supports the role of natural gas and liquids production. By contrast, import-dependent economies such as China, India, and those in Southeast Asia have a dramatic economic incentive to decarbonise sources of energy.\"",
      "Global energy transition investment surpassed $2tn for the first time last year but studies have also shown that the growth of clean energy transition has markedly slowed in recent years, while many major banks continue to finance fossil fuels."

    "summary": "The world's frozen oceans keep the planet cool, but they currently have less ice than ever recorded before.",
    "story": [
      "The world's frozen oceans, which help to keep the planet cool, currently have less ice than ever previously recorded, satellite data shows.",
      "Sea-ice around the north and south poles acts like a giant mirror by reflecting much of the Sun's energy back into space.",
      "But as rising temperatures cause this bright layer to shrink, the dark ocean below can absorb more heat, warming the planet further.",
      "This latest sea-ice low appears to have been driven by a combination of warm air, warm seas and winds breaking apart the ice.",
      "Over the 5 days to 13 February, the combined extent of Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice was 15.76 million sq km (6.08 million sq miles), according to BBC analysis of data from the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC).",
      "This breaks the previous 5-day record low of 15.93 million sq km (6.15 million sq miles) from January-February 2023.",
      "Arctic sea-ice is currently at its smallest recorded extent for the time of year, while Antarctic sea-ice is close to a new low in satellite records going back to the late 1970s.",
      "The decline of Arctic sea-ice in response to a warming planet is well-established. Its end-of-summer extent fell from an average of 7 million sq km in the 1980s to 4.5 million sq km in the 2010s.",
      "But until the mid-2010s, Antarctic sea-ice had been remarkably resilient, defying predictions that it would shrink.",
      "Since then, Antarctica has shown a series of very low sea-ice extents, although there is still lots of natural variability.",
      "\"Every year, every data point that we get suggests that this isn't a temporary shift, but something more permanent, like what we've seen in the Arctic,\" Walter Meier, senior research scientist at NSIDC, told BBC News.",
      "\"It is indicating that the Antarctic has moved into a new regime of lower ice extents.\"",
      "Antarctic sea-ice is relatively thin and mobile - being surrounded by ocean rather than continents like the Arctic - so it can be particularly sensitive to winds breaking up the ice.",
      "But warmer air and warmer waters look to have played a key role in this latest 2025 low, towards the end of the southern hemisphere summer.",
      "The Antarctic ice-shelves \u2013 ice flowing off the Antarctic continent, rather than sea-ice \u2013 appear to have had a particularly extreme season of surface melting, driven by high air temperatures.",
      "\"Atmospheric conditions in December and January looked like they were strongly promoting surface melting on the ice-shelves,\" said Tom Bracegirdle, research scientist at the British Antarctic Survey.",
      "\"That could also have contributed to what we've seen in Antarctic sea-ice, and ongoing ocean warming is setting the backdrop to all of this as well.\"",
      "Antarctica's record sea-ice low of 2023 would have been a one-in-2,000 year event without climate change, according to a recent study. Yet 2025 is not far from eclipsing it.",
      "At the other end of the planet, the Arctic should be reaching its annual maximum, with cold winter temperatures helping the oceans to freeze over.",
      "But current sea-ice extent is nearly 0.2 million sq km below anything previously recorded for the time of year, and has been tracking very low since late 2024.",
      "This is partly as a result of a late freeze-up of ice around Hudson Bay, with unusually warm ocean waters taking a long time to cool down.",
      "As well as warmer seas, some storms also disrupted ice around the Barents and Bering Seas, with the consequences likely amplified by long-term reductions in sea-ice thickness.",
      "\"A thinner ice cover is more responsive to weather [\u2026 so] weather events can have a stronger impact than they used to,\" said Julienne Stroeve, professor of polar observation and modelling at University College London.",
      "In recent weeks, Arctic sea-ice has moved even further below average. Temperatures around the north pole were about 20C above normal in early February, leading to melting conditions in places like Svalbard.",
      "This \"is quite astonishing\" for the time of year, according to Dr Bracegirdle.",
      "This very low winter extent doesn't necessarily mean the Arctic will end up with record conditions throughout 2025, as conditions can change quickly at the poles.",
      "But, with the Arctic warming nearly four times faster than the global average, declines over the coming decades are almost inevitable.",
      "The Arctic is expected to be essentially free of sea-ice at the end of its summer at least once before 2050, according to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Some recent studies suggest it could happen sooner.",
      "Declining sea-ice at both poles not only has implications for local wildlife like polar bears and penguins, but also the Earth's climate.",
      "Polar sea-ice has already lost around 14% of its natural cooling effect since the early-to-mid 1980s, as the area of bright, reflective ice has declined, according to a study published last year.",
      "\"If you significantly change the sea ice distribution in and around Antarctica, you modify that part of the planet which is actually helping us fight against climate change,\" said Simon Josey, a professor at the National Oceanography Centre.",
      "Sea-ice also plays an important role in the great ocean conveyor, the mass movement of water that helps distribute heat around the planet and keeps places like the UK and north-west Europe relatively mild.",
      "\"If we see another strong winter loss [of Antarctic sea-ice], people are going to start to worry about what it's doing to the ocean circulation,\" said Prof Josey.",

      "A meeting between Chinese president Xi Jinping and some of the country's foremost business leaders this week has fuelled excitement and speculation, after Alibaba founder Jack Ma was pictured at the event.",
      "The charismatic and colourful Mr Ma, who was one of China's most prominent businessmen, had withdrawn from public life after criticising China's financial sector in 2020.",
      "His reappearance at Monday's event has sparked a wave of discussion, with experts and analysts wondering what it means for him, China's tech sector and the economy in general.",
      "The response has been overwhelmingly positive - tech stocks, including those of Alibaba, rallied soon after the event.",
      "On Thursday, the e-commerce giant reported financial results that beat expectations, with shares ending the trading day in New York more than 8% higher. The company's shares are up 60% since the beginning of the year.",
      "So what are analysts reading into Mr Ma's appearance at the event alongside other high-profile guests - including DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng?",
      "Is Jack Ma 'rehabilitated'?",
      "Analysts began looking for clues about the significance of the meeting as soon as Chinese state media started releasing pictures of the event.",
      "\"Jack Ma's attendance, his seating in the front row, even though he did not speak, and his handshake with Xi are clear signs he has been rehabilitated,\" China analyst Bill Bishop wrote.",
      "Social media was abuzz with users praising Mr Ma for his return to the public spotlight.",
      "\"Congratulations [Jack] Ma for the safe landing,\" said one user on Chinese social media platform Weibo.",
      "\"The comeback of [Jack] Ma is a shot in the arm to the current Chinese economy,\" said another.",
      "It is unsurprising that observers have attached so much significance to an appearance by Mr Ma.",
      "Before his disappearance from public life in 2020 - following comments at a financial conference that China's state-owned banks had a \"pawn-shop mentality\" - Mr Ma was the poster boy for China's tech industry.",
      "An English teacher with no background in computing, Mr Ma co-founded Alibaba in his apartment more than two decades ago after convincing a group of friends to invest in his online marketplace.",
      "He went on to build one of China's largest tech conglomerates and become one of the country's richest men.",
      "That was before his \"pawn shop\" comment, when he also lamented the \"lack of innovation\" in the country's banks.",
      "It led to the cancellation of his $34.5bn (\u00a327.4bn) stock market flotation of  Ant Group, his financial technology giant.",
      "This was seen at the time as an attempt by Beijing to humble a company that had become too powerful, and a leader who had become too outspoken.",
      "Analysts agree that the fact he's back in the spotlight, at a symposium where Xi Jinping himself presided, is a very good sign for Mr Ma.",
      "Some caution, however, that the fact he was not among the speakers may show that he has not fully returned to the exalted status he once enjoyed.",
      "Also, the lack of coverage his attendance received in Chinese media outlets seems to confirm he has not been completely rehabilitated.",

      "He also said it was the \"right time for private enterprises and private entrepreneurs to fully display their talents\".",
      "This has been widely interpreted as the government telling private tech firms that they too are back in good graces.",
      "Mr Ma's downfall had preceded a broader crackdown on China's tech industry.",
      "Companies came to face much tighter enforcement of data security and competition rules, as well as state control over important digital assets.",
      "Other companies across the private sector, ranging from education to real estate, also ended up being targeted in what came to be known as the \"common prosperity\" campaign.",
      "The measures put in place by the common prosperity policies were seen by some as a way to rein in the billionaire owners of some of China's biggest companies, to instead give customers and workers more of a say in how firms operate and distribute their earnings.",
      "But as Beijing imposed tough new regulations, billions of dollars were wiped off the value of some of these companies - many of them tech firms - rattling international investors.",
      "This, along with a worsening global economy that was affected by the pandemic as well as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has contributed to considerable changes in China's economic situation.",
      "Growth has slowed, jobs for the country's youth have become more scarce and, amid a property sector downturn, people are not spending enough.",
      "As rumours that Mr Ma would attend Monday's meeting began to spread, so did a glimmer of hope. Richard Windsor, director of technology at research firm Counterpoint, said Mr Ma's presence would be a sign that China's leadership \"had enough of stagnation and could be prepared to let the private sector have a much freer hand\".",
      "Aside from Mr Ma and Mr Liang, the list of guests also included key figures from companies such as telecommunications and smartphone firm Huawei, electric-vehicle (EV) giant BYD, and many others from across the tech and industrial sectors.",

      "\"[It] likely indicates the importance of technology... and the contribution of private enterprises to the development and growth of China's economy.\"",
      "Those present at the meeting seemed to share that sentiment. Lei Jun, the chief executive of consumer electronics giant Xiaomi, told state media that he senses the president's \"care and support\" for businesses.",
      "Is it because of US sanctions?",
      "The symposium took place after the country experienced what some observers have described as a \"Sputnik moment\": the arrival of DeepSeek's disruptive R1 artificial intelligence (AI) model at the end of last month.",
      "Soon after its release, the Chinese-made AI chatbot rose through the ranks to become one of the most downloaded in the world. It also triggered a sudden sell-off of major US tech stocks, as fears mounted over America's leadership in the sector.",
      "Back in China, the app's global success has sparked a wave of national pride that has quickly spread to financial markets. Investment has been pouring into Chinese stocks - particularly those of tech companies - listed in Hong Kong and mainland China.",
      "Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs has also upgraded its outlook for Chinese stocks, saying rapid AI adoption could boost companies' revenues and attract as much as $200bn of investment.",
      "But the biggest significance of this innovation was that it came as a result of DeepSeek having to innovate due to a ban on the export of advanced chips and technology to China.",
      "Now, with Trump back in the White House and his fondness of trade tariffs, Mr Xi may have found it necessary to recalibrate his approach to China's entrepreneurs.",
      "Instead of a return to an era of unregulated growth, some analysts believe Monday's meeting signalled an attempt to steer investors and businesses toward Mr Xi's national priorities.",
      "The Chinese president has been increasingly emphasising policies that the government has referred to as \"high-quality development\" and \"new productive forces\".",
      "Such ideas have been used to reflect a switch from what were previously fast drivers of growth, such as property and infrastructure investment, towards high-end industries such as semiconductors, clean energy and AI.",
      "The goal is to achieve \"socialist modernisation\" by 2035 - higher living standards for everyone, and an economy driven by advanced manufacturing and less reliant on imports of foreign technology.",
      "Mr Xi knows that to get there he will need the private sector fully on board.",
      "\"Rather than marking the end of tech sector scrutiny, [Jack Ma's] reappearance suggests that Beijing is pivoting from crackdowns to controlled engagement,\" an associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney, Marina Zhang told the BBC.",
      "\"While the private sector remains a critical pillar of China's economic ambitions, it must align with national priorities - including self-reliance in key technologies and strategic industries.\""

      "More than 80% of Australian children aged eight to 12 use social media or messaging services that are only meant to be for over-13s, according to new research.",
      "It comes as Australia plans to implement a total social media ban for under-16s that is expected by the end of this year.",
      "The country's internet regulator, eSafety, found YouTube, TikTok and Snapchat were the most popular platforms used by young children.",

      "Researchers questioned over 1,500 children across Australia aged between eight and 15 about their usage of social media and messaging platforms.",

      "Snapchat, TikTok, Twitch and YouTube told the authors they deployed tools and technology to detect whether a user may be under the age of 13 once they were using the service.",
      "\"Proactive tools and technologies may rely on a user actively engaging with a service (such as connecting with others, communicating with others, sharing and creating content) to detect relevant signals,\" the report said.",

      "Apple has been struggling to find a new product that excites consumers - sales of iPhones dropped at the end of last year.",

      "Its name is clearly a nod to its iPhone SE series, which were released from 2016 to  2022, and were also lower priced.",
      "Apple said the iPhone 16e would be available for pre-order from 21 February in 59 countries.",
      "It will launch in the UK for \u00a3599, which is \u00a3200 less than the iPhone 16 - but more than double the price of the original iPhone SE went for when it launched in 2016.",

    "summary": "It says a new chip it has created could end up being as important a breakthrough as the semiconductor.",
    "story": [
      "Microsoft has unveiled a new chip called Majorana 1 that it says will enable the creation of quantum computers able to solve \"meaningful, industrial-scale problems in years, not decades\".",
      "It is the latest development in quantum computing - tech which uses principles of particle physics to create a new type of computer able to solve problems ordinary computers cannot.",
      "Creating quantum computers powerful enough to solve important real-world problems is very challenging - and some experts believe them to be decades away.",
      "Microsoft says this timetable can now be sped up because of the \"transformative\" progress it has made in developing the new chip involving a \"topological conductor\", based on a new material it has produced.",
      "The firm believes its topoconductor has the potential to be as revolutionary as the semiconductor was in the history of computing.",
      "But experts have told the BBC more data is needed before the significance of the new research - and its effect on quantum computing - can be fully assessed.",
      "Jensen Huang - boss of the leading chip firm, Nvidia - said in January he believed \"very useful\" quantum computing would come in 20 years.",
      "Chetan Nayak, a technical fellow of quantum hardware at Microsoft, said he believed the developments would shake up conventional thinking about the future of quantum computers.",
      "\"Many people have said that quantum computing, that is to say useful quantum computers, are decades away,\" he said. \"I think that this brings us into years rather than decades.\"",
      "Travis Humble, director of the Quantum Science Center of Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the US, said he agreed Microsoft would now be able to deliver prototypes faster - but warned there remained work to do.",
      "\"The long term goals for solving industrial applications on quantum computers will require scaling up these prototypes even further,\" he said.",
      "What is quantum computing?",
      "Quantum computing holds the promise of carrying out calculations that would take today's systems millions of years and could unlock discoveries in medicine, chemistry and many other fields.",
      "There are numerous important problems that \"classical\" computers, of the sort we use every day in our phones, and laptops and power most modern applications, cannot solve.",
      "But these are problems quantum machines might be able to rapidly crack, promising new discoveries by creating new medicines or designing better batteries.",
      "A host of technology firms, including the silicon valley giants, are currently engaged in a multi-billion dollar race to develop a quantum computer powerful enough to solve these problems.",
      "Microsoft is approaching the problem differently to most of its rivals.",
      "Its path to building a quantum computer relied upon being able to create a \"topoconductor\" or topological conductor.",
      "It uses the newly developed material to create a new state of matter- a so-called \"topological state\" which isn't a gas, liquid or solid and, until relatively recently, had existed only in theory.",
      "Specifically, it relies on so-called Majorana particles, which themselves were previously considered theoretical - work claiming that they had been discovered in 2018 had to be retracted.",
      "High risk, high reward?",
      "While rivals produced a steady stream of announcements - notably Google's \"Willow\" at the end of 2024 - Microsoft seemed to be taking longer.",
      "Pursuing this approach was, in the company's own words, a \"high-risk, high-rewards\" strategy, but one it now believes is going to pay off.",
      "\"In the same way that the invention of semiconductors made today's smartphones, computers and electronics possible, topoconductors and the new type of chip they enable offer a path to developing quantum system,\" Microsoft said.",
      "The biggest challenge of quantum computers relates to their fundamental building block, called a qubit, which is incredibly fast but also extremely difficult to control and prone to errors.",
      "The more qubits a chip has the more capable it is.",
      "Microsoft says it has put eight of its new topological qubits on its new chip - considerably less than the chips created by some of its rivals.",
      "However, it claims to have a path to scaling it up to a million qubits - which would create immense computing power.",
      "Professor Paul Stevenson of Surrey University said the research published by Microsoft was a \"significant step\", but he felt it had tough challenges ahead.",
      "\"Until the next steps have been achieved, it is too soon to be anything more than cautiously optimistic,\" he said.",
      "Chris Heunen, Professor of Quantum Programming at the University of Edinburgh, told the BBC he felt Microsoft's plans were \"credible\".",
      "\"This is promising progress after more than a decade of challenges, and the next few years will see whether this exciting roadmap pans out,\" he said."

    "published": "Mon, 17 Feb 2025 03:50:48 GMT",
    "summary": "Elon Musk's goal might be hindering the growth potential of the AI firm of his rival Sam Altman, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "OpenAI's board of directors has officially rejected Elon Musk's nearly $100bn offer for the maker of what is the world's best-known artificial intelligence (AI) tool, ChatGPT.",
      "But the unsolicited bid might not be a failure - at least as far as Musk is concerned, experts say.",
      "That's because the offer could still complicate CEO Sam Altman's plans to transform OpenAI from a non-profit controlled entity to a for-profit company.",
      "Musk is \"basically trying to stymie OpenAI's growth trajectory,\" said University of Cambridge associate teaching professor Johnnie Penn in an interview with the BBC.",
      "Profit & non-profit",
      "Last week, Musk and a consortium of investors including Hollywood superagent Ari Emanuel tabled a $97.4bn (\u00a378.4bn) offer for all of OpenAI's assets.",
      "It was a huge sum - but less than the $157bn the firm was valued at in a funding round just four months ago, and much lower than the $300bn that some think it is worth now.",
      "Complicating all of this is OpenAI's unusual structure which involves a partnership between non-profit and for-profit arms.",
      "Mr Altman is understood to want to change that, stripping it of its non-profit board.",
      "That involves costs which Mr Musk is seemingly trying to inflate.",
      "\"What Musk is trying to do here is raise the perceived value of the non-profit arm of OpenAI, so that OpenAI has to pay more to get out of the obligations it has to its own non-profit,\" said Dr Penn.",
      "The value of its non-profit assets isn't clear. With his bid, Musk was floating a price, according to Cornell University senior lecturer Lutz Finger, who is also the founder and CEO of AI startup R2Decide.",
      "\"By Musk putting a price tag on the non-profit part, he makes the split way more expensive for Altman to do,\" Mr Finger told the BBC. \"It's very simple.\"",
      "What is AI and how does it work?",
      "'Missed the AI train'",
      "Mr Musk justified his actions by saying he wants to return OpenAI - which he co-founded - to its non-profit roots and original mission of developing AI for the benefit of humanity.",
      "Others, though, suggest he has somewhat less noble motives linked to his own AI company xAI and chatbot Grok, which have received a lacklustre response from the public.",
      "\"Musk has missed the AI train, somewhat. He's behind, and he has made several attempts to catch up,\" Mr Finger said.",
      "Now, Mr Finger says, Mr Musk is trying to kneecap his most formidable competitor.",
      "An already-tense relationship appeared to worsen further last week with Mr Altman taunting Mr Musk's offer on X, and Mr Musk retorting by calling his onetime partner a \"swindler\".",
      "Mr Altman then hit back in an interview with Bloomberg, opining that Mr Musk is not \"a happy person\" and saying his decisions are made from a \"position of insecurity\".",
      "The tit-for-tat is also playing out in court, where US district judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers is considering Mr Musk's request for an injunction that would block OpenAI from its planned conversion.",
      "He claims that he will be irreparably harmed without her intervention.",
      "\"It is plausible that what Mr Musk is saying is true. We'll find out. He'll sit on the stand,\" Gonzalez Rogers said during a hearing in Musk v Altman earlier this month in Oakland, California.",
      "According to OpenAI's lawyers, Mr Musk's recent bid contradicts his earlier claims that OpenAI's assets cannot be transferred away for \"private gain.\"",
      "\"[O]ut of court, those constraints evidently do not apply, so long as Musk and his allies are the buyers,\" their reply brief states.",
      "Some observers say making a deal never appeared to be his goal.",
      "\"I think he's just trying to create noise and news and consternation,\" says Karl Freund, founder and principal analyst at Cambrian-AI.",
      "But in addition to causing problems for his old rival, that strategy could inflict lasting damage on Mr Musk's own reputation.",
      "\"He's brilliant. He creates incredible companies that are doing incredible things. But his personal agenda is causing people to question his motives,\" Mr Freund said."

      "Changes which come in on Sunday permit so-called \"fingerprinting\", which allows online advertisers to collect more data about users including their IP addresses and information about their devices.",
      "Google says this data is already widely used by other companies, and it continues to encourage responsible data use.",
      "However the company had previously come out strongly against this kind of data collection, saying in a 2019 blog that fingerprinting \"subverts user choice and is wrong.\"",
      "But in a post announcing the new rule changes, Google said the way people used the internet - such as devices like smart TVs and consoles - meant it was harder to target ads to users using conventional data collection, which users control with cookie consent.",

      "Google told the BBC in a statement: \"Privacy-enhancing technologies offer new ways for our partners to succeed on emerging platforms... without compromising on user privacy.\"",

      "What is fingerprinting?",
      "Fingerprinting collects information about a person's device and browser and puts it together to create a profile of that person.",
      "The information is not explicitly collected in order to advertise to people, but it can be used to target specific ads based on that user's data.",
      "For example, a person's screen size or language settings are legitimately needed in order to display a website properly.",
      "But when that is combined with their time zone, browser type, battery level - and many other data points - it can create a unique combination of settings which makes it easier to work out who is using a web service.",
      "These details along with someone's IP address - the unique identifier used by internet devices - were previously prohibited by Google for ad targeting.",
      "Privacy campaigners say that unlike cookies, which are small files stored on a local device, users have little control over whether they send fingerprinting information to advertisers.",
      "\"By explicitly allowing a tracking technique that they previously described as incompatible with user control, Google highlights its ongoing prioritisation of profits over privacy,\" said Lena Cohen, staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.",
      "\"The same tracking techniques that Google claims are essential for online advertising also expose individuals' sensitive information to data brokers, surveillance companies, and law enforcement,\" she added.",
      "'Irresponsible' change",

      "\"Should people feel comfortable staying in a grey area of privacy? I'd say no,\" he adds.",
      "GumGum, which has worked with the BBC on ad campaigns before, relies on something called contextual advertising, which uses other data points to target adverts to online users, such as keywords on the website they are on - rather than their personal data.",
      "Mr Wallace says allowing fingerprinting represents a shift in the industry.",
      "\"Fingerprinting feels like it's taking a much more business-centric approach to the use of consumer data rather than a consumer-centric approach,\" he says.",
      "\"This sort of flip-flopping is, in my opinion, detrimental to that route that the industry seemed to be taking towards this idea of really putting consumer privacy at the forefront.\"",
      "He adds that he hopes ad tech companies conclude \"that it isn't the appropriate way to use consumer data,\" but expects them to look at fingerprinting as an option in order to better target adverts.",
      "Advertising is the lifeblood of the internet business model, and allow many websites to be freely available to users without them having to directly pay to access them.",
      "But in return, users often have to give up private information about themselves so that advertisers can show them relevant adverts.",
      "The UK's data watchdog, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), says \"fingerprinting is not a fair means of tracking users online because it is likely to reduce people's choice and control over how their information is collected.\"",

    "story": [
      "Twenty five years ago computer programmers were racing to fix the millennium bug amidst fears that it would cause banking systems to crash and planes to fall out of the sky.",
      "Much to everyone's relief the impact turned out to be minimal.",
      "Today, some fear there is a new critical threat to the world\u2019s digital infrastructure. But this time, we cannot predict exactly when it will move from theory to reality, while the ubiquity of digital technology means fixing the problem is even more complicated.",
      "That\u2019s because the arrival of quantum computing means that many of the encryption algorithms that underpin and secure our hyperconnected world will be trivially easy to crack.",
      "Quantum computing is radically different to the \u201cclassical\u201d computing used today. Instead of processing binary bits which exist in one of two states \u2013 one or zero, on or off \u2013 quantum computing uses qubits, which can exist in multiple states, or superpositions.",
      "\u201cThe reason why it's so powerful is because you're doing all those possible computations simultaneously,\u201d Prof Nishanth Sastry, director of research for computer science at the University of Surrey, explains. This means it's \u201cmuch, much more efficient, much, much more powerful.\u201d",
      "This means quantum systems offer the possibility of solving key problems that are beyond classical computers, is areas such as medical research and materials science, or cracking particularly complex mathematical problems.",
      "The problem is some of those same mathematical problems underpin the encryption algorithms that help to ensure trust, confidentiality and privacy across today\u2019s computer networks.",
      "Today\u2019s computers would take thousands, even millions of years, to crack current encryption standards, such as RSA. A suitably powerful quantum computer could, theoretically, do the job in minutes.",
      "This has implications for everything from electronic payments and ecommerce to satellite communications. \u201cAnything that's protected by something that's vulnerable becomes fair game for people that have access to quantum relevant computers,\u201d says Jon France, chief information security officer at non-profit cybersecurity organization ISC2.",
      "Quantum computers capable of breaking asymmetric encryption are thought to be years away.",
      "But progress is being made.",
      "In December, Google said its new quantum chip incorporates key \"breakthroughs\" and \"paves the way to a useful, large-scale quantum computer\".",
      "Some estimates say a quantum device capable of breaking current encryption would require 10,000 qubits, while others say millions would be needed. Today\u2019s systems have a few hundred at most.",
      "But businesses and governments face a problem right now, as attackers could harvest encrypted information and decrypt it later when they do gain access to suitably powerful devices.",
      "Greg Wetmore, vice president for software development at security firm Entrust, says if such devices could emerge in the next decade, technology leaders need to ask, \u201cWhat data in your organization is valuable for that period of time?\u201d",
      "That could be national security information, personal data, strategic plans, and intellectual property and secrets - think of a soft drink company\u2019s \u201csecret\u201d formula or the precise balance of herbs and spices in a fast food recipe.",
      "Mr France adds, if quantum computing becomes widespread, the threat becomes more immediate with the encryption that protects our daily banking transactions, for example, potentially trivial to break.",
      "The good news is that researchers and the technology industry have been working on solutions to the problem. In August, the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the US released three post quantum encryption standards.",
      "The agency said these would \u201csecure a wide range of electronic information, from confidential email messages to e-commerce transactions that propel the modern economy.\u201d It is encouraging computer system administrators to transition to the new standards as soon as possible, and said a further 18 algorithms are being evaluated as backup standards.",
      "The problem is this means a massive upgrade process touching virtually all our technology infrastructure.",
      "\u201cIf you think about the number of things out there with asymmetric encryption in them, it's billions of things. We're facing a really big change problem,\u201d says Mr France.",
      "Some digital infrastructure will be relatively easy to upgrade. Your browser, for example, will simply receive an update from the vendor says Mr France. \u201cThe challenge really comes in discrete devices and the internet of things (IOT),\u201d he continues.",
      "These might be hard to track down, and geographically inaccessible. Some equipment \u2013 legacy devices in critical national infrastructure such as water systems, for example \u2013 might not be powerful enough to handle the new encryption standards.",
      "Mr Wetmore says the industry has managed encryption transitions in the past, but \u201cIt's the sharper discontinuity that makes this threat more serious.\u201d",
      "So, it is trying to help customers build \u201ccrypto agility\u201d by setting out policies now and using automation to identify and manage their cryptographic assets. \u201cThat's the secret to making this transition an orderly one and not a chaotic one.\u201d",
      "And the challenge extends into space. Prof Sastry says many satellites \u2013 such as the Starlink network \u2013 should be relatively straightforward to upgrade, even if it means briefly taking an individual device offline temporarily.",
      "\u201cAt any given point in time, especially with the LEO (low earth orbit) satellites, you've got 10 to 20 satellites above your head,\u201d Prof Sastry says. \u201cSo, if one can't serve you, well so what? There are nine others that can serve you.\u201d",
      "More challenging, he says, are \u201cremote sensing\u201d satellites, which include those used for geographical or intelligence purposes. These carry a lot more compute power on board and typically include some sort of secure computing module. A hardware upgrade effectively means replacing the whole device. However, says Prof Sastry, this is now less of a problem thanks to more frequent and lower cost satellite launches.",
      "While the impact of the millennium bug might have been minimal in the first days of 2000, that's because an immense amount of work had gone into fixing it ahead of a known deadline, says Fran\u00e7ois Dupressoir, associate professor in cryptography at the University of Bristol.",
      "By contrast, he adds, that it is not possible to predict when current encryption will become vulnerable.",

      "It remains unclear what caused the incident, which is under investigation.",
      "There were 76 passengers and four crew on the flight, which had travelled from the US city of Minneapolis before making its crash-landing in Canada.",

      "Witnesses recount escape from flipped plane",
      "Toronto law firm Rochon Genova says it has been retained by certain passengers and their families over the crash-landing.",
      "Lawyer Vincent Genova said the group expected a \"timely and fair resolution\", highlighting that his clients \"suffered personal injuries of a serious nature that required hospital attention\".",
      "In an email to the BBC, Mr Genova said the $30,000 compensation is an \"advance\" payment meant to assist plane crash victims with short-term financial challenges, and the airline will seek to deduct it from any later settled claims.",
      "There is precedent to these types of payments, like in 2013, when Asiana Airlines offered passengers of a San Francisco plane crash $10,000 in initial compensation.",
      "Last year, Alaska Airlines offered a $1,500 cash payment to passengers after mid-air door-plug blowout on a flight from Portland.",
      "Following this week's incident in Toronto, the plane crew and emergency responders were praised for their quick work in removing people from the wrecked vehicle. The plane's various safety features have also been credited for ensuring no loss of life.",
      "All of the 21 passengers who were taken to hospital had been released by Thursday morning, the airline said.",
      "Delta's chief told the BBC's US partner CBS News that the flight crew were experienced and trained for any condition.",
      "The airline's head Ed Bastian told CBS the plane crew had \"performed heroically, but also as expected\", given that \"safety is embedded into our system\". He said Delta was continuing to support those affected.",
      "Several theories about what caused the crash have been suggested to the BBC by experts who reviewed footage, including that harsh winter weather and a rapid rate of descent played a role.",
      "One passenger recalled \"a very forceful event\", and the sound of \"concrete and metal\" at the moment of impact. Another said passengers were left hanging upside down in their seats \"like bats\".",
      "The cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder have been recovered from the wreckage. The investigation is being led by Canada's Transportation Safety Board (TSB), supported by US officials.",
      "On Wednesday evening, the wreckage was removed from the airport runway.",
      "The accident was the fourth major air incident in North America in a space of three weeks - and was followed on Wednesday by a crash in Arizona in which two people lost their lives when their small planes collided.",
      "Experts continue to insist that air travel is overwhelmingly safe - more so than other forms of transport, in fact.",
      "That message was emphasised by US Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, who told CBS on Wednesday there was no pattern behind the incidents, each of which he said was \"very unique\"."

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:53:54 GMT",
    "summary": "An Indian drug maker tells a BBC undercover team its addictive cocktail drug is \u201cvery harmful\u201d but \u201cthis is business\u201d.",
    "story": [
      "An Indian pharmaceutical company is manufacturing unlicensed, highly addictive opioids and exporting them illegally to West Africa where they are driving a major public health crisis in countries including Ghana, Nigeria, and Cote D'Ivoire, a BBC Eye investigation has revealed.",
      "Aveo Pharmaceuticals, based in Mumbai, makes a range of pills that go under different brand names and are packaged to look like legitimate medicines. But all contain the same harmful mix of ingredients: tapentadol, a powerful opioid, and carisoprodol, a muscle relaxant so addictive it's banned in Europe.",
      "This combination of drugs is not licensed for use anywhere in the world and can cause breathing difficulties and seizures. An overdose can kill. Despite the risks, these opioids are popular as street drugs in many West African countries, because they are so cheap and widely available.",
      "The BBC World Service found packets of them, branded with the Aveo logo, for sale on the streets of Ghanaian, Nigerian, and Ivoirian towns and cities.",
      "Having traced the drugs back to Aveo's factory in India, the BBC sent an undercover operative inside the factory, posing as an African businessman looking to supply opioids to Nigeria. Using a hidden camera, the BBC filmed one of Aveo's directors, Vinod Sharma, showing off the same dangerous products the BBC found for sale across West Africa.",
      "In the secretly recorded footage, the operative tells Sharma that his plan is to sell the pills to teenagers in Nigeria \"who all love this product\". Sharma doesn't flinch. \"OK,\" he replies, before explaining that if users take two or three pills at once, they can \"relax\" and agrees they can get \"high\". Towards the end of the meeting, Sharma says: \"This is very harmful for the health,\" adding \"nowadays, this is business.\"",
      "It is a business that is damaging the health and destroying the potential of millions of young people across West Africa.",
      "In the city of Tamale, in northern Ghana, so many young people are taking illegal opioids that one of the city's chiefs, Alhassan Maham, has created a voluntary task force of about 100 local citizens whose mission is to raid drug dealers and take these pills off the streets.",
      "\"The drugs consume the sanity of those who abuse them,\" says Maham, \"like a fire burns when kerosene is poured on it.\" One addict in Tamale put it even more simply. The drugs, he said, have \"wasted our lives\".",
      "The BBC team followed the task force as they jumped on to motorbikes and, following a tip off about a drug deal, launched a raid in one of Tamale's poorest neighbourhoods. On the way they passed a young man slumped in a stupor who, according to locals, had taken these drugs.",
      "When the dealer was caught, he was carrying a plastic bag filled with green pills labelled Tafrodol. The packets were stamped with the distinctive logo of Aveo Pharmaceuticals.",
      "It's not just in Tamale that Aveo's pills are causing misery. The BBC found similar products, made by Aveo, have been seized by police elsewhere in Ghana.",
      "We also found evidence that Aveo's pills are for sale on the streets of Nigeria and Cote D'Ivoire, where teenagers dissolve them in an alcoholic energy drink to increase the high.",
      "Publicly-available export data show that Aveo Pharmaceuticals, along with a sister company called Westfin International, is shipping millions of these tablets to Ghana and other West African countries.",
      "Nigeria, with a population of 225 million people, provides the biggest market for these pills. It has been estimated that about four million Nigerians abuse some form of opioid, according to Nigeria's National Bureau of Statistics.",
      "The Chairman of Nigeria's Drug and Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Brig Gen Mohammed Buba Marwa, told the BBC, opioids are \"devastating our youths, our families, it's in every community in Nigeria\".",
      "In 2018, following a BBC Africa Eye investigation into the sale of opioids as street drugs, Nigerian authorities tried to get a grip on a widely abused opioid painkiller called tramadol.",
      "The government banned the sale of tramadol without prescription, imposed strict limits on the maximum dose, and cracked down on imports of illegal pills. At the same time, Indian authorities tightened export regulations on tramadol.",
      "Not long after this crackdown, Aveo Pharmaceuticals began to export a new pill based on tapentadol, an even stronger opioid, mixed with the muscle-relaxant carisoprodol.",
      "West African officials are warning that opioid exporters appear to be using these new combination pills as a substitute for tramadol and to evade the crackdown.",
      "In the Aveo factory there were cartons of the combination drugs stacked on top of each other, almost ceiling-high. On his desk, Vinod Sharma laid out packet after packet of the tapentadol-carisoprodol cocktail pills that the company markets under a range of names including Tafrodol, the most popular, as well as TimaKing and Super Royal-225.",
      "He told the BBC's undercover team that \"scientists\" working in his factory could combine different drugs to \"make a new product\".",
      "People outside the UK can watch the documentary on YouTube.",
      "Aveo's new product is even more dangerous than the tramadol it has replaced. According to Dr Lekhansh Shukla, assistant professor at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences in Bengaluru, India, tapentadol \"gives the effects of an opioid\" including very deep sleep.",
      "\"It could be deep enough that people don't breathe, and that leads to drug overdose,\" he explained. \"And along with that, you are giving another agent, carisoprodol, which also gives very deep sleep, relaxation. It sounds like a very dangerous combination.\"",
      "Carisoprodol has been banned in Europe because it is addictive. It is approved for use in the US but only for short periods of up to three weeks. Withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, insomnia, and hallucinations.",
      "When mixed with tapentadol the withdrawal is even \"more severe\" compared to regular opioids, said Dr Shukla. \"It's a fairly painful experience.\"",
      "He said he knew of no clinical trials on the efficacy of this combination. Unlike tramadol, which is legal for use in limited doses, the tapentadol-carisoprodol cocktail \"does not sound like a rational combination\", he said. \"This is not something that is licensed to be used in our country.\"",
      "In India, pharmaceutical companies cannot legally manufacture and export unlicensed drugs unless these drugs meet the standards of the importing country. Aveo ships Tafrodol and similar products to Ghana, where this combination of tapentadol and carisoprodol is, according to Ghana's national Drug Enforcement Agency, unlicensed and illegal. By shipping Tafrodol to Ghana, Aveo is breaking Indian law.",
      "We put these allegations to Vinod Sharma and Aveo Pharmaceuticals. They did not respond.",
      "The Indian drugs regulator, the CDSCO, told us the Indian government recognises its responsibility towards global public health and is committed to ensuring India has a responsible and strong pharmaceutical regulatory system.",
      "It added that exports from India to other countries are closely monitored and that recently tightened regulation is strictly enforced. It also called importing countries to support India's efforts by ensuring they had similarly strong regulatory systems.",
      "The CDSCO stated it has taken up the matter with other countries, including those in West Africa, and is committed to working with them to prevent wrongdoing. The regulator said it will take immediate action against any pharmaceutical firm involved in malpractice.",
      "Aveo is not the only Indian company making and exporting unlicensed opioids. Publicly available export data suggest other pharma companies manufacture similar products, and drugs with different branding are widely available across West Africa.",
      "These manufacturers are damaging the reputation of India's fast-growing pharmaceutical industry, which makes high-quality generic medicines upon which millions of people worldwide depend and manufactures vaccines which have saved millions of lives. The industry's exports are worth at least $28bn (\u00a322bn) a year.",
      "Speaking about his meeting with Sharma, the BBC's undercover operative, whose identity must remain concealed for his safety, says: \"Nigerian journalists have been reporting on this opioid crisis for more than 20 years but finally, I was face to face\u2026 with one of the men at the root of Africa's opioid crisis, one of the men who actually makes this product and ships it into our countries by the container load. He knew the harm it was doing but he didn't seem to care\u2026 describing it simply as business.\"",
      "Back in Tamale, Ghana, the BBC team followed the local task force on one final raid that turned up even more of Aveo's Tafrodol. That evening they gathered in a local park to burn the drugs they had seized.",
      "\"We are burning it in an open glare for everybody to see,\" said Zickay, one of the leaders, as the packets were doused in petrol and set ablaze, \"so it sends a signal to the sellers and the suppliers: if they get you, they'll burn your drugs\".",
      "But even as the flames destroyed a few hundred packets of Tafrodol, the \"sellers and suppliers\" at the top of this chain, thousands of miles away in India, were churning out millions more - and getting rich on the profits of misery."

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:42:26 GMT",
    "summary": "Analysts say the Alibaba founder's re-emergence could signal a policy change in Beijing.",
    "story": [
      "A meeting between Chinese president Xi Jinping and some of the country's foremost business leaders this week has fuelled excitement and speculation, after Alibaba founder Jack Ma was pictured at the event.",
      "The charismatic and colourful Mr Ma, who was one of China's most prominent businessmen, had withdrawn from public life after criticising China's financial sector in 2020.",
      "His reappearance at Monday's event has sparked a wave of discussion, with experts and analysts wondering what it means for him, China's tech sector and the economy in general.",
      "The response has been overwhelmingly positive - tech stocks, including those of Alibaba, rallied soon after the event.",
      "On Thursday, the e-commerce giant reported financial results that beat expectations, with shares ending the trading day in New York more than 8% higher. The company's shares are up 60% since the beginning of the year.",
      "So what are analysts reading into Mr Ma's appearance at the event alongside other high-profile guests - including DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng?",
      "Is Jack Ma 'rehabilitated'?",
      "Analysts began looking for clues about the significance of the meeting as soon as Chinese state media started releasing pictures of the event.",
      "\"Jack Ma's attendance, his seating in the front row, even though he did not speak, and his handshake with Xi are clear signs he has been rehabilitated,\" China analyst Bill Bishop wrote.",
      "Social media was abuzz with users praising Mr Ma for his return to the public spotlight.",
      "\"Congratulations [Jack] Ma for the safe landing,\" said one user on Chinese social media platform Weibo.",
      "\"The comeback of [Jack] Ma is a shot in the arm to the current Chinese economy,\" said another.",
      "It is unsurprising that observers have attached so much significance to an appearance by Mr Ma.",
      "Before his disappearance from public life in 2020 - following comments at a financial conference that China's state-owned banks had a \"pawn-shop mentality\" - Mr Ma was the poster boy for China's tech industry.",
      "An English teacher with no background in computing, Mr Ma co-founded Alibaba in his apartment more than two decades ago after convincing a group of friends to invest in his online marketplace.",
      "He went on to build one of China's largest tech conglomerates and become one of the country's richest men.",
      "That was before his \"pawn shop\" comment, when he also lamented the \"lack of innovation\" in the country's banks.",
      "It led to the cancellation of his $34.5bn (\u00a327.4bn) stock market flotation of  Ant Group, his financial technology giant.",
      "This was seen at the time as an attempt by Beijing to humble a company that had become too powerful, and a leader who had become too outspoken.",
      "Analysts agree that the fact he's back in the spotlight, at a symposium where Xi Jinping himself presided, is a very good sign for Mr Ma.",
      "Some caution, however, that the fact he was not among the speakers may show that he has not fully returned to the exalted status he once enjoyed.",
      "Also, the lack of coverage his attendance received in Chinese media outlets seems to confirm he has not been completely rehabilitated.",
      "Is the crackdown on the tech industry over?",
      "Xi Jinping told participants at the symposium that their companies needed to innovate, grow and remain confident despite China's economic challenges, which he described as \"temporary\" and \"localised\".",
      "He also said it was the \"right time for private enterprises and private entrepreneurs to fully display their talents\".",
      "This has been widely interpreted as the government telling private tech firms that they too are back in good graces.",
      "Mr Ma's downfall had preceded a broader crackdown on China's tech industry.",
      "Companies came to face much tighter enforcement of data security and competition rules, as well as state control over important digital assets.",
      "Other companies across the private sector, ranging from education to real estate, also ended up being targeted in what came to be known as the \"common prosperity\" campaign.",
      "The measures put in place by the common prosperity policies were seen by some as a way to rein in the billionaire owners of some of China's biggest companies, to instead give customers and workers more of a say in how firms operate and distribute their earnings.",
      "But as Beijing imposed tough new regulations, billions of dollars were wiped off the value of some of these companies - many of them tech firms - rattling international investors.",
      "This, along with a worsening global economy that was affected by the pandemic as well as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has contributed to considerable changes in China's economic situation.",
      "Growth has slowed, jobs for the country's youth have become more scarce and, amid a property sector downturn, people are not spending enough.",
      "As rumours that Mr Ma would attend Monday's meeting began to spread, so did a glimmer of hope. Richard Windsor, director of technology at research firm Counterpoint, said Mr Ma's presence would be a sign that China's leadership \"had enough of stagnation and could be prepared to let the private sector have a much freer hand\".",
      "Aside from Mr Ma and Mr Liang, the list of guests also included key figures from companies such as telecommunications and smartphone firm Huawei, electric-vehicle (EV) giant BYD, and many others from across the tech and industrial sectors.",
      "\"The [guest] list showcased the importance of internet/tech/AI/EV sectors given their representation of innovation and achievement,\" said a note from market analysts at Citi.",
      "\"[It] likely indicates the importance of technology... and the contribution of private enterprises to the development and growth of China's economy.\"",
      "Those present at the meeting seemed to share that sentiment. Lei Jun, the chief executive of consumer electronics giant Xiaomi, told state media that he senses the president's \"care and support\" for businesses.",
      "Is it because of US sanctions?",
      "The symposium took place after the country experienced what some observers have described as a \"Sputnik moment\": the arrival of DeepSeek's disruptive R1 artificial intelligence (AI) model at the end of last month.",
      "Soon after its release, the Chinese-made AI chatbot rose through the ranks to become one of the most downloaded in the world. It also triggered a sudden sell-off of major US tech stocks, as fears mounted over America's leadership in the sector.",
      "Back in China, the app's global success has sparked a wave of national pride that has quickly spread to financial markets. Investment has been pouring into Chinese stocks - particularly those of tech companies - listed in Hong Kong and mainland China.",
      "Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs has also upgraded its outlook for Chinese stocks, saying rapid AI adoption could boost companies' revenues and attract as much as $200bn of investment.",
      "But the biggest significance of this innovation was that it came as a result of DeepSeek having to innovate due to a ban on the export of advanced chips and technology to China.",
      "Now, with Trump back in the White House and his fondness of trade tariffs, Mr Xi may have found it necessary to recalibrate his approach to China's entrepreneurs.",
      "Instead of a return to an era of unregulated growth, some analysts believe Monday's meeting signalled an attempt to steer investors and businesses toward Mr Xi's national priorities.",
      "The Chinese president has been increasingly emphasising policies that the government has referred to as \"high-quality development\" and \"new productive forces\".",
      "Such ideas have been used to reflect a switch from what were previously fast drivers of growth, such as property and infrastructure investment, towards high-end industries such as semiconductors, clean energy and AI.",
      "The goal is to achieve \"socialist modernisation\" by 2035 - higher living standards for everyone, and an economy driven by advanced manufacturing and less reliant on imports of foreign technology.",
      "Mr Xi knows that to get there he will need the private sector fully on board.",
      "\"Rather than marking the end of tech sector scrutiny, [Jack Ma's] reappearance suggests that Beijing is pivoting from crackdowns to controlled engagement,\" an associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney, Marina Zhang told the BBC.",
      "\"While the private sector remains a critical pillar of China's economic ambitions, it must align with national priorities - including self-reliance in key technologies and strategic industries.\""

      "The watching crowd was smaller than usual, perhaps because of the heavy rain.",

    "summary": "Long-serving masterminds Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson give creative control to Amazon.",
    "story": [
      "The closing credits of 2021's No Time To Die, the most recent film in the 007 series, ended with a familiar message: \"James Bond will return.\"",
      "But for the last few years, fans haven't been so sure.",
      "A year after the release of Daniel Craig's final film in the franchise, Amazon bought the series' parent company MGM. Since then, very little has happened.",
      "That finally changed on Thursday, when Amazon announced a new joint venture that will see long-term Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson step back, and Jeff Bezos's company take full creative control.",
      "In the intervening years, it's been widely reported that there was tension between Amazon, who understandably wanted a return on their investment, and Wilson and Broccoli, whose top priority remained protecting the Bond brand.",
      "The news of the deal has been met with mixed reaction from 007 fans.",
      "\"I'm in two minds,\" says David Zaritsky, creator of The Bond Experience fan channel on YouTube and Instagram.",
      "\"The nostalgic part of my mind feels a little bit of sadness. Broccoli and Wilson have been the custodians for all these years, so it feels like a bit of royal blood in lineage has been severed.",
      "\"That being said, nobody likes inactivity. And there's been a lot of inactivity around the James Bond franchise for many years, and I know that Amazon as a company will not have patience for inactivity.",
      "\"So I'm very hopeful, and dare I say even a little bit excited, that they're going to do something with the franchise that will be interesting nonetheless.\"",
      "Other franchises which have drastically expanded perhaps offer some clues about what we can expect from the forthcoming Amazon era of Bond.",
      "Lancelot Narayan, a James Bond historian, journalist and filmmaker, told BBC Radio 5 Live a good comparison is George Lucas selling Lucasfilm to Disney in 2012, giving the company control of the Star Wars brand.",
      "\"They went off and made that sequel trilogy, and whether you like it or not, it got made rather quickly,\" he notes. \"There wasn't a three-year wait between films.\"",
      "However, despite the explosion in productivity, there is a feeling that both Marvel and Star Wars have overstretched themselves with their spin-off products.",
      "Narayan says he believes Star Wars has become \"creatively redundant\" since the explosion in productivity.",
      "\"The Star Wars TV series have been very hit and miss \u2013 Andor is fantastic, The Mandalorian is OK, I haven't seen Skeleton Crew... but there are very disparate creative voices going on there,\" he notes. \"So this is the worry, you need the correct creative people to run the show.\"",
      "Similarly, the Marvel Cinematic Universe built on the films by launching a string of Disney+ TV shows.",
      "The subsequent decline in Marvel's popularity arguably owes much to fan fatigue, something which won't have been helped by the huge number of story strands they had to keep up with.",
      "Both cases, Marvel and Star Wars, highlight the risks of brand expansion, which can cause long-term damage for short-term financial gain.",
      "Fans will be hoping any Bond extensions will be better than 2023's dubious game show 007: Road to a Million, hosted by Succession's Brian Cox, which was poorly received.",
      "The James Bond franchise, and particularly the subject of which actor will take over from Craig, is of such fascination to the public that it's the focus of a new show currently playing in Cirencester, called A Role To Die For.",
      "\"There are a lot of people who have grown up with it, for whom James Bond has been part of their culture their entire lives,\" says the appropriately named Derek Bond, who directs the show.",
      "\"As time has gone on, being able to reinvent that character and have him perhaps change with the times, has been the secret to his longevity.",
      "\"But I wonder if we're now in a situation where the times have changed so much, that James Bond now feels as if he belongs in a different era, and it needs something really radical to keep him relevant today.\"",
      "Character origin stories",
      "One area the company will almost certainly be looking at now they're in creative control is the potential for character origin stories, in a similar vein to other famous and beloved film characters who have received their own spin-off films.",
      "Cruella, an extension of the 101 Dalmatians villain, and Wonka, of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, have both been hugely successful film spin-offs in their own right in the last five years, with Emma Stone and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet respectively bringing the characters and worlds to a whole new audience.",
      "It's not hard to imagine the popularity of a similar film or show based on famous Bond villains such as Jaws, Oddjob, Blofeld, Goldfinger or May Day - all big brands in their own right.",
      "\"I mean, why has nobody made Moneypenny?!\" laughs Derek Bond. \"There's a great series to made about her and her journey.",
      "\"Also M, I'd love to know how Judi Dench's M ended up in that role. And the villains especially, it's a very rich universe, and it's easy to imagine the Marvelisation of it, where you have a kind of spin-off for every character that James Bond ever passed in a corridor.\"",
      "But Zaritsky notes: \"I think Amazon will stop short of doing it ad nauseum, to the point where they're having spin-offs about the MI6 janitor that sleeps in the corner. If they do have spin-offs, I think it's going to be prime characters.\"",
      "Not everyone is a fan of the idea. \"This is quite possibly the WORST thing to happen to this franchise,\" tweeted Griffin Schiller of Film Speak after Amazon's announcement.",
      "\"James Bond was more than your average franchise. It had class, prestige, they were indie films made as blockbusters... now? It'll be milked dry. It's truly the end.\"",
      "Broccoli has been seen as a steward of the brand throughout her tenure; a safe pair of hands who protected the traditions of the original character.",
      "That may not necessarily have been compatible with Amazon, who were presumably looking to buy a brand rather than only a film franchise, in an effort to maximise profit.",
      "\"It does tend to be a slightly older generation that it skews to, and there's a whole generation of people who have not experienced a James Bond film, and now, I wonder if they will,\" Bond says.",
      "In her own tenure, Broccoli has made efforts to keep attracting young audiences in other ways, however, such as selecting popular young artists such as Billie Eilish to sing the theme songs.",
      "A repositioning of of the brand could see Amazon try to take the franchise in a direction that appeals more to a younger audience as well as an American market, which is culturally slightly cooler on the Bond brand than the UK.",
      "\"I think it's quite bad news for the franchise, and British film as a whole,\" movie journalist Hannah Strong told Radio 4's PM following Amazon's announcement.",
      "\"It's the premier British film property, and I think the control reverting to an American company, not least one that hasn't shown that much commitment to great cinema, is probably quite a worrying sign.\"",
      "That said, Amazon will be aware that Bond makes a huge amount of money as it currently is - and that altering the core product itself in a way that appeals more to an American audience would be a huge risk.",
      "Strong added: \"When Amazon bought MGM, Barbara Broccoli was quite outspoken about the fact she was finding it difficult to come to a middle ground with Amazon. I suspect the middle ground involves an awful lot of money.\"",
      "The biggest decision remains who will replace Craig in the leading role.",
      "Broccoli previously said James Bond could be any race, but that he would remain male. That guarantee may no longer stand now she is has handed over the reins, although her approach was widely regarded as sensible and Amazon are unlikely to rock the boat too much.",
      "How long could it be until we see the first new Bond product? Zaritsky suggests Amazon won't wait around, although the first thing to launch may not be a film.",
      "\"It could be with merchandise, or in the form of fan outreach,\" he says. \"Whatever it is, I think we might see something extremely fast.\"",

    "story": [
      "On a sprawling farm in Connecticut, Bill Berloni has spent nearly five decades turning rescue dogs into stars of stage and screen. The Tony Award-winning animal trainer has worked with between 200-300 dogs since 1976, all of them rescued from shelters.",
      "\"Someone told me they had cheap dogs at the animal shelter and I went looking one day,\" Berloni recalls of his first theatrical dog training experience. \"I found this little dog who was gonna be put to sleep the next day, adopted him and that was the original production of \"Annie\" and that was the original Sandy.\"",
      "That chance beginning launched a remarkable career. Berloni became the first trainer to feature a dog in a major role on Broadway, and remains the only animal trainer to receive a Tony Award for Excellence in Theater.",
      "His current roster of performers includes Bowdie, who starred as Nana in \"Peter Pan Live,\" and Myrtle, who plays Charlotte York's dog in \"And Just Like That ...\" One of his newest stars, Tana June, was rescued just four months before landing a role alongside six-time Tony winner Audra McDonald in Broadway's \"Gypsy.\"",
      "\"These are the original method actors because you're on stage and they're in the moment,\" Berloni said.",
      "The trainer and his team prepare the dogs extensively for live theater's unpredictable environment.",
      "\"We prepare them by taking them to shows ahead of time. We desensitize them to the things they're gonna be in touch with,\" he explains.",
      "For Berloni, working exclusively with rescue animals is a moral imperative.",
      "\"My answer is why not? And as a result, two to 300 animals have lived wonderful lives who might not have been alive,\" he says.",
      "When their performing days are over, all of Berloni's dogs retire to his farm.",
      "\"The thought of adopting a dog, exploiting it for money and then getting rid of it just didn't make any sense to me,\" he explains.",

    "summary": "Amazon MGM Studios and longtime Bond custodians Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli formed a new joint venture in which they will co-own James Bond intellectual property rights.",
    "story": [
      "In a James Bond shakeup that stirred the film industry,\u00a0Amazon MGM\u00a0announced Thursday that the studio has taken the creative reins of the 007 franchise after decades of family control. Longtime Bond custodians Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli said they would be stepping back.",
      "Amazon MGM Studios, Wilson and Broccoli formed a new joint venture in which they will co-own James Bond intellectual property rights \u2014 but Amazon MGM will have creative control.",
      "Financial terms weren't disclosed. The deal is expected to close sometime this year.",
      "\"With my 007 career spanning nearly 60 incredible years, I am stepping back from producing the James Bond films to focus on art and charitable projects,\" Wilson said in a statement. \"Therefore, Barbara and I agree, it is time for our trusted partner, Amazon MGM Studios, to lead James Bond into the future.\"",
      "Amazon bought MGM Studios in 2022 for $6.1 billion, a purchase that was significantly motivated by the acquisition of one of the movies' most beloved and long-running franchises. Since the Daniel Craig era of 007\u00a0concluded with 2021's \"No Time to Die,\"\u00a0Broccoli and Wilson have reportedly clashed with Amazon MGM over the direction of Bond.",
      "The announcement Thursday means that for the first time in more than half a century of Bond, a Broccoli won't be greenlighting the next 007 film, or picking who inherits his tux. Amazon MGM also anticipates expanding the franchise beyond movies.",
      "\"We are grateful to the late Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman for bringing James Bond to movie theaters around the world, and to Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli for their unyielding dedication and their role in continuing the legacy of the franchise that is cherished by legions of fans worldwide,\" said Mike Hopkins, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios. \"We are honored to continue this treasured heritage, and look forward to ushering in the next phase of the legendary 007 for audiences around the world.\"",
      "Bond had been a family business since Albert \"Cubby\" Broccoli secured the rights to adaptations of Ian Fleming's novels and kicked off a run of 25 Bond films produced by Eon Productions, beginning with 1962's \"Dr. No.\" Those movies have accrued $7.6 billion in the box office.",
      "In 1995, the elder Broccoli handed over control of Eon to his daughter, Broccoli, and stepson, Wilson. In recent years, the 64-year-old Broccoli has largely taken the lead as Wilson, 83, has aged into retirement.",
      "\"My life has been dedicated to maintaining and building upon the extraordinary legacy that was handed to Michael and me by our father, producer Cubby Broccoli,\" Broccoli said in a statement. \"I have had the honor of working closely with four of the tremendously talented actors who have played 007 and thousands of wonderful artists within the industry. With the conclusion of 'No Time to Die' and Michael retiring from the films, I feel it is time to focus on my other projects.\"",
      "Broccoli and Wilson's previous standoff with Amazon MGM had essentially frozen development on the next Bond movie. No script, director or star has yet been announced for the next installment, an unusually long break for a franchise that has typically spaced films two or three years apart. Broccoli also produced the\u00a02022 film \"Till\"\u00a0and the musical \"Buena Vista Social Club,\" opening next month on Broadway.",
      "A key point for the producers in the Amazon acquisition of MGM was a commitment to theatrically release James Bond films. That Bond's future is now in the hands of an e-commerce giant with one of the leading streaming services will immediately prompt doubts from some fans about Bond's new corporate overloads. Other billion-dollar movie franchises, such as the Disney-owned \"Star Wars\" and Marvel brands, have struggled with over-saturation in recent years.",
      "Even Joe Russo, co-director of four Marvel Cinematic Universe films including \"Avengers: Endgame,\" pleaded to Amazon MGM: \"DON'T cinematic universe James Bond.\"",
      "\"It is one of our last, great theatrical events,\" Russo said on X. \"Don't dilute that with a plethora of streaming spin-offs.\"",
      "In an interview last fall ahead of receiving an honorary Oscar alongside her brother, Broccoli told The Associated Press that, in an era of upheaval in the movie industry, boldness was necessary.",
      "\"People are playing it very safe,\" Broccoli said. \"I think in times of crisis like this, you've got to be brave.\"",

      "Blake Lively was not alone in her feelings about Justin Baldoni's alleged conduct while making the film \"It Ends with Us,\"\u00a0according to the amended complaint filed Tuesday in New York. The actor alleged that her costar and the film's director made other women uncomfortable on set and their concerns were documented, the complaint said.",
      "The amended complaint from Lively's legal team included new allegations against Baldoni and his business partner, Wayfarer Studios CEO Jamey Health. It described an alleged incident in 2023 \u2014 after Lively said she reported experiencing \"unwelcome and uncomfortable behavior\" to various leads on the movie \u2014 where another woman in the cast \"reported her own concerns regarding Mr. Baldoni's unwelcome behavior\" and the ways in which she saw it hurting the film.",
      "Baldoni apparently responded to the cast member, whose name doesn't appear in the lawsuit, soon afterward, according to the document. He apparently acknowledged in writing his awareness of the cast member's concerns and indicated things would change, but according to the amended lawsuit they didn't. The complaint referenced another woman in the cast who later told Lively she felt uncomfortable on set, too.",
      "\"Ms. Lively was not alone in raising allegations of on-set misconduct more than a year before the Film was edited,\" said Lively's attorneys, Esra Hudson and Mike Gottlieb, in a statement. The attorneys said their amended complaint contains evidence to support that accusation \"as well as evidence detailing the threats, harassment, and intimidation of not just Ms. Lively, but numerous innocent bystanders that have followed defendants' retaliatory campaign.\"",
      "Lively and Baldoni have been embroiled in a widely publicized legal battle\u00a0since December, when the New York Times published her sexual harassment allegations against Baldoni. She also alleged that Baldoni retaliated after she spoke up about what happened on set. Baldoni has since sued the newspaper and Lively for defamation, seeking $400 million from her and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, alleging extortion, defamation and invasion of privacy.",
      "Lively's accusations against Baldoni have partly centered on his alleged use of retaliation tactics to discourage the actor from speaking up by turning public opinion against her. The amended complaint suggested the retaliatory efforts have devolved into \"dangerously extreme\" acts of cyberbullying, harassment and intimidation, allegedly directed not only toward just Lively, but also toward her family, others in the cast of \"It Ends with Us\" and some witnesses.",
      "\"The culture of fear, intimidation, harassment and threats is the predictable result of an incessant digital campaign to turn social media sentiment as dark and negative as is humanly possible,\" a spokesperson for Lively said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Jed Wallace, the owner of crisis public relations firm Street Relations, was also introduced as a defendant in Lively's lawsuit in the amended version. Wallace, who was named in an initial civil rights complaint Lively filed in California prior to suing Baldoni, has been accused of helping orchestrate an alleged smear campaign to damage Lively's reputation and disincentivize her from speaking out. He has denied Lively's allegations and recently filed a defamation suit of his own against her.",
      "Baldoni's attorney, Bryan Freedman, characterized the amended complaint from Lively as \"unsubstantial hearsay of unnamed persons.\"",
      "\"Since documents do not lie and people do, the upcoming depositions of those who initially supported Ms. Lively's false claims and those who are witnesses to her own behavior will be enlightening. What is truly uncomfortable here is Ms. Lively's lack of actual evidence,\" Freedman told CBS News in a statement.",

      "Prosecutors alleged Rocky pointed a semiautomatic firearm at Ephron before opening fire during another later confrontation on the evening of Nov. 6, 2021. During the first few days of the trial, Ephron testified that Rocky said, \"I'll kill you right now,\" as he pointed the gun at him, saying it was pointed \"like towards my stomach, like towards like my head and shoulder.\"",
      "While he said he couldn't remember certain details, he told jurors Rocky had moved the gun as he pointed it, saying \"He was looking for a spot to shoot me.\" The prosecution had claimed Rocky then opened fire twice in Ephron's direction later that night, during another alleged confrontation which Ephron described during his testimony.",
      "\"So I see Rocky turn around, and when he turned around, he's like,\" Ephron said as he mimicked the gesture he says Rocky made with the gun, raising his arm into the air while pointing his fingers downward. \"Kinda looked like a movie. The whole thing looked like a movie.\"",
      "The former friends were near the intersection of Argyle and Selma avenues, an area of Hollywood just around the corner from the Walk of Fame, when prosecutors say Rocky opened fire.",
      "Ephron testified he was left with bullet-graze wounds just above his knuckles which he later sought medical treatment for.",
      "\"When he shot the first shot, I felt my hand hot,\" he told jurors from the witness stand last month, saying he grabbed another person there that night and \"used him as a shield\" to try dodging the gunfire. \"I'm just trying to like not get hit at this point,\" Ephron said.",
      "He testified he went back to the area later that night, after Los Angeles Police Department officers had responded to the scene, and collected shell casings he claims were fired by the gun. \"But I ended up going back and getting the actual bullets myself,\" he said, saying he brought a paper bag to collect them and took photos of them.",
      "\"It wasn't hard for me to find the bullets because I knew exactly where I got shot at,\" he said.",
      "Tacopina, Rocky's defense attorney, told jurors that Ephron fabricated that evidence and committed perjury during his testimony, describing him as a \"pathological liar\" during the trial. Tacopina said several police officers had responded to the scene before Ephron returned, saying they carried out a thorough search and never came across shell casings.",
      "\"What you'll learn is that Relli returned to that scene an hour later,\" Tacopina said of Ephron, referring to him by his former artist name of A$AP Relli. \"And he attempted to fabricate evidence... This is some offensive stuff.\"",
      "One of the defense witnesses testified to seeing Rocky with a starter pistol, which only fired blanks, on three occasions. A$AP Twelvyy, another former member of the A$AP Mob collective and longtime friend of Rocky, said the rapper carried around the fake gun as a means of security. The felony charges Rocky had faced do not apply if there was no real firearm involved.",
      "The defense argued the rapper could also be found not guilty on the basis of self defense. Both the prosecution and defense has agreed that Rocky and two other men who were with him that night walked away after the first of two confrontations in Hollywood on the night of Nov. 6, 2021, and that Relli followed them afterwards. However, prosecutors argued Rocky was the aggressor when he first allegedly pulled out the gun and then allegedly opened fire during the second incident.",
      "While arguing that Ephron attempted to extort Rocky, the defense presented recordings which a witness for the defense, Wally Sajimi, testified he made in 2022. On the recording, a voice resembling Ephron's says he will accept being paid to stop taking part in the case against Rocky. \"Once I walk away, when I get my cash, the case will get way weaker,\" the voice on the recording says.",
      "But prosecutors have said Ephron's testimony in court was consistent with what he told Sajimi during a recorded conversation \u2014 that the Grammy-nominated rapper had opened fire with a real gun.",
      "\"Mr. Ephron wants to be paid because he was the victim of a real crime by a real gun,\" Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Paul Przelomiec told jurors last week. \"In that couple minutes, he tells the exact same details that he told you when he testified in this case.\"",
      "\"That's evidence they created. That's their person trying to trick Mr. Ephron, trying to get Mr. Ephron to say something damaging, say something that's gonna undermine this case,\" Przelomiec said of the recording submitted as evidence by the defense.",
      "During closing arguments, Przelomiec told jurors that witnesses who testified for the defense never told law enforcement that Rocky had a fake gun that night when the investigation first got underway. He said the prop gun was only brought up more than two years after the alleged shooting, when those witnesses spoke with Rocky's defense attorneys.",
      "\"The idea that they would not be running into the police station to tell their story is absurd,\" Przelomiec said of the defense witnesses.",
      "Meanwhile, the defense has honed in on what they allege is a lack of credibility in the prosecution's key witness.",
      "Tacopina told jurors during closing arguments last week that aside from Ephron's testimony, the prosecution's evidence \"consists of video, shell casings and knuckle scrapes,\" saying the videos alone do not prove the defendant's guilt and the shell casings were fabricated evidence.",
      "\"They mean nothing without believing his story,\" Tacopina said.",

      "Sotheby's auction house said Tuesday that \"Crude Oil (Vettriano)\" is being sold by Sotheby's in London on March 4 from the collection of Mark Hoppus, bassist with California skate-punk band Blink-182, who sees Banksy as a kindred spirit.",
      "Hoppus said he was drawn to the subversion, humor and intelligence of Banksy's work and the similarities between \"skateboarding, punk rock and art.\"",
      "\"I feel like street art and punk rock have the same core,\" Hoppus said. \"The left-out and overlooked making their own reality. \u2026 Just go make art. It's the same spirit. And I've loved art and especially street art ever since realizing that.\"",
      "\"Crude Oil (Vettriano)\" is part of a 2005 series of works in which Banksy put a satirical spin on famous paintings \u2014 withering Vincent van Gogh's \"Sunflowers\" and smashing the diner window in Edward Hopper's \"Nighthawks.\" The artist said his aim was to show that \"the real damage done to our environment is not done by graffiti writers and drunken teenagers, but by big business.\"",
      "The work going under the hammer is based on \"The Singing Butler,\" a painting by Scottish artist Jack Vettriano showing a couple in evening dress dancing on a beach as servants proffer sheltering umbrellas. Banksy has added a sinking oil liner and two figures lugging a barrel of toxic waste.",
      "\"We loved this painting since the moment we saw it,\" said Hoppus, who bought the artwork with his wife Skye in 2011. He said the painting \u2013 \"unmistakably Banksy, but different\" \u2013 has hung in the family's homes in London and LA ever since.",

      "The board has also recommended that Meta fold its ban on \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" into the company's Adult Sexual Exploitation regulations, so moderation of such content would be more rigorously enforced.",
      "Asked Monday by CBS News about the board's recommendations, Meta pointed to the guidelines on its transparency website, which show the company is assessing the feasibility of three of four recommendations from the oversight board and is implementing one of its suggestions, though Meta noted in its statement on its site that it is currently ruling out changing the language of its \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" policy to include the phrase \"non consensual.\" Meta also says it is currently unlikely   to move its \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" policy to within its Adult Sexual Exploitation regulations.",

      "YouTube, the online video platform owned by Google, launched its subscription-based arm for television streaming in 2017, partnering with broadcast and cable networks that gave YouTube TV access to their programs.",
      "Whether the company's prior agreement with Paramount, which allowed it to stream a broad range of channels under the network's umbrella, would hold up for another year was uncertain until Saturday, as a dispute over carriage fees halted talks for a contract renewal.",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 11:37:22 -0500",
    "summary": "The actor, who received his fourth Oscar nomination for his portrayal of the legendary folk singer, talks about cultivating authenticity in his performances.",
    "story": [
      "The fires that ravaged Southern California last month turned too many of Malibu's most treasured places to ash. But some, like the legendary Shangri-La Studios, still stand. Over the years, Shangri-La has been used by some of the biggest names in the music business, like Eric Clapton and Adele. But it's also known as the house that Bob Dylan built. Even the old bus out back, legend has it, was used by Dylan on tour.",
      "Dylan even camped out on the lawn. \"I actually think it's in Clapton's biography that there was a period where Dylan had a tent in the rose garden here,\" said actor Edward Norton.",
      "For him, this is hallowed ground \u2013 and in a way, so is his latest movie role. In \"A Complete Unknown,\" Norton is folk music legend Pete Seeger, playing opposite Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as the young Bob Dylan.",
      "Norton says playing a music legend like Seeger was both sublime, and terrifying. \"I think every actor, some part of 'em wants to be a rock star, you know?\" he said. \"I think every actor holds the dream in some sense. I mean, I almost started crying at the idea of it, because, well, I was nervous about it. I was nervous about the whole enterprise. Because I thought the idea of a biopic about Dylan \u2013 if you just said it that way, I was, like, Oooh, like, I'm not sure. 'Cause to me, it has a mythical kind of place in me, and I thought, this could be really, really a bad idea.\"",
      "And here's just one of the challenges: Pete Seeger was an accomplished banjo player, so Norton had to become one as well, and the banjo's a tough one to learn.",
      "I said, \"We did an interview with Steve Martin, and he played the banjo for us, and watching him play the banjo, I mean, it's so complex and it's so fast.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I made the joke that I googled, you know, 'Is there an AI that can replace my hands with Steve Martin's?'\" Norton laughed. \"Or, you know, that thing where you put your arms behind your back and Steve Martin puts his hands under my armpits and does the playing for me? Which I'm not saying is not what happened, you know? It might have. Who knows?\"",
      "In the finished film, his playing looks and sounds authentic, because it is:",
      "That authenticity is something that Norton has always worked for, starting with his very first movie role, as a calculating killer in the 1996 thriller \"Primal Fear.\" Norton, who was raised in Maryland, cultivated an Appalachian accent so real that people thought he was actually from Kentucky, and he wound up with his first Oscar nomination. Three years later he was fighting it out with Brad Pitt in \"Fight Club,\" a film that has now become embedded in our culture.",
      "And although it has a huge following now, it was not successful when it was released. \"No, not at all,\" Norton said. \"And it was polarizing. I would say, there were those who absolutely, like, it hit them right in the center of their sense of their own selves. And then there were people who just absolutely thought it was garbage \u2013 panned it.\"",
      "In fact, it was roundly booed at the Venice Film Festival. But that didn't bother Norton, or his co-star Pitt. \"As the credits rolled, Brad looked at me in the dark crying, and he said, 'That's the best film we'll ever be in.' And I said, 'Me, too, and I think so, too.' And we were hugging each other and crying because we were so happy with, like, boos rising around us, you know what I mean? I think sometimes you just gotta, you know, let your own freak flag fly, and people will figure it out, or not.\"",
      "Norton has let his own freak flag fly in more than 40 films, like a mild-mannered police captain in \"The Grand Budapest Hotel.\" He was an ego-driven Broadway actor in \"Birdman\"; and he nailed the eccentric billionaire part in \"Glass Onion.\"",
      "Watching him on-screen, it's hard to believe Norton was once told he didn't have what it takes to make it as an actor. There was once a casting director who told him, \"Find another profession.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I had one of those, like, someone sits you down and says, 'You should do something else,'\" he said. \"Very, very, very well-known casting director in New York. One of the ones you hoped to get in front of. But look, if you don't run into moments where people lay some fundamental uncertainty around you [about] the path you've chosen, and you can't push through it, then you probably don't belong.\"",
      "There's little doubt he belongs in all of this: Norton has an Oscar nomination for every decade of his career, and he's in the running now for his work in \"A Complete Unknown.\" But he says that, for him, it's not about the awards or the money, but the chance to channel greatness.",
      "He said, \"If channeling their frequency gets people refocused on what it looked like when people were using the talents they had to further ideas and values that were bigger than themselves, then that is what makes it worth doing. Can we get people to re-engage with and be moved by and inspired by the idea of artists as agents of change?\"",
      "And whether Edward Norton is a pure artist, or just a really great actor, it's easy to believe him.",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 10:14:56 -0500",
    "summary": "On October 11, 1975, people tuning into the debut of a late-night comedy show saw something unlike any TV variety extravaganza they'd ever seen. Today, \"Saturday Night Live,\" produced by Lorne Michaels, is now an entrenched part of pop culture.",
    "story": [
      "On Saturday night, October 11, 1975, television viewers tuned in for a comedy variety show that looked nothing like they were used to. \"It's a sketch, a very unusual sketch, kind of in a minor key, [with] John Belushi as a kind of rumpled guy with a grocery sack,\" said writer Susan Morrison. \"He's supposed to be an immigrant trying to learn English.\"",
      "Instructor (Michael O'Donoghue): \"I would like\u2026\"Belushi: \"I would like\u2026\"Instructor: \"\u2026to feed your fingertips\u2026\"Belushi: \"\u2026to feed your fingertips\u2026\"Instructor: \"\u2026to the wolverines.\"Belushi: \"\u2026to the wolverines.\"",
      "When the instructor succumbs to a heart attack and falls to the floor, Belushi mimics him. \"It's about death,\" Morrison laughed. \"And that was something that variety shows did not traffic in in 1975!\"",
      "Morrison is the author of \"Lorne\" (that would be Lorne Michaels, the man behind \"Saturday Night Live\"). For 50 years now, \"Saturday Night Live\" has been putting on a 90-minute mix of live comedy sketches, beloved commercial parodies, and musical acts, each episode headlined by a celebrity host.",
      "So, what did variety shows look like before SNL? \"They took place on a big, wide stage; it was very shiny, very blank,\" said Morrison. \"And the content of these variety shows also was kind of a throwback \u2013 very hammy, almost vaudevillian, kind of Catskill comics doing seltzer-in-the-pants bits.\"",
      "Michaels worked on several of those shows, including \"Laugh-In.\" Morrison said, \"'Laugh-In' was really the first variety show that seemed to care about youth culture and being hip. But politically, that show was relatively toothless. What passed for political humor on 'Laugh-In' was Goldie Hawn doing kind of a dumb blonde bit.\"",
      "Michaels learned a different lesson working on a cornball comedy show hosted by Phyllis Diller.\u00a0 Its premiere episode in 1968 went up against a Barbra Streisand special. \"Streisand was the hottest thing out there,\" said Morrison. \"'Funny Girl' was about to come out. And Lorne thought, 'Oh my God, we're dead. Everybody's gonna watch Streisand.' But as it turned out, the Diller show beat Streisand in the ratings by a mile.",
      "\"And Lorne recognized, I think he said, 'You know, I realized there are two audiences. You know, there's the people I know, and then there's the wider American audience.' And to this day, he's always telling his young writers and performers, 'We have audience in all 50 states. We have to remember this is broadcast. It takes in the whole country.'\"",
      "Keeping all this in mind, Michaels set about creating a show for his own generation. As it happened, NBC's then-president was thinking along the same lines. And while it's fun to knock network executives, one of the revelations in \"Lorne\" is the role that Herb Schlosser played.",
      "\"He was a visionary president of NBC who was looking to fill a hole on Saturday night, when the network had been running Johnny Carson reruns,\" said Morrison. \"And he dictated a memo that pretty much hit all the points of what SNL was to be. He wanted to do a show out of Studio 8H at 30 Rock, which had basically been dormant, you know, since the '50s. He wanted it to be live. He wanted it to be on at 11:30 Saturday night. He wanted it to have rotating hosts.\"",
      "Before Michaels even hired his cast, he hired the writers, among them, Alan Zweibel. \"If you look at those early days of SNL, the logo for the show was 'Saturday Night Live' spray-painted on the outside wall of what was then called the RCA Building,\" he said. \"It was like graffiti. And I thought it spoke volumes. Here these kids came along besmirching whatever the standard was, whatever the establishment was.\"",
      "Zweibel had been working in a deli when he got the gig: \"I gave him a book with my jokes in it. The first joke that I put, saying that the post office is about to issue a stamp commemorating prostitution in the United States. 'It's a 10-cent stamp. But if you want to lick it, it's a quarter.' And they laughed, and it was great. I was now a professional comedy writer.\"",
      "The writers were young, and the cast were unknowns. Morrison said, \"He really wanted the show to feel like it was speaking in the voice of everybody's funny, sarcastic friend, you know, grousing, wisecracking, just the way people are when they're trying to make their friends laugh.\"",
      "And over the past five decades, America has become friends with more than a hundred different cast members and the characters they've created, not to mention all those catchphrases that have seeped into our conversation, like \"Well, isn't that special,\" or \"I gotta have more cowbell.\"",
      "The writers and actors know that the best way to make the audience laugh is to make each other laugh.",
      "Rachel Dratch was on the show from 1999 to 2006. She and longtime writer Paula Pell created Debbie Downer \u2013 that friend we all have who always manages to bring the party down.",
      "Dratch recalled, \"I think it was Paula said, like, 'Let's set it somewhere really happy. So, let's put it at Disney World.' And then it started to flow. And then as we were writing we were making each other laugh a lot, but then we started going, like, wah-wah. Like, just to each other. I think it was Paula who said, like, 'What if we just put the trombone in the scene?'\"",
      "Pell said, \"And then we did it for that first time, and it was where everyone lost their minds laughing on \u2013 they were wiping their eyes with waffles. And I remember being in a dressing room watching it on the thing, and just tears coming down my d\u00e9colletage and laughing so ungodly hard. It was such a lightning-in-a-bottle moment at that show where you're, like, I will never forget this five minutes ever in my life!\"",
      "For material, the staff is encouraged to draw from their own lives. \"I was always, always wanting to be a cheerleader,\" said Pell. \"And every year, every summer, I worked on my back handsprings. I was a little chubby girl. I was very strong. I was nice and loud. I was really good at cheerleading. And every year, I didn't get it.\"",
      "So, Pell collaborated with Cheri Oteri and Will Ferrell on their Spartan cheerleaders sketch:",
      "\"So, the Spartan cheerleaders, that comes from a real place?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, it comes from the place of, like, joyful loser existence,\" said Pell. \"You go, 'Oh, I didn't make it. Let's go cheer anyway. We're gonna get costumes. Let's go cheer for things nobody is gonna kick us out on,' and they still get to be dramatic cheerleaders.\"",
      "Over the run of the show, the tone of SNL has shifted away from gritty and dark, towards colorful and more, well, cheerful. Morrison writes that Lorne Michaels began directing his staff to \"do it in sunshine.\" She explained: \"Do it in sunshine means first of all, everyone should look pretty good, you know? You want the costumes to be flattering, the colors to be bright. You don't want anger. He very often counsels writers to avoid writing anger. People don't put on a television to see people yelling at each other. Fred Armisen told me that Lorne said once, 'There's enough misery in the world. People huddle around the television as if they're huddling around a fire.'\"",
      "Armisen played Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi. \"I try to keep it, you know, even with the dictators I've played, I've even approached them with \u2013 I can't believe I'm saying this \u2013 like, love and kindness. So, for Qaddafi I'm like, 'I'm gonna love this character. Whoever this guy is, I'm gonna love him and just imagine him as an eccentric at his very worst.'\"",
      "Armisen spent 12 seasons on \"Saturday Night Live.\" To hear him tell it, it wasn't nearly enough. \"I loved it. It was just the best existence,\" he said. \"If you're sitting out three sketches in a row and you're like, 'Oh, I'm not in these,' it is awesome to watch your castmates put something together and see that magic happen. It's fantastic.\"",

    "title": "David Macaulay, America's \"Explainer-in-chief\"",
    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 09:26:15 -0500",
    "summary": "The author has spent more than 50 years finding ways to explain things, via his humorous and intricately illustrated books featuring wooly mammoth guides \u2013 his attempt to hook young readers on the wonders right before their eyes.",
    "story": [
      "Confession: I'm just mad about the mammoth, the one that wandered out of the Ice Age into one of author-illustrator David Macaulay's books \u2013 where he found his purpose in life (if that's a mammoth thing) helping Macaulay explain the way things work to kids.",
      "\"I was desperate to find a humorous way of explaining levers,\" said Macaulay, who realized levers have probably been around for a long time. \"So, I put the mammoth on the end of the log, and put the log on the rock to have a fulcrum, and the villagers on this end of the lever. The problem that had to be solved was, what does the mammoth weigh? So, it's as simple as that!\"",
      "Since it came out in 1988, \"The Way Things Work\" has sold more than a million copies around the world. Mammoth (and a whole herd of his friends) have made their way into other Macaulay books as well.",
      "Asked how many mammoths he thinks he's drawn, Macaulay replied, \"It's like 43,272, I believe. That's just a guess.\"",
      "With or without the help of mammoths, but always with a sense of humor, Macaulay has come to be known as \"America's Explainer-in-chief.\" He is a multi-award-winning star in the children's picture book world and a Macarthur \"genius grant\" recipient, having explained all kinds of things in more than two dozen books over the course of his 50+ year career: the human body \u2026 cathedrals \u2026 castles \u2026 toilets \u2026 the pyramids \u2026 ships \u2026 the city of Rome.",
      "\"I miss Rome,\" he said. \"I think about it often, and I think about particular streets and places in Rome.\"",
      "As an architecture student at the Rhode Island School of Design, Macaulay spent a year there. Born in England, he moved to the United States at the age of ten with his family.",
      "An ongoing exhibit at the National Building Museum in Washington, D.C., explores the messiness of creating a book. It is toplined, literally, as chaos: \"Chaos, that's where this process started, and in fact it's where all my books start,\" he said. \"This whole thing [depicts] the inside of my brain, and those clouds floating overhead were an attempt to sort of suggest some of that, you know, the things that go through your mind when you think, This is not going to work.\"",
      "\"Some of these look like procrastination,\" I said.",
      "\"Oh, procrastination is my gift,\" said Macaulay. \"I always find that in the end, if I'm using my imagination, if I'm asking the right questions, then the procrastination is working in my favor. I just have to keep drawing.\"",
      "And drawing \u2026 and drawing. The exhibits features just some of the drawings he produced while he was figuring out who would be the ideal tour guide of Rome with the perfect point of view. \"Why not a pigeon carrying a message from somebody who lives outside the city to someone who lives inside the city? And it took the scenic route, which was ideal.\"",
      "Early one fall morning, Macaulay brought us to the Ledyard Bridge. On one aside, Vermont; over there, New Hampshire, the Connecticut River in-between. He began sketching the bridge: \"The weight of all of this is supported on this arch, and transferred into these piers,\" he said.",
      "He wanted us to realize that, for him, sketching is seeing. Sketching is a language for understanding. \"We look at things, but do we actually see them?\" he said. \"What better way to spend time with a structure like this than with a sketchbook in your hand, looking at specific details? I think that's my goal in a way, is to have people open their eyes to the ordinary, to the everyday, to the things they take for granted.\"",
      "Like the sorts of things, both man-made and natural, that Macaulay sees when he walks his dogs, Maya and Minnow, in Norwich, Vt., where he lives.",
      "His storyboard details the objects that hold his fascination: \"Once she's stopped and I'm holding the leash, I think, 'I wonder how many pieces of wood are in that fence? Wonder how it's fastened together?'\"",
      "Walks with Stella, his beloved previous dog, are the basis for the book he's working on now. What's starting to take shape on his wall is David Macaulay's stealth attempt to hook kids on the wonder right before their eyes.\u00a0 \"I thought maybe I can create a book that will help them connect,\" he said. \"What better way to do that than to maybe use myself as an example?\"",
      "It's the first time his work has ever been this personal and introspective. At 78, this time, the point of view is his own.",
      "But why? And why now? \"My sort of conscience, perhaps a little bit, a little payback here after all these years of being able to do what I want, really, and be successful at it, be rewarded for it,\" he said. \"It's time to maybe pay that off.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 10:11:47 -0500",
    "summary": "Around 100 were fired from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.",
    "story": [
      "More than 10% of the staff working for the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration were fired this month as part of the government-wide cuts to recently hired federal workers ordered by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, task force.",
      "The cuts amounted to around 100 probationary workers, multiple current and former federal health officials told CBS News, and affected multiple teams around the department, ranging from recently hired directors of SAMHSA's regional offices to staff working on projects related to the 988 hotline for people facing mental health crises, which the agency oversees.",
      "At the agency's communications team, whose work is aimed at raising awareness about the 988 hotline, a SAMHSA employee said a quarter of their team had been lost over the last month.",
      "\"People on the federal staff who oversee and are working to raise awareness of 988 nationally are the people who are gone,\" the employee, Stacey Palosky, posted on LinkedIn.",
      "Palosky declined a request for an interview, referring comment to SAMHSA and the Department of Health and Human Services. A spokesperson for the department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Officials predicted the impact of the cuts, like at many other health agencies that administer large swaths of grants and external contracts, would likely not be immediately felt. Instead, they said the cuts would translate to a long-term erosion of SAMHSA's ability to conduct oversight, a slowdown in grant approvals and bogging down updates to guidance.",
      "Much of the work in some parts of the agency is made up of awarding and tracking taxpayer dollars awarded to drug addiction and mental health treatment programs.",
      "That includes funding for the call centers that make up the 988 hotline, run largely by state and local governments around the country, as well as the nonprofit that administers it.",
      "Federal health officials said they also feared the cuts at the agency would herald a return of the plummeting morale under the first Trump administration, which followed a steep reduction in the agency's size.",
      "The workforce at SAMHSA dropped to a low of 376 employees in 2020, according to records tallied by the Partnership for Public Service, down from a high of 553 in 2014.",
      "Over the same time, survey scores of employee satisfaction at SAMHSA dropped to a record low of 27 out of 100, far below the average for federal agencies.",
      "Employee satisfaction scores began to recover in 2020, reaching a record high of 81.5 by 2023, above the average. The size of the SAMHSA workforce also grew to 633 by 2023.",
      "Most federal health agencies have also faced firings in recent weeks, largely handed down by either termination letters this past weekend from HHSor as a result of severed contracts.",
      "Agencies losing contractors and recently-hired workers include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, and the Administration for Children and Families.",
      "Some agencies initially slated for steep cuts later secured exemptions for many health agency workers, including the Indian Health Service.",
      "It is not clear how many total workers were ultimately cut from HHS.",
      "At SAMHSA, officials remaining at the agency said the firings were frustrating, undoing hard-won hires in some cases for needed positions.",
      "One health official warned of a repeat from the \"doom loop\" that plagued the agency during the first Trump administration, where most of the highest performing workers fled SAMHSA for jobs in the private sector, feeding a drop in morale.",
      "Some staff remained because they were committed to public service, the official said. But many others remained because they were stuck in their jobs at SAMHSA, either because of personal circumstances or because they were unable to get hired elsewhere.",
      "\"Last time it took them two or three years to induce the doom loop. This time they have done it in less than a month,\" the official said.",

Now they need to fully uphold their promise and reverse the firings of World Trade Center Health staff to ensure care for 9/11 survivors and first responders continues uninterrupted.\"",
      "\"This staff is understaffed\"",
      "This comes after 20% of the World Trade Center Health Program's staff was terminated last week. Advocates say it impacts first responders along with people who lived and worked in Lower Manhattan on 9/11, and makes it harder for them to get certified for a 9/11-related illness.",
      "\"The World Trade Center Health Program is a lifeline to 137,000-plus people in the program. This staff is understaffed,\" Feal said.",

      "\"A tragedy for all Americans who swore they would never forget\"",
      "Before the grant was restored, news of the cut drew outrage across New York City.",
      "\"The World Trade Center Health Program has been a lifeline to sickened 9/11 responders, who selflessly gave so much. Cuts to its grant funding will limit our ability to prove that new conditions are WTC related, and should be added to the list of covered conditions. This will hinder our efforts to provide treatment coverage for new conditions, which is a tragedy for all Americans who swore they would never forget,\" FDNY Commissioner Robert Tucker said.",
      "John Feal, who worked at Ground Zero days after the attack, advocates for 9/11 victims, survivors and their families.",
      "\"The research is vital to the 9/11 community because it's the research that allows us to add illnesses to the bill as we move forward. Last year we added uterine cancer for the 69th cancer under the bill,\" said Feal. \"More and more people are getting sick, and more and more people are coming up with new illnesses.\"",
      "Michael Barasche has represented nearly 40,000 first responders and civilians with 9/11 illnesses.",

      "\"The individual had respiratory symptoms. He was previously hospitalized and has since been released,\" a spokesperson for Ohio's health department told CBS News in an email Saturday.",

      "News of the hospitalization comes a day after Wyoming announced the third U.S. hospitalization from bird flu, linked to exposure to an infected backyard flock.",
      "Wyoming's health department declined Saturday to release details of the patient's status, who is hospitalized in neighboring Colorado.",
      "\"We don't typically provide information on patient condition due to privacy concerns,\" spokesperson Kim Deti said in an email to CBS News.",
      "Deti said that the hospitalization in Colorado occurred within the last two weeks, \"just a couple of days\" after they had been exposed to sick poultry at their home in Wyoming's Platte County.",
      "The vast majority of human cases have been blamed on direct, often intensive exposure to sick cows or birds.",
      "Data reported so far by the CDC from testing labs suggests that this winter's record surge of influenza is being driven by seasonal strains of the virus, not human-to-human spread of a bird flu strain.",
      "However, investigations of a handful of human bird flu cases in the U.S. have so far not been able to identify a source of how they may have gotten sick.",
      "The first U.S. bird flu hospitalization was reported last year in Missouri, though health officials think the patient tested positive while hospitalized for other reasons, not bird flu. A second hospitalization was later reported in Louisiana, in a patient who died from the virus.",
      "Which bird flu strain sickened the new cases?",
      "It is unclear which strain of the H5N1 bird flu virus caused the Ohio and Wyoming cases. Answering that question has been a focus of experts and health officials for previous cases, as they track the evolution of the virus.",

      "A spokesperson for Ohio's health department said that information was not immediately available.

    "summary": "Amazon MGM Studios and longtime Bond custodians Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli formed a new joint venture in which they will co-own James Bond intellectual property rights.",
    "story": [
      "In a James Bond shakeup that stirred the film industry,\u00a0Amazon MGM\u00a0announced Thursday that the studio has taken the creative reins of the 007 franchise after decades of family control. Longtime Bond custodians Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli said they would be stepping back.",
      "Amazon MGM Studios, Wilson and Broccoli formed a new joint venture in which they will co-own James Bond intellectual property rights \u2014 but Amazon MGM will have creative control.",
      "Financial terms weren't disclosed. The deal is expected to close sometime this year.",
      "\"With my 007 career spanning nearly 60 incredible years, I am stepping back from producing the James Bond films to focus on art and charitable projects,\" Wilson said in a statement. \"Therefore, Barbara and I agree, it is time for our trusted partner, Amazon MGM Studios, to lead James Bond into the future.\"",
      "Amazon bought MGM Studios in 2022 for $6.1 billion, a purchase that was significantly motivated by the acquisition of one of the movies' most beloved and long-running franchises. Since the Daniel Craig era of 007\u00a0concluded with 2021's \"No Time to Die,\"\u00a0Broccoli and Wilson have reportedly clashed with Amazon MGM over the direction of Bond.",
      "The announcement Thursday means that for the first time in more than half a century of Bond, a Broccoli won't be greenlighting the next 007 film, or picking who inherits his tux. Amazon MGM also anticipates expanding the franchise beyond movies.",
      "\"We are grateful to the late Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman for bringing James Bond to movie theaters around the world, and to Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli for their unyielding dedication and their role in continuing the legacy of the franchise that is cherished by legions of fans worldwide,\" said Mike Hopkins, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios. \"We are honored to continue this treasured heritage, and look forward to ushering in the next phase of the legendary 007 for audiences around the world.\"",
      "Bond had been a family business since Albert \"Cubby\" Broccoli secured the rights to adaptations of Ian Fleming's novels and kicked off a run of 25 Bond films produced by Eon Productions, beginning with 1962's \"Dr. No.\" Those movies have accrued $7.6 billion in the box office.",
      "In 1995, the elder Broccoli handed over control of Eon to his daughter, Broccoli, and stepson, Wilson. In recent years, the 64-year-old Broccoli has largely taken the lead as Wilson, 83, has aged into retirement.",
      "\"My life has been dedicated to maintaining and building upon the extraordinary legacy that was handed to Michael and me by our father, producer Cubby Broccoli,\" Broccoli said in a statement. \"I have had the honor of working closely with four of the tremendously talented actors who have played 007 and thousands of wonderful artists within the industry. With the conclusion of 'No Time to Die' and Michael retiring from the films, I feel it is time to focus on my other projects.\"",
      "Broccoli and Wilson's previous standoff with Amazon MGM had essentially frozen development on the next Bond movie. No script, director or star has yet been announced for the next installment, an unusually long break for a franchise that has typically spaced films two or three years apart. Broccoli also produced the\u00a02022 film \"Till\"\u00a0and the musical \"Buena Vista Social Club,\" opening next month on Broadway.",
      "A key point for the producers in the Amazon acquisition of MGM was a commitment to theatrically release James Bond films.

    "title": "Walmart stock tumbles on a lower-than-expected sales forecast",
    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 08:34:21 -0500",
    "summary": "Walmart delivered another year of strong sales and profits, but executives expressed caution about an uncertain economic landscape.",
    "story": [
      "Walmart shares tumbled on Thursday after the retailing giant provided a 2025 sales and profit forecast that was lower than analysts had expected, with executives warning about new challenges in an uncertain economic landscape.",
      "Walmart slipped $6.93, or 6.7%, to $97.07 in early afternoon trading on Thursday. The outlook from the nation's largest retailer for 2025 is as much as 27 cents below analyst projections for per-share earnings and for the quarter, Walmart's expectations are as much as 7 cents below Wall Street projections.",
      "Its sales outlook is also disappointing, potentially a reflection of rising challenges ahead as consumers pull back on spending and President Donald Trump's tariffs on China and other countries threaten the low-price model that is the core of Walmart's success.",
      "\"[W]e have to acknowledge that we are in an uncertain time, and we don't want to get out over our skis here,\" said Walmart chief financial officer John David Rainey on a conference call with investors on Feb. 20.",
      "Walmart executives said the company has built in hedges against some tariff threats. Groceries account for roughly 60%, of its U.S. business, according to the company's most recent annual report, meaning a huge chunk of sales are not reliant on goods made in China or elsewhere.",
      "Walmart expects first quarter earnings per share of between 57 cents and 58 cents, well below the 64 cents Wall Street was expecting, and for the year. Walmart expects earnings per share in the range of $2.50 to $2.60. That's also off the $2.77 that analysts are predicting, according to FactSet.",
      "It forecast a 3% to 4% increase in quarterly sales or between $166.35 billion and $167.97 billion. That could be a letdown for industry analysts, who had expected sales of $167.05 billion, according to FactSet.",
      "Walmart expects sales to be up anywhere between 3% to 4% for the current year, or between $667.57 billion and $674.05 billion. That too falls short of the $708.72 billion that analysts predicted, according to FactSet.",
      "Inflation-weary consumers",
      "Walmart is among the first major U.S. retailers to report quarterly financial results and numbers could provide a hint as to the mood of the American shopper, particularly amid new trade barriers that according to most economists threaten to reignite inflation.",
      "Consumers over the past year have increasingly focused more on necessities rather than TVs, furniture or appliances. They've become much more discerning about big-ticket purchases because of higher costs for credit as well as for groceries.",
      "Walmart has flourished in that environment, using its clout to keep prices down. It's gained market share, notably among households with incomes over $100,000. Walmart's online offerings and paid membership, Walmart +, have also drawn wealthier customers",
      "\"We have momentum driven by our low prices, a growing assortment, and an eCommerce business driven by faster delivery times,\" said CEO Doug McMillon. \"We're gaining market share, our top line is healthy, and we're in great shape with inventory.\"",
      "Tariff risks",
      "Still, Walmart could be faced with challenges with the new tariffs carrying more economic risks than during Trump's first term. If Americans are hit by a new wave of price increases, economists say, and with 70% of the U.S. economy driven by consumers a broad pullback in spending would have ramifications beyond Walmart's sales.",
      "Government data last week revealed a sharp drop in January retail sales as cold weather kept more Americans indoors. But it was a much bigger drop than economists expected and the biggest in a year. Sales were revised higher for December, possibly indicating a pullback by consumers after a holiday season splurge.",
      "\"[T]here are a lot of potential headwinds from sticky inflation, high debt levels, and a suppressed housing market. The uncertainty of tariffs and their impact on prices adds another changeable dimension,\" noted Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, in a Feb. 14 research note about the retail data.",
      "Yet grocery prices, a sore point for American households, continued to rise.",
      "Walmart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, reported earnings of $5.25 billion, or 65 cents per share, in the quarter ended Jan. 31. That compares with $5.49 billion, or 68 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings per share for the most recent quarter was 66 cents.",
      "Sales rose 4.1% to $180.55 billion in the quarter.",
      "Analysts expected 65 cents per share on sales of $180.07 billion in the fourth quarter, according to FactSet.",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 05:00:01 -0500",
    "summary": "The FDA is already limited in policing claims of health benefits by makers of supplements and herbal remedies \u2014 a $70 billion industry. Get ready for even less regulation.",
    "story": [
      "Last fall, before being named the senior U.S. health official, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the Trump administration would liberate Americans from the FDA's \"aggressive suppression\" of vitamins, dietary supplements, and other substances \u2014 ending the federal agency's \"war on public health,\" as he put it.",
      "In fact, the FDA can't even require that supplements be effective before they are sold. When Congress, at the agency's urging, last considered legislation to require makers of vitamins, herbal remedies, and other pills and potions to show proof of their safety and worth before marketing the products, it got more negative mail, phone calls, and telegrams than at any time since the Vietnam War, by some accounts. The backlash resulted in a 1994 law that enabled the dietary supplement industry to put its products on the market without testing and to tout unproven benefits, as long as the touting doesn't include claims to treat or cure a disease. Annual industry revenues have grown from $4 billion to $70 billion since.",
      "With Kennedy now in the driver's seat, the industry will likely expect more: It aims to make bolder health claims for its products and even get the government, private insurers, and flexible spending accounts to pay for supplements, essentially putting them on an equal footing with FDA-approved pharmaceuticals.",
      "On Feb. 13, the day he swore in Kennedy as secretary of Health and Human Services, President Donald Trump issued a \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda targeting alleged corruption in health regulatory agencies and instructing them to \"ensure the availability of expanded treatment options and the flexibility for health insurance coverage to provide benefits that support beneficial lifestyle changes and disease prevention.\"",
      "Kennedy has said exercise, dietary supplements, and nutrition, rather than pharmaceutical products, are key to good health. Supplement makers want consumers to be able to use programs like health savings accounts, Medicare, and even benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, to pay for such items as vitamins, fish oil, protein powders, and probiotics.",
      "\"Essentially they're seeking a government subsidy,\" said Pieter Cohen, a Harvard University physician who studies supplements.",
      "As the Senate Finance Committee questioned Kennedy during his Jan. 29 confirmation hearing, supporters in the Alliance for Natural Health lunched on quinoa salad in a U.S. Capitol Visitor Center and crowed that the moment had finally arrived for their health freedom movement, which has combined libertarian capitalism and mistrust of the medical establishment to champion unregulated compounds since the 19th century.",
      "\"The greatest opportunity of our lifetimes is before us,\" said Jonathan Emord, the group's general counsel, who has brought many successful lawsuits against the FDA's restrictions on unproven health claims. \"RFK has dedicated his whole life to opposing the undue influence\" of the pharmaceutical industry and \"assuring that our interests triumph,\" Emord said.",
      "In speeches and in a pamphlet called \"The MAHA Mandate,\" Emord and alliance founder Robert Verkerk said Kennedy would free companies to make greater claims for their products' alleged benefits. Emord said his group was preparing to sue the FDA to prevent it from restricting non-pharmaceutical production of substances like biopeptides \u2014 complex molecules related to drugs like Ozempic.",
      "HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon did not respond to a request for comment on the agency's plans vis-\u00e0-vis dietary supplements.",
      "While the basic law governing the FDA establishes that a substance alleged to have treatment or curative effects is by definition a \"drug,\" and therefore comes under the agency's requirements for high standards of scientific evidence, the new administration could reallocate money away from enforcement, said Mitch Zeller, former head of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products.",
      "As a Senate aide early in his career, Zeller investigated a tainted L-tryptophan supplement that killed at least 30 people and sickened thousands in the U.S. in 1989. The scandal led the FDA to seek heavier regulation of supplements, but a powerful backlash resulted in the relatively weak supplements law of 1994.",
      "Even that law's enforcement could be undercut with a stroke of the pen that would keep FDA inspectors out of the field, Zeller said.",
      "Sweeping changes couldn't come too soon for Nathan Jones, founder and CEO of Xlear, a company that makes products containing xylitol, an artificial sweetener. The Federal Trade Commission sued Xlear in 2021 for making what it called false claims that its nasal spray could prevent and treat COVID.",
      "Jones points to a handful of studies evaluating whether xylitol prevents cavities and infections, saying the FDA would require overly expensive studies to get xylitol approved as a drug. Meanwhile, he said, dentists have been bought out by \"Big Toothpaste.\"",
      "One can hardly find any products \"without fluoride for oral health,\" he said. \"Crest and Colgate don't want it to happen,\" he said.",
      "Kennedy's desire to rid water supplies of fluoride because of its alleged impact on children's IQ is welcome news, he said, and not only because it could highlight the value of his products. Jones stresses, as do many health freedom advocates, that clean air and water and unadulterated food do more to prevent and cure disease than vaccines and drugs. For example, he and other advocates claim, wrongly, that the United States eliminated the crippling disease polio through better sanitation, not vaccination.",
      "The Alliance for Natural Health hopes that in lieu of strict FDA standards, Kennedy will enable companies to make expanded marketing claims based on evidence from non-FDA sources, Verkerk said, such as the National Institutes of Health's nutritional information site, which describes the pros and cons of different supplements.",
      "Kennedy has also called for relaxing the strictures on psychedelic drugs, which interest some veterans as potential remedies for such conditions as post-traumatic stress disorder. VETS, a San Diego-based organization, has paid for 1,000 veterans to get treatment with the powerful hallucinogen ibogaine at clinics in Mexico and other countries, said the group's co-founder, Amber Capone.",
      "She got involved after her husband, a retired Navy SEAL, pulled out of a suicidal spiral after spending a week at an ibogaine clinic near Tijuana, Mexico, in 2017. She wants NIH, the Defense Department, and the Department of Veterans Affairs to fund research on the illegal substance \u2014 which can cause cardiac complications and is listed as a Schedule I drug, on par with heroin and LSD \u2014 so it can be made legally available when appropriate.",
      "Coincidentally, the push for less onerous standards on supplements and psychedelics would come while Kennedy is demanding \"gold-standard science\" to review preservatives and other food additives that he has said could play a role in the country's high rate of chronic diseases.",
      "\"Put aside the fact that there's precious little evidence to support\" that idea, said Stuart Pape, a former FDA food center attorney. \"There's been no indication they want the same rigor for supplements and nutraceuticals.\"",
      "Although most of these products don't have major safety concerns, \"we have no idea which products work, so in the best case people are throwing away a ton of money,\" Zeller said. \"The worst-case scenario is they are relying on unproven products to treat underlying conditions, and time is going by when they could have been using more effective FDA-authorized products for diseases.\"",
      "Supplement makers aren't entirely unified. Groups such as the Consumer Healthcare Products Association and the Council for Responsible Nutrition have advocated for the FDA to crack down on products that are unsafe or falsely represented. The Alliance for Natural Health and the Natural Products Association, meanwhile, largely want the government to get out of the way.",
      "\"The time has come to embrace a radical shift \u2014 from reactive disease management to proactive health cultivation, from top-down public health diktats to personalized, individual-centric care,\" Emord and Verkerk state in their \"MAHA Mandate.\"",

      "Over 6,000 Internal Revenue Service employees are expected to be terminated by the end of this week, according to a source familiar with the agency's plans. More than half of these employees \u2014 over 3,500 \u2014 are expected to be from just one division at the IRS, according to text of an email obtained by CBS News and shared by an IRS employee.",
      "The email was sent to managers of the IRS Small Business/Self-Employed Division Wednesday, and it says that the affected SBSE employees will be notified Thursday by the IRS Human Capital Office.",
      "The email, signed by SBSE commissioner Lia Colbert and SBSE deputy commissioner Maha Williams, says that \"while details are still developing, we understand that over 3,500 SB/SE probationary hires will be terminated by the end of this week.\"",
      "According to the email, the probationary workers who are expected to be fired \"were not deemed as critical to filing season.\" The layoffs are expected to take place a couple of weeks before the tax filing season reaches peak activity, in mid-March through mid-April. The New York Times was first to report that 6,000 IRS employees are expected to be cut.",
      "According to an email sent to IRS managers in one division Thursday morning, probationary employees terminated were supposed to\u00a0receive these emails by 12 p.m. ET.\u00a0Managers were not copied on these emails, but CBS News obtained a copy of the termination memo.",
      "The guidance said all separation actions will be final Thursday. Terminated employees are to be paid for a full day Thursday, and the guidance says \"administrative leave will cover the balance of the day after they depart.\" Federal probationary employees who have worked for under a year are not entitled to severance.",
      "Managers were instructed to inform any employees who planned to be on leave on Thursday that their leave was canceled and they were to report to the office with their equipment. If this is \"not practical,\" the email said, managers were to ensure terminated employees read their notice and sent an email to IT to provide information for prepaid labels and boxes to return their equipment.",
      "The email also also included a list of national tax groups to help connect employees with accounting backgrounds and \"tax return preparation experience.\"",
      "The IRS is\u00a0carrying out some of the highest numbers of mass terminations known so far at a department or agency \u2014 and these figures represent only a single department within the IRS. Managers in the IRS Large Business & International Division also received an email that asked them to come into the office Thursday and Friday \"to support offboarding activities.\" It did not specify a number of employees that could be terminated.",
      "CBS News has also reached out to the IRS and White House for comment.",
      "The IRS has tens of thousands of employees \u2014 it used 82,990 full-time equivalent positions to carry out its work in 2023. Under former President Joe Biden, the Inflation Reduction Act boosted IRS funding over the next decade by $80 billion. A fraction of this, $1.4 billion, was rescinded in a bill passed by Congress in 2023.",
      "The anticipated layoffs are taking place after the Trump administration and the Office of Personnel Management issued a directive to cut probationary workers across federal agencies. The federal government's probationary workers are those who are still in a trial period that typically extends for one to two years of employment in their position.",
      "This past weekend, an IRS employee affiliated with the Department of Government Efficiency requested access to an internal data system within the IRS that houses Americans' individual personal tax information. An executive order signed by Trump in early February instructed agency heads to work with DOGE and initiate \"large scale reductions in force.\"",
      "The Wednesday email to SBSE managers goes on to say that later Wednesday, they would receive a list of the employees who are to be terminated. After telling managers to instruct employees to be in the office at the end of the week, the email also asked SBSE managers to be in the office for the rest of the week.",
      "The SBSE division makes sure small business owners comply with their tax obligations, like filing their taxes, and it offers help with debt resolution. It serves more than 57 million small business owners and entrepreneurs with less than $10 million in assets, according to the IRS website.",
      "\"IT will be available to help secure equipment. If IT is not available, managers will secure equipment,\" the email to SBSE managers reads. It adds that there will be a guide and FAQ guide \"to help guide managers through this difficult process.\"",
      "Some LB&I employees were also called and emailed Wednesday to be summoned to the office later this week and were told to bring any government-issued equipment with them, like access cards and paper case files.",
      "\"Under an executive order, IRS has been directed to terminate probationary employees who were not deemed as critical to filing season. We don't have many details that we are permitted to share, but this is all tied to compliance with the executive order,\" according to the text of the email shared with CBS News.",
      "Before cuts of the probationary workers at several agencies began last week, federal employees were offered a \"deferred resignation\" buyout program by the Trump administration. The program offered employees the option to resign and go on administrative leave while retaining their pay and benefits until Sept. 30. Over 75,000 employees opted in before the program's deadline, according to the White House. The program is facing legal challenges, but a federal judge in Massachusetts ruled in early February that the program could continue.

    "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 12:59:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump said his administration is considering dividend checks based on savings found by DOGE. Economists are skeptical.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Wednesday said he's considering using 20% of the savings from Elon Musk's cost-cutting task force, the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to provide direct payments to taxpayers. But economists and policy experts across the political spectrum expressed skepticism about the feasibility of such a \"DOGE dividend.\"",
      "\"We're thinking about giving 20% back to the American citizens and 20% back to pay down debt,\" Mr. Trump said at the FII Priority summit, an investment conference in Miami sponsored by Saudi government entities. Mr. Trump didn't provide further details.",
      "The idea of the so-called DOGE dividend surfaced on social media this week when a four-page proposal was posted by an X user, James Fishback. The post caught the eye of Musk, the owner of X, who is spearheading DOGE, and who on Tuesday said he would pitch the idea to Mr. Trump.",
      "According to Fishback's calculation, 20% of the supposed $2 trillion in eventual DOGE savings would be provided to some taxpayers in the form of a direct tax rebate, which he estimated at $5,000 per household. Only households with a tax liability would receive the payment, which means lower-income households that generally don't owe income taxes wouldn't be included.",
      "But economists and policy experts said the plan isn't likely to materialize, citing the implausibility of finding anywhere near $2 trillion in federal cuts, as well as the legislative hurdles in approving such a direct tax payment.",
      "\"It is completely impossible for DOGE to save $2 trillion,\" Jessica Reidl, an economist and senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Two-thirds of the $7 trillion federal budget goes to Social Security, Medicare, defense, veterans and interest on the debt \u2014 all of which has been taken off the table by President Trump.\"",
      "She added, \"Saving $2 trillion would require eliminating nearly every remaining federal program. DOGE has no legal or constitutional authority to cut this spending; Congress must pass a law and that will not happen.\"",
      "Two-thirds of the nation's $6.7 trillion in annual spending is\u00a0mandatory\u00a0commitments through programs including Social Security and Medicare, while discretionary spending is largely spent on defense. In a Feb. 18 interview on Fox News' \"The Sean Hannity Show,\" Mr. Trump reiterated his earlier vow that Social Security and Medicare cuts are off the table.",
      "\"Social Security won't be touched, other than fraud or something,\" Mr. Trump said during the interview. \"We're going to find it's going to be strengthened, but won't be touched. Medicare, Medicaid, none of that stuff is going to be touched.\"",
      "On Feb. 19, Mr. Trump backed the House Republicans' budget proposal, which, if enacted, would include deep cuts to Medicaid, the nearly $900-billion-a-year government health insurance program that serves about 79 million mostly low-income or disabled Americans.",
      "The White House didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "DOGE cuts",
      "As of Wednesday, DOGE claims it has made cuts that add up to\u00a0about $8.4 billion, according to the task force's own\u00a0documentation.",
      "While DOGE has only been operating since Mr. Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20, its cuts are far from reaching Musk's stated goal of shaving $500 billion in annual government spending, let alone reaching near $2 trillion, experts noted.",
      "The plan \"is very unrealistic,\" Alex Nowrasteh, vice president for economic and social policy studies at the Cato Institute, who describes himself as a libertarian, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I'd love to see it, but I think that is unrealistic, especially in the first year, and certainly unrealistic without Congress getting involved.\"",
      "Any new tax refund check would need the approval of Congress, which controls government spending and is in charge of crafting tax laws. But House Republicans are currently\u00a0negotiating a budget proposal\u00a0that would enact trillions of dollars in spending cuts to pay for an extension of Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts, as well as other tax provisions the president promised on the campaign trail.",
      "A DOGE dividend \"will make their numbers even harder to work in the budget reconciliation,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a Washington, D.C.-based left-leaning economic think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's hard to see how to make the math work.\"",
      "While a plan for some kind of DOGE dividend could materialize, it would doubtless be a much smaller amount than envisioned, given the practical impossibility of finding $2 trillion in federal cuts.",
      "Experts noted that rebate checks are typically issued in times of economic stress, such as during the pandemic, when Congress authorized several rounds of stimulus checks. But the U.S. economy today is viewed as strong, given growing GDP and low unemployment, they added.",
      "At the same time, the federal government's annual outlays are outpacing revenue by about $2 trillion, creating budget deficits and sending the nation's debt to a record $36.2 trillion.",
      "Reidl noted, \"Washington is facing annual budget deficits that will likely surpass $3 trillion within the next few years. Sending taxpayers dividend checks would be completely irresponsible.\"",
      "DOGE facing legal issues",
      "Experts also raised the issue of whether DOGE's cuts could be reversed by the courts, given that the group is facing multiple lawsuits over its access to sensitive data across various agencies as well as over the legality of its creation.",

The researchers analyzed search queries mentioning gambling, addiction, addict, anonymous or hotline, such as gambling addiction hotline, from January 2016 through June 2024.",
      "The increases in Illinois (35%), Massachusetts (47%), Michigan (37%), New Jersey (34%), New York (37%), Ohio (67%), Pennsylvania (50%) and Virginia (30%) were all higher than expected after the opening of sportsbooks in those states, the study found.

      "In Pennsylvania, the introduction of retail sportsbooks led to 33% more searches than expected for gambling addiction-related terms during the five months before online sportsbooks launched, the study found. After online sportsbooks became available, searches spiked to 61% over expectations and persisted for year.",

    "summary": "Elon Musk had claimed that DOGE found evidence of 150-year-olds receiving Social Security benefits.",
    "story": [
      "People who are listed as over 100 years old in the Social Security system are \"not necessarily receiving benefits,\" the new head of the agency said Wednesday, contradicting claims that tens of millions of dead people over that age are receiving checks.",
      "Instead, those individuals \"are people in our records with a Social Security number who do not have a date of death associated with their record,\" said Lee Dudek, the new acting Social Security Administration commissioner who was placed in the role by President Trump, in the Feb. 19\u00a0statement.",
      "The clarification comes after Mr. Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk claimed on social media and in press briefings that people who are 100, 200 and even 300 years old are improperly and routinely getting benefits.",
      "Because Social Security records are not public, it's not possible to independently verify Musk's claim. However, the Social Security Administration automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old, an agency rule that has been in effect since September 2015.",
      "Musk, whose Department of Government Efficiency is seeking to root out fraud, waste and abuse, issued a slew of posts on his social media platform X on Monday night, including: \"Maybe Twilight is real and there are a lot of vampires collecting Social Security.\"",
      "To be sure, there are instances of overpayments and fraud within the Social Security system. A\u00a0July 2024 report\u00a0from Social Security's inspector general stated that from fiscal years 2015 through 2022, the agency paid out almost $8.6 trillion in benefits, including $71.8 billion \u2014 or less than 1% \u2014 in improper payments. Most of the erroneous payments were overpayments to living people.",
      "Social Security and COBOL",
      "Part of the confusion comes from Social Security's software system based on the COBOL programming language, which has a lack of date type. This means that some entries with missing or incomplete birth dates will default to a reference point of more than 150 years ago.",
      "The news organization WIRED first reported on the agency's use of COBOL, a programming language which is more than 60 years old.",
      "Additionally, a series of reports from the Social Security Administration's inspector general in March 2023 and July 2024 state that the agency has not established a new system to properly annotate death information in its database, which included roughly 18.9 million Social Security numbers of people born in 1920 or earlier but were not marked as deceased. This does not mean, however, that these individuals were receiving benefits.",
      "The agency decided not to update the database because of the cost to do so, which would run upward of $9 million.",
      "A July 2023 Social Security OIG report states that \"almost none of the numberholders discussed in the report currently receive SSA payments.\"",
      "DOGE at the Social Security Administration",
      "Dudek, who was named acting chief of the Social Security Administration after the resignation of Michelle King, reiterated the agency's commitment to transparency. The last lines of the statement acknowledged recent reporting about people older than 100 receiving benefits from the agency.",
      "In the statement, Dudek added that the agency's priority continues to be \"paying beneficiaries the right amount at the right time, and providing other critical services people rely on from us.\"",
      "He noted that DOGE personnel \"CANNOT make changes to agency systems, benefit payments, or other information. They only have READ access.\"",
      "\"I am confident that with DOGE's help and the commitment of our executive team and workforce, that Social Security will continue to deliver for the American people,\" Dudek said.",
      "Treasury clawbacks",
      "In early January, the U.S. Treasury clawed back more than $31 million in a variety of federal payments\u2014 not just Social Security payments\u2014 that improperly went to dead people, a recovery that former Treasury official David Lebryk said was \"just the tip of the iceberg.\"",
      "The money was reclaimed as part of a five-month pilot program after Congress gave the Department of Treasury temporary access to the Social Security Administration's \"Full Death Master File\" for three years as part of the omnibus appropriations bill in 2021. The SSA maintains the most complete federal database of individuals who have died, and the file contains more than 142 million records, which go back to 1899, according to the Treasury.",
      "Treasury estimated in January that it would recover more than $215 million during its three-year access period, which runs from December 2023 through 2026.",
      "Chuck Blahous, a senior research strategist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, said, \"Two cheers for Elon Musk if he can root out and put a stop to improper payments.\"",
      "But to pick the places in the federal government where error rates are high, \"Social Security would be near the bottom of the list, not near the top,\" Blahous said. \"Medicaid improper payment rates are quite substantial, and soared after the Medicaid expansion of the ACA.\"",
      "\"By all means \u2014 go after any improper payments that are found, but let's not pretend that's where the system's biggest financial problems are,\" he said.",
      "Sita Nataraj Slavov, a professor of public policy at the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University, said the claims by Musk and Trump will make people think the solutions to the government's financial problems are simpler than they appear.",
      "\"The real concern is that this claim may mislead people into thinking there's an easy fix to Social Security's financial problems \u2014 that we can somehow restore solvency without making sacrifices through higher taxes or lower benefits,\" Slavov said. \"This is simply not true.\"",
      "Karoline Leavitt, the White House spokesperson, referred back to the Social Security's inspector general report.",
      "\"A previous investigation revealed the SSA paid at least $71.8 billion in improper payments,\" she said. \"The Social Security Administration is now working to find even more waste, fraud, and abuse in the Administration's whole-of-government effort to protect American taxpayers.\"",

    "story": [
      "Mackenzie Scott, the philanthropist and ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has pioneered a new kind of giving that has proved transformative for nonprofit organizations.",
      "Since 2019, Scott, who is estimated by Forbes to be worth more than $32 billion, has given away $19 billion in no-strings-attached gifts to more than 2,000 nonprofits, meaning the recipients of the donations were permitted to spend the funds however they saw fit. The median gift size was roughly $5 million. She identified organizations she deemed worthy of support through \"quiet research,\" or a discreet vetting process, and didn't accept solicitations for donations.",
      "That's according to new\u00a0research\u00a0from the Center for Effective Philanthropy (CEP) which found that the uncommon size and lack of restrictions of Scott's charitable gifts have not only helped those nonprofits become more financially stable but has enabled them to increase the scope of their impact.",
      "\"There is much to learn from the experiences of nonprofits who received grants using Scott's approach,\" CEP vice president of research Elisha Smith Arrillaga said in a statement. \"These organizations have managed large gifts in strategic ways that have impacted thousands of lives \u2014 whether doubling or tripling the number of individuals receiving food from food banks, or increasing the number of houses being built in towns across the country, or countless other examples.\"",
      "For the report, which is the culmination of a three-year study, CEP surveyed roughly 800 organizations that received gifts from Scott on how the donations affected their efforts.",
      "Organization leaders surveyed said they managed the grants with an eye toward long-term sustainability, and most \u2014 90% \u2014 said the gifts from Scott strengthened their financial positions, compared with organizations that did not receive such grants. Half of nonprofit heads also said that Scott's gift made fundraising easier, and many said they the gift attracted new contributions. Only a few \u2014 7% \u2014 said they lost funders because of the grant.",
      "Some funders expressed concerns that such large grants would make it hard for their groups to continue fundraising, a fear that never materialized and a notion the study dispels.",
      "Community impact",
      "Grant recipients also said they put part of the money they received toward programming efforts, and that they've observed meaningful change in communities as a result.",
      "\"We received the grant December 2022, during which we served migrants from 29 countries, and were able to expand that to 71 countries in 2023,\" one grantee said in a statement. \"In 2023, our staff provided legal orientation to over 12,000 refugees, helped reunify over 200 unaccompanied children with their family members in the United States, and coordinated life-saving shelter and medical treatment to over 1,600 migrants.\"",
      "One group that received funding from Scott said the grant allowed their charity to grow from serving meals to approximately 2.5 million people a day, to 10 million. The grants also had an effect within community organizations, notably by boosting leaders' confidence in the work they do, according to the report.",
      "\"Receiving this grant has helped to rewrite my own narrative of who is capable of being a leader,\" one nonprofit leader said in the report, adding that the confidence boost led the group to expand its programming, take more risks, raise its profile and feel more secure in asking for larger grants from other funding sources.",
      "\"We need more unrestricted gifts like the one we received to help really make a difference in the work we do! We are extremely grateful to MacKenzie Scott for graciously gifting us this funding, which will go a long way to helping us achieve our programmatic and scale goals,\" another gift recipient said in a statement.",
      "For her part, Scott is quoted in the report as saying that the motive behind not issuing restrictions around how groups could allocate the funds was rooted in her belief that those who are closest to the work are best positioned to identify the organization's needs.",
      "\"I needn't ask those I care about what to say to them, or what to do for them. I can share what I have with them to stand behind them as they speak and act for themselves,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Former GOP Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer, President Trump's nominee to run the Labor Department, appeared before a Senate committee for her confirmation hearing on Wednesday, where she has faced questions about her support for a pro-union bill when she was in Congress and other labor issues.",
      "Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who sits on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, has said he will oppose her because of her previous support for pro-labor policies. Chavez-DeRemer was one of only three Republicans who supported the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or PRO Act, in the last Congress. The bill would have strengthened labor protections for workers to collectively bargain and expanded penalties for employers that violate workers' rights.",
      "Chavez-DeRemer addressed her support for the bill in her opening statement, saying she recognized the legislation was \"imperfect\" and would implement President Trump's labor policies if confirmed as secretary.",
      "\"If confirmed, my job will be to implement President Trump's policy vision. And my guiding principle will be President Trump's guiding principal \u2014 ensuring a level playing field for businesses, unions and, most importantly, the American worker,\" she said.",
      "In January, Paul predicted that Chavez-DeRemer could lose more than a dozen Republican votes. But so far, he's been the only GOP senator to publicly pull his support.",
      "\"I'm the national spokesman and lead author of the right-to-work bill. Her support for the PRO Act, which would not only oppose national right-to-work but would preempt state law on right-to-work \u2014 I think it's not a good thing,\" Paul told NBC News last month. \"And it'd be sort of hard for me, since it's a big issue for me, to support her.\"",
      "Paul questioned Chavez-DeRemer about right-to-work policies during the hearing, asking whether she is still supportive of the PRO Act, which he said would have overturned right-to-work laws in half the country. When Chavez-DeRemer said she \"fully\" supports states that \"want to protect their right to work,\" Paul doubled down, asking if she no longer supports the aspects of the PRO Act that would have overturned state right-to-work laws. She said she did not.",
      "Without Paul, Chavez-DeRemer will need at least one Democrat on the Senate HELP Committee to vote to advance her nomination. Republicans have a 12-11 vote majority on the panel.",
      "Chavez-DeRemer could pick up support from Democrats for her pro-union stances, but many are fuming over the president's ongoing overhaul of the executive branch and firings of federal workers. Democrats expressed appreciation for Chavez-DeRemer's record during the hearing, but none emerged as clear backers of her nomination.",
      "So far, Mr. Trump's Cabinet nominees have been confirmed with minimal GOP defections. Three Republicans voted against Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who was confirmed after Vice President JD Vance cast the tie-breaking vote. Republicans have otherwise united behind Mr. Trump's picks, with the exception of Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who voted against three nominees as of last week.",

    "story": [
      "Billionaire Elon Musk's role in the Trump administration is to find ways to cut costs through the newly created\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. But a new court\u00a0filing\u00a0from the White House states that the Tesla CEO isn't an employee of DOGE, adding that Musk \"has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself.\"",
      "The filing raises questions about Musk's role in the Trump administration and at DOGE, a cost-cutting task force created by Mr. Trump on Jan. 20 that is working at a number of agencies, including the\u00a0Treasury Department\u00a0and the\u00a0IRS, in an effort to find fraud and waste. The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about Musk's role at DOGE.",
      "Musk, along with fellow billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy, was\u00a0originally tasked\u00a0by Mr. Trump with providing \"advice and guidance from outside of Government\" and partnering with the White House and Office of Management & Budget to drive large scale structural reform.\" Ramaswamy\u00a0left DOGE\u00a0in January and is planning a run for Ohio governor.",
      "Since Mr. Trump took office, DOGE has driven massive federal employee cuts and paused tranches of congressionally approved spending. Many of those federal workers, their unions and Democratic officials have argued that this is a result of Musk's unchecked authority. Mr. Trump has suggested that Musk largely answers to him.",
      "Last week, Musk \u2014 the world's richest person, with a net worth of\u00a0$398 billion\u00a0\u2014 stood behind President Trump at the Oval Office, describing DOGE's work as taking \"very simple and basic\" steps to cut federal spending. During a lengthy Q&A that followed, Mr. Trump was asked if there was anything Musk was told that he can't touch.",
      "\"Well, we haven't discussed that much,\" Mr. Trump replied. \"I'll tell him to go here, go there, he does it. He's got a very capable group of people.\"",
      "Asked by reporters if he was working closely with agency heads, Musk replied that he was working \"in partnership\" with them. \"I check with the president to make sure that this is what the president wants to happen,\" Musk added. \"We talk almost every day, and I double check things to make sure. 'Is this something, Mr. President, you want us to do this?' Then we'll do it.\"",
      "Multiple lawsuits, alarm bells",
      "At the same time, DOGE's efforts have sparked multiple lawsuits and\u00a0raised alarms\u00a0from Democratic lawmakers and consumer advocates over its reported access to personal data of millions of Americans and businesses.",
      "The White House's Feb. 17 filing came at the request of U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is hearing a case about the\u00a0constitutionality\u00a0of Musk's actions since the start of Mr. Trump's presidency. Fourteen states ranging from Arizona to Washington are suing Musk, DOGE and Mr. Trump, alleging that Musk is exceeding his authority and taking \"actions that can only be taken by a nominated and principal officer of the United States.\"",
      "The lawsuit claims that Musk \"does not occupy an office created by law and has no authority to exercise the powers of a principal officer, or any other officer.\"",
      "\"There is no greater threat to democracy than the accumulation of state power in the hands of a single, unelected individual,\" the lawsuit alleges. \"In recent weeks, defendant Elon Musk, with President Donald J. Trump's approval, has roamed through the federal government unraveling agencies, accessing sensitive data and causing mass chaos and confusion for state and local governments, federal employees and the American people,\" the lawsuit further claims.",
      "At a Feb. 17 hearing, Justice Department attorney Harry Graver told Chutkan, \"There is not a single instance of Musk or USDS commanding these actions,\" referring to\u00a0widespread firings of government employees\u00a0across various agencies last week. Instead, the government workers were fired by officials within their own agencies, he said.",
      "When asked at a press briefing at Mar-a-lago on Tuesday about the administration's contention that Musk isn't in charge of DOGE, Mr. Trump said, \"Elon is to me a patriot. So, you could call him an employee, you could call him a consultant, you could call him whatever you want.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Judge Chutkan ruled against the states' request for a temporary restraining order to stop Musk and DOGE from accessing data systems at seven federal agencies and firing or putting their employees on leave. She found that the states failed to show that they would suffer imminent, irreparable harm without relief, writing in her ruling that \"the 'possibility' that defendants may take actions that irreparably harm plaintiffs 'is not enough.'\"",
      "Nonetheless, in a hearing Monday, Chutkan warned that the alleged actions by Musk and DOGE are \"concerning\" and \"troubling.\" She said the mass firings of thousands of federal workers is \"not a small or common thing\" and noted that Musk has not been nominated to a position by the president or confirmed by the Senate.",
      "\"No actual or formal authority\"",
      "The Feb. 17 filing states that Musk is working as a \"senior adviser to the president,\" comparing his role to that of Anita Dunn under the Biden administration. Dunn served as a special government employee when she advised former President Biden, the filing noted.",
      "\"Like other senior White House advisers, Mr. Musk has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself,\" the filing said. \"Mr. Musk can only advise the president and communicate the president's directives.\"",
      "Musk's role as a\u00a0special government employee, or SGE, confirmed by the White House earlier this month, indicates that he'll work for the Trump administration for 130 days or less during a one-year period. The SGE role was created in 1962 as a way of enabling the government to tap outside expertise,\u00a0according\u00a0to the publication Government Executive.",
      "Because Musk isn't paid for his work at the White House, his financial disclosure report\u00a0will remain confidential, a White House official has told CBS News on condition of anonymity",
      "Asked at the Oval Office last week whether there are issues with conflicts of interest between his businesses, including Tesla and Space X \u2014 which receive billions in federal contracts \u2014 and DOGE, Musk said that the task force's work is transparent. He added, \"So you can see everything that's going on, and then you can see, am I doing something that benefits one of my companies or not? It's totally obvious.\"",

      "The National Science Foundation \u2014 an independent federal agency that funds scientific research around the globe \u2014 has fired 168 probationary employees in adherence to orders from the White House, according to an agency spokesperson.",
      "The dismissals, effective as of Tuesday, were made to ensure compliance with an executive order issued by President Donald Trump last week, the NSF spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. The NSF had 1,450 employees prior to Tuesday's job cuts, the spokesperson said. The 168 workers who were fired represent about 12% of that number.",
      "Federal workers who are in a probationary period are still in a trial period that typically extends for one to two years of employment. These workers, who haven't yet gained civil service protection, are currently the focus of widespread cuts across multiple agencies as part of President Trump's efforts to shrink the size of the federal government.",
      "\"We thank these employees for their service to the NSF and their contributions to advance the agency mission,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The NSF also employs about 200 people from research institutions on a temporary basis.",
      "The agency was established by Congress in 1950 to promote science and engineering, advance public health and contribute to the nation's defense, according to its website. The NSF provides a quarter of federal support for basic research at the nation's colleges and universities. It had a budget of nearly $9.1 billion in fiscal 2024.",
      "The NSF funds projects including research stations in Antarctica and astronomy observatories.",
      "Mr. Trump's initial attempt to downsize the workforce was the deferred resignation program, which offered to pay people until Sept. 30 if they agreed to quit. The White House said 75,000 people signed up, and a federal judge cleared a legal roadblock last week for the program to move forward.",
      "However, the number of workers who took the deferred resignation offer was less than the administration's target.

Peterson Foundation notes that defense spending represents nearly half of all discretionary spending in the U.S. \u2014 47% in 2024 \u2014 and the U.S. spends more than the next nine countries combined on defense.",
      "\"Where we can find billions of dollars \u2014 and he's right to say billions \u2014 inside the Defense Department, every dollar we save there is a dollar that goes to warfighters, and that's good for the American people,\" Hegseth said, adding that climate programs might be an area to consider for cuts.",

Reuters noted that SpaceX CEO Gwynne Shotwell has estimated that the company had $22 billion in U.S. contracts, $15 billion from NASA. An exact accounting of Musk's defense contracts can't be established, however, because a number of the contracts are classified.",

Joshua Fisher, the White House director of the Office of Administration, in a filing with the court defined Musk's role as special adviser to the president, similar to the role of Anita Dunn in the Biden administration.",
      "In the lawsuit, the state attorneys general are arguing that Mr. Trump \"delegated virtually unchecked authority to Mr. Musk without proper legal authorization from Congress.\"",
      "The Trump administration has presented Musk as the leader of the cost-cutting effort on several occasions. In the Oval Office last week, Mr. Trump asked Musk to detail what \"your team\" has found.",

      "During the X livestream, xAI demoed Grok 3, asking the chatbot to plot a launch from earth to planet Mars, and back to earth at a future launch date. Musk and his engineers also asked it to create a game that is a hybrid between Tetris and Bejeweled, and to \"make it insanely great.\"",

      "Sotheby's auction house said Tuesday that \"Crude Oil (Vettriano)\" is being sold by Sotheby's in London on March 4 from the collection of Mark Hoppus, bassist with California skate-punk band Blink-182, who sees Banksy as a kindred spirit.",
      "Hoppus said he was drawn to the subversion, humor and intelligence of Banksy's work and the similarities between \"skateboarding, punk rock and art.\"",
      "\"I feel like street art and punk rock have the same core,\" Hoppus said. \"The left-out and overlooked making their own reality. \u2026 Just go make art. It's the same spirit. And I've loved art and especially street art ever since realizing that.\"",
      "\"Crude Oil (Vettriano)\" is part of a 2005 series of works in which Banksy put a satirical spin on famous paintings \u2014 withering Vincent van Gogh's \"Sunflowers\" and smashing the diner window in Edward Hopper's \"Nighthawks.\" The artist said his aim was to show that \"the real damage done to our environment is not done by graffiti writers and drunken teenagers, but by big business.\"",
      "The work going under the hammer is based on \"The Singing Butler,\" a painting by Scottish artist Jack Vettriano showing a couple in evening dress dancing on a beach as servants proffer sheltering umbrellas. Banksy has added a sinking oil liner and two figures lugging a barrel of toxic waste.",
      "\"We loved this painting since the moment we saw it,\" said Hoppus, who bought the artwork with his wife Skye in 2011. He said the painting \u2013 \"unmistakably Banksy, but different\" \u2013 has hung in the family's homes in London and LA ever since.",

    "story": [
      "The presence of Elon Musk's cost-cutting task force, the Department of Government Efficiency, at the IRS is sparking fresh concerns from Democratic lawmakers about the safety of taxpayer information, and whether the group's work could cause delays in taxpayers receiving their refunds.",
      "An IRS employee associated with DOGE is requesting access to the IRS' Integrated Data Retrieval System, or IDRS, which would provide the group with access to tax data for individuals and businesses, according to a Trump administration official.",
      "\"Waste, fraud, and abuse have been deeply entrenched in our broken system for far too long,\" said White House spokesman Harrison Fields. \"DOGE will continue to shine a light on the fraud they uncover as the American people deserve to know what their government has been spending their hard-earned tax dollars on.\"",
      "News of the request was first reported by\u00a0the Washington Post. The IRS didn't immediately return a request for comment.",
      "In a Feb. 17 letter to the IRS, Senators Ron Wyden and Elizabeth Warren, both Democrats, cited reports that DOGE is \"pressuring the IRS to agree to a memorandum of understanding (\"the MOU\") which would give software engineers working for Elon Musk at DOGE broad access to IRS systems, property and datasets which include the private tax return information of hundreds of millions of American citizens and businesses.\"",
      "Supporters of DOGE view its efforts as a way to cut what they see as bloated federal spending at a time when the nation's outlays are outstripping its tax revenue, pushing the federal debt to an all-time high of\u00a0$36 trillion. But the group's efforts have also sparked several lawsuits, with consumer advocates and Democratic lawmakers raising alarms earlier this month after DOGE gained access to the Treasury Department's\u00a0payment system, which stores personal data for most Americans.",
      "IRS data is particularly sensitive, given that it reflects financial details for millions of Americans and businesses, ranging from their income, employers, losses, investments, dependents and other items. Under the IRS taxpayers' bill of rights, \"information [taxpayers] provide to the IRS will not be disclosed unless authorized by the taxpayer or by law.\"",
      "\"Software engineers working for Musk seeking to gain access to tax return information have no right to hoover up taxpayer data and send that data back to any other part of the federal government and may be breaking the law if they are doing so,\" Wyden and Warren wrote in the Feb. 17 letter.",
      "The senators pointed to privacy regulations in the tax code that they said provide \"strong legal protections\" for taxpayer data, noting that violation of those laws can result in incarceration or other criminal penalties. They added that even if the DOGE employees are employed at the Treasury Department, which oversees the IRS, they may still be violating the law by accessing taxpayer data.",
      "\"There are serious statutory and regulatory restrictions on when employees outside the Treasury Department may gain access to tax return information,\" the letter said.",
      "It added, \"To date, no information on DOGE employees or any others executing orders on Musk's behalf have revealed any clear, stated purpose as to why they need access to return information, whether they have followed all required laws to gain access to IRS systems, and what steps the IRS has taken to ensure that inspection of tax return is contained to authorized personnel and not disclosed to any unauthorized parties.\"",
      "Protections for taxpayer data were increased in the 1970s after former President Nixon sought to use the IRS against his political opponents, according to New York University's Tax Law blog.",
      "\"Congress acted to put in place ironclad guarantees against such abuses and a bipartisan consensus emerged to ensure the privacy of every American's tax information,\" Robert Weissman, the co-president of consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Musk and DOGE's attempt to gain access to IRS data raises profound questions about whether those protections are now being shredded.\"",
      "In an interview with Fox News, Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff, said DOGE was seeking to find signs of tax fraud.",
      "\"We are talking about performing a basic anti-fraud review to ensure that people are not engaging in large scale theft of federal taxpayer benefits,\" he said. \"I mean, for example, we pay billions of dollars a year in child tax credit payments to illegal aliens, billions with a B. So these are systematic, programmatic reforms that we're talking about here.\"",
      "Delays to IRS tax refunds?",
      "Wyden and Warren also raised concerns about DOGE's impact on tax refunds this year.",
      "DOGE's work at the IRS comes as the tax agency is in the middle of the current tax season, when about 140 million individual tax returns are expected to be filed before the April 15 deadline. For many households, their tax refund check \u2014 which last year averaged more than $3,100 \u2014 is often their biggest cash influx of the year.",
      "\"We are also extremely concerned that DOGE personnel meddling with IRS systems in the middle of tax filing season could, inadvertently or otherwise, cause breakdowns that may delay the issuance of tax refunds indefinitely,\" the Feb. 17 letter said. \"Any delay in refunds could be financially devastating to millions of Americans who plan their budgets around timely refunds every spring.\"",
      "In the meantime, the IRS is preparing to fire thousands of probationary workers in the middle of tax season, the Associated Press reported, citing two sources familiar with the agency's plans. It's unclear how many IRS workers could be impacted, however, the AP noted. Federal workers in a probationary period typically have less than one year on the job and have not yet gained civil service protection.",
      "The cuts would come even as IRS employees were told they would not be able to participate in the Trump administration's earlier \"deferred resignation\" offer until after the tax filing deadline had passed.",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Thursday allowed President Trump's efforts to shrink the federal workforce to continue moving forward while legal proceedings continue, declining a request from a group of labor unions to temporarily block his firing of federal employees and other actions targeting government workers.",
      "U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper, who sits on the federal district court in Washington, D.C., said in a 16-page decision that he had to deny the unions' request for relief because he lacks jurisdiction over the claims. The judge, appointed by former President Barack Obama, said the unions must pursue their legal challenges through the scheme established by Congress in the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, which governs labor relations in the federal workforce.",
      "The claims, he said, must be filed with the Federal Labor Relations Authority.",
      "Still, Cooper wrote that the first month of Mr. Trump's administration \"has been defined by an onslaught of executive actions that have caused, some say by design, disruption and even chaos in widespread quarters of American society.\" He also noted that mixed decisions by federal judges halting some of Mr. Trump's actions and letting others proceed while cases move forward are not a surprise.",
      "\"Federal district judges are duty-bound to decide legal issues based on even-handed application of law and precedent \u2014 no matter the identity of the litigants or, regrettably at times, the consequences of their rulings for average people,\" Cooper wrote.",
      "White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said in a statement that the district court \"properly determined that it did not have jurisdiction to review the termination of probationary employees. Thanks to this and other legal wins, President Trump and his administration will continue to deliver on the American people's mandate to eliminate wasteful spending and make federal agencies more efficient.\"",
      "The head of the National Treasury Employees Union, Doreen Greenwald, called Cooper's decision denying the emergency relief the unions sought a \"temporary setback.\"",
      "\"Already too many federal employees and their families have been devastated by these indiscriminate layoffs, and soon their local economies will feel that pain, too,\" she said in a statement. \"There is no doubt that the administration's actions are an illegal end-run on Congress, which has the sole power to create and oversee federal agencies and their important missions regarding public health and safety, national security, economic growth and stability, and consumer protection.\"",
      "The five unions, which represent federal workers, had asked Cooper to issue an order that temporarily prevented the termination of members who are probationary employees; implementation of large-scale reductions in force throughout the government; and a renewal of the president's \"deferred resignation program.\"",
      "That program offered federal workers the chance to resign their positions but retain full pay and benefits until Sept. 30. The deadline for employees to accept the offer was Feb. 12, and roughly 75,000 federal workers agreed to the program, according to the White House.",
      "The unions argued that the president's three initiatives \u2014 firing of probationary employees, deferred resignation program and planned large-scale reductions in force \u2014 violate the separation of powers and federal law.",
      "In court filings, lawyers for the unions warned that the president's plans to shrink the size of the government threatened more than 500,000 employees. Roughly 220,000 workers are considered probationary, they said, and another 345,000 were deemed nonessential during the last major government shutdown during Mr. Trump's first term. Nonessential workers were targeted for firing in an executive order signed by the president that directs agency heads to prepare for \"large-scale reductions in force.\"",
      "More than 12,000 federal workers have already been or are likely to be fired, including over 6,000 at the Internal Revenue Service who are expected to be terminated by the end of the month, according to a source familiar with the agency's plans.",
      "\"A mass reduction of roughly twenty-five percent of the federal civilian workforce is unprecedented,\" the unions wrote in a filing. \"It raises the novel question of whether the Executive Branch may lawfully hobble the federal agencies that Congress creates, to which Congress assigns statutory missions, and which Congress funds so that they may accomplish those legislative directives.\"",
      "The Justice Department had urged the court to deny the unions' request, arguing in part that they failed to show they would be harmed, absent relief.",
      "\"The president is charged with directing the Executive Branch workforce, and he has determined that the politically accountable heads of his agencies should take steps to streamline and modernize the workforce through measures including voluntary deferred resignations, removal of certain probationary employees, and [reductions in force],\" Justice Department lawyers wrote in a filing.",

      "Publicist Adam Gonshor confirmed to CBS News that Chantal Kreviazuk changed the lyric from \"in all of us command\" to \"that only us command.\"",
      "During Canada's 3-2 overtime victory, Kreviazuk told The Associated Press she did it \"because I believe in democracy, and a sovereign nation should not have to be defending itself against tyranny and fascism.\"",
      "\"I'm somebody who grew up on music that spoke to the heart and the moment, and it shaped me as a songwriter and really as a human being,\" she added. \"I don't think it would be authentic to me to be given a world stage and not express myself and be true to myself.\"",
      "Kreviazuk, who is from Winnipeg, Manitoba, also wrote the phrase \"that only us command\" with mascara on her left hand. She posted a picture of that on her Instagram with emojis of a Canadian flag and a flexed muscle.",
      "A post shared by Chantal (@chantalkrev)",
      "\"I just put it on there so if I ever had a moment and I kind of froze, I would be able to look at my hand and see it,\" Kreviazuk said. \"I'd love to see people sort of get inspired and catch the fire and say their heart more in their art. ... Sometimes you just got to speak the truth in your art and it's awesome. That's what it should be about.\"",
      "In the post, Kreviazuk said, \"I am sorry if my performance of our national anthem rubbed you the wrong way. ... I am sorry if you think that we'd be better off annexed. ... We should express our outrage in the face of any abuses of power. ... Canada, not unlike Ukraine, is a sovereign nation. Period.\"",
      "In a post on X, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said, \"You can't take our country \u2014 and you can't take our game.\"",
      "The National Hockey League declined comment on the situation.",
      "Fans in Boston lightly booed the song, though it was soon drowned out by Kreviazuk's singing. The crowd in Montreal booed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" prior to U.S. tournament games at Bell Centre last week, more vociferously before the team faced Canada.",
      "Tensions have risen between the neighbors and longtime allies over the past several weeks as Mr. Trump has suggested multiple times since being inaugurated that Canada become the 51st U.S. state, in relation to a trade dispute, and has threatened a series of tariffs. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said that will never happen.",
      "The subject of Canada becoming the 51st state was brought up Thursday during a news conference with David McGuinty, Canada's Public Safety Minister.",
      "\"Sounds like President Trump is worried about the outcome of the hockey game,\" McGuinty said. \"Canada is a sovereign and independent country. It has been for over 150 years and will remain so. This discussion of 51st state is a non-starter.\"",
      "Mr. Trump called the U.S. team prior to their morning skate Thursday to wish players luck in the game. Players told reporters in Boston it was an honor to hear from him, with defenseman Noah Hanifin saying, \"Hopefully we can get the win tonight for our country and for Trump.\"",

      "The president made the announcement during a Black History Month event in the White House East Room Thursday afternoon. Johnson spent over 21 years in prison for nonviolent drug-related crimes when Mr. Trump commuted her sentence and she was released in 2018. Mr. Trump later issued her a full pardon.",

And you're going to find people just like you that should not this should not have happened. It should not have happened. So you're going to look and you're going to make recommendations, and I'll follow those recommendations, okay? For pardons. All right?\"",

    "story": [
      "More than 10% of the staff working for the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration were fired this month as part of the government-wide cuts to recently hired federal workers ordered by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, task force.",
      "The cuts amounted to around 100 probationary workers, multiple current and former federal health officials told CBS News, and affected multiple teams around the department, ranging from recently hired directors of SAMHSA's regional offices to staff working on projects related to the 988 hotline for people facing mental health crises, which the agency oversees.",
      "At the agency's communications team, whose work is aimed at raising awareness about the 988 hotline, a SAMHSA employee said a quarter of their team had been lost over the last month.",
      "\"People on the federal staff who oversee and are working to raise awareness of 988 nationally are the people who are gone,\" the employee, Stacey Palosky, posted on LinkedIn.",
      "Palosky declined a request for an interview, referring comment to SAMHSA and the Department of Health and Human Services. A spokesperson for the department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Officials predicted the impact of the cuts, like at many other health agencies that administer large swaths of grants and external contracts, would likely not be immediately felt. Instead, they said the cuts would translate to a long-term erosion of SAMHSA's ability to conduct oversight, a slowdown in grant approvals and bogging down updates to guidance.",
      "Much of the work in some parts of the agency is made up of awarding and tracking taxpayer dollars awarded to drug addiction and mental health treatment programs.",
      "That includes funding for the call centers that make up the 988 hotline, run largely by state and local governments around the country, as well as the nonprofit that administers it.",
      "Federal health officials said they also feared the cuts at the agency would herald a return of the plummeting morale under the first Trump administration, which followed a steep reduction in the agency's size.",
      "The workforce at SAMHSA dropped to a low of 376 employees in 2020, according to records tallied by the Partnership for Public Service, down from a high of 553 in 2014.",
      "Over the same time, survey scores of employee satisfaction at SAMHSA dropped to a record low of 27 out of 100, far below the average for federal agencies.",
      "Employee satisfaction scores began to recover in 2020, reaching a record high of 81.5 by 2023, above the average. The size of the SAMHSA workforce also grew to 633 by 2023.",
      "Most federal health agencies have also faced firings in recent weeks, largely handed down by either termination letters this past weekend from HHSor as a result of severed contracts.",
      "Agencies losing contractors and recently-hired workers include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, and the Administration for Children and Families.",
      "Some agencies initially slated for steep cuts later secured exemptions for many health agency workers, including the Indian Health Service.",
      "It is not clear how many total workers were ultimately cut from HHS.",
      "At SAMHSA, officials remaining at the agency said the firings were frustrating, undoing hard-won hires in some cases for needed positions.",
      "One health official warned of a repeat from the \"doom loop\" that plagued the agency during the first Trump administration, where most of the highest performing workers fled SAMHSA for jobs in the private sector, feeding a drop in morale.",
      "Some staff remained because they were committed to public service, the official said. But many others remained because they were stuck in their jobs at SAMHSA, either because of personal circumstances or because they were unable to get hired elsewhere.",

      "The GOP senators forged ahead with the proposal despite President Trump's decision on Wednesday to\u00a0endorse a competing plan put forward by House Republicans.",
      "The Senate began what's known as a \"vote-a-rama\" on the GOP budget blueprint Thursday at shortly before 7 p.m., in which senators could offer an unlimited number of amendments and force the chamber to cast vote after vote through the night. After the Senate exhausted all amendment votes in the middle of the night, the lawmakers took a final vote on the budget resolution, which directs the committees to submit their proposed spending plans by March 7. The resolution was adopted, 52-48.",
      "The vote-a-rama gave Democrats the opportunity to force their GOP colleagues to go on the record on a host of politically dicey subjects, including Medicaid cuts and tax breaks for the wealthy.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, defended the upper chamber's decision while wishing House Republicans success in moving their resolution forward.",
      "\"I think he's made it clear for a long time that he would prefer one big, beautiful bill, and we're fine with that too,\" Thune said Wednesday, referring to the president. \"If the House can produce one big, beautiful bill, we're prepared to work with them to get that across the finish line, but we believe that the president also likes optionality.\"",
      "The Senate's budget resolution calls for increasing military spending by $150 billion and border security spending by $175 billion, but does not extend tax cuts enacted during Mr. Trump's first term that expire at the end of the year. Senate Republicans want to address tax cuts in a second bill and make them permanent.",
      "The House plan includes $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, raises the debt ceiling by $4 trillion and calls for at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts. To appease conservatives, the House Budget Committee amended the resolution to make tax cuts dependent on spending cuts. If House committees don't achieve at least $2 trillion in spending cuts, then tax cuts would be scaled back. Tax cuts would be increased if more than $2 trillion is slashed in spending.",
      "Mr. Trump's endorsement of the House's one-bill approach was a victory for Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, and took Senate Republicans by surprise. Johnson has been trying to keep pace with the Senate's two-bill plan while navigating the demands of his divided Republican conference and razor-thin majority. House GOP leaders aren't confident they can pass two bills with their narrow majority.",
      "Senate Republicans, who want to move quickly on border and defense spending, deferred to their House counterparts for weeks to take the lead, but put out their own blueprint amid repeated delays in the lower chamber.",
      "The Senate Budget Committee and House Budget Committee both passed separate plans last week. The House is in recess this week.",
      "The chambers will have to eventually have to adopt identical budget resolutions to continue the reconciliation process and enact Mr. Trump's agenda. The process allows Senate Republicans to pass the legislation with a simple majority.",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, stressed Thursday ahead of votes that the Senate plan is the backup plan if the House blueprint fails, saying \"I prefer what you're doing to what we're doing, but we've got to have a Plan B if you can't get it done soon.\" Graham also reiterated that senators want permanent tax cuts.",
      "\"To my House colleagues, we will all get there together if you can pass the one big, beautiful bill that makes the tax cuts permanent \u2014 not four or five years \u2014 then we'll all cheer over here,\" he said on the Senate floor. \"Nothing would please me more than Speaker Johnson being able to put together the bill that President Trump wants.

    "summary": "Many of the dozens of lawsuits challenging the Trump administration's actions hinge on alleged violations of decades-old federal laws.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Dozens of lawsuits have been filed in the past month challenging executive actions President Trump has taken since the start of his second term in office, and federal courts from coast to coast have started scrutinizing the president's plans.",
      "The challenges are aimed at unwinding many of the president's policies, which they believe are unlawful. They have targeted his plans to\u00a0crack down on illegal immigration,\u00a0shrink the size\u00a0of the federal government and cut\u00a0spending, as well as Mr. Trump's pledge to end what he believes is\u00a0the weaponization of the Justice Department and FBI.",
      "Many of the lawsuits hinge on alleged violations of decades-old federal laws: The Administrative Procedure Act, the Privacy Act and the Impoundment Control Act. The measures prescribe certain procedures and policies that the executive branch must follow when it comes to taking certain actions.",
      "Here is what to know about each of the laws:",
      "Administrative Procedure Act",
      "Lawsuits challenging Mr. Trump's actions on gender ideology, immigration, civil service rules, FBI agents, deferred resignations, USAID cuts, foreign aid pauses and federal assistance freezes all have one thing in common: they allege the Trump administration and senior officials have violated the Administrative Procedure Act.",
      "Enacted by Congress in 1946, the law, known as the APA, established the process that federal agencies must follow when creating new rules and regulations, and how courts review those actions. The law's requirements do not apply to the president.",
      "\"In the late 1940s, at a time when agencies were doing more and more, and agencies often had their own procedures for doing certain things, Congress wanted to largely standardize the procedures that agencies need to go through when they either make or repeal or reform a regulation or when they take specific action through agency adjudication,\" said Adam White, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who focuses on the Supreme Court and the administrative state.",
      "The APA requires agencies to provide the public with notice of a proposed rule and the chance to offer written comment on it. Once the notice-and-comment period is closed, the agency then publishes its final rule in the Federal Register. This must be done at least 30 days before the rule takes effect.",
      "Courts reviewing a challenged agency action typically consider whether an agency's action is \"arbitrary and capricious.\" The standard of review requires an agency to show that it engaged in \"reasoned decisionmaking\" by providing an adequate explanation for its decision, according to the Congressional Research Service. The agency also has to provide \"the essential facts upon which the administrative decision was based.\"",
      "\"To make a rule, an agency under the APA normally has to give reasons for its rule, and arbitrary and capricious review is a consideration of those reasons,\" White said.",
      "Arbitrary and capricious review is deferential to the agency, which will often prevail in cases alleging violations of the APA if their explanation is \"even plausibly reasonable,\" White said.",
      "\"The government usually wins because it's a very deferential standard of review, but every once in a while it loses because it just didn't connect the dots on the policy it was trying to explain,\" he said.",
      "Most of the lawsuits filed against the Trump administration that seek to invalidate its actions allege violations of the APA, and specifically claim the targeted policies are arbitrary and capricious.",
      "In one of the cases that challenges a memo freezing federal assistance, a group of nonprofit organizations argues that the funding pause is arbitrary and capricious \"in multiple respects.\" The suit argues that the directive fails to acknowledge the \"catastrophic practical consequences\" of halting federal assistance and did not articulate why a review of existing grant programs requires they be paused.",
      "But the challengers also allege that OMB does not have the authority to unilaterally freeze federal financial assistance programs government-wide.",
      "The APA has tripped up the last two administrations.",
      "In a decision from June 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that Mr. Trump's rescission of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals immigration program, or DACA, violated the APA. The high court found the rescission was arbitrary and capricious, and said the first Trump administration failed to consider certain issues when it walked back the DACA program, such as the impacts to young people who were enrolled.",
      "Then, in its last term, the Supreme Court blocked a rule from the Environmental Protection Agency under former President Joe Biden that aimed to address the harmful smog that travels from certain states. The court said a group of states that challenged the rule were likely to prevail on their claim that it was arbitrary and capricious, in part because of the EPA's decisionmaking regarding concerns raised during the notice-and-comment period.",
      "Privacy Act",
      "Enacted in 1974, the Privacy Act was passed during the Watergate scandal and at the advent of new technologies like mainframe computer systems that allowed for the storage of millions of Americans' information.",
      "\"It was Congress' effort to control what government may do with the information it collects about American citizens and to provide, to a limited degree, an ability for American citizens to review and respond to that use through lawsuits and more particularly through congressional oversight,\" Paul Rosenzweig, an expert in homeland security and national security, told CBS News.",
      "The law governs the government's collection and use of Americans' information kept by agencies. It lays out how the government must store that information, who can access it and when the government can use the data or disclose it. The Privacy Act also prohibits agencies from disclosing records pertaining to an individual without their written consent, unless it falls under an exception.",
      "These 12 exceptions allow the government to use personal information in certain circumstances without the individual's approval, such as for law enforcement activity, or when the information cannot be tied with a specific person, such as for statistical research. A \"need-to-know\" exception lets an agency disclose Privacy Act records to its officers and employees who need the record to perform their duties, while another allows disclosure when the information is needed for a \"routine use.\"",
      "The Privacy Act gives Americans the right to sue an agency for an alleged violation of the law. A well-known case was brought by Linda Tripp, who was a central figure in the impeachment scandal involving former President Bill Clinton.",
      "Tripp accused the Defense Department of violating the Privacy Act by disclosing personal information to a newspaper. She filed three lawsuits against the agency, and the case eventually ended with a settlement in which the Defense Department agreed to pay Tripp $595,000.",
      "Now, the law has been invoked in several lawsuits stemming from the work of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which was established by Mr. Trump as part of his efforts to shrink the size of government.",
      "In November, the president said Elon Musk would lead DOGE, though the White House has since said he is a special government employee and senior adviser to Mr. Trump, and not the administrator of the task force.",
      "Since DOGE's formal creation on Mr. Trump's first day in office, its employees have been dispatched to more than a dozen federal agencies and started accessing data systems. But their efforts have raised concerns among labor unions and Democratic-led states, which have in turn filed lawsuits seeking to block\u00a0 DOGE's access.",
      "\"This is a novel set of circumstances involving wholesale disclosures and wholesale access,\" Rosenzweig said. He noted that while Privacy Act lawsuits typically center on a specific person's complaint, \"we've never seen that many suits of this scope and scale. We've also never seen an administration purport to authorize access to such a wide range of people who would not normally be given access: special government employees in DOGE.\"",
      "The suits allege that several agencies \u2014 including the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Treasury\u00a0and Education\u00a0\u2014 have violated the Privacy Act by disclosing Americans' personal information to DOGE staff without their consent.",
      "\"People who must share information with the federal government should not be forced to share information with Elon Musk or his 'DOGE.' And federal law says they do not have to,\" lawyers for a group of unions wrote in a lawsuit against Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent challenging DOGE's access to sensitive personal and financial information maintained by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service.",
      "But the Trump administration has argued that DOGE employees are authorized to access the records and are being supervised by the agencies to which they have been detailed. At the Treasury Department, for example, Justice Department lawyers invoked the need-to-know exception and said in a filing that DOGE team members were agency employees who have a need for the records to perform their duties.",
      "\"Need-to-know is based upon need and thus the asserted justification for why they must have access is fair ground for court-based inquiry,\" Rosenzweig said. \"For as long as the Privacy Act has been around, that need has been measured by both the asserted government interests and, to some degree, the sensitivity of the data at issue. It's not canonical, but it is a common-sense assessment that if you really want to know my health records, you better have a damn good reason.\"",
      "The cases are in their early stages, and no judge has ruled definitively on whether the Trump administration has violated the Privacy Act by allowing Musk and DOGE access to agency records without Americans' consent.",
      "Judges have, though, denied preliminary requests to prevent DOGE staff from getting into systems at some agencies. In one decision from U.S. District Judge John Bates, the court found that a group of labor unions was unlikely to succeed on their claims that the Trump administration is violating the Privacy Act by allowing DOGE access to systems at the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "The Impoundment Control Act",
      "Court fights aimed at the Trump administration's 90-day pause on foreign development assistance argue that it is violating the Impoundment Control Act, while federal judges overseeing cases involving the Office of Management and Budget's memo halting federal aid have both cited the law.",
      "Enacted in 1974, the law aimed to reassert Congress' power of the purse by providing the procedures for when a president wants to suspend appropriations that have already been approved by Congress. The law was enacted following attempts by President Richard Nixon's administration to not spend money that had been appropriated by Congress, according to the Government Accountability Office.",
      "The measure allows the president to temporarily withhold or cut approved funds in certain circumstances. But under the law, he must first send a \"special message\" to Congress that details the request to rescind or withhold funds. In the case of rescissions, Congress must then pass legislation cutting the funding.",
      "The administration's attempts to halt foreign aid and federal assistance programs may have been aimed at sparking legal challenges to the Impoundment Control Act, as they have done.",
      "OMB Director Russell Vought said during his confirmation hearing that Mr. Trump believes the impoundment law is unconstitutional.",
      "In decisions temporarily halting the administration's funding freeze while litigation continues, judges have raised the Impoundment Control Act.",
      "U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan\u00a0pointed to the Impoundment Control Act as one example of the legislature prohibiting \"the executive branch from encroaching on Congress's appropriations power.\" U.S. District Judge John McConnell issued a separate ruling in which he found there is \"no evidence that the executive has followed the law by notifying Congress\" to bring about a pause that would be legally allowed.",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 05:58:14 -0500",
    "summary": "The decision means Haitians would lose work permits and could be eligible to be removed from the country by August.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is throwing out protections for roughly half a million Haitians that had shielded them from deportation.",
      "The decision announced Thursday means they would lose their work permits and could be eligible to be removed from the country by August of this year.",
      "The decision is part of a sweeping effort by the Trump administration to make good on campaign promises to carry out mass deportations and specifically scale back the use of the Temporary Protected Status designation that was greatly expanded under the Biden administration to cover roughly 1 million immigrants.",
      "Impact and deportation concerns",
      "The Department of Homeland Security in a news release said they were vacating a decision by the Biden administration to renew Temporary Protected Status for Haitians. That status gives people legal authority to be in the country but doesn't provide a long-term path to citizenship.",
      "They are reliant on the government renewing their status when it expires. Critics, including Republicans and the Trump administration, have said that over time the renewal of the protection status becomes automatic, regardless of what is happening in the person's home country.",
      "\"For decades the TPS system has been exploited and abused. For example, Haiti has been designated for TPS since 2010. The data shows each extension of the country's TPS designation allowed more Haitian nationals, even those who entered the U.S. illegally, to qualify for legal protected status,\" Homeland Security said in a statement announcing the change.",
      "Homeland Security said an estimated 57,000 Haitians were eligible for TPS protections as of 2011 but by July of last year, that number had climbed to 520,694.",
      "It's not immediately clear how quickly they could be deported from the country once their protections expire. Some may apply for other types of protection and there are logistical challenges to carrying out such large-scale deportations.",
      "Haiti's migration director, Jean Negot Bonheur Delva, said only 21 Haitians have been deported so far under the Trump administration, but he noted the group had already been scheduled for deportation under Biden. There were a total of nine flights to Haiti in 2024, according to Witness at the Border, an advocacy group that tracks flight data.",
      "Delva worried about the strain it would cause to send people back to a country still reeling from violence and where more than one million people are homeless because of gang violence.",
      "\"It's very sad that people who left Haiti to look for a better life elsewhere...will come back,\" said Delva. \"With the insecurity problem, the lack of resources, they will be miserable.\"",
      "More than 5,600 people were reported killed last year in Haiti, according to the U.N.",
      "Many of those displaced are living in severely overcrowded makeshift shelters including abandoned government buildings where rapes are becoming increasingly common.",
      "Gangs control 85% of Haiti's capital and have launched new attacks to seize control of even more territory. Recent massacres have claimed the lives of hundreds of civilians.",
      "Delva said Haiti's government recently created a commission to help those deported.",
      "\"They are children of Haiti. A mother must receive her children from wherever they are,\" he said.",
      "Congress created TPS in 1990 to prevent deportations to countries suffering from natural disasters or civil strife, giving people authorization to work in increments of up to 18 months at a time.",
      "Toward the end of the Biden administration, 1 million immigrants from 17 countries were protected by TPS, including people from Venezuela, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, Afghanistan, Sudan, Ukraine and Lebanon. But the Trump administration has already moved to end the protections for Venezuelans.",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 05:00:01 -0500",
    "summary": "The FDA is already limited in policing claims of health benefits by makers of supplements and herbal remedies \u2014 a $70 billion industry. Get ready for even less regulation.",
    "story": [
      "Last fall, before being named the senior U.S. health official, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the Trump administration would liberate Americans from the FDA's \"aggressive suppression\" of vitamins, dietary supplements, and other substances \u2014 ending the federal agency's \"war on public health,\" as he put it.",
      "In fact, the FDA can't even require that supplements be effective before they are sold. When Congress, at the agency's urging, last considered legislation to require makers of vitamins, herbal remedies, and other pills and potions to show proof of their safety and worth before marketing the products, it got more negative mail, phone calls, and telegrams than at any time since the Vietnam War, by some accounts. The backlash resulted in a 1994 law that enabled the dietary supplement industry to put its products on the market without testing and to tout unproven benefits, as long as the touting doesn't include claims to treat or cure a disease. Annual industry revenues have grown from $4 billion to $70 billion since.",
      "With Kennedy now in the driver's seat, the industry will likely expect more: It aims to make bolder health claims for its products and even get the government, private insurers, and flexible spending accounts to pay for supplements, essentially putting them on an equal footing with FDA-approved pharmaceuticals.",
      "On Feb. 13, the day he swore in Kennedy as secretary of Health and Human Services, President Donald Trump issued a \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda targeting alleged corruption in health regulatory agencies and instructing them to \"ensure the availability of expanded treatment options and the flexibility for health insurance coverage to provide benefits that support beneficial lifestyle changes and disease prevention.\"",
      "Kennedy has said exercise, dietary supplements, and nutrition, rather than pharmaceutical products, are key to good health. Supplement makers want consumers to be able to use programs like health savings accounts, Medicare, and even benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, to pay for such items as vitamins, fish oil, protein powders, and probiotics.",
      "\"Essentially they're seeking a government subsidy,\" said Pieter Cohen, a Harvard University physician who studies supplements.",
      "As the Senate Finance Committee questioned Kennedy during his Jan. 29 confirmation hearing, supporters in the Alliance for Natural Health lunched on quinoa salad in a U.S. Capitol Visitor Center and crowed that the moment had finally arrived for their health freedom movement, which has combined libertarian capitalism and mistrust of the medical establishment to champion unregulated compounds since the 19th century.",
      "\"The greatest opportunity of our lifetimes is before us,\" said Jonathan Emord, the group's general counsel, who has brought many successful lawsuits against the FDA's restrictions on unproven health claims. \"RFK has dedicated his whole life to opposing the undue influence\" of the pharmaceutical industry and \"assuring that our interests triumph,\" Emord said.",
      "In speeches and in a pamphlet called \"The MAHA Mandate,\" Emord and alliance founder Robert Verkerk said Kennedy would free companies to make greater claims for their products' alleged benefits. Emord said his group was preparing to sue the FDA to prevent it from restricting non-pharmaceutical production of substances like biopeptides \u2014 complex molecules related to drugs like Ozempic.",
      "HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon did not respond to a request for comment on the agency's plans vis-\u00e0-vis dietary supplements.",
      "While the basic law governing the FDA establishes that a substance alleged to have treatment or curative effects is by definition a \"drug,\" and therefore comes under the agency's requirements for high standards of scientific evidence, the new administration could reallocate money away from enforcement, said Mitch Zeller, former head of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products.",
      "As a Senate aide early in his career, Zeller investigated a tainted L-tryptophan supplement that killed at least 30 people and sickened thousands in the U.S. in 1989. The scandal led the FDA to seek heavier regulation of supplements, but a powerful backlash resulted in the relatively weak supplements law of 1994.",
      "Even that law's enforcement could be undercut with a stroke of the pen that would keep FDA inspectors out of the field, Zeller said.",
      "Sweeping changes couldn't come too soon for Nathan Jones, founder and CEO of Xlear, a company that makes products containing xylitol, an artificial sweetener. The Federal Trade Commission sued Xlear in 2021 for making what it called false claims that its nasal spray could prevent and treat COVID.",
      "Jones points to a handful of studies evaluating whether xylitol prevents cavities and infections, saying the FDA would require overly expensive studies to get xylitol approved as a drug. Meanwhile, he said, dentists have been bought out by \"Big Toothpaste.\"",
      "One can hardly find any products \"without fluoride for oral health,\" he said. \"Crest and Colgate don't want it to happen,\" he said.",
      "Kennedy's desire to rid water supplies of fluoride because of its alleged impact on children's IQ is welcome news, he said, and not only because it could highlight the value of his products. Jones stresses, as do many health freedom advocates, that clean air and water and unadulterated food do more to prevent and cure disease than vaccines and drugs. For example, he and other advocates claim, wrongly, that the United States eliminated the crippling disease polio through better sanitation, not vaccination.",
      "The Alliance for Natural Health hopes that in lieu of strict FDA standards, Kennedy will enable companies to make expanded marketing claims based on evidence from non-FDA sources, Verkerk said, such as the National Institutes of Health's nutritional information site, which describes the pros and cons of different supplements.",
      "Kennedy has also called for relaxing the strictures on psychedelic drugs, which interest some veterans as potential remedies for such conditions as post-traumatic stress disorder. VETS, a San Diego-based organization, has paid for 1,000 veterans to get treatment with the powerful hallucinogen ibogaine at clinics in Mexico and other countries, said the group's co-founder, Amber Capone.",
      "She got involved after her husband, a retired Navy SEAL, pulled out of a suicidal spiral after spending a week at an ibogaine clinic near Tijuana, Mexico, in 2017. She wants NIH, the Defense Department, and the Department of Veterans Affairs to fund research on the illegal substance \u2014 which can cause cardiac complications and is listed as a Schedule I drug, on par with heroin and LSD \u2014 so it can be made legally available when appropriate.",
      "Coincidentally, the push for less onerous standards on supplements and psychedelics would come while Kennedy is demanding \"gold-standard science\" to review preservatives and other food additives that he has said could play a role in the country's high rate of chronic diseases.",
      "\"Put aside the fact that there's precious little evidence to support\" that idea, said Stuart Pape, a former FDA food center attorney. \"There's been no indication they want the same rigor for supplements and nutraceuticals.\"",
      "Although most of these products don't have major safety concerns, \"we have no idea which products work, so in the best case people are throwing away a ton of money,\" Zeller said. \"The worst-case scenario is they are relying on unproven products to treat underlying conditions, and time is going by when they could have been using more effective FDA-authorized products for diseases.\"",
      "Supplement makers aren't entirely unified. Groups such as the Consumer Healthcare Products Association and the Council for Responsible Nutrition have advocated for the FDA to crack down on products that are unsafe or falsely represented. The Alliance for Natural Health and the Natural Products Association, meanwhile, largely want the government to get out of the way.",
      "\"The time has come to embrace a radical shift \u2014 from reactive disease management to proactive health cultivation, from top-down public health diktats to personalized, individual-centric care,\" Emord and Verkerk state in their \"MAHA Mandate.\"",

      "\"It's not enormous,\" Musk added of his security detail. \"Maybe it should be bigger.\"",
      "Musk was tapped by President Trump to head the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.

During President Trump's inauguration, 4,000 officers from outside of Washington, D.C. \u2014 across 178 different law enforcement and police agencies \u2014 were sworn in and deputized by the U.S. Marshals to assist in protection of the nation's capital.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 21:39:00 -0500",
    "summary": "\"I can tell you this: anyone that has crossed the border between the ports of entry since this administration has taken office has not been released,\" Border Patrol chief Mike Banks told CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Unlawful crossings at the U.S. southern border are down 94% from the same period last year, Border Patrol Chief Mike Banks told CBS News in his first sit-down interview, crediting the Trump administration's government-wide crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Over the past seven days, Banks said, Border Patrol agents have apprehended an average of 285 migrants per day along the entire southern border, compared to roughly 4,800 during the same time last year.",
      "Banks attributed the dramatic drop in illegal immigration to a slew of executive actions taken by President Trump. They include an order that has effectively closed the U.S. asylum system and allowed for summary deportations, as well as the cancellation of Biden administration policies that allowed some migrants to enter the country with the government's permission.",
      "Formerly Texas' border czar, Banks also cited the Trump administration's deployment of additional troops to the southern border and a decision to deputize Texas National Guard soldiers as immigration officers, to help Border Patrol agents in the field.",
      "Taken together, Banks said, the actions have virtually halted releases of migrants into the U.S. interior and sent a strong warning to those thinking about traveling to the American border that they will most likely be deported if they enter the country without permission.",
      "\"The greater the punishment, the larger the deterrent,\" Banks said during an interview at Customs and Border Protection's headquarters in Washington.",
      "Since Mr. Trump took office, Banks added, only two migrants have been released from Border Patrol custody after crossing the southern border unlawfully. He said they were released to assist with criminal prosecutions as witnesses.",
      "\"I can tell you this: anyone that has crossed the border between the ports of entry since this administration has taken office has not been released,\" Banks noted.",
      "One of the Biden-era policies the Trump administration rescinded allowed prospective asylum-seekers in Mexico to use a phone app, known as CBP One, to request a time to enter the U.S. at a legal border entry point.",
      "Asked if asylum is no longer an option for migrants at the U.S. southern border given the policy changes, Banks responded, \"At the border, right, crossing in between the ports of entry, which is what the Border Patrol focuses on? No.\"",
      "\"You do not cross the border illegally and then make an asylum claim,\" he said. \"You can go to the port of entry, or you can go to one of the embassies in your country and make your claim for asylum.\"",
      "While illegal crossings along the border with Mexico have dropped precipitously since Mr. Trump's inauguration, they had been on a downward trend over the past year, since soaring to record highs in late 2023.

    "story": [
      "The top official in charge of food safety and nutrition at the Food and Drug Administration resigned this week, protesting the dozens of scientists and other health officials now being let go across the agency's foods program.",
      "In his resignation letter, James Jones warned that the \"indiscriminate\" cuts would add \"one more roadblock\" to the \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda outlined by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "\"They included staff with highly technical expertise in nutrition, infant formula, food safety response and even 10 chemical safety staff hired to review potentially unsafe ingredients in our food supply,\" Jones wrote in his letter, which was dated Feb. 17.",
      "Jones said that at least 89 of his recently hired staff had been cut across the agency's human foods program. News of the resignation was previously reported by the food industry publication Food Fix.",
      "Dozens of other staff have been cut across other parts of the FDA, multiple agency employees told CBS News, because of the sweeping cost-cutting moves by the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, task force. Firings at the FDA affected a range of teams, including those overseeing tobacco products to medical devices, officials said.",
      "Many firings came without warning to their supervisors within the agency, officials said, with letters emailed directly to staff by human resources officials outside the FDA. Some were later walked back for employees that Trump administration officials felt needed to be exempted.",
      "The total number of staff cut at the FDA is unclear. An agency spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Jones had come into his role at the FDA as part of a major shakeup in recent years to the agency's food safety work.",
      "One major initiative spearheaded by Jones, a former top regulatory official at the Environmental Protection Agency, had been an effort to systematically start reviewing whether some of the additives previously greenlighted for use in food should still be considered safe.",
      "Under the program, the FDA moved to ban the color additive Red 3 for causing cancer in some laboratory animals. Advocates had hoped the program would also lead to renewed scrutiny of other artificial dyes, like Red 40, which had been lambasted by Kennedy.",
      "He also oversaw a proposal in the final weeks of the Biden administration to push for nutrition labels on the front of packages, as a way to push Americans and food manufacturers towards healthier options on store shelves.",
      "Some officials within the agency had hoped that Jones would be able to find common ground with the incoming team under Kennedy, who is weighing major changes to how food additives are regulated and has decried health officials for not doing enough to curb unhealthy foods.",
      "At a town hall with FDA employees this month, Jones had told his staff that he was ready to work with Kennedy. That changed after the firings, which Jones called \"short sighted\" and \"indiscriminate.\"",
      "\"It has been increasingly clear that with the Trump Administration's disdain for the very people necessary to implement your agenda, however, it would have been fruitless for me to continue in this role,\" Jones wrote in his letter.",
      "Kennedy had said in the run-up to the election that he wanted to fire all of the food and nutrition staff at the FDA and other federal agencies, saying they had been corrupted by conflicts of interest from corporations. In his letter, Jones rebuked Kennedy's attacks on his staff as unfounded.",

      "Washington --- Last month, Katie Sandlin uprooted her life in Carbon Hill, Alabama, a town of 2,000, to work at the National Institutes of Health\u00a0in Bethesda, outside Washington, D.C.",
      "\"I wiped out my savings account, I maxed out my credit card, I had to take out a loan,\" Sandlin told CBS News.",

      "Three weeks later, before she even unpacked her D.C. apartment, Sandlin became one of the thousands of federal probationary workers to be fired as part of President Trump's efforts to reduce the size of the federal government.",
      "Probationary workers usually have less than one year experience, and in some cases less than two years. They have fewer protections from layoffs, making them easier to terminate.",
      "\"Now, I'm unemployed, I have a ton of debt, and I'm also losing my health insurance, and I have, like many Americans, a chronic condition that requires me to take medication,\" said Sandlin, who adds that the idea of getting fired \"never crossed my mind.\"",

    "story": [
      "As the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, implements sweeping cuts across the federal government, Republican lawmakers are worried about the impact on jobs and industry in their states.",
      "But very few are directly criticizing President Trump or DOGE's leader, Elon Musk, and are instead taking a quieter approach. But the concerns raised nonetheless underscore the clash between shrinking government and parochial interests.",
      "Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski said she was hearing from so many constituents concerned about cuts to the federal workforce in her state that she decided to host a tele town hall Wednesday night, which she said over 1,000 people attended.",
      "Alaska has one of the largest federal workforces per capita in the country, with public land management a significant focus. Murkowski said the concerns at the town hall ranged from the impact on preparedness for wildland fires to staffing national parks to the ruthless treatment of employees.",
      "\"The abrupt terminations that we have seen for those have really been detrimental,\" she said, adding that she took her concerns to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. \"The problem is, they're going to require that all these people who were terminated reapply, so they have to go back to usa.gov and go through the application process, which, if you haven't done it, is a multi-month process. Parks are opening up in a couple months here, and so I'm concerned.\" Additionally, she said, cuts to the Bureau of Land Management could slow permitting for Mr. Trump's energy initiatives.",
      "The Alaska senator said she supports eliminating waste, fraud and abuse in government, \"but there is a way that we go about it, and we do it within the confines of the law and the rules that are out there\u2026when you're dealing with employees, there is a right way and a really not so right way to treat them.\"",
      "Maine Republican Susan Collins, another moderate senator, said she's also worried about the impact on national parks in her state, as well as on biomedical research.",
      "\"I think many of these firings are indiscriminate,\" she said. \"We should wait until Cabinet members are confirmed and can take a careful look at their agencies' needs, rather than doing these sweeping indiscriminate cuts. The fact that workers were let go who are working on avian flu, and the fact that workers have also been fired who are responsible for nuclear safety, shows that we need a far more careful approach.",
      "Earlier this month, as the administration began to dismantle USAID, Kansas Republican Sen. Jerry Moran urged Secretary of State Marco Rubio to \"distribute the $340 million in American-grown food currently stalled in U.S. ports to reach those in need.\"",
      "Moran, who sits on the Senate Agriculture Committee, also said he raised his concerns with the White House. \"U.S. food aid feeds the hungry, bolsters our national security & provides an important market for our farmers, especially when commodity prices are low,\" he said on X. He later said the State Department approved his request to distribute the stalled food aid.",
      "Kansas Republican Sen. Roger Marshall partnered with Moran to move USAID's Food for Peace program \u2014 of particular interest to Kansas farmers \u2014 under the jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture.",
      "\"To me, this is all about saving American taxpayers money, and so I fully support pauses in these programs,\" Marshall told CBS News. \"I think it's time to get rid of some of the agencies we have, over 400 agencies in this federal government, over 2 million employees outside of what we have in the military. So I think it's time for consolidation.\"",
      "Lawmakers have also taken notice of the layoffs at the National Institute of Health. \"Every cent of hard-earned taxpayer money should be spent efficiently, judiciously, and accountability \u2014 without exception,\" Alabama Sen. Katie Britt told AL.com. \"While the administration works to achieve this goal at NIH, a smart, targeted approach is needed in order to not hinder life-saving, groundbreaking research at high-achieving institutions like those in Alabama.\"",
      "Most other Republicans remain supportive of DOGE's mission. North Carolina GOP Sen. Thom Tillis said he's making sure FEMA and disaster aid isn't disrupted in his state, which has recently been ravaged by storms. But overall, he said, he agrees with the approach.",
      "\"I actually believe they are doing this because they're sick of trying to get answers to legitimate questions about where we can be efficient, and the way to force people to justify investments on exceptions is to shut everything down,\" Tillis said. \"I know it's disruptive, but I think they need to have the capacity to bring things back online that make sense.\"",
      "Oklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin also defended the administration's cost-cutting efforts. He pointed to the nation's burgeoning debt as a national security issue that requires \"difficult choices\".",
      "\"Any member is going to be particularly upset about some cuts that may be happening in our backyard,\" Mullin told CBS News. \"Look what's happened to FAA? You know, in Oklahoma City, we had the training facility for our air traffic controllers, right? That's a concern, and Sean Duffy and I've had conversations. But at the same time, we have the responsibility to the taxpayers and American people to get our financials, our financial burdens, in order.\"",
      "Florida Senator Rick Scott said he doesn't believe Musk and his DOGE team are moving too quickly.",
      "\"It's what I did when I was governor. It's what I did in my business life,\" said Scott. \"You go through and you're constantly looking at how to spend your money better.

      "Patel's nomination was approved in a party-line vote, 51 to 49. Two Republicans \u2014 Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2014 joined Democrats in voting to oppose Patel.",
      "FBI directors are appointed to 10-year terms but can be removed by the president. Chris Wray, whom the president appointed in 2017, resigned at the end of the Biden administration after Mr. Trump pledged to fire him.",

      "Collins cited the recent resignations at the Justice Department and a questionnaire sent to FBI employees about their involvement in cases about the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol. His statements and actions \"cast doubt on Mr. Patel's ability to advance the FBI's law enforcement mission in a way that is free from the appearance of political motivation,\" Collins said.",
      "Murkowski said her opposition \"stem[med] from his own prior political activities and how they may influence his leadership.\" She said the FBI \"must be trusted as the federal agency that roots out crime and corruption, not focused on settling political scores,\" and she was \"disappointed that when [Patel] had the opportunity to push back on the administration's decision to force the FBI to provide a list of agents involved in the January 6 investigations and prosecutions, he failed to do so.\"",

      "Eight senior bureau officials were asked to step down from their posts or face termination last month as part of broader scrutiny of FBI leadership by the Trump administration. The ousted officials oversaw the bureau's national security, criminal and cyber divisions, three sources told CBS News.",
      "Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove also ordered Brian Driscoll, who was serving as acting director of the FBI until Patel was installed, to compile a list of all current and former FBI employees who were assigned to the investigation into the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol for review to \"determine whether any additional personnel actions are necessary.\"",
      "A survey was also sent to certain FBI employees about their activities related to the Jan. 6 probes, including the extent of their roles.",
      "The FBI turned over the list of more than 5,000 personnel who worked on Jan. 6 cases last week. While it initially contained employee identification numbers instead of names and other information, Driscoll was later ordered to identify employees by name.",
      "Concerns that the list of names could be made public prompted a group of unnamed FBI agents who worked on the Capitol riot investigations to file lawsuits against the Justice Department seeking to prevent disclosure of the information.",
      "The Justice Department and lawyers for the agents reached an agreement last week in which the government would not make public the list of names unless it provided two days' notice to the agents. Legal proceedings are ongoing in the case.",
      "Patel vowed during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee late last month that \"all FBI employees will be protected from political retribution.\"",
      "\"Every FBI employee will be held to the absolute same standard and no one will be terminated for case assignments,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump, meanwhile, has vowed to fire \"some\" FBI employees who worked on the Jan. 6 investigations and alleged without evidence they are \"corrupt.\"",
      "Days before the Senate took up his nomination, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, asked the Justice Department's internal watchdog to investigate whether Patel was directing the firing of senior FBI officials as a private citizen.",
      "\"It is unacceptable for a nominee with no current role in government, much less at the FBI, to personally direct unjustified and potentially illegal adverse employment actions against senior career FBI leadership and other dedicated, nonpartisan law enforcement officers,\" Durbin wrote in a letter to Michael Horowitz, the Justice Department inspector general.",
      "He also alleged that Patel may have perjured himself during his confirmation hearing before the Judiciary Committee. During an exchange with Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, Patel said he was not aware of any plans or discussions to punish FBI agents or personnel associated with investigations into Mr. Trump before he was elected to a second term.",

Representing our commonwealth has been the honor of a lifetime. I will not seek this honor an eighth time. My current term in the Senate will be my last.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump said his administration is considering dividend checks based on savings found by DOGE. Economists are skeptical.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Wednesday said he's considering using 20% of the savings from Elon Musk's cost-cutting task force, the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to provide direct payments to taxpayers. But economists and policy experts across the political spectrum expressed skepticism about the feasibility of such a \"DOGE dividend.\"",
      "\"We're thinking about giving 20% back to the American citizens and 20% back to pay down debt,\" Mr. Trump said at the FII Priority summit, an investment conference in Miami sponsored by Saudi government entities. Mr. Trump didn't provide further details.",
      "The idea of the so-called DOGE dividend surfaced on social media this week when a four-page proposal was posted by an X user, James Fishback. The post caught the eye of Musk, the owner of X, who is spearheading DOGE, and who on Tuesday said he would pitch the idea to Mr. Trump.",
      "According to Fishback's calculation, 20% of the supposed $2 trillion in eventual DOGE savings would be provided to some taxpayers in the form of a direct tax rebate, which he estimated at $5,000 per household. Only households with a tax liability would receive the payment, which means lower-income households that generally don't owe income taxes wouldn't be included.",
      "But economists and policy experts said the plan isn't likely to materialize, citing the implausibility of finding anywhere near $2 trillion in federal cuts, as well as the legislative hurdles in approving such a direct tax payment.",
      "\"It is completely impossible for DOGE to save $2 trillion,\" Jessica Reidl, an economist and senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Two-thirds of the $7 trillion federal budget goes to Social Security, Medicare, defense, veterans and interest on the debt \u2014 all of which has been taken off the table by President Trump.\"",
      "She added, \"Saving $2 trillion would require eliminating nearly every remaining federal program. DOGE has no legal or constitutional authority to cut this spending; Congress must pass a law and that will not happen.\"",
      "Two-thirds of the nation's $6.7 trillion in annual spending is\u00a0mandatory\u00a0commitments through programs including Social Security and Medicare, while discretionary spending is largely spent on defense. In a Feb. 18 interview on Fox News' \"The Sean Hannity Show,\" Mr. Trump reiterated his earlier vow that Social Security and Medicare cuts are off the table.",
      "\"Social Security won't be touched, other than fraud or something,\" Mr. Trump said during the interview. \"We're going to find it's going to be strengthened, but won't be touched. Medicare, Medicaid, none of that stuff is going to be touched.\"",
      "On Feb. 19, Mr. Trump backed the House Republicans' budget proposal, which, if enacted, would include deep cuts to Medicaid, the nearly $900-billion-a-year government health insurance program that serves about 79 million mostly low-income or disabled Americans.",
      "The White House didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "DOGE cuts",
      "As of Wednesday, DOGE claims it has made cuts that add up to\u00a0about $8.4 billion, according to the task force's own\u00a0documentation.",
      "While DOGE has only been operating since Mr. Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20, its cuts are far from reaching Musk's stated goal of shaving $500 billion in annual government spending, let alone reaching near $2 trillion, experts noted.",
      "The plan \"is very unrealistic,\" Alex Nowrasteh, vice president for economic and social policy studies at the Cato Institute, who describes himself as a libertarian, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I'd love to see it, but I think that is unrealistic, especially in the first year, and certainly unrealistic without Congress getting involved.\"",
      "Any new tax refund check would need the approval of Congress, which controls government spending and is in charge of crafting tax laws. But House Republicans are currently\u00a0negotiating a budget proposal\u00a0that would enact trillions of dollars in spending cuts to pay for an extension of Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts, as well as other tax provisions the president promised on the campaign trail.",
      "A DOGE dividend \"will make their numbers even harder to work in the budget reconciliation,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a Washington, D.C.-based left-leaning economic think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's hard to see how to make the math work.\"",
      "While a plan for some kind of DOGE dividend could materialize, it would doubtless be a much smaller amount than envisioned, given the practical impossibility of finding $2 trillion in federal cuts.",
      "Experts noted that rebate checks are typically issued in times of economic stress, such as during the pandemic, when Congress authorized several rounds of stimulus checks. But the U.S. economy today is viewed as strong, given growing GDP and low unemployment, they added.",
      "At the same time, the federal government's annual outlays are outpacing revenue by about $2 trillion, creating budget deficits and sending the nation's debt to a record $36.2 trillion.",
      "Reidl noted, \"Washington is facing annual budget deficits that will likely surpass $3 trillion within the next few years. Sending taxpayers dividend checks would be completely irresponsible.\"",
      "DOGE facing legal issues",
      "Experts also raised the issue of whether DOGE's cuts could be reversed by the courts, given that the group is facing multiple lawsuits over its access to sensitive data across various agencies as well as over the legality of its creation.",
      "\"I'm happy to see [DOGE] identify things that can be cut, but I do have concerns about the legality of it,\" Nowrasteh of the Cato Institute said. \"Congress appropriates money, and having the presidential quasi-commission go around and cut things seems like it would run afoul of a lot of laws.\"",
      "DOGE's savings so far could \"be reversed by the courts for bypassing Congress,\" Reidl noted.",
      "Given the challenges of trying to find anything close to $2 trillion in savings, as well as the legislative issues in passing a tax rebate check, experts said their advice to taxpayers is not to bank on getting a DOGE dividend.",
      "\"I wouldn't be budgeting a $5,000 expense in the near term,\" Jacquez said.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 12:51:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The \"reinventing government\" program cut over 480,000 federal jobs and thousands of regulations. The woman who ran the program says any similarities to DOGE end there.",
    "story": [
      "As President Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency push to slash spending, Republican allies have likened their efforts to a White House program from more than 30 years ago.",
      "After entering the White House in 1993, Democratic President Bill Clinton tasked Vice President Al Gore with looking for ways to cut waste and red tape and streamline the federal bureaucracy to \"create a government that works better and costs less.\"",
      "The \"reinventing government\" program cut nearly half a million federal jobs and dispensed with a massive number of regulations. But according to the woman who ran the program under the Clinton administration, any similarities between that program and DOGE end there.",
      "\"We cut fat and they cut muscle. It's as simple as that,\" Elaine Kamarck, now a senior fellow in Governance Studies at Brookings, told CBS News. \"We didn't have any meltdowns of agencies, we didn't have any dysfunction going on, and we obeyed the law. When we thought something was wrong, we sent it to Congress and asked them to change it.\"",
      "The National Partnership for Reinventing Government followed through on Clinton's campaign promise to make the government more efficient and effective. The project was spearheaded by Gore and officially\u00a0created in March 1993, kicking off a review of government agencies that would go on to become the longest-running reform effort in the nation's history. It wrapped up its work in 1998.",
      "Kamarck was hired by Gore to direct the program, and the two put together a team of about 400 civil servants who worked across a number of teams. They conducted reviews of Cabinet-level agencies with a partner team within the agency and returned recommendations for review. Six months later, the project had yielded hundreds of recommendations bound in a report titled\u00a0 \"Creating a Government that Works Better & Costs Less.\"",
      "The effort, which would ultimately trim the federal workforce by around 426,000 in less than eight years while cutting thousands of pages of regulations, was focused on saving the government money. But Kamarck said it also focused on \"making the government work better,\" with attention toward performance and customer service standards that remain today.",
      "\"Basically, we worked with people in the government to identify where we could make it work better, and where we could make it cost less,\" Kamarck said.",
      "The program went on well beyond the six-month review period to focus on implementation, acting upon around two-thirds of the recommendations, and yielding an estimated $136 billion in savings for taxpayers.",
      "Now, more than three decades later, a new cost-cutting effort is underway. Mr. Trump\u00a0announced in December that Musk, who played a major role in his reelection effort, would lead DOGE in the new administration, and signed an\u00a0executive order on his first day in office to officially create the Department of Government Efficiency. Its\u00a0website says it's found $55 billion in savings so far, but a CBS News review of those savings shows some discrepancies.",
      "Unlike the Clinton-era program, which took six months to make its recommendations, DOGE has worked with Cabinet department and agency heads to shrink the government workforce immediately and pause swaths of government spending. DOGE first turned its focus to excising federal contracts and spending on issues like diversity, equity and inclusion provisions and\u00a0foreign aid and has moved on to other federal agencies.",
      "The Trump administration offered a\u00a0deferred resignation plan to more than 2 million civilian federal employees and convinced 75,000 to accept it before shutting it down and ordered agencies to\u00a0lay off nearly all probationary employees.",
      "DOGE has also gained\u00a0access to the Treasury Department's payment system. And an IRS employee associated with DOGE\u00a0requested access to the IRS' data system that includes individual taxpayer information in recent days.",
      "The moves have sparked controversy \u2014 and lawsuits \u2014 over the administration's authority to carry out its dramatic reshaping of the federal government in a compressed period of time.",
      "Facing scrutiny, Musk and allies have held up the example of the Clinton administration's government overhaul seemingly as a kind of model for their own. During a hearing held by the House's newly created DOGE subcommittee last week, one Republican lawmaker showed a video featuring Clinton and Gore's announcement after the six-month review to remind Democrats of what their \"party believed in.\" Musk himself has highlighted the comparison between his work and the effort three decades prior in recent days, sharing an AI-generated\u00a0post on reductions to the federal workforce under the Clinton administration and concurring with a\u00a0post that called Clinton and Gore \"the original Doges.\"",
      "Kamarck, though she has\u00a0advocated for new government cuts, said the \"big difference\" between the Clinton administration program and DOGE is that the earlier program sought to understand what was going on in the agency and what was important, using a fine-toothed comb to make cuts.",
      "\"If they were doing it the same way we did it, they could do a hell of a lot of good for the government,\" Kamarck said. \"But instead, they're just, they're throwing out the baby with the bath water.\"",
      "Still, Clinton's government cutting received its share of criticism, sparking frustrations when the program chose to close many regional offices deemed to be obsolete and incompatible with advancements in electronic communications. Kamarck conceded that they didn't win every fight. Though they succeeded on procurement reform, pioneered electronic filing of tax returns and generally helped usher the federal government into the internet age, they fell short on civil service reform without an advocate in Congress.",
      "And although their effort to reduce the size of the government workforce took place over years instead of weeks, there were some who felt that the buyout strategy they used was not as effective as it could have been. \"Many with special skills left, and people who stayed might have been those we'd have wanted to leave,\" Donald Kettl, the former dean of the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland,\u00a0told Government Executive in 2013.",
      "Kamarck said the process the Clinton administration followed is the \"harder way to do it\" \u2014 and not how DOGE is proceeding.",
      "\"They are pretending that there is no law governing the bureaucracy,\" she said.",

      "Washington \u2014 Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska on Wednesday urged her colleagues in Congress to reassert their constitutional authority and stand up to President Trump if he withholds funding approved by lawmakers through his\u00a0mass firings of federal workers or severe cuts to federal agencies.",
      "\"If the president, for instance, should seek to withhold federal funding that has already been authorized and appropriated, that violates the Budget Act, it violates the Impoundment Act and it cannot be allowed to stand. And so, if we in Congress allow that, we effectively cede some of our authority, and so, your question as to, what do we do about it? We have to stand up,\" she said in a virtual town hall with constituents.",
      "\"Now, the 'we' has to be more than just me. And this is where it becomes more of a challenge, but it requires speaking out. It requires saying, 'That violates the law. That violates the authorities of the executive,'\" she said.",
      "The Alaska Republican said Congress has an \"obligation to the Constitution\" that requires \"speaking out and standing up, and that requires, again, more than just one or two Republicans \u2014 it requires us as a Congress to do so.\"",
      "The president's moves to essentially shutter several agencies and fire thousands of workers have already run into legal challenges, with federal courts across the country weighing whether his actions were lawful. The administration has been temporarily blocked from ousting workers and freezing funding in a handful of cases so far.",
      "Murkowski is a moderate Republican who has been in the Senate since 2002 and won reelection in 2022 despite longstanding differences with Mr. Trump. She said more than 1,000 people dialed into the call on Wednesday, and that many of her constituents were concerned about the Trump administration's cuts, which are being spearheaded by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. Alaska has one of the highest concentrations of federal government workers per capita outside the Washington, D.C., Maryland, and Virginia region.",
      "Most Republican lawmakers have so far shown little interest in objecting as the Trump administration tries to whittle down agencies established and funded by Congress.",
      "On the war in Ukraine, Murkowski said \"we were all more than a little bit stunned\" by what she called a \"radical switch\" in the president's rhetoric about the war and Russia. Mr. Trump this week referred to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a \"dictator\" and wrongly blamed Ukraine for Russia's invasion, while his top aides met with Russian representatives in Saudi Arabia about the war without inviting Ukrainian officials.",
      "Murkowski said she thought Mr. Trump's comments about Zelenskyy were \"uncalled for and unfortunate.\"",
      "\"It is wrong to suggest that somehow or other Ukraine started this war, asked for this war. It is clear for all the world to see and to know that Putin invaded Ukraine and started the war,\" Murkowski said.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly said Russia wants to end the war, without mentioning that Russia started the conflict and could end it at any point by withdrawing troops from Ukraine. Asked if he trusts Russia to negotiate in good faith on ending the war, the president said he does.",
      "\"I do, I think the Russians want to see the war end,\" the president said. \"And I do, I really do. But I think they have the cards a little bit because, you know, they've taken a lot of territory, so they have the cards.\"",
      "A handful of other Republicans have expressed their disagreement with Mr. Trump's stance on Russia and Ukraine, without directly crossing the president.",
      "\"Russia's the aggressor here,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Wednesday.",
      "\"Putin started this war,\" Republican Rep. Don Bacon wrote on X Wednesday. \"Putin committed war crimes. Putin is the dictator who murdered his opponents. The EU nations have contributed more to Ukraine. Zelensky polls over 50%. Ukraine wants to be part of the West, Putin hates the West. I don't accept George Orwell's doublethink.\"",
      "Murkowski separately told CBS News on Capitol Hill earlier Wednesday she has been hearing from constituents who have been worked for the federal government for years or decades. She said she heard from one woman who used to work for her before accepting a position with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Because the woman was recently promoted, Murkowski said, she was considered a probationary employee and was terminated as part of the administration's cuts. Now the woman has a \"black mark\" on her record, Murkowski said.",
      "\"She's been terminated and given no opportunity to appeal it, no opportunity to even think about it,\" Murkowski said. \"You get a notice on Friday saying you're gone. Now that, to me, doesn't demonstrate much due process. But even more, it doesn't show respect for those who have worked hard as federal servants.\"",

The Defense Departmen expects to redirect those fund to other programs in the department that would be prioritized by President Trump.",
      "Robert Salesses, who is performing the duties of deputy secretary of defense, said in a statement Wednesday evening that the department intends to produce budgets \"that revive the warrior ethos, rebuild our military, and reestablish deterrence.\"",

Officials at both agencies acknowledge the unlikelihood of 2024 YR4 causing problems, with the ESA saying that current risk estimates are probably unnecessarily high because the people studying it are still uncertain about some of the asteroid's key features.",
      "Right now, astronomers estimate the asteroid is between 40 meters and 90 meters wide, which is roughly 130 to 295 feet wide. For reference, an American football field measures 100 yards \u2014 or 300 feet \u2014 long.",
      "\"It is very important that we improve our size estimate for 2024 YR4,\" the ESA said in a statement Monday, which noted \"the hazard represented by a 40 m asteroid is very different from that of a 90 m asteroid.\"",
      "On the slim chance the asteroid does strike Earth in 2032, its impacts would be localized. But 2024 YR4 has nonetheless received a Level 3 rating, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale, which is a fairly rare distinction meant to represent \"a close encounter\" that warrants public and scientific attention.",
      "\"An asteroid this size impacts Earth on average every few thousand years and could cause severe damage to a local region,\" the ESA said\u00a0a previous statement\u00a0about 2024 YR4.",
      "If the asteroid does hit the planet, NASA said its potential impact sites could include areas over the eastern Pacific Ocean, northern South America, the Atlantic Ocean, Africa, the Arabian Sea and South Asia.",
      "CBS News space consultant Bill Harwood said if it landed in a populated area, it would \"be truly catastrophic,\" but the effects would be localized.",
      "\"It wouldn't be something like the rock that killed the dinosaurs,\" Harwood said. \"It wouldn't affect the global climate, but it would certainly be a disaster of every proportion. So we're all hoping that doesn't happen.\"",
      "In order to gain a greater understanding of the asteroid and better prepare for whatever is to come, astronomers will use the Webb Telescope to collect data on its size that could not be observed as accurately without the telescope's technology, the ESA said.",
      "Where scientists are generally limited to observing the asteroid based on the amount of visible light it reflects from the sun, with brighter light typically signaling a larger asteroid, the Webb telescope can calculate its infrared emissions, allowing for more accurate estimates.",
      "Webb will begin studying the asteroid in March, when it appears brightest, and again in May, according to the ESA. 2024 YR4 will disappear from view for a while after that, and astronomers will take time to interpret the telescope's data and determine what it could mean for the asteroid's route before it shows itself again in 2028.",

    "summary": "The head of planetary defense at the European Space Agency discusses 2024 YR4, an asteroid with a small chance of striking Earth eight years from now.",
    "story": [
      "An asteroid capable of flattening a mid-sized city could potentially collide with Earth eight years from now, as its orbit around the sun briefly intersects the path of our planet. Named 2024 YR4, the space rock carries with it very slim odds of striking land \u2014 either on Earth or the moon \u2014 and astronomers recently set the odds of a crash at 0.28%.",
      "International space organizations like NASA are taking the possible threat seriously, however small it might be. Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's Planetary Defence Office, said their attentiveness shouldn't unduly raise public concern. He shared key facts about the asteroid with CBS News during the below conversation, which has been edited for clarity.",
      "When would the asteroid hit Earth?",
      "This asteroid passes us by every four years. Every time we go four times around the sun, it has almost precisely completed one turn. It has just recently had a flyby in December 2024, which means the next flyby is in December 2028, and we know already that this one is no problem.",
      "The critical one is in 2032, on the 22nd of December, somewhere around the middle of the day in Universal Time. That is when the asteroid is passing, really, through a part of the orbit of the Earth. So, it's really going through the path of Earth, so to speak.",
      "And the question is, whether Earth will be there at this point in time, or whether it will have already passed or is still approaching that point. It's the question, where will it pass by? There's an uncertainty region that spans, right now, the entire Earth-Moon system \u2014 which is not to say that we don't know a lot about it. In fact, we know a lot about it.",
      "Now, we're looking at a closing moment in time on the 22nd of December, 2032, and the question is about fractions of a meter per second, which will make all the difference.",
      "There's about a 20-something-minute window in which the Earth can be in the way of this before it's no longer in the path of the asteroid, or the asteroid cannot come in contact with the Earth anymore.",
      "How is the asteroid risk being managed?",
      "Until recently, we did daily measurements with different telescopes. Then, we had to pause a little bit for one or two days because of the full moon, and the object being too close to the full moon, and the moon illuminating the sky too much to see it.",
      "From now on, we will not monitor it daily, but it will be constantly monitored in the best way possible, with ever larger telescopes. And the idea is to measure its path around the sun in ever higher positions, so you will see this uncertainty region shrink, and shrink, and shrink. And we are trying to constrain the uncertainty so much that we can say whether it passes by Earth safely, or whether there is still some chance left in the middle of April.",
      "What happens in April?",
      "We will be so far away from the object that we cannot observe it from Earth anymore. And then, the James Webb Telescope will take measurements. It will actually take one in March, primarily infrared observations that give us more insight about the size of the object, and then one more in May to do additional measurements. The most likely scenario is that, by that time, you will be able to say, look, we can prove it's not going to hit Earth, but there is a chance that we cannot eliminate it completely. And that will be the more interesting bit, because then we have to wait until mid-2028, when we can observe it again. We will not let that time pass by without action.",
      "When was the last time an asteroid had similar odds of hitting Earth?",
      "This is only the second time that impact prediction systems have rated any asteroid with an impact probability of more than 1%. The last time was about 20 years ago, with the asteroid Apophis in 2004, which reached a couple of percent for a brief period in time before the uncertainty region could be constrained.",
      "That shows how unusual 1% is, and that means that we, as experts, have to take this seriously. However, with the current probability estimated at around 3%, it's still around 97% likely that nothing bad will happen at all. So, that needs to be kept in mind all the time. This is something that merits attention, but it's not perceived as an imminent threat. It's just, we need to find out more about it.",
      "Have asteroids this size actually crashed into Earth?",
      "We are aware of a recent example in history where this has happened. It was 1908 in Siberia. There was an event where 2,000 square kilometers of forest had been flattened by a big explosion, high up in the atmosphere. And this is very consistent with a body about 50 meters in diameter, plus or minus 10 meters, entering Earth's atmosphere.",
      "The body itself was, then, likely not a solid piece of rock. It was more like, what we call a pile of smaller pieces of rock. And this burst several kilometers above the surface and had this effect, that 2,000 square kilometers of forest was flattened, that seismic waves went out from this and could be detected far away, that people witnessed this event, also from very far away.",
      "We don't know if anyone was hurt in that accident. Nothing is reported. But the size, the footprint of the destruction is comparable to a major urban area, or a big city on Earth. So, this is basically the scenario that we would expect from this.",
      "Another example not recorded in human history was an object believed to have been about 50 meters in diameter, a massive chunk of iron that formed the Barringer meteor crater in Arizona. It's a 1.2-kilometer crater. If you look at this and think about it, if that were to hit in a city, the city would look very, very different afterward.",
      "The estimated size of this asteroid ranges from about 40 to 90 meters. Wouldn't there also be a big difference between the damage caused by something 40 meters wide versus 90 meters?",
      "Absolutely. I mean, the 40 to 90 meters is a standard estimate, because we cannot know at this point in time what the surface brightness is. Current data indicate it's more toward the 40- or 50-meter size. So, luckily, on the smaller size range, which is why I cited these popular examples for this.",
      "But, indeed, size matters for asteroids. Size matters a lot. If we're talking about the doubling of the radius of an asteroid, that means eight times the mass, eight times the energy, and that is a significant difference, of course. While on the lower end of the scale, with about 40 meters, it would be threatening to, let's say, a middle-sized city, on the 90-meter edge, it might be comparable to the biggest urban areas.",
      "Why has the probability of 2024 YR4 hitting Earth increased since it was first discovered?",
      "The good news is, this increase does not mean that the asteroid has become more dangerous. The path of the asteroid is defined by physical laws. It's already clear. It's just our knowledge of where that path would be, in reality, is not perfect yet.",
      "The percentage can be compared to the size of the uncertainty area, compared with the size of the Earth. If you look at the fraction, the size of the Earth \u2014   which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014   is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness.",
      "Since then, the size of the uncertainty region has basically shrunk by half. And the size of Earth, luckily, remains the same. So, that means Earth is now occupying twice the amount of space in the uncertainty region. And it means our estimate for the impact risk has risen from 1% to 3%. It doesn't mean that anything has changed.",
      "Again, 3% is a 97% chance of missing. So what will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further, and the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.",
      "In the case of this being a close flyby to Earth, if it's reasonably close, it's entirely possible that the impact probability will continue to rise a little bit on a modest path. This is still no cause for alarm.",
      "The asteroid has been assigned a Level 3 ranking, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale. How uncommon is that?",
      "It's the first time ever that an object is officially classified as a Level 3 on the Torino scale. The only other object that was ever classified with a level higher than 1 was Apophis. Because of its larger size, Apophis has been classified as a 4 on the Torino scale, which is really just indicating that it's a larger object. [Apophis has an estimated diameter of 350 meters, which is much larger than the asteroid 2024 YR4.]",
      "What else should people know?",
      "Well, the most important thing is, don't panic. Always good advice, but it's definitely applicable advice in this situation. I think this gives us a chance to prove that we, as a planet, can still rise above things on Earth that are between people, between countries, between parts of Earth. That if we are facing a completely outside threat, that we can all come together, join forces and face these kinds of threats together.",
      "This one is a manageable challenge. Even if it were to be headed towards Earth, which is by no means certain, 97% it's clear that it will miss us. So, not much to be afraid of, but a good chance to show that we can stand united on this planet.",

    "summary": "The asteroid 2024 YR4 has a very small chance of striking Earth when its orbit briefly intersects our planet's in December 2032.",
    "story": [
      "An asteroid gaining notoriety for its potential to collide with Earth in 2032\u00a0was estimated Tuesday to have roughly a 3% chance of striking our planet \u2014 the highest probability ever assigned \u2014 before additional analysis Wednesday lowered the chances to about 1.5%, according to NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies.",
      "Risks of the massive space rock \u2014 which falls into the \"city killer\" category \u2014 actually making impact have fluctuated\u00a0since it was first discovered last December. Called 2024 YR4, the near-Earth asteroid initially carried a 1% chance of hitting land when NASA and the European Space Agency first announced its existence last month.",
      "Protocols require the agencies to formally notify the public when the odds of an asteroid strike reach that 1% threshold, which in itself is an extremely rare occurrence.",
      "The highest estimate, by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, suggested\u00a0a 3.1% chance the asteroid will hit Earth on Dec. 22, 2032, during a fleeting window of time in which the rock's orbit around the sun intersects the path of the planet. That would make the odds of a collision still quite small, about 1 in 32.",
      "The European Space Agency's latest probability estimate\u00a0was slightly lower, at 2.8%. Last week, NASA and the ESA agreed the probability of an asteroid strike was closer to 2%.",
      "\"However,\" NASA reported, \"on Wednesday, Feb. 19, new data collected overnight reduced the impact probability to 1.5%.\"",
      "It added, \"NASA expects the impact probability to continue to evolve as new observations of asteroid 2024 YR4 are made over the coming days and weeks.\"",
      "Astronomers and researchers have said the probability could drop to zero as they learn more about the asteroid, which will be closely observed by the James Webb Space Telescope before it disappears from view in April. Much of the risk is based on an area of \"uncertainty\" in outer space, where the asteroid may or may not end up, and rising odds reflect new insights into that area, according to Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's Planetary Defence Office.",
      "\"The size of the Earth \u2014 which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014 is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness,\" Moissl\u00a0told CBS News last week, speaking about how the odds of a collision are determined.",
      "The size of the uncertainty region has shrunk since then, because more is known about it, so Earth, remaining the same size, occupies a greater portion of the region than it did originally. Scientifically, that drives up the probability even though nothing has truly changed, Moissl said. He emphasized that even a 3% chance of hitting Earth corresponds with a 97% chance of missing it, and in all likelihood 2024 YR4 will not pose threats to our world.",
      "\"What will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further,\" he said. \"And the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.\"",
      "Probability of a crash will most likely dip below 1% before April, experts say, as the asteroid's orbit carries it too far from Earth for humans to see it on the ground. After that, 2024 YR4 will not be visible again for four years.",
      "It is possible the probability of a collision continues to rise, moderately, if its route takes it on a \"close flyby\" of Earth. Moissl said \"this is still no cause for alarm,\" although international space organizations are taking the slim risk seriously. The asteroid, at 40 to 90 meters wide, could be capable of destroying a mid-sized city on Earth. If researchers find its actual size to be nearer the top end of that range, it could flatten some of the world's largest metropolitan areas.",

    "story": [
      "Egyptian officials announced Tuesday the discovery of the tomb of King Thutmose II, the last of the lost tombs of the kings of ancient Egypt's Eighteenth Dynasty, which reigned for over two centuries between about 1550 BC and 1292 BC. It's the first royal Egyptian tomb to be discovered since King Tutankhamun's final resting place was found in 1922.",
      "A joint Egyptian-British archaeological mission discovered Thutmose II's tomb in the mount of Thebes area, west of Luxor and the renowned Valley of the Kings. The team and the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, which made the announcement, said evidence was discovered that clearly indicates it was King Thutmose II's tomb during excavations of what had previously been known only as tomb No. C4.",
      "The entrance and main passage into the structure were discovered in 2022, and internal excavations have continued meticulously since then.",
      "Dr. Mohamed Ismail Khaled, Secretary-General of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, said when the mission first found the entrance to the tomb and its main passage almost three years ago, the team believed it could belong to one of the wives of the kings, given its proximity to the tomb of the wives of King Thutmose III and its proximity to the tomb of Queen Hatshepsut, which was prepared for her as a royal wife before she became ruler of the ancient kingdom. She ended up being buried in the Valley of the Kings, due to her ascent to the throne.",
      "As the excavation work and examination of artifacts continued, the mission found new evidence that identified the owner of the mysterious tomb as King Thutmose II, suggesting also that his burial rites were carried out by Queen Hatshepsut, who was his wife and half-sister.",
      "Khaled said parts of alabaster vessels found in the ruins have inscriptions bearing the name of King Thutmose II and identifying him as the \"deceased king,\" along with the name of his wife, Hatshepsut, all of which he said had helped to confirm Thutmose II as the owner of the tomb.",
      "He described the discovery as one of the most important archaeological finds in recent years. The artifacts discovered are important additions to the body of knowledge around the history of the area and the reign of King Thutmose II.",
      "The mummy of King Thutmose II was discovered during the 19th century, not far away at another archaeological site known as the Deir el-Bahari Cachette, to which it was likely moved centuries after being looted by tomb raiders, according to the\u00a0relatively new National Museum\u00a0of Egyptian Civilization. His mummy is now on display, among those of other ancient royals, at the museum.",
      "The tomb is in a poor state of preservation due largely to exposure to floods shortly after Thutmose II's death, according to Mohamed Abdel Badie, Head of the Egyptian Antiquities Sector at the Supreme Council of Antiquities and Head of the Egyptian team that has worked on the dig. Abdel Badie said initial studies also indicate much of the original contents of the tomb were moved to another location after the ancient floods.",
      "He said the teams had discovered mortar in the tomb with remnants of blue inscriptions and yellow stars, and some paragraphs from the book of \"Imydwat,\" which is one of the most important funerary books found in ancient Egyptian tombs, written to help guide the late royals through their underworld journey.",
      "Dr. Piers Litherland, head of the English team at the site, said the tomb is characterized by a simple architectural design typical of those chosen by the successive rulers of Egypt who came after Thutmose II.",
      "Litherland said the mission would continue its survey work and try to determine where the rest of the contents from Thutmose II's tomb were relocated to, and to uncover any further secrets that may have been locked beneath the earth for millennia.",

    "summary": "A clinical trial from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center looked at the effects of a targeted mRNA vaccine on early-stage pancreatic cancer patients.",
    "story": [
      "When a routine scan led to Barbara Brigham's pancreatic cancer\u00a0diagnosis in 2020, all she could think about was how she wanted more time. Her husband had just passed away. She loved her local library job. Her three children were still growing their own families.",
      "She turned to her care team at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to learn about her options. Brigham had first come to the cancer center when she was diagnosed with a small, non-cancerous cyst on her pancreas. Every year, she had a scan to make sure there were no new cysts. It was that annual scan that found the early-stage pancreatic cancer.",
      "Brigham and her youngest son went to Sloan-Kettering the next day to meet with Dr. Vinod Balachandran, a surgical oncologist who specializes in pancreatic cancer. While laying out her options to fight the cancer, he mentioned that he was running a clinical trial that he believed she would be the \"perfect candidate\" for.",
      "The trial would combine standard surgery and chemotherapy treatments \u2014 which are the standard of care for pancreatic cancer \u2014 with a customized mRNA vaccine. Each vaccine would be designed based on the patient's individual tumor. The idea was that the vaccines could hopefully help the body's immune system attack the cancer, Balachandran told CBS News.",
      "\"I looked at my son, and my son said, 'Absolutely.' So we decided to do that,\" Brigham said. \"The prognosis was not good when I was diagnosed. You know you're going to have a limited amount of time. I just wanted to extend that time.\"",
      "Helping an immune system recognize cancer",
      "The inspiration for the clinical trial came from the small handful of long-term pancreatic survivors, Balachandran said. Only about 10% of people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer survive for more than five years.",
      "About a decade ago, Balachandran and other researchers turned their attention to these \"long-term\" survivors. Multiple studies found that the long-term survivors' immune systems generated \"spontaneous immune response\" to the cancer, meaning the immune system could recognize that the cancer was a threat and react accordingly. Typically, it's \"challenging\" to teach the immune system to recognize cancer, said Balachandran, because \"the immune system is hardwired not to recognize our own body.\"",
      "\"This led to this question of, 'If this is what is happening in the best case scenario, could we then replicate the success in other pancreatic cancer patients?' Namely, could we teach other patients' immune systems to recognize their cancers in a very similar way as to what is happening naturally in the long-term survivors?\" Balachandran said.",
      "The phase 1 clinical trial looked at 16 patients with early-stage pancreatic cancer like Brigham's. To be eligible for the trial, a patient's cancer had to only be in the pancreas and be removable with surgery. Those conditions occur in just between 20% and 25% of pancreatic cancer patients, Balachandran said, and mirrored the conditions of most long-term survivors. During surgery, a patient's tumor was removed, then sent to Sloan-Kettering's research partners at the German biotechnology company BioNTech. From the tumor, BioNTech would make the vaccine, which would be given to the patient alongside several weeks of immunotherapy and chemotherapy.",
      "The vaccine targeted mutations created by pancreatic cancer. As cancer cells rapidly divide in the body, they accumulate genetic errors, Balachandran said. Those errors could serve as \"red flags to the immune system,\" he said, so it became a matter of alerting the immune system to those cells and teaching it to recognize them.",
      "Sparking \"strong immune responses\"",
      "Of the 16 patients included in the trial, eight had \"strong immune responses,\" Balachandran said. The difference seemed to hinge on what kind of surgery they had to remove their pancreatic cancer: People who had their spleen removed as part of their treatment did not generate a strong immune response, Balachandran said, likely because of the important role the organ plays in immune function.",
      "Earlier data published by Balachandran showed that of the eight people who had strong immune responses, none of them had their cancer recur 18 months after treatment. On average, people whose early-stage pancreatic cancer is treated with chemotherapy and surgery see their cancer recur in a year or less.",
      "Now, new research published in Nature looked at the same patients 3.2 years after their treatment. The follow-ups found that only two of the eight patients who had a strong immune response saw their cancer return.",
      "Meanwhile, seven of the eight non-responding patients had their cancers return within that 3.2-year window, Balachandran said.",
      "While the data seems promising, Balachandran cautioned that it's \"still hard to attribute causality\" to the vaccine, especially because of the trial's small size.",
      "Dr. Suneel Kamath, a gastrointestinal oncologist at the Cleveland Clinic who was not involved with the trial, pointed out that the survival rate of the patients in the trial is similar to the survival rate of people who have early-stage pancreatic cancer treated with surgery and chemotherapy.",
      "\"This was a nice kind of proof-of-concept study to show that we can make a vaccine for this disease, and it really does actually create an immune response, and an immune response that lasts,\" Kamath said. \"That's a very nice backbone to build off of.\"",
      "Another, larger clinical trial is now underway, Balachandran said. This randomized trial will only focus on early-stage pancreatic cancer patients with intact spleens, to confirm what role that organ plays in the process, he said. It will also help confirm if there is a link between the vaccines and better outcomes for pancreatic cancer patients.",
      "mRNA vaccines as cancer treatment",
      "Many other researchers are focusing on how mRNA vaccines could be used to treat cancer. Such research was underway well before the coronavirus pandemic thrust mRNA vaccination into the spotlight, said Kamath, who is working with the company Moderna on a different mRNA vaccine trial looking at pancreatic and gastric cancer.",
      "Part of what makes mRNA vaccines suitable for cancer treatment is how easily they can be customized, Kamath said. Balachandran said that it took about nine weeks for a vaccine to be made for each patient in the clinical trial. That included international shipping on both sides, he said.",
      "\"The beauty of mRNA vaccines, as we saw with COVID development, is they're very fast to make. It easy to generate. Once you found a new target, it's very quick to make a vaccine for that particular target,\" Kamath explained. \"It's really exciting, because when we talk about curing cancer, it's not really a single monolithic disease. There are probably hundreds of different targets for every cancer type. And so the ability to make vaccines against a lot of those different targets very quickly is really powerful.\"",
      "Part of that research is learning which cancers are better candidates for mRNA vaccines to be used as part of the treatment, Kamath said. Things like melanoma, which causes a lot of mutations in the body, are easier to direct the immune system against. Kidney and lung cancers are other promising options, he said.",
      "Something like pancreatic cancer, which has fewer mutations, is more difficult, but has been the\u00a0subject of previous research. Balachandran said part of his goal in looking at pancreatic cancer was to see if mRNA vaccines could make a difference \"among the most challenging cancers in oncology.\"",
      "\"Hopefully this can provide some important lessons and clues and how we can do this in other cancer types,\" Balachandran said.",
      "\"Such a wondrous thing\"",
      "For Brigham, participating in the clinical trial gave her what she wanted: More time with her family and loved ones \u2014 more than four years after she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. On average, for people whose pancreatic cancer is caught \"before the tumor grows much or spreads,\" survival time is about three to three and a half years, according to Johns Hopkins.",
      "In the past few months, Brigham celebrated several milestones. Her youngest son welcomed his first child \u2014 her eighth grandchild \u2014 in late 2024, and she recently joined her extended family for her brother's 60th wedding anniversary.",
      "Brigham has not had any recurrences since she took part in the trial. The removal of part of her pancreas did make her diabetic, because the organ produces insulin, but she says it's manageable.",
      "\"The trial was such a wondrous thing,\" Brigham said. \"It has just given me such a renewal in my life. Sometimes it's a little difficult, but it's worth it, absolutely worth it.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Feb 2025 10:42:43 -0500",
    "summary": "Human brains contain higher concentrations of microplastics than other organs, according to a new study, and the amount appears to be increasing over time.",
    "story": [
      "Human brains contain higher concentrations of microplastics than other organs, according to a new study, and the amount appears to be increasing over time.",
      "In the study, published in early February in the journal\u00a0Nature Medicine, University of New Mexico Health Sciences researchers found microplastics in human brains have increased 50% over the past 8 years. They also found that people with dementia had up to 10 times as much plastic in their brains as everyone else.",
      "Microplastics are tiny fragments of degraded polymers that are found in the environment, including our air, water and soil, a news release explained. Previous studies have already shown these substances have made their way into the human body.",
      "The lead researcher, toxicologist Matthew Campen, said the rate of accumulation they found mirrors the increasing amounts of plastics waste on the planet. And he said in the news release that their findings should trigger alarm about the potential impact on human health.",
      "\"I have yet to encounter a single human being who says, 'There's a bunch of plastic in my brain and I'm totally cool with that,'\" he said.",
      "The study compared liver, kidney and brain tissue samples from autopsies conducted in 2016 and 2024, and found \"substantially higher concentrations\" in the 2024 brain tissue. The researchers also conducted similar analysis on older and more recent autopsies for people who died with confirmed dementia diagnoses, and found \"far greater\" concentrations.",
      "While it's unclear how particles are actually being transported into the brain, Campen said the size of the micro- and nanoplastics, measuring 200 nanometers or less, are not much larger than viruses and therefore small enough to cross the blood-brain barrier.",
      "In the study, researchers detected 12 different polymers, the most common of which was polyethylene, widely used for packaging and containers, including bottles and cups, the release noted.",
      "Campen suspects most microplastics in the body are ingested through food, particularly meat.",
      "\"The way we irrigate fields with plastic-contaminated water, we postulate that the plastics build up there,\" he said. \"We feed those crops to our livestock. We take the manure and put it back on the field, so there may be a sort of feed-forward biomagnification.\"",
      "The team also found high concentrations of plastic in meat bought at grocery stores.",
      "As for the higher levels found in the brains of dementia patients, the researchers noted the study was not designed to prove whether that was the cause of symptoms \u2014 it may be the reverse, that the disease process allows more accumulation to happen.",
      "\"Atrophy of brain tissue, impaired blood\u2013brain barrier integrity and poor clearance mechanisms are hallmarks of dementia and would be anticipated to increase [micro- and nanoplastic] concentrations,\" they wrote.",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said the research on the health impact of microplastics is still in its infancy, but there are important questions being asked.",
      "\"There are concerns that this could be causing any number of conditions. Could it be increasing the risk of stroke or heart attack? Could it be increasing the risk of cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, infertility?\" she said\u00a0on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "For those looking to reduce exposure to microplastics, Gounder suggests switching from plastic bottles to stainless steel or glass and making some other changes in the kitchen.",
      "\"Do not reheat your food in contact with plastic \u2014 that is really important. So move it to a glass dish or your plate, not in plastic,\" she said \"And then finally switch out your cutting boards. Don't use plastic cutting boards, use either wood or stone.\"",

    "title": "Asteroid's odds of hitting Earth fluctuate as NASA tasked with studying it",
    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 11:02:45 -0500",
    "summary": "Astronomers will use the Webb telescope to closely monitor the size and trajectory of an asteroid that has a slim chance of hitting Earth in 2032.",
    "story": [
      "An asteroid has a small chance of hitting Earth less than eight years from now, and astronomers are enlisting the help of NASA's James Webb Space Telescope to study it. Characterized as a potential \"city-killer,\" the asteroid was first detected in December and its odds of impacting our planet have fluctuated since then, according to NASA and the European Space Agency.",
      "The space rock is formally named 2024 YR4. Scientists say the risk of it making contact with Earth is remote \u2014 with NASA giving it as high as a 3.1% chance before reducing its estimate to 0.28%, and the European agency putting it at 0.16%, down from around 2.8% \u2014 when it eventually reaches this part of the solar system on Dec. 22, 2032. Although the asteroid will most likely pass by without issue, those tasked with monitoring its physical attributes and potential have shifted upward the probability of a crash since 2024 YR4 was initially discovered.",
      "The European Space Agency in January placed the asteroid's odds of hitting Earth at roughly 1%, before NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory estimated the risk was more like 1.6% at the tail end of the month. Officials at both agencies acknowledge the unlikelihood of 2024 YR4 causing problems, with the ESA saying that current risk estimates are probably unnecessarily high because the people studying it are still uncertain about some of the asteroid's key features.",
      "Right now, astronomers estimate the asteroid is between 40 meters and 90 meters wide, which is roughly 130 to 295 feet wide. For reference, an American football field measures 100 yards \u2014 or 300 feet \u2014 long.",
      "\"It is very important that we improve our size estimate for 2024 YR4,\" the ESA said in a statement Monday, which noted \"the hazard represented by a 40 m asteroid is very different from that of a 90 m asteroid.\"",
      "On the slim chance the asteroid does strike Earth in 2032, its impacts would be localized. But 2024 YR4 has nonetheless received a Level 3 rating, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale, which is a fairly rare distinction meant to represent \"a close encounter\" that warrants public and scientific attention.",
      "\"An asteroid this size impacts Earth on average every few thousand years and could cause severe damage to a local region,\" the ESA said\u00a0a previous statement\u00a0about 2024 YR4.",
      "If the asteroid does hit the planet, NASA said its potential impact sites could include areas over the eastern Pacific Ocean, northern South America, the Atlantic Ocean, Africa, the Arabian Sea and South Asia.",
      "CBS News space consultant Bill Harwood said if it landed in a populated area, it would \"be truly catastrophic,\" but the effects would be localized.",
      "\"It wouldn't be something like the rock that killed the dinosaurs,\" Harwood said. \"It wouldn't affect the global climate, but it would certainly be a disaster of every proportion. So we're all hoping that doesn't happen.\"",
      "In order to gain a greater understanding of the asteroid and better prepare for whatever is to come, astronomers will use the Webb Telescope to collect data on its size that could not be observed as accurately without the telescope's technology, the ESA said.",
      "Where scientists are generally limited to observing the asteroid based on the amount of visible light it reflects from the sun, with brighter light typically signaling a larger asteroid, the Webb telescope can calculate its infrared emissions, allowing for more accurate estimates.",
      "Webb will begin studying the asteroid in March, when it appears brightest, and again in May, according to the ESA. 2024 YR4 will disappear from view for a while after that, and astronomers will take time to interpret the telescope's data and determine what it could mean for the asteroid's route before it shows itself again in 2028.",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 10:43:51 -0500",
    "summary": "The head of planetary defense at the European Space Agency discusses 2024 YR4, an asteroid with a small chance of striking Earth eight years from now.",
    "story": [
      "An asteroid capable of flattening a mid-sized city could potentially collide with Earth eight years from now, as its orbit around the sun briefly intersects the path of our planet. Named 2024 YR4, the space rock carries with it very slim odds of striking land \u2014 either on Earth or the moon \u2014 and astronomers recently set the odds of a crash at 0.28%.",
      "International space organizations like NASA are taking the possible threat seriously, however small it might be. Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's Planetary Defence Office, said their attentiveness shouldn't unduly raise public concern. He shared key facts about the asteroid with CBS News during the below conversation, which has been edited for clarity.",
      "When would the asteroid hit Earth?",
      "This asteroid passes us by every four years. Every time we go four times around the sun, it has almost precisely completed one turn. It has just recently had a flyby in December 2024, which means the next flyby is in December 2028, and we know already that this one is no problem.",
      "The critical one is in 2032, on the 22nd of December, somewhere around the middle of the day in Universal Time. That is when the asteroid is passing, really, through a part of the orbit of the Earth. So, it's really going through the path of Earth, so to speak.",
      "And the question is, whether Earth will be there at this point in time, or whether it will have already passed or is still approaching that point. It's the question, where will it pass by? There's an uncertainty region that spans, right now, the entire Earth-Moon system \u2014 which is not to say that we don't know a lot about it. In fact, we know a lot about it.",
      "Now, we're looking at a closing moment in time on the 22nd of December, 2032, and the question is about fractions of a meter per second, which will make all the difference.",
      "There's about a 20-something-minute window in which the Earth can be in the way of this before it's no longer in the path of the asteroid, or the asteroid cannot come in contact with the Earth anymore.",
      "How is the asteroid risk being managed?",
      "Until recently, we did daily measurements with different telescopes. Then, we had to pause a little bit for one or two days because of the full moon, and the object being too close to the full moon, and the moon illuminating the sky too much to see it.",
      "From now on, we will not monitor it daily, but it will be constantly monitored in the best way possible, with ever larger telescopes. And the idea is to measure its path around the sun in ever higher positions, so you will see this uncertainty region shrink, and shrink, and shrink. And we are trying to constrain the uncertainty so much that we can say whether it passes by Earth safely, or whether there is still some chance left in the middle of April.",
      "What happens in April?",
      "We will be so far away from the object that we cannot observe it from Earth anymore. And then, the James Webb Telescope will take measurements. It will actually take one in March, primarily infrared observations that give us more insight about the size of the object, and then one more in May to do additional measurements. The most likely scenario is that, by that time, you will be able to say, look, we can prove it's not going to hit Earth, but there is a chance that we cannot eliminate it completely. And that will be the more interesting bit, because then we have to wait until mid-2028, when we can observe it again. We will not let that time pass by without action.",
      "When was the last time an asteroid had similar odds of hitting Earth?",
      "This is only the second time that impact prediction systems have rated any asteroid with an impact probability of more than 1%. The last time was about 20 years ago, with the asteroid Apophis in 2004, which reached a couple of percent for a brief period in time before the uncertainty region could be constrained.",
      "That shows how unusual 1% is, and that means that we, as experts, have to take this seriously. However, with the current probability estimated at around 3%, it's still around 97% likely that nothing bad will happen at all. So, that needs to be kept in mind all the time. This is something that merits attention, but it's not perceived as an imminent threat. It's just, we need to find out more about it.",
      "Have asteroids this size actually crashed into Earth?",
      "We are aware of a recent example in history where this has happened. It was 1908 in Siberia. There was an event where 2,000 square kilometers of forest had been flattened by a big explosion, high up in the atmosphere. And this is very consistent with a body about 50 meters in diameter, plus or minus 10 meters, entering Earth's atmosphere.",
      "The body itself was, then, likely not a solid piece of rock. It was more like, what we call a pile of smaller pieces of rock. And this burst several kilometers above the surface and had this effect, that 2,000 square kilometers of forest was flattened, that seismic waves went out from this and could be detected far away, that people witnessed this event, also from very far away.",
      "We don't know if anyone was hurt in that accident. Nothing is reported. But the size, the footprint of the destruction is comparable to a major urban area, or a big city on Earth. So, this is basically the scenario that we would expect from this.",
      "Another example not recorded in human history was an object believed to have been about 50 meters in diameter, a massive chunk of iron that formed the Barringer meteor crater in Arizona. It's a 1.2-kilometer crater. If you look at this and think about it, if that were to hit in a city, the city would look very, very different afterward.",
      "The estimated size of this asteroid ranges from about 40 to 90 meters. Wouldn't there also be a big difference between the damage caused by something 40 meters wide versus 90 meters?",
      "Absolutely. I mean, the 40 to 90 meters is a standard estimate, because we cannot know at this point in time what the surface brightness is. Current data indicate it's more toward the 40- or 50-meter size. So, luckily, on the smaller size range, which is why I cited these popular examples for this.",
      "But, indeed, size matters for asteroids. Size matters a lot. If we're talking about the doubling of the radius of an asteroid, that means eight times the mass, eight times the energy, and that is a significant difference, of course. While on the lower end of the scale, with about 40 meters, it would be threatening to, let's say, a middle-sized city, on the 90-meter edge, it might be comparable to the biggest urban areas.",
      "Why has the probability of 2024 YR4 hitting Earth increased since it was first discovered?",
      "The good news is, this increase does not mean that the asteroid has become more dangerous. The path of the asteroid is defined by physical laws. It's already clear. It's just our knowledge of where that path would be, in reality, is not perfect yet.",
      "The percentage can be compared to the size of the uncertainty area, compared with the size of the Earth. If you look at the fraction, the size of the Earth \u2014   which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014   is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness.",
      "Since then, the size of the uncertainty region has basically shrunk by half. And the size of Earth, luckily, remains the same. So, that means Earth is now occupying twice the amount of space in the uncertainty region. And it means our estimate for the impact risk has risen from 1% to 3%. It doesn't mean that anything has changed.",
      "Again, 3% is a 97% chance of missing. So what will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further, and the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.",
      "In the case of this being a close flyby to Earth, if it's reasonably close, it's entirely possible that the impact probability will continue to rise a little bit on a modest path. This is still no cause for alarm.",
      "The asteroid has been assigned a Level 3 ranking, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale. How uncommon is that?",
      "It's the first time ever that an object is officially classified as a Level 3 on the Torino scale. The only other object that was ever classified with a level higher than 1 was Apophis. Because of its larger size, Apophis has been classified as a 4 on the Torino scale, which is really just indicating that it's a larger object. [Apophis has an estimated diameter of 350 meters, which is much larger than the asteroid 2024 YR4.]",
      "What else should people know?",
      "Well, the most important thing is, don't panic. Always good advice, but it's definitely applicable advice in this situation. I think this gives us a chance to prove that we, as a planet, can still rise above things on Earth that are between people, between countries, between parts of Earth. That if we are facing a completely outside threat, that we can all come together, join forces and face these kinds of threats together.",
      "This one is a manageable challenge. Even if it were to be headed towards Earth, which is by no means certain, 97% it's clear that it will miss us. So, not much to be afraid of, but a good chance to show that we can stand united on this planet.",

      "Risks of the massive space rock \u2014 which falls into the \"city killer\" category \u2014 actually making impact have fluctuated\u00a0since it was first discovered last December. Called 2024 YR4, the near-Earth asteroid initially carried a 1% chance of hitting land when NASA and the European Space Agency first announced its existence last month.",
      "Protocols require the agencies to formally notify the public when the odds of an asteroid strike reach that 1% threshold, which in itself is an extremely rare occurrence.",

      "It added, \"NASA expects the impact probability to continue to evolve as new observations of asteroid 2024 YR4 are made over the coming days and weeks.\"",
      "Astronomers and researchers have said the probability could drop to zero as they learn more about the asteroid, which will be closely observed by the James Webb Space Telescope before it disappears from view in April. Much of the risk is based on an area of \"uncertainty\" in outer space, where the asteroid may or may not end up, and rising odds reflect new insights into that area, according to Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's Planetary Defence Office.",
      "\"The size of the Earth \u2014 which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014 is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness,\" Moissl\u00a0told CBS News last week, speaking about how the odds of a collision are determined.",
      "The size of the uncertainty region has shrunk since then, because more is known about it, so Earth, remaining the same size, occupies a greater portion of the region than it did originally. Scientifically, that drives up the probability even though nothing has truly changed, Moissl said. He emphasized that even a 3% chance of hitting Earth corresponds with a 97% chance of missing it, and in all likelihood 2024 YR4 will not pose threats to our world.",
      "\"What will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further,\" he said. \"And the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.\"",
      "Probability of a crash will most likely dip below 1% before April, experts say, as the asteroid's orbit carries it too far from Earth for humans to see it on the ground. After that, 2024 YR4 will not be visible again for four years.",
      "It is possible the probability of a collision continues to rise, moderately, if its route takes it on a \"close flyby\" of Earth. Moissl said \"this is still no cause for alarm,\" although international space organizations are taking the slim risk seriously. The asteroid, at 40 to 90 meters wide, could be capable of destroying a mid-sized city on Earth. If researchers find its actual size to be nearer the top end of that range, it could flatten some of the world's largest metropolitan areas.",

Such an impact, if it occurred, would have the potential for city-level devastation, depending on where it strikes.",
      "CBS News space consultant Bill Harwood said if it landed in a populated area, it would \"be truly catastrophic,\" but the effects would be localized.",
      "\"It wouldn't be something like the rock that killed the dinosaurs,\" Harwood said. \"It wouldn't affect the global climate, but it would certainly be a disaster of every proportion. So we're all hoping that doesn't happen.\"",
      "Scientists aren't panicking yet, but they are watching closely.",
      "\"At this point, it's 'Let's pay a lot of attention, let's get as many assets as we can observing it,'\" Bruce Betts, chief scientist of The Planetary Society, told the AFP news agency.",
      "What we know about 2024 YR4 and its chances of hitting Earth",
      "Dubbed 2024 YR4, the asteroid was first spotted on December 27, 2024, by the El Sauce Observatory in Chile. Based on its brightness, astronomers estimate it is between 130 and 300 feet wide.",
      "\"An asteroid this size impacts Earth on average every few thousand years and could cause severe damage to a local region,\" the European Space Agency said in a statement.",
      "By New Year's Eve, it had landed on the desk of Kelly Fast, acting planetary defense officer at U.S. space agency NASA, as an object of concern.",
      "\"You get observations, they drop off again. This one looked like it had the potential to stick around,\" she told AFP.",
      "The risk assessment kept climbing, and on Jan. 29, the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), a global planetary defense collaboration, issued a memo.",
      "According to the latest calculations from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, there is a\u00a01.5% chance\u00a0of the asteroid striking Earth on Dec. 22, 2032. NASA said it expects the probability \"to continue to evolve\" as scientists gather new observations of the asteroid in the days and weeks ahead.",
      "The asteroid 2024 YR4 is now rated at Level 3 out of 10 on the\u00a0Torino Impact Hazard Scale, which is \"a close encounter\" that warrants attention from astronomers and the public.",
      "If it does hit, possible impact sites include over the eastern Pacific Ocean, northern South America, the Atlantic Ocean, Africa, the Arabian Sea, and South Asia, the IAWN memo states.",
      "2024 YR4 follows a highly elliptical, four-year orbit, swinging through the inner planets before shooting past Mars and out toward Jupiter.",
      "For now, it's zooming away from Earth, and its next close pass will not come until 2028. Scientists will be able to get another look at the asteroid then, Harwood said, and determine its orbit and trajectory.",
      "Betts said, \"The odds are very good that not only will this not hit Earth, but at some point in the next months to few years, that probability will go to zero.\"",
      "A similar scenario unfolded in 2004 with Apophis, an asteroid initially projected to have a 2.7 percent chance of striking Earth in 2029. Further observations ruled out an impact.",
      "\"City killer\" category",
      "The most infamous asteroid impact occurred 66 million years ago, when a six-mile-wide space rock triggered a global winter, wiping out the dinosaurs and 75 percent of all species.",
      "By contrast, 2024 YR4 falls into the \"city killer\" category.",
      "\"If you put it over Paris or London or New York, you basically wipe out the whole city and some of the environs,\" said Betts.",
      "The best modern comparison is the 1908 Tunguska Event, when an asteroid or comet fragment measuring 30-50 meters exploded over Siberia, flattening 80 million trees across 770 square miles.",
      "Like that impactor, 2024 YR4 would be expected to blow up in the sky, rather than leaving a crater on the ground.",
      "\"We can calculate the energy... using the mass and the speed,\" said Andrew Rivkin, a planetary astronomer at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.",
      "For 2024 YR4, the explosion from an airburst would equal around eight megatons of TNT \u2014 more than 500 times the power of the Hiroshima bomb.",
      "If it explodes over the ocean, the impact would be less concerning, unless it happens near a coastline triggering a tsunami.",
      "Time to prepare",
      "The good news, experts stress, is that we have plenty of time to prepare.",
      "Rivkin led the investigation for NASA's 2022 DART mission, which successfully nudged an asteroid off its course using a spacecraft \u2014 a strategy known as a \"kinetic impactor.\"",
      "The target asteroid posed no threat to Earth, making it an ideal test subject.",
      "\"I don't see why it wouldn't work\" again, he said. The bigger question is whether major nations would fund such a mission if their own territory was not under threat.",
      "Other, more experimental ideas exist.",
      "Lasers could vaporize part of the asteroid to create a thrust effect, pushing it off course. A \"gravity tractor,\" a large spacecraft that slowly tugs the asteroid away using its own gravitational pull, has also been theorized.",
      "If all else fails, the long warning time means authorities could evacuate the impact zone.",
      "\"Nobody should be scared about this,\" said Fast. \"We can find these things, make these predictions and have the ability to plan.\"",

      "Delta would be shelling out approximately $2.3 million in total if all 76\u00a0passengers that were on its subsidiary Endeavor Air's CRJ-900 aircraft took its offer, but one Texas man says he deserves more.",
      "In a newly filed lawsuit, the passenger says being \"suspended upside down\" and \"drenched with jet fuel\" caused him \"severe emotional distress and mental anguish.\" He says he also suffered \"significant injuries to his head, neck, back, knees and face.\"",
      "There may be more lawsuits to come due to the\u00a0Montreal Convention, an international treaty that governs how airlines are liable for passenger injuries, baggage damage and cargo loss.",
      "Under the treaty, passengers who are hurt on international flights can be compensated up to $200,000, but it could be more if the airline is found to be negligent. Passengers have two years to file a lawsuit under the treaty.",
      "Twenty-one people were hospitalized following the crash landing\u00a0of the flight that originated at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. On Thursday, Delta CEO Ed Bastian announced all have since been released.",
      "Upon the company's offer of $30,000 for each passenger who was aboard the flight, a spokesperson for Delta Care Team informed passengers that \"this gesture has no strings attached and does not affect rights.\"",
      "On Thursday, Delta also released more information on the flight's captain and first officer amid false online rumors that both had failed training events. The company says both are certified by the Federal Aviation Administration, and the captain has served \"in pilot training and flight safety capacities.\" The first officer, who was hired last year by Endeavor, also has \"the highest-level pilot certification in the U.S.,\" according to the airline.",

      "The cuts amounted to around 100 probationary workers, multiple current and former federal health officials told CBS News, and affected multiple teams around the department, ranging from recently hired directors of SAMHSA's regional offices to staff working on projects related to the 988 hotline for people facing mental health crises, which the agency oversees.",

      "Officials predicted the impact of the cuts, like at many other health agencies that administer large swaths of grants and external contracts, would likely not be immediately felt. Instead, they said the cuts would translate to a long-term erosion of SAMHSA's ability to conduct oversight, a slowdown in grant approvals and bogging down updates to guidance.",
      "Much of the work in some parts of the agency is made up of awarding and tracking taxpayer dollars awarded to drug addiction and mental health treatment programs.",
      "That includes funding for the call centers that make up the 988 hotline, run largely by state and local governments around the country, as well as the nonprofit that administers it.",

      "Employee satisfaction scores began to recover in 2020, reaching a record high of 81.5 by 2023, above the average. The size of the SAMHSA workforce also grew to 633 by 2023.",
      "Most federal health agencies have also faced firings in recent weeks, largely handed down by either termination letters this past weekend from HHSor as a result of severed contracts.",
      "Agencies losing contractors and recently-hired workers include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, and the Administration for Children and Families.",
      "Some agencies initially slated for steep cuts later secured exemptions for many health agency workers, including the Indian Health Service.",
      "It is not clear how many total workers were ultimately cut from HHS.",

      "One health official warned of a repeat from the \"doom loop\" that plagued the agency during the first Trump administration, where most of the highest performing workers fled SAMHSA for jobs in the private sector, feeding a drop in morale.",
      "Some staff remained because they were committed to public service, the official said. But many others remained because they were stuck in their jobs at SAMHSA, either because of personal circumstances or because they were unable to get hired elsewhere.",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 06:00:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Many of the dozens of lawsuits challenging the Trump administration's actions hinge on alleged violations of decades-old federal laws.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Dozens of lawsuits have been filed in the past month challenging executive actions President Trump has taken since the start of his second term in office, and federal courts from coast to coast have started scrutinizing the president's plans.",
      "The challenges are aimed at unwinding many of the president's policies, which they believe are unlawful. They have targeted his plans to\u00a0crack down on illegal immigration,\u00a0shrink the size\u00a0of the federal government and cut\u00a0spending, as well as Mr. Trump's pledge to end what he believes is\u00a0the weaponization of the Justice Department and FBI.",
      "Many of the lawsuits hinge on alleged violations of decades-old federal laws: The Administrative Procedure Act, the Privacy Act and the Impoundment Control Act. The measures prescribe certain procedures and policies that the executive branch must follow when it comes to taking certain actions.",
      "Here is what to know about each of the laws:",
      "Administrative Procedure Act",
      "Lawsuits challenging Mr. Trump's actions on gender ideology, immigration, civil service rules, FBI agents, deferred resignations, USAID cuts, foreign aid pauses and federal assistance freezes all have one thing in common: they allege the Trump administration and senior officials have violated the Administrative Procedure Act.",
      "Enacted by Congress in 1946, the law, known as the APA, established the process that federal agencies must follow when creating new rules and regulations, and how courts review those actions. The law's requirements do not apply to the president.",
      "\"In the late 1940s, at a time when agencies were doing more and more, and agencies often had their own procedures for doing certain things, Congress wanted to largely standardize the procedures that agencies need to go through when they either make or repeal or reform a regulation or when they take specific action through agency adjudication,\" said Adam White, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who focuses on the Supreme Court and the administrative state.",
      "The APA requires agencies to provide the public with notice of a proposed rule and the chance to offer written comment on it. Once the notice-and-comment period is closed, the agency then publishes its final rule in the Federal Register. This must be done at least 30 days before the rule takes effect.",
      "Courts reviewing a challenged agency action typically consider whether an agency's action is \"arbitrary and capricious.\" The standard of review requires an agency to show that it engaged in \"reasoned decisionmaking\" by providing an adequate explanation for its decision, according to the Congressional Research Service. The agency also has to provide \"the essential facts upon which the administrative decision was based.\"",
      "\"To make a rule, an agency under the APA normally has to give reasons for its rule, and arbitrary and capricious review is a consideration of those reasons,\" White said.",
      "Arbitrary and capricious review is deferential to the agency, which will often prevail in cases alleging violations of the APA if their explanation is \"even plausibly reasonable,\" White said.",
      "\"The government usually wins because it's a very deferential standard of review, but every once in a while it loses because it just didn't connect the dots on the policy it was trying to explain,\" he said.",
      "Most of the lawsuits filed against the Trump administration that seek to invalidate its actions allege violations of the APA, and specifically claim the targeted policies are arbitrary and capricious.",
      "In one of the cases that challenges a memo freezing federal assistance, a group of nonprofit organizations argues that the funding pause is arbitrary and capricious \"in multiple respects.\" The suit argues that the directive fails to acknowledge the \"catastrophic practical consequences\" of halting federal assistance and did not articulate why a review of existing grant programs requires they be paused.",
      "But the challengers also allege that OMB does not have the authority to unilaterally freeze federal financial assistance programs government-wide.",
      "The APA has tripped up the last two administrations.",
      "In a decision from June 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that Mr. Trump's rescission of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals immigration program, or DACA, violated the APA. The high court found the rescission was arbitrary and capricious, and said the first Trump administration failed to consider certain issues when it walked back the DACA program, such as the impacts to young people who were enrolled.",
      "Then, in its last term, the Supreme Court blocked a rule from the Environmental Protection Agency under former President Joe Biden that aimed to address the harmful smog that travels from certain states. The court said a group of states that challenged the rule were likely to prevail on their claim that it was arbitrary and capricious, in part because of the EPA's decisionmaking regarding concerns raised during the notice-and-comment period.",
      "Privacy Act",
      "Enacted in 1974, the Privacy Act was passed during the Watergate scandal and at the advent of new technologies like mainframe computer systems that allowed for the storage of millions of Americans' information.",
      "\"It was Congress' effort to control what government may do with the information it collects about American citizens and to provide, to a limited degree, an ability for American citizens to review and respond to that use through lawsuits and more particularly through congressional oversight,\" Paul Rosenzweig, an expert in homeland security and national security, told CBS News.",
      "The law governs the government's collection and use of Americans' information kept by agencies. It lays out how the government must store that information, who can access it and when the government can use the data or disclose it. The Privacy Act also prohibits agencies from disclosing records pertaining to an individual without their written consent, unless it falls under an exception.",
      "These 12 exceptions allow the government to use personal information in certain circumstances without the individual's approval, such as for law enforcement activity, or when the information cannot be tied with a specific person, such as for statistical research. A \"need-to-know\" exception lets an agency disclose Privacy Act records to its officers and employees who need the record to perform their duties, while another allows disclosure when the information is needed for a \"routine use.\"",
      "The Privacy Act gives Americans the right to sue an agency for an alleged violation of the law. A well-known case was brought by Linda Tripp, who was a central figure in the impeachment scandal involving former President Bill Clinton.",
      "Tripp accused the Defense Department of violating the Privacy Act by disclosing personal information to a newspaper. She filed three lawsuits against the agency, and the case eventually ended with a settlement in which the Defense Department agreed to pay Tripp $595,000.",
      "Now, the law has been invoked in several lawsuits stemming from the work of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which was established by Mr. Trump as part of his efforts to shrink the size of government.",
      "In November, the president said Elon Musk would lead DOGE, though the White House has since said he is a special government employee and senior adviser to Mr. Trump, and not the administrator of the task force.",
      "Since DOGE's formal creation on Mr. Trump's first day in office, its employees have been dispatched to more than a dozen federal agencies and started accessing data systems. But their efforts have raised concerns among labor unions and Democratic-led states, which have in turn filed lawsuits seeking to block\u00a0 DOGE's access.",
      "\"This is a novel set of circumstances involving wholesale disclosures and wholesale access,\" Rosenzweig said. He noted that while Privacy Act lawsuits typically center on a specific person's complaint, \"we've never seen that many suits of this scope and scale. We've also never seen an administration purport to authorize access to such a wide range of people who would not normally be given access: special government employees in DOGE.\"",
      "The suits allege that several agencies \u2014 including the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Treasury\u00a0and Education\u00a0\u2014 have violated the Privacy Act by disclosing Americans' personal information to DOGE staff without their consent.",
      "\"People who must share information with the federal government should not be forced to share information with Elon Musk or his 'DOGE.' And federal law says they do not have to,\" lawyers for a group of unions wrote in a lawsuit against Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent challenging DOGE's access to sensitive personal and financial information maintained by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service.",
      "But the Trump administration has argued that DOGE employees are authorized to access the records and are being supervised by the agencies to which they have been detailed. At the Treasury Department, for example, Justice Department lawyers invoked the need-to-know exception and said in a filing that DOGE team members were agency employees who have a need for the records to perform their duties.",
      "\"Need-to-know is based upon need and thus the asserted justification for why they must have access is fair ground for court-based inquiry,\" Rosenzweig said. \"For as long as the Privacy Act has been around, that need has been measured by both the asserted government interests and, to some degree, the sensitivity of the data at issue. It's not canonical, but it is a common-sense assessment that if you really want to know my health records, you better have a damn good reason.\"",
      "The cases are in their early stages, and no judge has ruled definitively on whether the Trump administration has violated the Privacy Act by allowing Musk and DOGE access to agency records without Americans' consent.",
      "Judges have, though, denied preliminary requests to prevent DOGE staff from getting into systems at some agencies. In one decision from U.S. District Judge John Bates, the court found that a group of labor unions was unlikely to succeed on their claims that the Trump administration is violating the Privacy Act by allowing DOGE access to systems at the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "The Impoundment Control Act",
      "Court fights aimed at the Trump administration's 90-day pause on foreign development assistance argue that it is violating the Impoundment Control Act, while federal judges overseeing cases involving the Office of Management and Budget's memo halting federal aid have both cited the law.",
      "Enacted in 1974, the law aimed to reassert Congress' power of the purse by providing the procedures for when a president wants to suspend appropriations that have already been approved by Congress. The law was enacted following attempts by President Richard Nixon's administration to not spend money that had been appropriated by Congress, according to the Government Accountability Office.",
      "The measure allows the president to temporarily withhold or cut approved funds in certain circumstances. But under the law, he must first send a \"special message\" to Congress that details the request to rescind or withhold funds. In the case of rescissions, Congress must then pass legislation cutting the funding.",
      "The administration's attempts to halt foreign aid and federal assistance programs may have been aimed at sparking legal challenges to the Impoundment Control Act, as they have done.",
      "OMB Director Russell Vought said during his confirmation hearing that Mr. Trump believes the impoundment law is unconstitutional.",
      "In decisions temporarily halting the administration's funding freeze while litigation continues, judges have raised the Impoundment Control Act.",
      "U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan\u00a0pointed to the Impoundment Control Act as one example of the legislature prohibiting \"the executive branch from encroaching on Congress's appropriations power.\" U.S. District Judge John McConnell issued a separate ruling in which he found there is \"no evidence that the executive has followed the law by notifying Congress\" to bring about a pause that would be legally allowed.",

      "Members of Elon Musk's private security detail have been deputized by the U.S. Marshals Service, granting them certain rights and protections of federal law enforcement agents, four sources familiar with the move confirmed to CBS News Thursday.",
      "The move comes after several people within Musk's orbit relayed a heightened concern about safety for the tech billionaire, including several death threats in recent weeks.",
      "The Tesla CEO turned Trump adviser referenced that concern while on stage at a conservative gathering outside Washington, D.C., on Thursday.",
      "\"President Bukele from El Salvador, who managed to put in prison like a hundred thousand murderous thugs, and he called me,\" Musk recounted to activists gathered at the Conservative Political Action Conference. \"'I am worried about your security,'\" he said the Central American leader told him. \"I'm like, 'Dude, you are worried about my security?'\"",
      "\"It's not enormous,\" Musk added of his security detail. \"Maybe it should be bigger.\"",
      "Musk was tapped by President Trump to head the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump took office last month Musk's team has gone about slashing thousands of federal positions across numerous agencies. DOGE has also stoked controversy by seeking access to sensitive government data.",
      "In a statement late Thursday, Secret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi referred CBS News to DOGE's communications office.",
      "\"While we are not able to comment on the specifics of our protective operations, Secret Service protocols strictly prohibit private security services from being armed within the Treasury Building, Eisenhower Executive Office Building or the White House,\" Guglielmi said in a statement.",
      "The U.S. Marshals Service routinely deputizes police. During President Trump's inauguration, 4,000 officers from outside of Washington, D.C. \u2014 across 178 different law enforcement and police agencies \u2014 were sworn in and deputized by the U.S. Marshals to assist in protection of the nation's capital.",
      "However, the move to deputize private security officers, who are not sworn law enforcement officials, is considered unorthodox, raising eyebrows among officials familiar with the move.",
      "It was not immediately apparent what authorities Musk's team would be granted, but special deputies are typically permitted to carry weapons on federal grounds and carry out arrests.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House, Justice Department and U.S. Marshals Service for comment. CNN was first to report the news.",
      "It remains unclear why the White House did not issue Musk Secret Service protection. The agency could technically assign a protective detail to anyone with an executive order from Mr. Trump. Along with the president, vice president and first and second families, Secret Service also provides protection to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, among other top White House officials.",
      "The U.S. Marshals are responsible for protecting more than 2,700 sitting judges and approximately 30,300 federal prosecutors and court officials, along with members of the public who visit and work in federal courthouses nationwide.

    "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 21:39:00 -0500",
    "summary": "\"I can tell you this: anyone that has crossed the border between the ports of entry since this administration has taken office has not been released,\" Border Patrol chief Mike Banks told CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Unlawful crossings at the U.S. southern border are down 94% from the same period last year, Border Patrol Chief Mike Banks told CBS News in his first sit-down interview, crediting the Trump administration's government-wide crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Over the past seven days, Banks said, Border Patrol agents have apprehended an average of 285 migrants per day along the entire southern border, compared to roughly 4,800 during the same time last year.",
      "Banks attributed the dramatic drop in illegal immigration to a slew of executive actions taken by President Trump. They include an order that has effectively closed the U.S. asylum system and allowed for summary deportations, as well as the cancellation of Biden administration policies that allowed some migrants to enter the country with the government's permission.",
      "Formerly Texas' border czar, Banks also cited the Trump administration's deployment of additional troops to the southern border and a decision to deputize Texas National Guard soldiers as immigration officers, to help Border Patrol agents in the field.",
      "Taken together, Banks said, the actions have virtually halted releases of migrants into the U.S. interior and sent a strong warning to those thinking about traveling to the American border that they will most likely be deported if they enter the country without permission.",
      "\"The greater the punishment, the larger the deterrent,\" Banks said during an interview at Customs and Border Protection's headquarters in Washington.",
      "Since Mr. Trump took office, Banks added, only two migrants have been released from Border Patrol custody after crossing the southern border unlawfully. He said they were released to assist with criminal prosecutions as witnesses.",
      "\"I can tell you this: anyone that has crossed the border between the ports of entry since this administration has taken office has not been released,\" Banks noted.",
      "One of the Biden-era policies the Trump administration rescinded allowed prospective asylum-seekers in Mexico to use a phone app, known as CBP One, to request a time to enter the U.S. at a legal border entry point.",
      "Asked if asylum is no longer an option for migrants at the U.S. southern border given the policy changes, Banks responded, \"At the border, right, crossing in between the ports of entry, which is what the Border Patrol focuses on? No.\"",
      "\"You do not cross the border illegally and then make an asylum claim,\" he said. \"You can go to the port of entry, or you can go to one of the embassies in your country and make your claim for asylum.\"",
      "While illegal crossings along the border with Mexico have dropped precipitously since Mr. Trump's inauguration, they had been on a downward trend over the past year, since soaring to record highs in late 2023. Officials at the time credited Mexico's increased efforts to interdict migrants, and a Biden administration policy, enacted in June 2024, that restricted asylum, though not as broadly as the current rules.",
      "In fact, in December, the Biden administration's last full month in office, Border Patrol recorded 47,000 migrant apprehensions, down 81% from December 2023, during a record-breaking surge in unlawful crossings, government figures show. That number dipped to just over 29,000 last month.",

In fact, journalists from all over the globe continue to pour into Ukraine, seeking the front lines, finding the story, doing their jobs.",
      "For me, there was a personal element as well. My escape from Ukraine after the bombing had been improbable, all but doomed to fail, yet I'd somehow made it out alive and all the way back to my home in London, to my family. Returning to Ukraine was a chance to retake this most unlikely escape in reverse. To relive the many impossible events that had to happen for me to survive, only this time with a clearer head and a more functional body. A chance to appreciate and be thankful for all the twists of fate and acts of heroism that brought me home.

The Ukrainian doctor was dead set against moving me, afraid that any passage on the country's gutted, bomb-shelled streets might dislodge the shrapnel in my throat and kill me\u2014one of several ways that leaving the hospital might have cost me my life.",
      "Finally, he did agree to let me leave, patched up and hammered together just enough to make the trip feasible. And now, on my unlikely return to see him almost two years later, there he was again, waiting to greet me along with a handful of nurses who'd helped keep me alive.",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 10:21:20 -0500",
    "summary": "Hamas is under pressure from Israel and the U.S. at a crucial time for the Gaza ceasefire as it claims it could have misidentified a hostage's remains.",
    "story": [
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to make Hamas pay \"the full price\" for what he called a \"cruel and wicked violation\" of the tenuous Gaza ceasefire agreement after the Israeli and U.S.-designated terrorist group returned the remains of a Gazan woman instead of an Israeli mother taken hostage with her two young children.",
      "Israeli officials said late Thursday evening that Hamas had handed over the body of an unidentified Gazan woman earlier in the day instead of the remains of Shiri Bibas as expected. In a handover orchestrated under the ceasefire deal that came into effect on Jan. 19, Hamas was supposed to return the bodies on Thursday of Bibas along with her two slain sons, Ariel, 4, and Kfir, who at just nine months old was the youngest of the 251 Israelis seized during the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack.",
      "The children's remains were returned, along with the body of Oded Lifshitz, who was 83, but Netanyahu said that instead of Shiri Bibas' remains, Hamas \"put the body of a Gazan woman in a coffin.\"",
      "\"May the sacred memory of Oded Lifshitz and Ariel and Kfir Bibas be etched in the heart of the nation forever,\" he said. \"May God avenge their blood. And so will we.\"",
      "Hamas has claimed since November 2023 that Shiri Bibas, her children and Lifshitz were all killed in Israeli bombing in Gaza, along with some militants who were holding them captive. Yarden Bibas, the children's father, was not with his family on Oct. 7, but was taken separately. He was\u00a0released earlier this month\u00a0after 16 months in captivity.",
      "In a statement on Friday, Hamas indicated the handover of a different body the previous day could have been a mistake, claiming there was a \"possibility of an error or overlap in the bodies, which may have resulted from the occupation targeting and bombing the place where the family was located.\"",
      "The statement said Hamas would look at \"these claims with complete seriousness, and we will announce the results clearly,\" and it added that the group wished to, \"confirm our seriousness and full commitment to all our obligations, and we have proven this through our behavior during the past days. We have no interest in not committing [to the ceasefire terms] or keeping any bodies with us.\"",
      "Hamas called on Israel to return the remains of the unidentified Gazan woman to the decimated Palestinian territory.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces issued a terse statement Friday rejecting Hamas' claim that the Bibas children were killed in an IDF strike.",
      "\"Ariel and Kfir Bibas were murdered by terrorists in cold blood,\" the IDF alleged. \"The terrorists did not shoot the two young boys \u2014 they killed them with their bare hands. Afterwards, they committed horrific acts to cover up these atrocities. This assessment is based on both forensic findings from the identification process, and intelligence that supports the findings.\"",
      "The incident, along with previous hostage handovers that have seen large crowds of well-armed Hamas terrorists and civilians crowding around freed Israelis and, on Thursday for instance, a massive propaganda poster behind the coffins holding the hostages' remains depicting Netanyahu as a bloody vampire, have drawn fury from Israeli officials and the Trump administration.",
      "The handovers have also been increasingly criticized by the international community \u2014 including by the Red Cross, which has facilitated the physical transfer of hostages, both living and dead, inside Gaza. In a Friday statement to Reuters, the global organization said it was \"concerned and unsatisfied\" with the way the releases have played out.",
      "\"The ICRC does not participate in sorting, screening, or examining the deceased \u2014 this is the responsibility of the parties to the conflict,\" the International Committee of the Red Cross said, according to Reuters, adding concern that the Thursday transfer of remains had not been carried out in a private and dignified manner.",
      "United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres also issued a statement condemning \"the parading of bodies and displaying of the coffins of the deceased Israeli hostages by Hamas on Thursday. Under international law, any handover of the remains of the deceased must comply with the prohibition of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, ensuring respect for the dignity of the deceased and their families.\"",
      "Regardless of any intentionality on the part of Hamas, that handover of the wrong body and Israel's stern reaction to it left the already-fragile ceasefire in an even more perilous position Friday, just a week before the first six-week phase of the deal is set to end. A total of 33 living Israeli hostages were to be handed over during the first phase under the terms of the agreement, the final six of whom should be released Saturday.",
      "There was no immediate indication from Israel or Hamas that Saturday's planned release, and the corresponding release by Israel of scores more Palestinian prisoners from its jails, would not go ahead.",
      "Talks to hammer out the terms of the second phase, due to begin at the start of March, should have begun a couple weeks ago, but there's been no indication from Israel, Hamas, or the U.S. and its regional partners Qatar and Egypt, which helped negotiate the ceasefire, of what progress may or may not have been made.",
      "Arab nations coalesce to offer an alternative to Trump's Gaza plan",
      "Arab nations coalesce to offer an alternative to Trump's Gaza plan",
      "Netanyahu has been under constant pressure from some far-right members of his cabinet to end the ceasefire and resume Israel's military operation in Gaza, and Netanyahu himself has stressed that the goal of the war has always been to disarm, if not destroy Hamas. In that objective, Israel's government appears to have the firm backing of the Trump administration.",
      "In an interview on Thursday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio called Hamas, \"evil, terrible people, and the idea that they would ever be allowed to continue to have arms and to be militarized and control territory, anywhere in the world, is unfathomable.\"",
      "\"As long as Hamas is in Gaza, there will never be peace in Gaza,\" he said, \"because they are going to go back to attacking Israel, and Israel is going to have to respond.\"",
      "The families of the dozens of Israeli hostages still held in Gaza have been far less eager to see a resumption of fighting, however. In a statement cited Friday by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Kibbutz Nir Oz, the community from which the Bibas children and their mother were abducted, said it stood by the \"clear demands of the Bibas family at this time: release, not revenge.\"",
      "\"The state must bring Shiri back by all means, in a way that will not hinder the continuation of the deal and the immediate release of all hostages,\" the kibbutz community was quoted as saying.",
      "\"Hamas is a murderous organization that does not hesitate to kill infants and toddlers. Our expectations are from the Israeli government, whose actions must be immediate to free all 70 hostages from the hands of the murderers and end the ongoing failure.\"",
      "The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents the families of all the Israelis taken captive in the Oct. 7 terrorist attack, said in a separate statement that it was \"horrified and devastated by the news\" that Shiri Bibas' remains were not returned.",
      "\"To the world, we say: Do not look away. In Hamas' hell in Gaza, 70 more of our children, brothers, sisters, and parents remain in captivity, enduring unimaginable terror.

    "summary": "Hamas released four bodies, including the youngest captive taken in the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack, Kfir Bibas, and his brother.",
    "story": [
      "Khan Younis, Gaza Strip \u2014\u00a0Hamas released four bodies on Thursday, which Israeli officials said included two young children who have long been feared dead and had come to embody the nation's agony following\u00a0the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas on Israel. Their mother was said to have been returned with them, but Israeli forces said hours later that another person's remains were released instead.",
      "The remains were said to be those of Shiri Bibas and her two children, Ariel and Kfir, as well as Oded Lifshitz, who was 83 when he was abducted. Kfir, who was 9 months old when he was taken, was the youngest of all the captives. Hamas has said all four were killed along with their guards in Israeli airstrikes.",
      "In a social media post early Friday morning, the Israel Defense Forces said that Ariel and Kfir's remains were returned, but not their mother's. \"During the identification process, it was determined that the additional body received is not that of Shiri Bibas, and no match was found for any other hostage. This is an anonymous, unidentified body,\" the IDF said.",
      "In a statement released Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the handover of the wrong remains as a \"cruel and malicious violation\" of the ceasefire agreement that has halted fighting in the Gaza Strip and said Hamas would \"pay the full price\" for the action. He said the fourth body was that of a Gazan woman.",
      "The militants displayed four black caskets Thursday on a stage surrounded by banners, including a large one depicting Israeli Netanyahu as a vampire, as Red Cross vehicles arrived at the scene in the Gaza Strip.",
      "The fighters then carried the caskets over to Red Cross vehicles, where staffers in red vests covered them in white sheets before placing them inside. Each casket had a picture fixed to the front bearing the image of the slain hostage whose remains were purportedly inside.",
      "The Red Cross convoy headed back to Israel, where authorities were carrying out a formal identification process on the remains using DNA, which was expected to take up to two days. A statement from the Lifshitz family, however, shared by the Hostages Families Forum, said they had \"received with deep sorrow the official and bitter news confirming the identification of our beloved Oded's body.\"",
      "\"We had hoped and prayed so much for a different outcome. Now we can mourn the husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather who has been missing from us since October 7,\" the family said, adding that their \"healing process will begin now and will not end until the last hostage is returned.\"",
      "Thousands of people, including large numbers of masked and armed fighters from Hamas and other factions, gathered at the handover site on the outskirts of the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis.",
      "\"Every home in Israel bows its head today. We bow our heads for the heavy loss of our four hostages,\" Netanyahu said in a statement. \"The four coffins of our loved ones oblige us more than ever to promise, to swear, that what happened on October 7 will never happen again.\"",
      "Israeli channels did not broadcast the handover. In Hostage Square in Tel Aviv, where Israelis have gathered to watch the release of living hostages, a large screen showed a compilation of photos and videos of Lifshitz and the Bibas family, including a chuckling baby Kfir and the family dressed up in Batman costumes. Yarden Bibas, the children's father, was not with his family on Oct. 7, but was taken separately. He was released earlier this month after 16 months in captivity.",
      "Dozens of residents of Kibbutz Nir Oz, from which the four slain hostages released on Thursday were kidnapped, gathered to wave Israeli flags outside of their temporary home an hour north of the ravaged kibbutz.",
      "Israelis have celebrated the return of 24 living hostages in recent weeks under a tenuous ceasefire that paused over 15 months of war. But the handover on Thursday will provide a grim reminder of those who died in captivity as the talks leading up to the truce dragged on for over a year.",
      "It could also provide impetus for negotiations on the second stage of the ceasefire that have hardly begun. The first phase is set to end at the beginning of March.",
      "Kfir Bibas was just 9 months old, a red-headed infant with a toothless smile, when militants stormed into the family's home on Oct. 7, 2023. His brother Ariel was 4. Video shot that day showed a terrified Shiri swaddling the two boys as militants led them into Gaza.",
      "Relatives in Israel have clung to hope, marking Kfir's first and second birthdays and his brother's fifth. The Bibas family said in a statement Wednesday that it would wait for \"identification procedures\" before acknowledging that their loved ones were dead.",
      "Supporters throughout Israel have worn orange in solidarity with the family \u2014 a reference to two boys' red hair \u2014 and a popular children's song was written in their honor.",
      "Like the Bibas family, Oded Lifshitz was abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz, along with his wife Yocheved, who was freed during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. Oded was a journalist who campaigned for the recognition of Palestinian rights and peace between Arabs and Jews.",
      "Hamas-led militants abducted 251 hostages, including some 30 children, in the Oct. 7 terrorist attack, in which they also killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians.",
      "More than half the hostages, and most of the women and children, have been released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israeli forces have rescued eight and have recovered dozens of bodies of people killed in the initial attack or who died in captivity.",
      "Hamas is set to free six living hostages on Saturday in exchange for hundreds more Palestinian prisoners, and says it will release four more bodies next week, completing the ceasefire's first phase. That will leave the militants with some 60 hostages, all men, around half of whom are believed to be dead.",
      "Hamas has said it won't release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal. Netanyahu, with the full backing of the Trump administration, says he is committed to destroying Hamas' military and governing capacities and returning all the hostages, goals widely seen as mutually exclusive.",
      "Mr. Trump's proposal to remove some 2 million Palestinians from Gaza so the U.S. can own and rebuild it, which has been welcomed by Netanyahu but universally rejected by Palestinians and Arab countries, has thrown the ceasefire into further doubt.",
      "Hamas could be reluctant to free more hostages if it believes the war will resume with the goal of annihilating the group or forcibly transferring Gaza's population.",
      "Israel's military offensive killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its records. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence.",
      "The offensive destroyed vast areas of Gaza, reducing entire neighborhoods to fields of rubble and bombed-out buildings. At its height, the war displaced 90% of Gaza's population. Many have returned to their homes to find nothing left and no way of rebuilding.",

    "summary": "Egypt is promising a viable alternative to Trump's controversial Gaza plan with broad support that would keep Palestinians \"in their homeland.\"",
    "story": [
      "Cairo \u2014 Optimism in the Arab world that President Trump might bring a permanent end to the war in the Gaza Strip and, with it, stability to the tumultuous Middle East, soared as he was given a lion's share of the credit for ushering in the current ceasefire. But that hope has faded quickly since Mr. Trump suggested a plan to force Gaza's entire population out and to \"take over\" the decimated Palestinian territory to develop it as a vacation destination.",
      "Mr. Trump said the roughly 2.3 million Palestinians should be moved to Egypt and Jordan, apparently to make way for investors to move in and \"just clean out the whole thing.\"",
      "The president's suggestion sent a shockwave of confusion and anger sweeping across the Arab nations that surround Israel, and beyond.",
      "\"In Egypt, we have warned since the beginning of the crisis that what was happening was an attempt to render the Gaza Strip uninhabitable, paving the way for the displacement of the Palestinians,\" Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi said several days after Mr. Trump first suggested his plan. \"I state it unequivocally: The displacement of the Palestinian people from their place is an injustice. We cannot condone or be a part of the unjust displacement of Palestinians.\"",
      "Meeting earlier this month in Washington with Mr. Trump, Jordan's King Abdullah II, asked about the president's proposal, said Egypt was working on an alternative plan with other Arab countries.",
      "\"We will be in Saudi Arabia to discuss how we can work with the president and with the United States,\" Abdullah told reporters. \"Let's wait until the Egyptians can come and present it to the [U.S.] president, and not get ahead of ourselves.\"",
      "On Friday, a meeting to discuss that alternative proposal for Gaza's future will take place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. While Mr. Trump has continued to insist that Egypt and Jordan will rehome the Palestinians from Gaza, his administration has also said it remains open to other suggestions.",
      "\"Right now, the only one who's stood up and said, 'I'm willing to help do it,' is Donald Trump,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in an interview last week. \"All these other leaders, they're going to have to step up. If they've got a better idea, then now is the time.\"",
      "An Egyptian plan for Gaza takes shape",
      "\"Egypt is putting together a comprehensive, phased plan that seeks to rehabilitate Gaza,\" Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Tamim Khallaf told CBS News on Wednesday. \"The plan will span several years that would entail sequential phases of removing rubble and reconstruction.\"",
      "\"It will be conducted in a way to ensure that Palestinians in Gaza remain in their homeland,\" said Khallaf, adding that the plan \"will be operationally both realistic and workable.\"",
      "Funding for the herculean task of rebuilding Gaza will be a vital component of any plan for after the war. As of January, the U.N. and World Bank estimated that 72% of the territory's housing, 84% of its health facilities and 92% of its primary roads had been damaged or totally destroyed, and the bombing continued for another month from that point.",
      "Khallaf told CBS News that Egypt was \"in talks with the United Nations, through the U.N. Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator for Gaza, to jointly organize an international conference in Egypt for early recovery and reconstruction in Gaza, which will be essential to provide emergency relief activities and secure necessary funds to see the plan come to fruition and restore life back to Gaza.\"",
      "The plan being discussed in Riyadh is expected to be officially endorsed at an Arab summit scheduled for March 4 in Cairo. The plan is also expected to garner backing from further afield. Many U.S. allies in Europe have firmly rejected Mr. Trump's call to relocate Gaza's population, but there has been no other offer of an alternative.",
      "Speaking Wednesday next to Spain's prime minister after they met in Madrid, el-Sissi said the leaders had \"emphasized the importance of the international community's support and adoption of the reconstruction plan for the Gaza Strip, that does not involve the forcible displacement of the Palestinian people \u2014 again, without the displacement of the Palestinian people \u2014 from their land they so dearly cherish, and their ancestral homeland they will never abandon, and that ensures the immediate initiation of relief and early recovery operations.\"",
      "Egypt has grappled for a post-war solution for Gaza that would be acceptable to all parties since the conflict was sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack on Israel.",
      "It's unclear how much support a unified Arab stance, even with broader international support, might garner from Mr. Trump or his close ally, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Without their backing, it's difficult to envision any proposal coming to fruition.",
      "\"Generational healing between Palestinians and Israelis is possible but can only transpire when Palestinians live in an independent state of their own,\" Khallaf told CBS News. \"We look forward to working with the U.S. administration in achieving the long-awaited peace in the region.\"",

The firearms are then shipped across the southwest border through a chain of brokers and couriers.",

      "Spain's High Court convicted Rubiales of assault for the forced kiss and fined him 10,800 euros ($11,300).",

      "\"He refuses to have Elections, is very low in Ukrainian Polls, and the only thing he was good at was playing Biden 'like a fiddle,'\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left.\"",
      "Zelenskyy was elected president of Ukraine in 2019 with 73% of the vote. The country has delayed elections that were scheduled for early 2024 because of the war with Russia. One recent public opinion poll in Ukraine showed 57% of Ukrainians said they trust Zelenskyy, compared to 37% who said they don't.",
      "A senior administration official told CBS News that Mr. Trump's attack on Zelenskyy was a direct response to the Ukrainian president saying that Mr. Trump appeared to be operating in a Russian-created \"disinformation space.\"",
      "\"We are seeing a lot of disinformation and that is coming from Russia,\" Zelenskyy said Wednesday. \"Unfortunately, President Trump, with all due respect\u2026 is living in this disinformation space.\"",
      "Zelenskyy's comment came a day after Mr. Trump blamed Ukraine for starting the war with Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, falsely claiming Ukraine was run by \"neo-Nazis\" who posed a threat to Russia and its neighbors.",
      "U.S. and Russian officials met in Saudi Arabia earlier this week about ending the war. Ukrainian officials were not included in the meeting.",
      "On Capitol Hill, several Republican senators disagreed with Mr. Trump's criticism of Zelenskyy. Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said she would \"never refer to President Zelenskyy as a dictator.\" Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said Zelenskyy is not to blame for Russia's invasion \"in any way.\"",
      "\"To equate anybody or to suggest that anyone in Ukraine has responsibility for this war forgets the fact that Putin lied,\" Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said. \"He has lied every step of the way, and I believe any resolution in Ukraine that makes him feel like he won or just pushed to a tie is a bad idea.\"",
      "Mike Pence, who served as Mr. Trump's vice president during his first term, also spoke out against the president's comments, sharing a Fox News article from Feb. 24, 2022, with the headline \"Russia Invades Ukraine in Largest European Attack Since WWII.\"",

Her underwhelming amended complaint is filled with unsubstantial hearsay of unnamed persons who are clearly no longer willing to come forward or publicly support her claims.\"",

      "Lively and Reynolds were given a deadline of Feb. 18 to file an amended complaint against Baldoni by Judge Lewis Liman.",
      "\"This makes even more clear that the public appearance was not a good idea,\" Dowlatshahi said. \"The attorneys included the phrase 'behind closed doors' in an attempt to explain the appearances, but typically, you don't want to be in a position to have to qualify and contextualize your client\u2019s actions \u2013 you simply advise them not to do certain things.\"",

      "However, Lively's mention of how the case involving sexual harassment has affected her family and \"traumatized\" her children could indicate that the lawsuit \"must be worth fighting for,\" Ryan McCormick, a Reputation Management Expert & Managing Partner at Goldman McCormick PR, explained to Fox News Digital.",
      "Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni starred together in \"It Ends With Us.\" (Getty Images)",
      "\"One can say it's an attempt to maximize\u00a0public empathy but, at the same time, if these allegations are proven true, it's Lively just expressing how she really feels,\" the branding expert said. \"Sometimes we think that celebrities have a magical, wonderful life, but they're a lot like the average person \u2013 they have families to take care of. People like Reynolds and Lively are under scrutiny 24-7 and the emotional toll from legal situations like this can hit a lot harder because everything is public knowledge. Lively admitting how devastating this has been for her family and yet, upping the ante in the battle, indicates that it must be worth fighting for.\"",
      "McCormick noted Lively and Reynolds \"have to be seen and stay relevant.\" \"For the negative reaction surrounding their SNL50 joke, I didn't think it was that bad. Self-deprecating humor can go a long way.\"",

      "\"Also, for the power couple to show vulnerability\u00a0by admitting how deep their anguish is, is actually positive for their image,\" McCormick explained. \"When this lawsuit first kicked off in such a public manner, I was surprised. One may have assumed it was due to bruised egos. However, now because Blake Lively has amended\u00a0her complaint to include other women who alleged wrongdoing by Justin Baldoni, I think it's an indication that the matter is more serious than originally perceived.\"",

      "Days before filing the amended complaint, Lively attended the 50th celebration of \"Saturday Night Live\" on Feb. 16 with her husband.",
      "Reynolds seemingly poked fun at his and his wife's legal situation and the surrounding media frenzy as Tina Fey and Amy Poehler took the stage. The \"SNL\" alums spotted Reynolds in the crowd and asked, \"How's it going?\"",
      "Reynolds quickly responded, \"Great, why? What have you heard?\"",

      "Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds made their first red carpet appearance in months at \"SNL50.\" (NBC)",
      "Legal experts agreed that Reynolds' joke at \"SNL50\" was mostly harmless.",
      "\"Reynolds does not have an analogous emotional distress claim against Baldoni, so his public appearances are not as harmful,\" Dowlatshahi told Fox News Digital. \"Lively being out in public and accepting invites to various events shows that she\u2019s not as emotionally distressed and that the impact to her career in terms of earnings and job prospects isn\u2019t necessarily as severe, as warranting hundreds of millions of dollars. Although Lively didn't say anything publicly, her presence and participation at the \u2018SNL\u2019 event potentially mitigates her emotional distress damages for her sexual harassment claim.\"",
      "\"So the more events she and Reynolds attend, the weaker her claims may become, which might ultimately help Baldoni,\" Dowlatshahi added.",
      "Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, pictured here in 2016, have four children together. (Tommaso Boddi/WireImage)",
      "Another expert noted Reynolds' statements on both \"SNL50\" and \"The Voice\" were \"somewhat benign\" and likely wouldn't \"make a difference\" in the courtroom.",
      "\"They didn\u2019t amount to admissions, and really wouldn\u2019t have much of an effect on the merits of the case or damages,\" entertainment and media law attorney Tre Lovell said. However, the appearances could be \"very damaging\" in the court of public opinion.",
      "\"Clearly, both Lively and Reynolds\u2019 images have taken a hit from these lawsuits, injecting a lot of negativity and animus against them into the public arena. They need to be out there rehabilitating themselves and their persona,\" the lawyer at The Lovell Firm explained. \"They do this by being friendly and likable before the public. In other words, showing the personalities that got them favor from their fans in the first place. However, at the same time, they need to stay completely away from the lawsuit and never mock, demean, make fun of or comment on any of the facts. All references to the lawsuit should be made through their attorneys, and as far as they are concerned, they take the legal proceedings very seriously and intend on proving their case in court. Any efforts to diminish or ridicule the legal proceedings could have a profoundly negative impact on both Lively and Reynolds in the publicity fight.\"",

      "In response, Baldoni's attorney, Bryan Freedman, told Fox News Digital the claim is \"hearsay.\"",

Her underwhelming amended complaint is filled with unsubstantial hearsay of unnamed persons who are clearly no longer willing to come forward or publicly support her claims.\"",
      "\"Since documents do not lie and people do, the upcoming depositions of those who initially supported Ms. Lively\u2019s false claims and those who are witnesses to her own behavior will be enlightening,\" Freedman concluded. \"What is truly uncomfortable here is Ms. Lively\u2019s lack of actual evidence.\"",

      "\"That evidence includes previously undisclosed communications involving Ms. Lively, representatives of Sony and Wayfarer, and numerous other witnesses,\" the statement continued. \"The complaint includes significant contemporaneous evidence that Ms. Lively was not alone in raising allegations of on-set misconduct more than a year before the Film was edited; as well as evidence detailing the threats, harassment, and intimidation of not just Ms. Lively, but numerous innocent bystanders that have followed defendants\u2019 retaliatory campaign.\"",
      "In response, Baldoni's attorney, Bryan Freedman, told Fox News Digital the claim is \"heresay.\"",
      "\"Our clients have been transparent in providing receipts, real-time documents and video showing a completely different story than what has been manipulated and cherry-picked to the media,\" Freedman said in a statement. \"Our clients have taken this matter and these issues very seriously, notwithstanding the jokes made publicly by the plaintiff and her husband. Her underwhelming amended complaint is filled with unsubstantial hearsay of unnamed persons who are clearly no longer willing to come forward or publicly support her claims.\"",
      "\"Since documents do not lie and people do, the upcoming depositions of those who initially supported Ms. Lively\u2019s false claims and those who are witnesses to her own behavior will be enlightening,\" Freedman concluded. \"What is truly uncomfortable here is Ms. Lively\u2019s lack of actual evidence.\"",

      "\"Her underwhelming amended complaint is filled with unsubstantial hearsay of unnamed persons who are clearly no longer willing to come forward or publicly support her claims.\"",
      "Lively's amended complaint also includes a new claim for defamation, \"based on the repeated false statements the defendants have made about Ms. Lively.\"",
      "\"Over the next several weeks, we will move to dismiss the utterly meritless lawsuits brought against Ms. Lively and Mr. [Ryan] Reynolds, and we will move full speed ahead with discovery that we expect will reveal shocking details about the depth to which the Defendants have sunk in their unending efforts to \u2018bury,' \u2018ruin,\u2019 and \u2018destroy\u2019 Ms. Lively and her family,\" the statement from Lively's legal team concluded.",
      "According to a spokesperson for Lively, the amended complaint details how other women on set experienced a \"fear\" of coming forward with their claims out of concern for the public's reaction.",

      "\"The amended complaint details the corroboration that backs up Blake\u2019s original sexual harassment and retaliation concerns, including that (1) Justin Baldoni and Jamey Heath made other women uncomfortable on set; and (2) other women confided in Blake about their discomfort and fear of coming forward, and their concern about the current public vitriol,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "\"The new filing also details that a Sony representative spoke to Baldoni about the concerns, and that Baldoni responded, including by reaching out to one of the other women who complained to reassure her that he heard her and promised to make adjustments. The complaint alleges that Mr. Baldoni didn\u2019t follow through on that promise, but did make the adjustment to hire a crisis management team, digital manipulation experts, litigators, and used those helpers to plan and execute the smear campaign described in her original lawsuit. In doing so, Blake has alleged, Baldoni hoped that if she or any other woman made their grievances public, nobody would believe them.\"",

      "\"Witnesses have been threatened not just with lawsuits, but physical violence, including threats against witnesses\u2019 families,\" a spokesperson for Lively told Fox News Digital. \"This culture of fear, intimidation, harassment, and threats is the predictable result of an incessant digital campaign to turn social media sentiment as dark and negative as is humanly possible.\"",
      "\"The Wayfarer defendants don\u2019t seem to care about how many people they \u2018bury\u2019 or \u2018destroy\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s all apparently in service of protecting Wayfarer\u2019s image. It is because of the continued harassment and targeting of innocent bystanders that Ms Lively\u2019s Amended Complaint does not refer to certain victim-witnesses by name, nor does it quote directly from their texts or include screen shots. Importantly, however, these victim-witnesses have given Ms. Lively permission to share their communications in the Amended Complaint as they are laid out, and they will testify and produce documents in the discovery process.\"",
      "Additionally, according to the complaint, the \"investigation\" conducted by Wayfarer Studios into itself was insufficient for multiple reasons.",
      "\"Two years after Ms. Lively and others made sexual harassment complaints against Baldoni and Heath, Wayfarer finally launched an \u2018investigation\u2019 into itself. What they have put together is a farce, not an investigation,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "\"The truth is they chose not to investigate any of the claims of sexual harassment at the time they first surfaced. Instead, as alleged in the lawsuit, Wayfarer and its management chose to expend their efforts and resources devising a plan to retaliate and discredit those who dared to make the accusations in the first place.\"",

      "During Freedman's appearance on \"Hot Mics with Billy Bush\" on Monday, prior to Lively's amended filing, Bush mentioned that people on TikTok were circulating alleged HR complaints against Baldoni from two other women on the cast. Bush asked Freedman if it was something he was looking into.",
      "\"I think we're looking into everything,\" Freedman said. He went on to ask what the dates of the HR complaints were, but Bush told him that information was redacted, and also noted the complaints were allegedly sent to Sony's HR department.",
      "\"I'm not really sure why the dates are redacted\u2026 I understand why people could be redacted, I believe in certain privacy rights, but I'm not really clear on why dates would be redacted,\" Freedman said. \"So it'll be interesting to see what the dates are.\"",
      "Freedman and Bush also noted that Sony had previously said they received no complaints, as reported in Variety.",

      "After Lively's lawsuit was filed against Baldoni and film producer Jamey Heath in December, Baldoni filed a $400 million lawsuit against Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, accusing them of civil extortion and defamation.",
      "Baldoni then released unedited footage from the set of \"It Ends with Us\" that he claims refutes Lively's previous accusations of sexual harassment. However, the actress' legal team claims the footage bolsters Lively's allegations.",
      "After the release, Lively's legal team demanded a gag order be issued against Baldoni's lawyer.",
      "Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds made their first red carpet appearance in months at SNL50. (NBC)",
      "On Jan. 23, Baldoni's lawyers filed a response, calling Lively's gag order attempt an \"intimidation tactic\" and \"tactical gamesmanship.\"",
      "Baldoni and Lively's legal teams were in federal court recently, and a judge ordered that they follow New York's Rules of Professional Conduct, which limit speaking to the press.",
      "Neither party will be permitted to make statements to the press that have a \"substantial likelihood\" of prejudicing a jury. However, the legal teams will be allowed to defend their clients in the media against publicity not created by either side in the dispute.",
      "Since the legal drama unraveled, Lively and Reynolds made their first public appearance at \"Saturday Night Live's\" 50th anniversary show over the weekend, where Reynolds appeared to make a joke referencing the legal drama.",
      "Baldoni's lawyer questioned Reynolds' decision during his appearance on \"Hot Mics with Billy Bush.\"",
      "\"I\u2019m unaware of anybody, frankly, whose wife has been sexually harassed and has made jokes about that type of situation,\" Freedman said. \"I can\u2019t think of anyone who\u2019s done anything like that. So it surprised me.\"",

    "summary": "A new debate has emerged about whether airlines should charge passengers based on their weight to help reduce fuel consumption and lower emissions.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News host Laura Ingraham asks why there are so many plane crashes on 'The Ingraham Angle.'",
      "In 2008, American Airlines became the first major U.S. carrier to charge for checked bags, introducing a $15 fee as part of a cost-cutting measure. Since then, other airlines have adopted similar fees, with prices steadily increasing over the years.

      "In 2013, Samoa Air introduced a \"fat tax\" where passengers paid based on their weight, but it didn't catch on widely.",
      "In February 2024, Finnair expanded its weight data collection initiative. The airline is now asking passengers to voluntarily weigh themselves along with their carry-on luggage at Helsinki Airport. This data collection will take place over three months, covering both short Schengen-area flights and longer-haul routes.",
      "Finnair's approach is designed to be anonymous, with only age, gender and travel class recorded alongside the weight data. The collected information will be used to update the airline's aircraft balance and loading calculations for the period from 2025 to 2030.",
      "These developments indicate a growing interest in the airline industry in exploring weight-based strategies for both operational efficiency and potential future pricing models.",

      "THE BEST TRAVEL GEAR FOR 2025",
      "Weight-based airline pricing divides opinion",
      "A recent\u00a0study asked 1,012 U.S. adults for their opinion on charging based on weight. It looked at three pricing options: a regular fare with a set luggage limit, a \"weight threshold\" where passengers over 160 pounds would pay extra and a \"body weight\" model where ticket prices would depend on each person\u2019s weight.",
      "The results showed that lighter passengers were more in favor of weight-based fees, while heavier passengers preferred the current system. However, almost half of the heavier respondents were still open to the idea.",
      "Younger travelers, frequent flyers and wealthier passengers were more likely to support weight-based charges.",
      "The study also revealed concerns about fairness, with nearly 60% worried about possible discrimination. Despite these worries, researchers believe it\u2019s important to discuss weight-based pricing as a way to reduce the environmental impact of air travel.",

      "FOOD TRACKING JUST GOT LAZY WITH THIS WEARABLE",
      "Ethical and environmental implications of weight-based airline pricing",
      "The potential implementation of weight-based airline pricing extends beyond simple economics, touching on complex environmental and social justice considerations. Climate researchers suggest that such a model could significantly reduce carbon emissions by creating a more direct correlation between passenger weight and fuel consumption. Environmental experts calculate that every additional pound on an aircraft increases fuel burn, with some estimates suggesting that a reduction of 1% in total aircraft weight could lead to approximately 0.75% fuel savings.",
      "This data provides a compelling scientific argument for weight-sensitive pricing strategies. However, the approach raises critical ethical questions about body diversity, accessibility and potential discrimination. Disability advocates argue that such pricing could disproportionately impact individuals with medical conditions or physical differences beyond their control.",
      "Emerging technologies like advanced lightweight materials and more fuel-efficient aircraft designs might ultimately provide alternative solutions to reducing aviation's carbon footprint, potentially rendering weight-based pricing unnecessary in the long term. As the debate continues, the airline industry faces the challenge of balancing environmental responsibility, economic efficiency and inclusive customer experience.",

    "summary": "Major IoT data breach: Mars Hydro database with 2.7 billion records exposed. Kurt \u201cCyberGuy&quot; Knutsson says the breach is a reminder of the risks that come with using IoT devices.",
    "story": [
      "Data breaches keep happening, and too often they come down to companies failing to take cybersecurity seriously. Some of the biggest breaches have been caused by negligence, and now there\u2019s another major one to add to the list. Mars Hydro, a Chinese company that makes Internet of Things (IoT) devices like LED lights and hydroponics equipment, left a massive database unprotected online. As a result, 2.7 billion records were exposed to anyone who knew where to look.",
      "Stay protected & informed! Get security alerts & expert tech tips\u2014sign up for Kurt\u2019s The CyberGuy Report now",
      "Illustration of IoT devices (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What happened?",
      "Mars Hydro, a Chinese manufacturer of IoT devices, suffered a massive data breach after a publicly accessible, unprotected database containing nearly 2.7 billion records was discovered online. The 1.17-terabyte database was not password-protected or encrypted, exposing a massive amount of sensitive information related to the company\u2019s smart devices, including LED grow lights and hydroponic equipment.",
      "The database contained logging, monitoring and error records for IoT devices sold worldwide. Among the exposed data were Wi-Fi network names (SSIDs), Wi-Fi passwords, IP addresses, device ID numbers and other details linked to user devices and the Mars Pro IoT software application. Plus, internal records referenced LG-LED SOLUTIONS LIMITED, a California-registered company, as well as Spider Farmer, which produces agricultural equipment.",
      "Security researcher\u00a0Jeremiah Fowler identified the database and immediately sent a responsible disclosure notice to LG-LED SOLUTIONS and Mars Hydro. Within hours, public access to the database was restricted.",
      "It remains unclear how long the database was publicly accessible or whether any unauthorized parties accessed the data before its restriction. The only way to confirm potential access or misuse would be through an internal forensic audit, but no such investigation has been publicly disclosed.",
      "Illustration of using an app to access smart home devices (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Should you be worried?",
      "The unprotected database contained highly sensitive user and device information, including SSIDs and passwords stored in plain text, which could allow unauthorized users to access home networks. Although the researcher did not indicate that any personally identifiable information was exposed, the presence of network credentials, IP addresses, device ID numbers and data about smartphones running the IoT software raises serious security concerns.",
      "The exposed credentials could theoretically enable an attacker to connect to the network, compromise other devices, intercept data or even launch targeted cyberattacks. This risk is particularly troubling, given the broader vulnerabilities within the IoT industry.",
      "According to a threat report by Palo Alto Networks, 57% of IoT devices across all industries are considered highly vulnerable, and an alarming 98% of data transmitted by these devices is unencrypted. The report further found that 83% of connected devices operate on outdated or unsupported operating systems, leaving them susceptible to attacks that exploit known vulnerabilities.",
      "This incident underscores a recurring problem in the IoT sector: poor security practices, weak data protection and the absence of encryption. Without proactive security measures, such breaches will likely continue, exposing users to risks that extend beyond just their IoT devices, potentially compromising entire home or business networks.",

      "FROM TIKTOK TO TROUBLE: HOW YOUR ONLINE DATA CAN BE WEAPONIZED AGAINST YOU",
      "6 ways you can protect yourself",
      "If you own a Mars Hydro device or use the Mars Pro app, take the following steps to protect your data and secure your network:",
      "1) Change your Wi-Fi password: Since Wi-Fi network names and passwords were stored in plain text, the first step is to update your router password immediately.\u00a0Even if you believe your credentials were not directly exposed, it\u2019s best to assume otherwise. A strong password should be complex, combining upper and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. Avoid using simple or easily guessable passwords, such as your name, address or basic numerical sequences.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): If your router supports\u00a0two-factor authentication, enabling it adds an extra layer of security. This ensures that even if someone gains access to your login credentials, they would still need a secondary authentication code \u2013 typically sent via text message or an authentication app \u2013 to log in. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access.",
      "3) Monitor your network for unusual activity: With Wi-Fi credentials and IP addresses exposed, attackers could attempt to access your network remotely. Checking your router\u2019s admin panel regularly to review connected devices is an important security measure. If you notice an unfamiliar device, remove it immediately and change your Wi-Fi password again.",
      "4) Keep your devices updated: IoT devices are notorious for running outdated or unsupported software, making them vulnerable to cyberattacks. Regularly\u00a0updating the firmware and software of your smart devices ensures that you receive the latest security patches. Check your device settings for available updates and install them as soon as they are released. Keeping your router\u2019s firmware updated is equally important, as routers are a primary target for hackers.",
      "5) Beware of phishing attempts and use strong antivirus software: Hackers may try to exploit the data from this breach by launching phishing attacks. If you receive an email claiming to be from Mars Hydro or LG-LED SOLUTIONS, urging you to reset your password or provide personal details, be cautious. Cybercriminals often create fake login pages designed to steal credentials. Do not click on suspicious links or download attachments from unknown senders.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6) Remove your exposed data from data brokers:\u00a0With 2.7 billion records exposed, your personal and network information may already be circulating among data brokers \u2013 companies that collect and sell user data, often without consent. Hackers and scammers use these databases to launch phishing attacks, identity theft scams and targeted cyber intrusions.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Mars Hydro breach is yet another reminder of the security risks that come with IoT devices. Companies need to do a better job of protecting user data, but at the end of the day, it is up to you to secure your own network. Updating passwords, enabling two-factor authentication and keeping an eye on your connected devices can make a big difference in keeping your data safe and your smart home secure.",

      "Kurt Knutsson joins \"Fox & Friends\" to discuss bank scams and a self-driving car that trapped a rider inside.",
      "Tech support scams have been around for years, but a new variant called the Phantom Hacker scam is rapidly gaining traction. It has cost victims, primarily older Americans, over $500 million since 2023. This scam is particularly deceptive because it unfolds in three carefully orchestrated phases and uses AI-powered social engineering tactics to avoid detection. Attackers leverage caller ID spoofing and AI-generated voices to make their scheme more persuasive, but there are ways to protect yourself.",

      "How the phantom hacker scam works",
      "As\u00a0highlighted by the FBI, the scam begins with the tech support impostor phase. You might receive a call, email, text or even a pop-up on your computer warning you that your device has been compromised. The message urges you to call a customer support number for assistance. Once you do, a scammer posing as\u00a0tech support claims that hackers have targeted your accounts. To \"help,\" they instruct you to download remote access software, allowing them to take control of your computer. Under the guise of scanning for threats, they trick you into revealing your financial accounts, setting up the next phase of the scam.",
      "Next comes the financial institution impostor phase. Another scammer, pretending to be from your bank or investment firm, calls to warn that a foreign hacker has infiltrated your accounts. They advise moving your money to a \"safe\" government-protected account, often using wire transfers, cryptocurrency or cash deposits. They might also insist on keeping the transaction confidential, claiming it\u2019s necessary for security reasons.",
      "In the final U.S. government impostor phase, a third scammer impersonates a federal official \u2013 often from the Federal Reserve \u2013 who pressures you to act quickly. If you start doubting the scheme, they may send you an official-looking email or document to convince you that the transfer is legitimate. By the time victims realize they\u2019ve been tricked, their money is gone, often sent overseas beyond the reach of U.S. authorities.",

      "SPOTIFY PLAYLISTS ARE BEING HIJACKED TO PROMOTE PIRATED SOFTWARE AND SCAMS",
      "How AI is making things worse",
      "AI is making scams like the Phantom Hacker scam more deceptive and harder to spot. Scammers are using AI-powered chatbots to automate their schemes. Instead of relying on human operators, they can now deploy AI-driven responses that sound natural and convincing.",
      "AI-generated\u00a0deepfake voices are also being used to impersonate bank officials and government representatives. With just a short audio sample, scammers can clone a voice to make their calls seem even more authentic. This means a victim might hear what sounds like their bank manager or an official from the Federal Reserve.",
      "Email scams are also becoming more sophisticated. AI tools can craft messages that mimic the tone and style of official communications. Scammers can even generate fake but realistic-looking documents with official letterheads to convince victims that the scam is legitimate.",

      "9 WAYS SCAMMERS CAN USE YOUR PHONE NUMBER TO TRY TO TRICK YOU",
      "7 ways to protect yourself",
      "The best way to defend yourself against the Phantom Hacker scam is to stay informed, be cautious and follow these steps:",
      "1) Ignore unsolicited messages: Scammers often send pop-ups, text messages or emails claiming that your computer is infected or that your bank account is at risk. These messages may look official, but they are designed to create panic and pressure you into taking immediate action. Never click on links or attachments from unknown senders, as they may contain malware or lead to phishing websites that steal your personal information.",
      "2)\u00a0Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Verify phone numbers before calling: If you receive an unexpected message urging you to call tech support, do not use the number provided in the message. Instead, visit the official website of the company in question and find their customer support contact information. Scammers often create fake websites or use\u00a0caller ID spoofing to make their phone numbers appear legitimate, so always double-check before making a call.",
      "4) Avoid downloading unknown software: No reputable company will ever ask you to install remote access tools unless you have specifically reached out for tech support. Scammers use these programs to take control of your computer, monitor your activity and access sensitive information. If someone unexpectedly asks you to download software to \"fix a problem\" or \"protect your account,\" it is likely a scam.",
      "5) Never give control of your device to a stranger: If you allow a scammer to remotely access your computer, they can view your personal files, log your keystrokes and manipulate your accounts without your knowledge. Legitimate customer support representatives will never request remote access unless you have initiated the support request through an official company channel. If someone insists on taking control of your device, hang up immediately.",
      "6) Be skeptical of urgent financial warnings: The U.S. government will never contact you unexpectedly and demand that you move your money to a \"safe account.\" They will also never ask you to wire funds, purchase gift cards or send cryptocurrency as a form of payment. Scammers create a false sense of urgency to trick victims into acting before they can think critically about the situation. If someone claims to be from a bank or government agency and pressures you to move money, stop and verify their identity through official channels.",
      "7) Invest in personal data removal services: Scammers often gather information from data broker websites to make their scams more convincing. Your name, phone number, home address and even financial history may be publicly available without your knowledge. Consider using a data removal service to regularly scan and request the removal of your personal information from these databases. This reduces the chances of scammers targeting you with highly personalized attacks. You can also manually opt out of major data broker sites, but using a service automates the process and keeps your information protected over time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Yurts founder and CEO Ben Van Roo breaks down concerns over DeepSeek on 'The Will Cain Show.'",
      "Apple devices are believed to be pretty secure, and that's what the company will tell you. You might have seen the tagline \"Privacy. That\u2019s Apple.\" in their promotions.",
      "However, the tech landscape is changing, and even Apple products aren\u2019t beyond cybercriminals\u2019 reach.",
      "A new report suggests Mac users will need to be more vigilant this year because AI advancements are helping hackers breach even the most secure systems. I have\u00a0consistently reported on how Mac malware is targeting users, and experts now believe this will only get worse.",

      "The rise of cyberattacks on Apple devices",
      "Mac malware is not what it used to be. For years, the biggest threats were annoying adware and browser hijackers, more of a nuisance than a real danger. But that is changing fast. As highlighted by\u00a0Malwarebytes, a new wave of information stealers is taking over, and they are far more dangerous, going after passwords, authentication cookies, credit card details and even cryptocurrency.",
      "This shift started in mid-2023 with the arrival of\u00a0Atomic Stealer, also known as AMOS, a piece of malware that looked much more like something you would see on Windows than the typical Mac threats. AMOS was not just effective. It was easy to use and sold as a service \u00a0for $1,000 a month with a slick web-based control panel. That success led to the rise of even more dangerous variants.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "One of them,\u00a0Poseidon, launched in mid-2024 and quickly became the dominant Mac stealer, responsible for 70% of infections. It can drain over 160 different cryptocurrency wallets, steal passwords from browsers and password managers and even grab VPN credentials.",
      "At the same time, cybercriminals have doubled down on\u00a0malvertising, using fake ads on Google and Bing to trick users into downloading malware instead of real software. These campaigns are highly targeted, allowing attackers to pinpoint Mac users and serve fake downloads based on their searches. With AI now being used to create and execute many of these attacks, they are likely to increase in scale.",

      "While Mac malware is evolving, the situation on Android is even more alarming. Phishing attacks on the platform have reached staggering levels, with thousands of malicious apps designed to steal credentials and bypass security measures.",
      "So far in 2024, researchers have detected 22,800 phishing-capable apps, alongside 3,900 apps designed to read OTPs from notification bars and 5,200 apps capable of extracting OTPs from SMS messages. These numbers highlight how widespread and effective Android phishing malware has become.",
      "Just like phishing emails, phishing apps trick users into handing over their usernames, passwords and two-factor authentication codes. Once stolen, these credentials can be sold or used for fraud,\u00a0identity theft or further\u00a0cyberattacks. Because phishing apps require minimal code and fewer permissions than traditional malware, they are much easier to sneak onto app stores, including Google Play.",
      "Many phishing apps look like regular, fully functional software. Some impersonate games or utilities, while others appear as cracked versions of popular apps like TikTok, WhatsApp or Spotify. Some stay dormant for days to avoid detection before launching their attacks. Others rely on ad functionality to redirect users to phishing sites, making the malicious code harder to trace.",
      "Google Play Protect, which is built-in malware protection for Android devices, automatically removes known malware. However, it is important to note that Google Play Protect may not be enough. Historically, it isn't 100% foolproof at removing all known malware from Android devices.",

      "1. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "2. Be cautious with downloads and links: Only download software from reputable sources such as the Mac App Store, Google Play Store or official websites of trusted developers. Be wary of unsolicited emails or messages prompting you to download or install updates, especially if they contain links.\u00a0Phishing attempts often disguise themselves as legitimate update notifications or urgent messages.",
      "3. Keep your software updated: Ensure that both macOS, Android and all installed applications are up to date. Apple and Android frequently release security patches and updates that address vulnerabilities. Enable automatic updates for macOS, Android and your apps to stay protected without having to manually check for updates. If you need more help, see my\u00a0guide on keeping all your devices updated.",
      "4. Use strong and unique passwords:\u00a0To protect your Mac from malware, it\u2019s also crucial to use strong, unique passwords for all your accounts and devices. Avoid reusing passwords across different sites or services. A\u00a0password manager can be incredibly helpful here. It generates and stores complex passwords for you, making them difficult for hackers to crack.",
      "It also keeps track of all your passwords in one place and automatically fills them in when you log into accounts, so you don\u2019t have to remember them yourself. By reducing the number of passwords you need to recall, you\u2019re less likely to reuse them, which lowers the risk of security breaches. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Use two-factor authentication (2FA): Enable\u00a02FA for your important accounts, including your Apple ID, Google account, email and any financial services. This adds an extra step to the login process, making it harder for attackers to gain access even if they have your password.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "The days when Mac users could assume they were safe are long gone. Cybercriminals are evolving their tactics, with Mac malware shifting from simple adware to advanced information stealers. Android phishing apps are also becoming harder to detect and more widespread than ever. From stealing passwords and authentication cookies to intercepting OTPs and draining cryptocurrency wallets, these threats are growing in both sophistication and scale. No platform is immune, and as cybercriminals continue refining their techniques, users and organizations must stay ahead with strong security measures.",

      "The financial toll is staggering \u2014 scams cost Americans over $159 billion annually, with average individual losses now exceeding $3,500 per victim. This epidemic is not just a financial crisis but also a human rights issue, as many scams originate from forced labor operations in Southeast Asia.",

      "The word scam with data in the background\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The mechanics of \"pig butchering\"",
      "One of the most pervasive scams today is the so-called \"pig butchering\" scheme. Originating in China and spreading across Southeast Asia, this scam involves criminals building trust with victims through social media or messaging apps. Once trust is established, victims are lured into fraudulent cryptocurrency investment schemes. These scams are meticulously crafted to appear legitimate, often involving fake trading platforms and simulated profits. Victims are encouraged to invest more until they are \"slaughtered,\" losing their\u00a0entire savings when the scammers vanish with their funds.",
      "9 WAYS SCAMMERS CAN USE YOUR PHONE NUMBER TO TRY TO TRICK YOU",
      "Forced labor behind these scam centers",
      "What makes these scams even more horrifying is their reliance on human trafficking. Criminal syndicates in countries like Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos force trafficked individuals to run these operations under threat of violence. These \"scam centers\" operate in lawless regions controlled by rebel groups or corrupt officials, making international intervention challenging.

      "BEST PRESIDENT\u2019S DAY DEALS",
      "Why America is a prime target",
      "Cyberscams have taken hold in the U.S. for several reasons that make it particularly vulnerable. As an American, you\u2019re likely connected to the digital world through social media platforms, messaging apps and other online tools. This high level of connectivity makes it easier for scammers to reach you directly, whether through a text message, email or social media chat. The sheer number of people online in the U.S. creates a vast pool of potential targets for cybercriminals.",
      "Additionally, the growing popularity of cryptocurrency in the U.S. has made it a\u00a0prime medium for fraud. Cryptocurrency transactions are fast, anonymous and difficult to trace, which makes them ideal for scammers looking to steal funds without leaving a trail. Many scams are designed to exploit this lack of transparency, leaving victims with little chance of recovering their money once it\u2019s gone.",
      "Another major issue is the lack of a centralized reporting system for cyberscams in the U.S. If you\u2019ve ever been scammed or know someone who has, you might have noticed how confusing it can be to figure out where to report the crime \u2014 whether to the FBI, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or another agency. This fragmented system not only makes it harder for victims to seek help but also prevents authorities from gathering comprehensive data to tackle the problem effectively. These factors combined have made Americans some of the most targeted individuals in the world when it comes to cyberscams.",

      "Several countries have implemented innovative measures to combat cyberscams, offering valuable lessons for the U.S. Singapore, for instance, has introduced a mandatory SMS Sender ID Registry (SSIR) that requires organizations to register their alphanumeric Sender IDs. This system effectively blocks unregistered SMS senders, significantly reducing impersonation scams. In fact, cases involving scam SMSes in Singapore fell by 70% over three months after mandating the SSIR.",
      "Britain has taken a different approach by establishing a dedicated \"159\" hotline, allowing residents to instantly verify suspicious calls. This simple yet effective system provides a quick way for individuals to check the legitimacy of unexpected communications, potentially preventing many scams before they occur.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Many nations have also implemented stricter authentication measures, such as biometric checks and in-app verifications, which have proven highly effective in reducing fraud. For example, Singapore has required facial verification for higher-risk transactions through Singpass since 2022, resulting in no further reports of malware-enabled scams involving unauthorized CPF withdrawals since its implementation in June 2023.",
      "Some countries are exploring ways to slow down cryptocurrency transactions or cap transfer amounts, which could significantly hinder scammers who rely on quick, anonymous transfers. These measures, combined with a coordinated global response involving major victim nations like the U.S. and China, could prove instrumental in dismantling criminal networks more effectively.

      "Defense attorney John Henry Browne, whose client list included Ted Bundy, reveals what he sees as the 'fascinating' parallel that case shared with the charges against Idaho student murders suspect Bryan Kohberger.",
      "FIRST ON FOX: A surviving housemate of four University of Idaho students killed in a home invasion knife attack told detectives she saw a bushy-eyed intruder walking out the back door with a \"vacuum-type object in his hand,\" after looking her in the eyes, according to newly unveiled court documents.",
      "The revelation came in Judge Steven Hippler's denial of 30-year-old suspect Bryan Kohberger's motion for a Franks hearing \u2013 a rare legal proceeding in which the defendant has a chance to attack the warrants in court before trial.",
      "Kohberger was arrested on Dec. 30, 2022 in connection with the home invasion massacre that happened on Nov. 13 of that year.",
      "His defense had attacked the witness' credibility, arguing that she admitted to being in a dreamlike state after witnessing the traumatic attack.

      "Although the judge said she was likely drunk during the murders, he explained that her statements to investigators on three separate occasions included a \"notably similar\" description of the suspect each time. She said he was a tall White male, lean and taller than she was.",
      "Each time, she said she heard an unknown male voice telling someone else in the house he was \"here to help\" and that he walked out the rear sliding door without saying anything to her. Kohberger's defense had argued police unfairly paraphrased her comments in the original probable cause affidavit, but the judge rejected that notion.",
      "While she left out the vacuum detail when speaking with an officer, she later mentioned it in two separate discussions with detectives.",
      "However, she also admitted that her memory was \"fuzzy and cloudy,\" according to the documents.",
      "\"Everything was kind of blurry,\" she told investigators. \"Like I don't fully remember it, I would say.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 10:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "RFK Jr. plans to investigate SSRI and antidepressant use, particularly among children and teens, as part of the \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement.",
    "story": [
      "In his first meeting with staff, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Tuesday that he intends to address the possible overmedication of children and the risks of antidepressants, according to an employee in attendance.",
      "The promise echoed an executive order that President Donald Trump issued last week establishing the Make America Healthy Again Commission, which he tasked with reducing chronic diseases, particularly among children. Trump made Kennedy the chair.",
      "The commission\u2019s agenda, per the order, includes looking into whether anti-depressants are being overprescribed to children; Trump asked for a report that assesses \u201cthe prevalence of and threat posed by the prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.\u201d",
      "Known as SSRIs, this class of antidepressants increases levels of serotonin, a chemical messenger in the brain that can improve mood. It includes Lexapro, Prozac and Zoloft, which treat conditions like depression, anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder. Depending on the medical condition, some SSRIs are approved for children starting at ages 6 to 10, but they are far more commonly used by adults than minors.",
      "In recent years, Kennedy has criticized what he sees as an overuse of these drugs, suggesting that they can be addictive and carry dangerous side effects.",
      "\u201cI know people, including members of my family, who\u2019ve had a much worse time getting off SSRIs than people have getting off heroin,\u201d he said during his Senate confirmation hearings.",
      "In the past, Kennedy has amplified false claims linking SSRIs to school shootings. He maintained in the recent hearings that he believes a possible connection \u201cshould be studied, along with other potential culprits.\u201d (A 2019 study found that most school shooters had not taken psychotropic medications, and when they did \u201cno direct or causal association was found\" with the shootings.)",
      "Doctors, however, say that SSRIs are not addictive, and that even the most extreme side effect that the FDA warns of, a risk of suicidal thoughts among children and teens, is only slightly elevated \u2014 4% versus 2% among those taking a placebo.",
      "Now in a position to turn his beliefs into policy, Kennedy appears to be thrusting SSRIs into the national spotlight \u2014\u00a0a move supported by some conservatives who\u2019ve embraced the \u201cMAHA\u201d movement \u2014 Make America Healthy Again.",
      "\u201cI have known many people who take anti-depressants. In almost every case there are glaringly obvious things in their lives that would cause any normal person to be depressed,\u201d right-wing podcaster and commentator Matt Walsh wrote on X on Tuesday, adding, \u201cInstead of making lifestyle changes or dealing with the underlying trauma, they are given drugs.\u201d",
      "The increased attention on SSRIs has prompted mental health advocacy groups to speak up in support of the medications. The drugs can be life-saving by mitigating thoughts of suicide, and can also help people with severe depression or anxiety function on a  daily basis and maintain social relationships.",
      "\u201cWe are deeply concerned some of these directives could create significant barriers to effective treatment for those suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and related conditions,\u201d the International OCD Foundation said in a statement.",
      "Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., who challenged Kennedy during his confirmation hearings over his comments about SSRIs, said in a statement: \u201cInstead of letting this be an issue between Americans and their physicians, under this Executive Order, Mr. Kennedy is planting the seeds to undermine people\u2019s trust in medications that are proven safe, effective, and in some circumstances save lives.\"",
      "In response to questions about why the MAHA Commission is investigating SSRIs, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement that \u201cAmericans have lost confidence in the medical apparatus that let us down during the COVID pandemic and oversaw an unprecedented explosion in chronic disease.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Trump-Vance administration will continue to review current best practices and healthcare bodies to implement needed reforms,\u201d he added.",
      "In children and teens, SSRIs are typically reserved for cases involving moderate or severe symptoms, such as those who are actively suicidal or whose depression prevents them from eating, sleeping, socializing or attending school.",
      "The gold standard for severe depression is to use SSRIs in combination with therapy, said Dr. Christine Crawford, associate medical director at the National Alliance on Mental Illness, a nonprofit group.",
      "\u201cIf things are severe, then we\u2019ll add the medication component to it, so that the kid can actually function physically,\u201d she said.",
      "SSRI use among minors has risen significantly in recent years \u2014\u00a0a trend Kennedy referred to during his hearings. A study last year found that the number of\u00a0 people ages 12 to 17 with an antidepressant prescription rose 43% from 2016 to 2022. (However, the study also found that young adults ages 18 to 25 had more than double the total number of prescriptions relative to the younger group.)",
      "Dr. Kao-Ping Chua, the study\u2019s author and an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Michigan Medical School, said one explanation for the trend is that \u201cthe prevalence of anxiety and depression has been rising among adolescents, young adults, even before the pandemic.\u201d",
      "\u201cDuring the pandemic, there\u2019s ample evidence to suggest that the mental health of this group got worse,\u201d he said.",
      "Experts generally agree that it\u2019s important to figure out why adolescents and young adults are experiencing depression and anxiety.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of reasons kids can feel sad or anxious, including experiencing significant trauma, poverty, social difficulties at school, and I think sometimes medications are given in those cases when a psychological intervention would be much more effective,\u201d said Dr. Michael Bloch, director of the Pediatric Depression Clinic at Yale School of Medicine.",
      "Shortages of available or affordable therapists can also encourage people with milder symptoms to seek medication as a first-line treatment. Bloch said adding more mental health services in schools could address that issue.",
      "He added, however, that when it comes to anti-depressants, \u201cit\u2019s fairly settled science that they do have a use in a lot of kids with anxiety, OCD and depression.\u201d",
      "As for Kennedy\u2019s claims about the risks of SSRIs, doctors said the drugs don\u2019t cause dependence,\u00a0though if patients don\u2019t taper the dosage properly when they begin to stop taking them, they can experience withdrawal symptoms. That is also true of other types of medications, including for blood pressure and seizures.",
      "And while SSRIs can have side effects \u2014 such as nausea, headache and difficulty sleeping \u2014 Kennedy\u2019s suggestion that they could be tied to violence is also incorrect. Although antidepressants carry a warning about a potential risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior in children and teens, Kennedy falsely stated in his confirmation hearings that the warning referred to \u201chomicidal behavior.\u201d",
      "Some doctors question whether the warning is necessary at all and worry it has deterred people who need the drugs from taking them.",
      "There are, however, important unanswered questions about antidepressants, doctors said. Bloch, who treats kids with depression and OCD, said he doesn\u2019t have good data comparing higher versus lower doses of SSRIs, or evaluating the risk of taking kids off a medication.",
      "And Crawford said that because of the many barriers to doing clinical studies in children, \u201cwe tend to trail behind that of the adult population in terms of medications that are FDA approved.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Republican-controlled Senate on Friday morning adopted a $340 billion budget blueprint designed to boost funding for President Donald Trump's immigration enforcement efforts, energy production and the military.",
      "The mostly partly-line vote came just before 5 a.m. ET following an all-night \u201cvote-a-rama,\u201d in which senators cast votes on 33 amendments over the course of a 10-hour span. The final vote was 52-48, with Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., as the lone Republican to join all 47 Democrats in voting against the budget resolution.",
      "\u201cWithout this bill passing,\u201d said Senate Budget Committee Chair Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., \u201cthere is no hope of getting money for the border.\u201d",
      "Passage of the Senate plan now puts pressure on the GOP-controlled House, which plans to take up its own competing budget resolution next week. In addition to money for the border, defense and energy, that version also includes a $4.5 trillion tax cut and a $4 trillion debt limit hike.",
      "Trump has endorsed the House version \u2014 what he calls \"one big, beautiful bill\" \u2014 but GOP senators have indicated that their version could be a fallback plan if the House blueprint fails.",
      "\u201cTo my House colleagues: We will all get there together. If you can pass the one big, beautiful bill that makes the tax cuts permanent \u2014 not four or five years \u2014 then we\u2019ll all cheer over here. Nothing would please me more than Speaker [Mike] Johnson being able to put together the bill that President Trump wants,\" Graham said on the Senate floor Thursday, before voting began.",
      "\"I want that to happen, but I cannot sit on the sidelines and not have a plan B.\"",
      "Paul, a fiscal hawk, said the budget contradicts GOP rhetoric about reducing spending.",
      "\u201cIf we were fiscally conservative, why wouldn\u2019t we take the savings from Elon Musk and DOGE and move it over here and help with the border?\u201d Paul said on the Senate floor before voting began. \u201cWhy would we be doing a brand new bill to increase spending by $340 billion?\u201d",
      "Under the process, Senate rules allow for members to propose an unlimited number of amendments.",
      "Democrats sought to force Republicans to take difficult votes through amendments, which the majority party voted down one by one. Many were aimed at protecting benefits and programs they say the GOP is targeting for cuts. One amendment proposed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., would have prohibited the bill from cutting taxes for the wealthy if even $1 is cut from Medicaid, a health care program for low-income Americans.",
      "It was rejected 49-51, with just two Republicans joining Democrats in favor of it: Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Josh Hawley, R-Mo.",
      "Just two amendments passed. One of them, offered by Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, would create \"a deficit-neutral reserve fund relating to protecting Medicare and Medicaid.\" But Democrats balked at the proposal, saying it was designed to give political cover to Republicans on the issue and that millions of Americans would lose their coverage.",
      "\"The language in this amendment is code for kicking Americans with Medicaid coverage off their health insurance if they\u2019re not sick enough, not poor enough, or not disabled enough,\" said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who spoke in opposition.",
      "The budget resolution instructs Senate committees to craft legislation that satisfies its goals, which can be fast-tracked to the floor and passed by a simple majority.",
      "The measure seeks $175 billion for immigration and border enforcement, on the request of the Trump administration\u2019s border czar, Tom Homan. And it calls for expanding the military by $150 billion, even as Trump and Elon Musk say they want to cut costs at the Pentagon. It also directs committees to find spending cuts to pay for it all.",
      "The \u201cbudget reconciliation\u201d process allows members to bypass the 60-vote threshold in the Senate, but it limits provisions to spending and taxes. Democrats can challenge policies that run afoul of the \u201cByrd rule\u201d constraints and call on the Senate parliamentarian to strip them out.",
      "For months, Republicans in the House and the Senate have clashed over whether the party should try to pass Trump\u2019s legislative priorities in one reconciliation bill or two.",
      "But Wednesday, Trump gave a full-throated endorsement to the House's strategy, taking to Truth Social to say he wanted \u201cONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL\u201d and urging the Senate to pump the brakes on their two-bill reconciliation push. The House plan calls for a sweeping package that includes border enforcement, expanding energy production and renewing the expiring 2017 Trump tax cuts.",
      "The Senate plan would be narrower and would not include renewing the tax cuts that were a signature accomplishment of Trump's first term. Instead, those tax cuts would come in a second reconciliation package later this year, senators have said.",
      "If the House and the Senate can get on the same page and pass an identical budget resolution, that would only be the start of a very long and complicated legislative process. In the House, conservatives are demanding steep spending cuts, while more moderate Republicans are getting skittish due to potential cuts to Medicaid.",
      "\u201cThe budget resolution is just patty cake. The real work begins when you start putting together the bill and the pay-fors,\u201d said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., a member of both the budget and the appropriations committees. \u201cThe only prediction I\u2019ll make is that a reconciliation bill will not pass either the House or the Senate without substantial spending reductions.\u201d",
      "Vice President JD Vance, who met with senators this week, said he believed Congress is \u201con track\u201d to pass a reconciliation package in May or June, while acknowledging that was an ambitious timeline.",
      "\u201cI think the president has learned a lot about how D.C. works. And\u00a0I actually talked to the president about this yesterday, and he said to me, \u2018Look, it\u2019s very rare that you can get two reconciliation bills done in one Congress,\u2019 which is why he thinks we\u2019ve got to do a lot with that one big beautiful bill,\u201d Vance said during an appearance Thursday at the Conservative Political Action Conference.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s early, right? This stuff takes time to put together,\u201d he continued. \u201cI think if you had a record-pace reconciliation bill, we would get this thing done in May or in June. I think we\u2019re on track to do that.\u201d"

      "New York Yankees players and employees will finally be able to sport beards, the team announced on Friday, adjusting a long-standing, one-of-a-kind grooming policy.",
      "Managing general partner Hal  Steinbrenner said he spoke to \"a large number of former and current Yankees\" about the archaic\u00a0rule against beards set by his late father George Steinbrenner nearly half a century ago.",
      "While a final policy is still being drawn up, the younger Steinbrenner made it clear that some beards will soon be allowed inside the Yankees clubhouse.",
      "\"Ultimately the final decision rests with me, and after great consideration, we will be amending our expectations to allow our players and uniformed personnel to have well-groomed beards moving forward,\" he said in a statement. \"It is the appropriate time to move beyond the familiar comfort of our former policy.\u201d",
      "The policy dates back to 1973 shortly after a group of investors, including George Steinbrenner, purchased the struggling franchise from CBS.",
      "The man who'd later be called \"The Boss\" immediately targeted some of the most famous Yankees of that era \u2014 Sparky Lyle, Thurman Munson, Bobby Murcer, Fritz Peterson and Roy White  \u2014 to clean up unkempt mustaches, mutton chops and long hair.",
      "The rule was eventually tweaked to allow for mustaches, but no beards. Hair from the scalp could not touch collars.",
      "For generations, Yankees players \u2014 often grudgingly \u2014 complied with the rule that seemed to have no equivalent in baseball or any other pro sport.",

      "While the deep-pocketed Yankees have always been one of baseball's most attractive destinations, it's been suggested their efforts to sign free agents has been hampered by the grooming policy.",

      "Flour Bakery in Boston can\u2019t make much with just its namesake ingredient; eggs are in just about everything from pies and cakes to brioche bread. With bird flu slamming into egg supplies and driving up prices, owner Joanne Chang said she\u2019s charging 50 cents more for egg sandwiches and quiches.",
      "\u201cWe held out for as long as we could,\u201d she said.",
      "Egg prices have soared amid major shortages because of avian influenza. The ongoing outbreak began in 2022 and has affected more than 162 million birds, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department, causing many farmers to cull their flocks. More than 27 million birds have been lost because of the virus so far this year alone, the American Egg Board trade group estimates.",
      "A dozen large grade-A eggs hit an average of $4.95 in January, federal data shows, surpassing the last peak of $4.82 in January 2023. In between, prices dipped \u2014 last January, the average was just $2.52 \u2014 and businesses and consumers are now feeling whiplash.",
      "\u201cYou see fluctuations, but you can\u2019t adjust your prices every single time,\u201d Chang said. She estimated paying $43 for a case \u2014 15 dozen, or 180 eggs \u2014 as recently as December. Last week, that bill swelled to $87. She said her supplier has begun sending extra large eggs instead of large ones, which are ordinarily the most common size.",
      "As small businesses weigh whether to raise prices to offset cost increases that threaten their profit margins, major breakfast food chains such as Waffle House have taken flak from customers who object to paying more. Many grocery stores have started rationing eggs, with Trader Joe\u2019s limiting purchases to one dozen per customer; some Kroger and Aldi stores set that cap at two cartons per trip.",
      "Farmers are struggling to not only meet demand, but to also keep their hens from contracting the virus, said American Egg Board President and CEO Emily Metz.",
      "\u201cWe are in the fight of our lives,\u201d she said. \u201cMy farmers wake up every day in fear that their farm is going to be next, and unfortunately we just haven\u2019t been able to get any relief.\u201d",
      "Some hope may be on the horizon. The USDA has granted a conditional license for a vaccine for poultry, though it hasn\u2019t been approved for commercial use yet. In the meantime, many farmers have been forced to euthanize their flocks and thoroughly sanitize their facilities in the event of an outbreak, Metz said. She estimated it could take affected farms take nine to 12 months to fully recover from an outbreak.",
      "Normally, there\u2019s about one egg-laying bird for every person in the U.S., or more than 330 million birds, Metz said. That tally has dropped below 280 million, she said, which is why the country is experiencing shortages.",
      "\u201cEggs are indispensable,\u201d Metz said, adding that she gets dozens of calls a day from customers asking how they can help egg farmers.",

It\u2019s a much smaller increase than other suppliers have instituted, said Botcher, who typically orders six cases per week.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not going to break the bank for me, and that starts in a couple weeks,\u201d she said, adding that \u201cbuying organic, ironically, has become a cheaper, more affordable option for us.\u201d",
      "Farm to People, a food delivery service based in New York, has been advertising pasture-raised eggs during the outbreak, saying its $7.49 carton of a dozen has seen only a 50-cent price hike in the last seven years. The company has vowed \u201cno price gouging on eggs\u201d and called the nationwide shortage \u201cyet another sign of a broken food system where large factory farms fall short.\u201d",
      "Eggs aren\u2019t the only bakery staple that\u2019s been getting more expensive. A global cocoa crunch has been sending wholesale costs sharply higher in recent weeks, and Botcher said she\u2019s seen prices for some varieties of chocolate rising by anywhere from 35% to 50% over the past year \u2014 a period in which labor costs have surged as well.",

It was the November implosion of his coalition, a disagreement about Germany\u2019s budget deficit, that sparked this snap ballot.",
      "The final results expected Monday will have global reverberations. The world\u2019s third-largest economy has enjoyed decades of steady, consensus-driven politics guided by its memory of the Nazi era. Sunday\u2019s vote could yield an upheaval.",
      "\u201cWe hope to establish a new partnership of conservatives, like we can already see in the U.S.,\u201d\u00a0 Marc Bernhard, another AfD lawmaker, said at the conference center in Karlsruhe, where a mostly white, mostly male audience ate sausages and pretzels, washed down with fizzy pilsner.",
      "In Duisburg, a city to the north, AfD candidate Sascha Lensing told NBC News that U.S. support was \u201cunbelievably important\u201d and \u201ca giant upswing.\u201d At a rally in nearby Marl, supporters wore red \u201cMake Germany Great Again!\u201d hats.",
      "The White House\u2019s new German friends want to carry out mass deportations of undocumented migrants, throttle border security, shrink the state and cut taxes. The party rejects established climate science, wants to scrap support for Ukraine in favor of improved Russia ties, and says young Germans should stop feeling guilty for the Holocaust.",
      "That has appalled some Jewish groups, such as the International Auschwitz Committee, which describes the AfD as \u201ca threat to democracy.\u201d It\u2019s also part of the reason the AfD remains a pariah in the Bundestag, whose parties have vowed to uphold the informal \u201cfirewall\u201d against far-right cooperation, seen as a bulwark against fascism.",
      "These concerns are not confined to the legislature. Germany\u2019s domestic BfV intelligence agency is surveilling the AfD on suspicion of far-right extremism, upheld by two levels of regional courts.",
      "The AfD\u2019s response has echoes of Trump\u2019s overhaul of federal agencies. Bernhard wants to reform the judiciary and intelligence services so they are \u201cmore independent\u201d and \u201crefocus on the real dangers\u201d such as \u201cIslamist terrorism.\u201d",
      "Opponents fear what these institutions might look like revamped by a party they accuse of extremist rhetoric.",
      "Supporters of leader Alice Weidel chant \u201cAlice f\u00fcr Deutschland,\u201d meaning \u201cAlice for Germany.\u201d That\u2019s a near homophone of \u201cAlles fur Deutschland,\u201d or \u201ceverything for Germany,\u201d a motto used by Adolf Hitler\u2019s paramilitary SS.",
      "Bernhard labeled it \u201cridiculous\u201d and \u201cbulls---\u201d to suggest that supporters have deliberately used this slogan. He said \u201c98% of the population\u201d had no idea this was \u201cused by any organization in the Third Reich.\u201d But some observers say it\u2019s exactly the kind of provocative wordplay the AfD deploys to skirt Germany\u2019s laws prohibiting Nazi endorsement.",
      "AfD firebrand Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke was last year adjudged to have overstepped that line. He was fined 13,000 euros (around $13,500) for using the slogan at a campaign rally. H\u00f6cke, a retired history teacher, said he didn\u2019t know it was associated with the SS.",
      "NBC News has asked the White House, Weidel and H\u00f6cke for comment on the U.S.-AfD relationship, as well as the party\u2019s policies and rhetoric.",
      "AfD supporters ask how the party can be bigoted when led by Weidel, 46, a Mandarin-speaking former investment banker with a Sri Lankan-born same-sex partner. She says this does not contradict the AfD\u2019s platform of opposing same-sex marriage in favor of \u201ctraditional families\u201d of fathers, mothers and plentiful children to counterbalance mass migration.",
      "Others disagree. The Lesbian and Gay Federation in Germany said last month that Weidel merely \u201cserves as a figurehead who is supposed to disguise the party\u2019s massive anti-queer sentiment.\u201d",
      "Until recently, she was seen as a relative moderate. That changed at the party conference last month, when Weidel first used the term \u201cremigration\u201d to advocate the mass deportation of undocumented migrants or incomers who commit crimes.",
      "That caused uproar \u2014in a country that remembers deporting and murdering Jews and other groups. And yet support for the idea has been fueled by a recent spate of high-profile attacks by people with migrant backgrounds. That\u2019s despite researchers at the University of Munich this week releasing a study that found that there is no link between migration and crime rates, which are decreasing.",
      "That study \u201cdoes not prove anything,\u201d Hess, the AfD lawmaker, said in Karlsruhe. \u201cAnyone who believes these attacks have nothing to do with migration is crazy.\u201d",
      "The stance has alarmed not just liberals, but also big business. CEOs from Deutsche Bank, Volkswagen and others have warned against deporting migrant workers upon whom Germany desperately relies.",
      "\u201cWe have more than 70 former refugees working for us \u2014 from Syria, Pakistan, Afghanistan and various African countries,\u201d said Bonita Grupp, managing partner of Trigema, a textiles dynasty founded by her great-grandfather in 1919.",
      "The firm is based in Burladingen, a small town with snow-dusted roofs and forested hills around 2 hours southeast of Karlsruhe. In European elections last year, almost 40% of the local population voted for the AfD.",
      "That shows how the party has grown beyond its East German base and into the industrialized West. Here, the German behemoth has not escaped the global cost-of-living crisis and is on the brink of recession.",
      "The AfD has wooed not only those with tighter wallets, but also youths receptive to its savvy use of TikTok. Support rose 11% among 16-25-year-olds in the summer\u2019s European elections.",
      "\u201cGermany is really unsafe, the immigration is uncontrolled and something has to change,\u201d said Yusuf, 18, among a group of teenagers at the AfD event in Karlsruhe.",
      "\u201cFirst, I also thought the AfD were fascists, but since I informed myself I knew that the AfD isn\u2019t a fascist party,\u201d added Yusuf, whose Tunisian grandfather came to Germany in the 1960s. He declined to give his last name, walking away when asked if he experiences racism within the party.",
      "Back in Burladingen, Carolin, 36, a tax adviser, pauses when asked which party she will vote for.",
      "\u201cThe blue one,\u201d she said, appearing to choke on her words as she pointed to an AfD lamppost placard.",
      "She too declined to give her last name, wary of being judged by her friends and family. She doesn\u2019t agree with the AfD\u2019s policies restricting abortions or rejecting female boardroom quotas. \u201cBut people are angry with the government because they can\u2019t pay their bills. And I hope they will fix it.\u201d",
      "This sudden groundswell has dismayed Erwin Staiger, 76, who has lived here for 50 years and retired as its nonparty political mayor last year.",
      "He wonders whether the loss of the local butcher and baker or the fading of community spirit may have boosted the AfD in a region with little direct experience of migration. He sees the AfD offering criticisms but few real solutions. He fears the consequences, not just for domestic politics, but also the risk that the war in Ukraine could spread through Europe if Kyiv is abandoned by the West.",
      "\u201cThe world is turned upside down,\u201d he said of upheavals in Germany and Washington. \u201cI am really concerned what is going to happen\u201d he added, for \u201cour democracy, but also for peace.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The mayor of a city in Alabama has placed its entire police department on administrative leave, a day after officials announced that a grand jury had recommended the small department be abolished, saying it had \u201coperated as more of a criminal enterprise than a law enforcement agency\u201d and is \u201can ongoing threat to public safety.\u201d",
      "Jim Sawyer, the mayor of Hanceville, a city of about 3,200 roughly 45 miles north of Birmingham, said in a statement Thursday evening that after an \u201ceffective meeting\u201d with Cullman County Sheriff Matt Gentry, all employees of the police department will be placed on administrative leave effective 5 p.m. Thursday.",
      "Sawyer said all 911 and emergency calls will be routed directly to the sheriff\u2019s office, which will provide all law enforcement services to the city of Hanceville.",

      "The police department employed only eight officers as of August, when Marlin was sworn in as chief, according to The Cullman Times. A woman who answered the police department\u2019s dispatch line earlier Thursday said there was no one available to speak to a reporter about its size and that the department had no comment about anything. A message left at the chief\u2019s work voicemail was not immediately returned.",
      "\u201cThis is a sad day for law enforcement, but at the same time, it is a good day for the rule of law,\u201d Crocker said at the start of Wednesday\u2019s news conference, where he was joined by Gentry.",
      "Crocker read nine findings from the grand jury \u2014 including that departmental negligence played a role in the 2024 overdose death of a Hanceville 911 dispatcher who was found dead at work.",
      "The grand jury did not charge the officers in connection with the death of the dispatcher, Christopher Michael Willingham, 49, whose body was found in his office in August and ruled an accidental overdose from the \u201ccombined toxic effects of fentanyl\u201d and other drugs by the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences.",
      "But the grand jury said his death was \u201cthe direct result\u201d of the police department\u2019s \u201cnegligence, lack of procedure, general incompetence and disregard for human life,\u201d Crocker said.",
      "The revelations came after the Alabama State Bureau of Investigations probed Willingham\u2019s death.",
      "The grand jury also said the department had failed to account for, preserve and maintain evidence, and in doing so, had failed crime victims and the public at large, Crocker said, adding that some of the evidence was unusable. Crocker said any pending cases will go through a review process.",
      "The grand jury said the department \u201chas recently operated as more of a criminal enterprise than a law enforcement agency,\u201d that it \u201cis a particular and ongoing threat to public safety\u201d and that the indicted officers should be suspended by the Alabama Peace Officer Standards and Training Commission. Because of what the grand jury described as \u201ca rampant culture of corruption,\u201d the grand jury recommended that another agency be tasked with policing the city of Hanceville.",
      "Crocker said one of the most concerning things was that the police department\u2019s evidence room was not secure.",
      "\u201cCriminal evidence must be secured in order to have that evidence for prosecution and to ensure due process,\u201d he said. \u201cThis evidence room was anything but secure.\u201d",
      "He showed photos of a hole in the wall of the evidence room and a green broomstick that he said was used to \u201cjimmy open\u201d the door.\u00a0 Crocker said the grand jury had watched \u201ca lot of videos\u201d from security camera footage that showed the evidence room was routinely accessed by individuals who were not authorized to do so.",
      "The grand jury toured the Hanceville jail on Feb. 12 and were left with no confidence in the police department\u2019s ability to maintain a jail or to meet the basic health and safety needs of jail personnel or inmates, Crocker said.",
      "Sawyer, the mayor, said in a statement Wednesday that the city would fully cooperate with all investigations into the police department. Sawyer also said the city council will consider the grand jury\u2019s recommendations \u201cand act swiftly and decisively to address the problems\u201d within it.",
      "Sawyer also said he had spoken with the district attorney and agreed that there should be an audit of the contents of the evidence room. Sawyer said in the statement that he could not comment further, citing the ongoing investigations.",
      "Messages left for Sawyer at his office and personal numbers were not immediately returned.",
      "Gentry, who also attended Wednesday\u2019s news conference, said all of the defendants had been released on bond.",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:33:31 GMT",
    "summary": "A Texas lawmaker horrified by an NBC News investigation into a medical school that profited from the bodies of the poor moved this week to ban the practice.",
    "story": [
      "This article is part of \u201cDealing the Dead,\u201d a series investigating the use of unclaimed bodies for medical research.",
      "A Texas lawmaker horrified by an NBC News investigation into a medical school that profited from the bodies of the poor and vulnerable moved this week to ban the practice, introducing a bill that would make it illegal in the state to perform medical research on a corpse without explicit consent.",
      "The proposal is a direct response to NBC News\u2019 \u201cDealing the Dead\u201d series, which exposed how the University of North Texas Health Science Center in Fort Worth took hundreds of unclaimed bodies from Dallas and Tarrant counties, cut them up and leased them out to medical device companies, other universities and the Army. Reporters discovered dozens of families who said they would have claimed their loved ones\u2019 bodies and given them proper funerals if they had been told. Some were still searching for their relatives, unaware that they had died.",
      "Sen. Tan Parker, who filed the bill in the Texas Legislature on Wednesday, said he had no idea what the Health Science Center had been doing until he saw NBC News\u2019 investigation in September. The findings outraged and disgusted him, he said.",
      "\u201cEvery Texan deserves dignity in life and death, and the right of families to decide how their loved ones\u2019 remains are handled must be protected,\u201d Parker, a Republican whose district includes portions of Dallas and Tarrant counties, said in a statement. \u201cNo family should ever have to worry that the remains of their loved ones could be taken, dismembered, and leased out without any effort to notify the next of kin. This legislation puts an end to that practice once and for all, ensuring Texas law upholds the highest ethical standards and respects the dignity of every individual.\u201d",
      "In addition to the legislation, NBC News\u2019 reporting has sparked sweeping changes: The Health Science Center suspended its body donation program, fired the officials who led it and said it would stop accepting unclaimed bodies. Boston Scientific and other medical device and research companies, as well as the Army, said they would rethink their arrangements with the center and take steps to ensure they would not use unclaimed bodies in the future. Members of Congress sought answers, and officials in Tarrant County adopted a policy to ensure unclaimed bodies were treated with dignity.",
      "The reporting also brought answers to families who had been left in the dark about what happened to their loved ones. Tim Leggett learned from NBC News last year that his brother Dale, 71, a World War II history buff, had died alone at a hospital in Tarrant County in May 2023. Without notifying Leggett, the county medical examiner provided his brother\u2019s body to the Health Science Center, which shipped his remains out of state to a for-profit medical education company. He applauded Parker\u2019s effort to ban the practice.",
      "\u201cThere is right and wrong, especially when it comes to how we treat each other, whether it\u2019s while we\u2019re alive or deceased,\u201d said Leggett, who was finally able to obtain his brother\u2019s ashes after seeing his name on a list NBC News and Noticias Telemundo published. \u201cThis bill is definitely another good step in making sure this doesn\u2019t happen to any other families.\u201d",
      "Leggett and nearly a dozen other families learned what happened to their relatives from NBC News and Noticias Telemundo reporters. Six of those families found their relative\u2019s name on the list the news outlets published.",
      "Kimberly Patman, who was told by NBC News that the body of her ex-husband, Victor Honey, was cut up and leased out, also said she welcomed Parker\u2019s bill.",
      "\u201cI am very thankful for them moving forward so that what happened to Victor and the other individuals won\u2019t ever happen again,\u201d Patman said.",
      "Honey, a homeless Army veteran who struggled with mental illness, died in Dallas in 2022 without anyone notifying his family. The Health Science Center then dissected his body and leased parts to two medical companies and the Army. After learning of his death last spring, his family buried his cremated remains at the Dallas-Fort Worth National Cemetery. The experience shook Patman, along with Honey\u2019s adult children and siblings.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t fully grasp the impact unless it has happened to your family,\u201d Patman said.",
      "Parker said his bill would prohibit the donation of an unclaimed body to a medical school or private body broker unless the person agreed to the donation before their death \u2014\u00a0or if permission is given by next of kin.",
      "If adopted, the measure would prevent a repeat of the Health Science Center\u2019s actions.",
      "It would also make Texas one of the few states to clearly ban research on the unclaimed dead \u2014\u00a0those whose families can\u2019t afford to make funeral arrangements or can\u2019t be reached. The practice is legal in most states but is increasingly viewed as unethical by anatomists and leaders in the body donation industry who say doctors and scientists should handle the dead with the same respect shown to living patients.",
      "Officials in North Texas justified sending unclaimed bodies to the Health Science Center by saying the deals saved local governments the cost of burials and cremations, helped train students and doctors and supported lifesaving research. But NBC News found that medical examiner\u2019s offices in Dallas and Tarrant counties, and staff at the Health Science Center, failed to contact relatives who were reachable before declaring the bodies unclaimed.",
      "More from 'Dealing the Dead'",
      "The University of North Texas Health Science Center built a flourishing business using unclaimed corpses. When Aurimar Iturriago Villegas was murdered, her corpse became a commodity in the U.S. body trade.

      "A disgraced chiropractor found a new job selling bodies, then was accused of mishandling them.",
      "Through thousands of pages of documents and data obtained via public records requests, reporters determined that Dallas and Tarrant counties sent about 2,350 unclaimed bodies to the Health Science Center since 2019, more than 830 of which \u2014 advertised as being of \u201cthe highest quality found anywhere in the U.S.\u201d \u2014\u00a0were selected for dissection and study. The center charged medical device and training companies $649 for heads, $330 for a pair of feet and $1,400 for a whole body. The body trade helped bring the center about $2.5 million a year.",
      "The dead included military veterans, people who struggled with drug addiction and mental illness and a young murder victim; while some had fallen out of touch with their relatives, their families said they loved and missed them and would have come forward to claim their body if they\u2019d known they were dead.",
      "After NBC News shared its findings with the Health Science Center, the school offered condolences to families and acknowledged the problems reporters uncovered. \u201cAs a result of the information brought to light through your inquiries, it has become clear that failures existed in the management and oversight of The University of North Texas Health Science Center\u2019s Willed Body Program,\u201d the center said in a statement last year.",
      "Parker\u2019s bill, which could be subject to revisions as it makes its way through the Legislature, will next be debated in a Texas Senate committee. Parker\u2019s office said it was working to get a companion bill filed in the Texas House and hoped to win bipartisan support.",
      "Eli Shupe, a bioethicist at the University of Texas at Arlington, said Parker\u2019s bill would herald a \u201clandmark shift\u201d in protecting corpses from misuse. Shupe began speaking against the Health Science Center\u2019s use of unclaimed bodies when she first learned of the practice just over three years ago.",
      "\u201cTexas would essentially go from a state that\u2019s recently been singled out for ethically unsavory practices to a model for others to follow,\u201d she said. \u201cVery few states have legislation like this. We would be a real leader in the country.\u201d"

      "The largest U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange said Friday that the Securities and Exchange Commission would drop its lawsuit against it, a signal that the Trump administration plans to take a friendlier approach to the broader crypto industry.",
      "In a release it titled \"Righting a major wrong,\" the exchange, Coinbase, said SEC staff had agreed in principle to dismiss a suit filed during the Biden administration. The suit accused Coinbase of acting as an unregistered securities broker.",
      "The agency must still vote to formally drop the suit.",
      "A representative for the SEC declined to comment on Coinbase\u2019s announcement.",
      "\"I think it is a really important signal that a small group of activists in the prior administration who tried to unlawfully attack this industry \u2014 we are able to turn page on that and finally get regulatory clarity in America,\" Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said in an interview on CNBC on Friday morning.",
      "Coinbase shares were up 5% in premarket trading. Bitcoin prices were up 1%.",
      "The move to drop the suit would serve to make good on President Donald Trump's campaign commitment to roll back the strict enforcement of the crypto industry that occurred under then-President Joe Biden. Trump has promised to make the United States  the \"crypto capital of the world,\" and has launched his own meme coin.",
      "In its original suit, the SEC said Coinbase's alleged actions were depriving investors of \"critical protections, including rulebooks that prevent fraud and manipulation, proper disclosure, safeguards against conflicts of interest, and routine inspection by the SEC.\"",
      "\u201cYou simply can\u2019t ignore the rules because you don\u2019t like them or because you\u2019d prefer different ones: the consequences for the investing public are far too great,\u201d Gurbir S. Grewal, director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement, said at the time.",
      "To date, the SEC has not categorized bitcoin as a security. The crypto industry has long complained that, under former Chair Gary Gensler, the agency took an overly critical posture toward the industry while failing to provide clear \"rules of the road\" and work with it to develop a means for it to operate legally.",
      "Lawsuits against two other exchanges, Binance and Kraken, are still pending.",
      "\"We tried to 'come in and register' but it turned out it was a fake offer, as every crypto company discovered,\" Armstrong wrote in a separate post on X on Friday, referring to the Biden administration's previous actions concerning the crypto industry.",
      "\"Regulators are supposed to enforce the law, but they can\u2019t make up new laws on the spot if they don\u2019t like the current ones, or weaponize a lack of clarity in the law.\""

      "Meta also slashed its annual distribution of stock options by about 10% for thousands of employees, according to a\u00a0report\u00a0published Thursday by the Financial Times.

    "story": [
      "Chinese propagandists used ChatGPT to write and translate op-eds that they successfully planted in Spanish-language news outlets last fall, researchers said Friday.",
      "A report published by OpenAI, the company that owns the artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT, found that a pro-China campaign had used the program to produce 18 articles and op-eds that were published across eight Spanish-language media platforms. Four of the outlets are Peruvian, two Ecuadorian, one Mexican and one Spanish. None of the eight outlets responded to requests for comment.",
      "The articles don\u2019t mention China, but are broadly critical of the U.S., highlighting problems like homelessness, racism, crime and income inequality. Often the people using ChatGPT asked it to translate and expand the articles from existing ones originally written in Chinese, the researchers found.",
      "\u201cThe actor generated these articles by asking our models to translate and expand publicly available Chinese-language articles,\u201d the researchers wrote in the report.",
      "\u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve observed a likely Chinese influence actor successfully publishing articles in mainstream outlets in Latin America,\u201d they added.",
      "The researchers\u2019 findings came as part of OpenAI\u2019s quarterly threat report that also documented efforts by a variety of bad actors to use its tools in a variety of malicious ways, including generating fake articles about the Ghanaian presidential election and to perpetuate romance scams.",
      "One of the news outlets indicated an article was \u201csponsored,\u201d but the rest were presented as authentic opinions. Most were published in October 2024, in the lead-up to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference, held in Peru.",
      "Some of the articles have the byline of a company, Jilin Yousen Culture Communication Co., instead of a person. A profile of a company with that name on Chinese search engine Baidu describes it as a multimedia tech and public relations firm.",
      "A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "All of the articles are still live, and many were published the same day that ChatGPT produced them. The people who used the chatbot to generate the articles usually worked during daytime business hours in China, OpenAI found.",
      "The accounts that asked ChatGPT to write the op-eds also sometimes had the program write short posts in English that criticized a Chinese dissident, Cai Xia, which were posted by various accounts on X that purported to be people from the U.S. or India.",
      "For years, U.S. tech companies have accused pro-Chinese propagandists of using inauthentic accounts on Western social media platforms to target people around the world, including Americans, with messages that align with Beijing\u2019s priorities, like promoting the Chinese Communist Party, downplaying allegations of human rights abuses in China, or criticizing the U.S. China has consistently denied any such efforts.",
      "Those efforts sometimes involve significant investment but almost always fall flat, with few people interacting with them. The X posts tied to the Latin American op-ed campaign similarly did not appear to get any significant social media engagement, OpenAI said."

    "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 21:53:51 GMT",
    "summary": "DOGE wants access to filers\u2019 data, and the commerce secretary says Trump wants to scrap the IRS. But filing a return remains mandatory \u2014 the earlier the better, tax advisers say.",
    "story": [
      "This tax season is rife with uncertainty, as the world\u2019s richest person looks to shake up the Internal Revenue Service and the commerce secretary calls to eliminate it \u2014 but filers still need to carry on as usual, tax experts say.",
      "\u201cWhatever they\u2019re going to have to do to make their tax return accurate and true, they have to do,\u201d said Christina Wease, director of the Alvin. L. Storrs Low-Income Taxpayer Clinic at Michigan State University.",
      "\u201cIn the face of uncertainty,\u201d tax filers should consider getting their returns in as soon as they can, ideally electronically, said Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. \u201cThis was the case a few years ago with the pandemic,\u201d and the advice still holds true, she said \u2014 echoing a common refrain among tax advisers even in uneventful tax seasons.",
      "The current season has already been anything but.",
      "Alina Habba, an adviser to President Donald Trump, said at a conservative conference Thursday, \u201cWe\u2019re firing a bunch of the IRS today, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d Her remarks followed Associated Press reporting that thousands of probationary employees are slated to be cut this week.",
      "Late Wednesday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Fox News\u2019 Jesse Watters that Trump wants to \u201cabolish\u201d the IRS \u201cand let all the outsiders pay\u201d via trade policies including tariffs (which tax American importers, not foreign businesses or governments). Watters then told his more than 3 million followers on X that their \u201ctax rates, interest rates, and mortgage rates are going to come hammering down.\u201d",
      "\u201cAbolishing the IRS or even, say, cutting funding to the IRS doesn\u2019t alter our tax system at all,\u201d said Kathleen DeLaney Thomas, a tax law professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \u201cOnly Congress could decide to repeal the many statutes in the Internal Revenue Code that provide the framework for our federal tax system.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency initiative is pressing for access to an IRS database containing sensitive taxpayer information, an effort that has drawn a lawsuit alleging privacy and tax law violations. The plaintiffs also claim DOGE\u2019s request poses a potential conflict of interest, since the data could involve tax records and investigations of Musk\u2019s business competitors.",
      "Tax policy and legal experts say much remains to be seen about the extent of any access to filers\u2019 data DOGE may gain and what the group might do with it. Two sections of the IRS tax code protect the confidentiality of returns and prohibit executive branch influence over agency audits and investigations.",
      "\u201cFor decades, since we\u2019ve had these privacy laws enacted by Congress, it\u2019s pretty much just been understood that IRS civil servants handled this data,\u201d Thomas said.",
      "In recent weeks, DOGE has made an aggressive push to slash federal spending and root out purported fraud and abuse across the government. While some of the initiative\u2019s high-profile claims have been called into question or included errors, conservative pundits and administration officials continue to promote them.",
      "\u201cWaste, fraud, and abuse have been deeply entrenched in our broken system for far too long,\u201d said White House spokesperson Harrison Fields, reiterating a statement he provided Sunday to NBC News. \u201cIt takes direct access to the system to identify and fix it.\u201d",
      "The IRS didn\u2019t respond to NBC News\u2019 requests for comment.",
      "In the meantime, taxpayers are still staring down the usual deadline to file their returns and have few ways to protect themselves from any potential fallout from non-IRS staffers\u2019 possible involvement.",
      "\u201cWe do not yet know the impact on IRS operations but are monitoring closely to ensure we can help hardworking Americans get every dollar they deserve,\u201d said a spokesperson for H&R Block, a major tax preparer. \u201cWhat we do know is tax returns are still due by April 15th.\u201d",
      "Holtzblatt said the DOGE efforts have caused \u201ca lot of uncertainty and a lot of concern ... [that] will be spilling over to the rest of us during this filing season, and particularly those of us who have concerns with how our tax information is used.\u201d",
      "But she emphasized that filing a correct and complete return isn\u2019t optional. If taxpayers are concerned about DOGE employees potentially seeing their bank account information, they could opt not to receive refunds via direct deposit. The IRS also offers checks by mail, but that could take longer.",
      "Mary Clements Evans, a certified financial planner in Emmaus, Pennsylvania, has been advising clients not to file their returns by mail either, citing the reports of workforce cuts at the IRS. \u201cThose paper filings, they\u2019re going to require people looking at them,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of the great things the IRS has done over the years is they\u2019ve automated the processes.\u201d",
      "Evans said she\u2019s now fielding clients\u2019 concerns about how changes at the agency might affect returns this year. Many taxpayers rely on the IRS for support, partly because of an ongoing shortage of certified public accountants, and she said she\u2019s worried that staff firings could leave filers with fewer free resources. But she echoed other tax experts in saying it remains a good idea to file sooner rather than later.",
      "\u201cAs far as the vast majority of individuals who are filing, they can go ahead and file,\u201d Evans said.",
      "Holtzblatt suggested using the IRS\u2019 new Direct File tool since it\u2019s less labor-intensive. The free filing system was piloted last year and has since expanded to 25 states.",
      "For fiscal year 2023, the IRS processed nearly 271.5 million tax returns and other forms, and issued $659.1 billion in returns, according to agency data. Taxpayers submit a wide variety of personal information in those documents, all of which helps calculate their tax liability. IRS employees then view taxpayers\u2019 returns to verify their filing status, exemptions and deductions before administering a refund if due. If something seems off, or if a taxpayer is selected for a random audit, the IRS will reach out via mail to request further information.",
      "The IRS database that DOGE is trying to access, called the Integrated Data Retrieval System, contains a slew of data that\u2019s central to this process. IRS employees are allowed to access it on a need-to-know basis, said Nina Olson, who served as the national taxpayer advocate at the IRS from 2001 to 2019. Agency staffers, usually auditors or case advocates, can use the IDRS to pull up individuals\u2019 tax returns, which can include from their Social Security numbers and income to details about their health histories and dependents.",
      "\u201cYou have to specify what you are going to be doing in order to be able to meet statutory requirements for having access to return information,\u201d Olson said, who herself did not have access to the IDRS in her role at the time. \u201cOtherwise, it\u2019s a crime to access it.\u201d",
      "Normally, IRS systems containing taxpayer data are secure and information is locked down, said Amy O\u2019Hara, executive director of the Georgetown University Research Data Center, which deals with federal statistics. She said breaches are rare, usually personnel-related and punished quickly.",
      "Under current laws, DOGE staffers would have to meet the same requirements to access the IDRS as any other contractor or employee, O\u2019Hara said.",
      "\u201cThere are these checks and balances in place to ensure the integrity of the systems,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just need to make sure that that integrity holds.\u201d"

      "\u201cI am become meme,\u201d Musk said, opening what would become something of a rambling interview, during which he said DOGE was \u201cfighting the Matrix\u201d and advocated for establishing a live tour of Fort Knox, the legendary depository in Kentucky, so that Americans can see the country\u2019s gold reserves.",
      "While Musk wasn\u2019t the most electrifying speaker at the conference, CPAC attendees still rallied around him.",
      "Throughout the day, Musk was a main topic of discussion and top conservative figures \u2014 even those who had disparaged him just the day before \u2014 made efforts to kiss his ring on stage.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi, Florida Sen. Rick Scott, Missouri Sen. Eric Schmitt and House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana all praised Musk for his work with the Department of Government Efficiency, the newly created vehicle for Trump\u2019s agenda.",
      "Even Bannon put aside his beef with Musk for the day. In his speech right after Musk\u2019s remarks, he praised DOGE\u2019s cuts and called him \u201cSuperman.\u201d\u00a0Bannon also seemed to flash his own salute that was similar to one Musk used in January.",
      "Afterward, at an event Bannon hosted in Washington, D.C., at Butterworth\u2019s \u2014 a Capitol Hill restaurant that has become the new hangout for the MAGA crowd and where the line stretched down the block \u2014 he continued to speak in a more complimentary way about Musk, calling him a \u201cgenius engineer\u201d in an interview with NBC News.",
      "\u201cYou saw him today. He can\u2019t really talk but, man, he\u2019s \u2018boom.\u2019 He\u2019s engineering, mathematics,\u201d Bannon said.",
      "It\u2019s a starkly different tone from what Bannon has publicly taken in the past about Musk. Bannon has built a reputation for nationalist politics focused on American workers and for an anti-China crusade. He has railed against \u201ctechnofeudalism,\u201d stoking fears that a reliance on technology platforms is making serfs out of people who have no choice but to rent digital space. And while he has praised Musk\u2019s federal slash-and-burn campaign and spending to elect Trump, he\u2019s clashed with the billionaire titan and other tech figures, whom he has likened to oligarchs, over policies like immigration.",
      "In December, Musk feuded with MAGA figures, including Bannon, who criticized him and other tech leaders for their support for the H-1B visa program, which gives temporary visas to highly skilled foreign workers. Trump eventually spoke out in support of the program.",
      "In January, Bannon called Musk \u201ca truly evil person\u201d and promised that he would oust him from Trump\u2019s camp \u201cby the time he\u2019s inaugurated.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday, the British outlet UnHeard published an interview with Bannon in which he reportedly called Musk \u201ca parasitic illegal immigrant\u201d who \u201cwants to impose his freak experiments and play-act as God without any respect for the country\u2019s history, values or traditions.\u201d The following day, Bannon called Musk an \u201coligarch\u201d who\u00a0doesn\u2019t \u201csupport MAGA.\u201d",
      "And he told NBC News on Thursday that Musk has \u201ca big evil brain.\u201d",
      "Trump advisers acknowledge the public tension that has presented itself between Musk and Bannon, but they have largely downplayed the simmering feud.",
      "\u201cIt is what it is,\u201d a Trump adviser said. \u201cWe know both are on the team in various ways, I don\u2019t think the boss cares that much about it as long as they are helping our agenda.\u201d",
      "The person noted that Trump at times actually likes to see his political advisers jockey for position, something he has been well known for going back to his first term in 2017.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think he hates it,\u201d the person said. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor to be on the team, and sometimes sharp elbows are required.\u201d",
      "Nigel Farage, leader of Britain\u2019s right-wing Reform U.K. party who had recently been involved in a spat with Musk over the tech mogul\u2019s support of an anti-immigrant activist, also made a point of praising tech billionaire on stage Thursday, calling him a \u201chero of free speech.\u201d",
      "CPAC attendees also generally seemed to go along with Musk\u2019s new positioning in the Republican Party, even as many had disagreements with or reservations about him.",
      "\u201cI do love Elon Musk,\u201d said Carter Long, president of Xavier University College Republicans in Ohio, \u201cand now is the time where we can kind of have these interparty debates and discussions.\u201d",
      "Long said that Musk and others put in \u201ctremendous effort to win,\u201d and now Republicans can figure out in which direction the party will go.",
      "\u201cIf Musk can prove to be successful with DOGE and with these spending cuts and actually reduce the deficit without touching entitlements, I think that would be one of the greatest victories that any political movement in the history of our country could claim,\u201d he said."

      "As the rich have gotten richer, family offices have exploded in popularity, numbering 8,000 worldwide and managing some $3.1 trillion in assets, according to\u00a0Deloitte. Family office-tailored events and conferences have followed.",
      "There were 123 such family-office conferences in 2024, and nearly twice as many \u2014 244 \u2014 are scheduled for this year, according to Dakota Marketplace, a research firm for investment sales professionals.",
      "\u201cPeople are interested in this world because it\u2019s growing so fast, and it\u2019s a pool of capital,\u201d said Paul Carbone, co-founder and vice chairman of Pritzker Private Capital and a member of the steering committee for a\u00a0family-office initiative\u00a0at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. The initiative hosts gatherings for family offices and said it\u2019s seen an uptick in demand.",
      "\u201cOne of the things that was clear was that families are interested in having a dialogue among themselves, where there\u2019s shared experiences, shared challenges, shared opportunities, where they can compare notes,\u201d Carbone said.",
      "Carbone divides these events into four categories: commercial conferences, events sponsored by major institutions such as banks, gatherings organized by families, and academic family gatherings.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s trillions of dollars in the family space, and relatively little directly goes into the private equity world,\u201d he added. \u201cIf users of capital can tap into that sizable pool of capital, it can behoove them and benefit them.\u201d",
      "Raphael \u201cRaffi\u201d Amit, professor of management at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, has witnessed the momentum firsthand. The Wharton Global Family Alliance, founded and led by Amit, has hosted family-office gatherings for more than two decades.",
      "Wharton\u2019s gatherings are intimate, capped at 60 participants from family offices, and not sponsored. But the lion\u2019s share of family-office conferences is dominated by sponsors and vendors, he said.",
      "\u201cFamilies hate \u2014 according to our survey \u2014 when they go to these conferences and all these vendors bombard them with all sorts of offers,\u201d Amit said. \u201cWe organize it for families, by families, and so as a result, the content is very, very different.\u201d",
      "All the same, event sponsors are eager to get the attention of this elite clientele.",
      "This week marked the return of Anthony Ritossa, a well-known figure in European and Middle East family-office circles. The former hedge-fund salesman was behind the\u00a024th Annual Global Family Office Investment Summit\u00a0in Miami, a two-day bash Feb. 18-19 at the Trump International Beach Resort.",
      "Ritossa, who for many years went by \u201cSir Anthony,\u201d built a name hosting conferences for family offices and investors eager to court them. He has since dropped the \u201cSir\u201d and was the subject of a yearlong investigation and 2022 article by\u00a0Vanity Fair, which raised questions about the legitimacy of his credentials and business practices.",
      "Vanity Fair, citing past attendees of the conferences, reported that Ritossa had misrepresented his background and charged sponsors between $18,000 and $200,000 on hopes of landing family-office investments that rarely materialized.",
      "Ritossa described the Vanity Fair reporting as \u201cinaccurate\u201d but declined to comment to CNBC on any specifics. When reached for comment by CNBC, he repeatedly offered invitations to the Miami conference with a ticket \u201cprovided gratis\u201d to \u201cexperience it firsthand,\u201d which CNBC did not accept.",
      "After the Vanity Fair article, Ritossa hosted another family-office summit in February 2023 and then largely stepped back from the spotlight. He sold one of his limited liability companies to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, according to the American think tank\u2019s chairman, Lakshmi Narayanan.",
      "Ritossa did not address questions from CNBC about the sale of his business.",
      "His latest summit series kicked off in Dubai with events in October and December 2024 emceed by an anchor for Dubai-based CNBC Arabia, a licensee of CNBC that operates the Arabic language business news channel. Attendees included sheikhs and the CEO of the Raffles Family Office, Chi-man Kwan.",
      "The impression, at least on the surface, is that Ritossa has mounted a comeback.",
      "The Miami event invitation said the summit would bring together a coterie of more than 250 high-net-worth individuals, family offices, members of Middle East royalty, and others, representing more than $1 trillion in investable assets. The\u00a0list\u00a0of 148 speakers and honored guests included some family-office principals and staff but was a largely disparate cohort, with speakers representing various industries, from crypto to medical tourism. Miami Mayor Francis Suarez was interviewed for a fireside chat.",
      "For some attendees, the reputation of conference guests, not the hosts, is most important.",
      "\u201cWithin the family-office community, events are more about which families show up than who organized it,\u201d said Jonathan Zaback, co-founder of public relations firm Impact Partners, which represents several summit speakers. \u201cPeople still attend because of who they know will be there. Families go where they feel they will meet other people and friends. For some, these events are one of the few times a year they get to see each other.\u201d",

      "Long story short, Taylor thought she recognized Daniel when she met him for the first time after getting engaged and began to suspect that the 30-year-old sales account executive previously followed her on Instagram. The 32-year-old colonoscopy nurse then confronted him the next day.",

      "Taylor Haag and Daniel Hastings' relationship journey on 'Love Is Blind'",
      "Taylor and Daniel's chemistry was apparent early on in the dating experiment and their conversations were filled with witty banter. Daniel even joked about proposing just minutes after they started talking.",
      "The couple's shared love of Christmas brought them even closer and they exchanged ornaments and stockings in Episode 5.",
      "Flash forward to Episode 6 and Daniel was ready to pop the question. He read Taylor a romantic letter that described his feelings, saying, \u201cAll I want to do is make you feel safe and make you happy for the rest of your life.\u201d",
      "Taylor gladly accepted the proposal and the couple prepared to meet face-to-face for the first time.",
      "The Instagram mystery, explained",
      "When the newly engaged couple met in person, things appeared to go well. Twenty-four hours later, Taylor spoke to producers in a confessional interview while holding back tears.",
      "\u201cWhen the doors first opened and I saw Daniel, I thought, \u2018He\u2019s so familiar to me.\u2019 But I couldn\u2019t place it. Is he familiar cause I\u2019ve pictured\u00a0his face through a wall 15 million times? Is he familiar cause I\u2019ve heard his voice? I have this overwhelming feeling that when the doors opened last night, that was not the first time that he saw me,\u201d she explained.",
      "Taylor went on to say that she remembered getting an Instagram follow request a few months before that could have been Daniel.",
      "\"I'm fairly positive that Daniel followed me on Instagram not long before coming to the show. I just remember seeing this one picture from this account of him being in front of a Christmas tree in a chair with his leg up with a drink. And that picture, for some reason, stuck in my head. I never followed the account back,\" she said.",
      "Taylor then explained why this was so concerning to her.",
      "\"I have\u00a0very specific things in my bio on my Instagram. It says I'm a registered nurse. It says I love Taco Bell. It says that family and faith are important to me. All these major things,\" she said. \"I have a Christmas highlight of how much I love Christmas. I just can't help but feel like there's so much of me there.\"",
      "Taylor admitted that she felt very torn and wasn't sure what to believe.",
      "\"I really care about Daniel and I've grown to love him in the pods. But I also can't ignore gut feelings. I believe he knew exactly what I looked like the entire time we were talking through the wall,\" she said.",
      "So, did Daniel follow Taylor on Instagram? What he said",
      "When the couple met to discuss the matter in person, Daniel wasn't sure what was going on, but he immediately reassured his fianc\u00e9e, saying, \"Whatever you need to say, it's OK.\"",
      "After Taylor recapped her fears, Daniel said he didn't follow her on Instagram.",
      "\"I mean, you followed me and then you unfollowed me,\" she said.",
      "\"I don't know why I would've followed you and unfollowed you,\" he replied.",
      "Taylor asked Daniel about the profile picture she remembered seeing.",
      "\"I have more Christmas pictures, but none of them were in front of a Christmas tree,\" he said.",
      "Meanwhile, internet sleuths have connected this conversation with a photo on Daniel's Instagram of him sitting in front of a Christmas tree.",
      "\"I hope you can see that my brain is freaking me out that you may have put the pieces together in the pods,\" she said.",
      "Daniel insisted that he saw Taylor for \"the first time\" the day before.",
      "\"I would've told production halfway through if I'd recognized anything,\" he said.",
      "Taylor noted that she has an app downloaded on her phone that allows her to track her followers. She was tempted to put the mystery to rest by checking the app.",
      "\"It's very possible that at one point I followed you and unfollowed you. It's possible. I don't know why I would've. I don't remember it. I just don't remember it. I remember faces. If I saw you, I'd remember,\" Daniel responded.",
      "A producer then asked if Taylor wanted to check her phone and she did. After scrolling for a while, she couldn't seem to find Daniel's name on her list of follow requests.",
      "\"Now I feel crazy,\" she said.",
      "\"No, please don't feel crazy. My feelings for you haven't changed and I hope ... Do you believe me?\" he asked.",
      "\"I do but you didn't\u00a0know. Maybe you did follow me at some point,\" she replied.",
      "\"I promise you I didn't know (what you looked like). I promise. Whatever you need to do to process, I'm OK with,\" he said.",
      "Looking to the future, Daniel let Taylor know he would follow her lead on how she wanted to proceed.",
      "\"I'd love to go to Honduras with you. If you have reservations about that, I'd love to go back home with you. Either way, wherever you go, I'm in,\" he said.",
      "In a confessional interview, Taylor expressed her gratitude for the way Daniel handled the conversation.",
      "\"I love that he's patient and I feel really bad because I'm sure on the way here, his brain was a million pieces ... It's been a very emotional experience to this point,\" she said.",
      "Taylor also elaborated on why the mystery shook her up so much in her private interview.",
      "\"I was scared that he knew physically everything about me and that's what the connection was built on. But it wasn't,\" she said.",
      "What else has Taylor Haag said about the incident?",
      "Taylor spoke to Glamour about her time on the season and specifically shared why the idea of Daniel following her on Instagram was so upsetting.",
      "\u201cThe primary concern was that he knew what I looked like during the experiment,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m guilty, too, of judging people off their looks, and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s been done to me. I wanted that to be completely removed from this entire situation. Hence,\u00a0'Love Is Blind.' So the thought of that very premise being compromised was terrifying to me.\u201d"

      "While in the pods, Devin also formed a connection with Brittany Dodson, but the relationship fizzled out when she realized he was too \u201crigid\u201d and didn\u2019t seem like the ideal partner. He agreed and continued to pursue Virginia, who had been reserved and skeptical during many of their conversations.",
      "In Episode 6, Devin wrote a sweet letter to Virginia expressing his feelings. \u201cVirginia, you are the most kind, loving and genuine person I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d he praised. \u201cI know that in your past relationships, they made you feel insecure and undervalued. But I promise to always make you feel valued, loved, and to make you feel like the queen that you are.\u201d",
      "At the end of his letter, he told Virginia he loved her and asked her to marry him. \u201cYes, I will,\u201d she softly replied. She later told the cameras through tears, \u201cI haven\u2019t felt like this ever. I just feel amazing. Today\u2019s a good day.\u201d",

      "They also bonded over their love of Christmas. In Episode 5, they gifted each other Christmas ornaments and stockings and marveled over their similarities. \u201cThe Christmas thing means a lot to me,\u201d Daniel said. \u201cBut even if it wasn\u2019t Christmas stuff, I feel like we were meant to find each other.\u201d",

After the face-to-face reveal, Taylor told the cameras she had an eerie feeling that she recognized Daniel. She spiraled, recalling that a social media user who looked like Daniel briefly followed her on Instagram before she left to film the show.",
      "She met Daniel and voiced her concerns, explaining that she worried he already knew facts based on her profile and used the prior knowledge to woo her. He said he couldn't remember following her and that her description didn't exactly match his account. To confirm the truth, she scrolled through a list of Instagram users who had previously followed her. When she couldn't find his name, she apologized. He was understanding and said he still wanted to take the trip with her Honduras.",
      "The two quickly moved past the tiff and enjoyed their vacation in Honduras. After they returned, they met each other's families and gushed about their connection. Daniel also introduced his parents to Taylor's mom and dad, who stressed that divorce wasn't an option in their family.",

But in Episode 5, Dave cried as he told Molly that he wanted to \u201csee things through\u201d with Lauren instead. Molly was hurt but said she knew if he didn\u2019t want her then it wasn\u2019t meant to be.",

      "He proposed and she quickly accepted. \u201cI love you so much, too. I\u2019m excited to just start a future with you,\u201d she said.",
      "In the pods, Dave repeatedly mentioned that his sister's opinions of his partners played a big role in his past relationships. Although fans still haven't met her, the weight of her apparent disapproval and the mistrust of Dave's friends negatively impacted his romance with Lauren in the second group of episodes.",
      "As soon as Dave and Lauren returned to Minneapolis, he complained that friends and family members learned about his engagement before he told them. Then, Dave revealed that an acquaintance claimed he had been dating Lauren up until she left to go on \"Love Is Blind.\" Lauren denied his timeline of events and said that she had ended their casual fling. She said that the acquaintance wanted to create drama.",

      "Joey and Monica",
      "Joey Leveille and Monica Danus\u2019 time in the pods was drama-free. Joey, a 35-year-old physician associate, and Monica, a 28-year-old digital marketer, seemed to only form a bond with each other. They quickly connected thanks to their bubbly and quirky personalities and their love for \u201cThe Sound of Music.\u201d Joey also supported Monica when she revealed that she was between jobs because she needed to take time off to help her family.",
      "By Episode 2, they already knew that they wanted to get engaged and leave the pods together, making them the first official couple of Season 8.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve had an incredible time falling in love with who you are as a person, your laugh, your voice, and I would love to take the next step with you,\u201d Joey said.",

      "Joey and Monica spent their time in Honduras learning more about each other and their idiosyncrasies, like her family's shared \"sock bin.\" It appeared the two would have a drama-free path to the finale \u2014 until Joey met Monica's family.",
      "While her parents were welcoming and invited Joey to participate in their family jam session, Monica's older sister, Nicolle, quietly eyed Joey from her seat. When she pulled Monica to have a private conversation outside, Nicolle mentioned that Joey wasn't her sister's usual type. She also said that as the older sister she always felt she would get married first.",
      "At their apartment, Joey shared that he could tell Nicolle didn't warm to him. After Monica revealed what she spoke about with Nicolle, Joey suggested that jealousy might be the cause of Nicolle's disapproval.",
      "Ben and Sara",
      "Ben Mezzenga and Sara Carton briefly struggled in the pods when they started discussing their values. In Episode 2, Sara, a 29-year-old oncology nurse, asked Ben, a 28-year-old developer, about growing up in a Christian household. He explained his beliefs before she revealed that she wasn\u2019t religious.",
      "\u201cThe main thing for me that\u2019s really tough about religion is my sister, Lisa. She\u2019s my best friend. She\u2019s gay,\u201d she explained. She asked if Ben would be comfortable around her sister and would go to Pride activities with them.",
      "\u201cYeah, no discomfort around that community at all,\u201d he replied. She felt confident in their connection, but when they met again in Episode 4, she had some more concerns. She mentioned Donald Trump\u2019s first presidency and the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m kind of ignorant towards that stuff. Like, I didn\u2019t vote in the last election. As long as I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s not going to do much, so\u2026\u201d Ben said. When she asked directly about BLM, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not one way or the other. I just kind of keep out of it.\u201d",
      "Sara replied, \u201cI think it\u2019s very valuable and important to think about those things.\u201d\u00a0 She later said she didn\u2019t like his responses to her questions. \u201cBasic human rights, equality, I need someone to be on the same page with me about that,\u201d she said.",
      "Ben assured her in Episode 5 that their values aligned. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to have any burden or any weight on your shoulder thinking that you have to teach me because I do have that motivation to grow into that and that internal feeling that we do have the same beliefs in these things,\u201d he said before proposing.",
      "\u201cI feel so at peace and accepted by you,\u201d she said after accepting his proposal. \u201cI honestly can\u2019t imagine being with anyone else.\u201d",
      "Ben and Sara landed in Honduras and swiftly decided to build on their emotional connection by exploring a physical relationship. When all the engaged couples reunited, Ben and Sara could not stop gushing about how well they got along.",
      "In Minneapolis, Sara met a few of Ben's friends. Sara shared details about their conversation about values in the pods and his friends confirmed that he was an inclusive person.",
      "Sara and Ben continued to progress until the two had an uncomfortable conversation at the end of Episode 9. She gasped twice after learning that a woman on TikTok posted a video calling out some of the \"s----- men\" on the Season 8 cast, without identifying the male cast members.",
      "Ben, who had already seen the video, said, \"I think she is referencing me.\" He also shared that he blocked the user and she blocked him.",
      "When Sara pressed him to further explain the situation, he said he hadn't spoken to the woman in over four years and that he was \"uncertain\" about what else she would reveal. He added that she was \"overreacting.\" Sara cautioned him that if he wasn't being forthcoming then the trust between them would be broken.",

      "The two seemed headed for an engagement until Madison revealed she had an avoidant attachment style. Alex suddenly became less talkative and their conversation ended abruptly.",
      "When they met again, Alex voiced his concerns that Madison would run if they faced an obstacle. She told him that her still being in the experiment was proof that she was ready to go through challenging times with him. Meanwhile, Madison was also building a connection with Mason Horacen.",
      "Mason told Madison he was \u201ccommitted\u201d to her. But when Madison decided to pursue her relationship with Alex instead, Mason regretted what he said. In Episode 6, Madison explained the situation to Alex.",
      "Alex said he sympathized with Mason and wished him well. Madison didn\u2019t appreciate that Alex wasn\u2019t more comforting toward her.\u00a0 After their tense conversation, Alex said he could see a future with her but he was worried they would struggle with communication and disagreements. \u201cI think at this point, it\u2019s a pretty big jump. We\u2019re not at a point to get engaged,\u201d he said.",
      "Madison tearfully departed the pods and left the experiment.",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, Alex said he had no regrets over ending the relationship.",
      "\"I was confident in the decision. If we could go back and do things again, I think it would have unfolded the same way. I\u2019m glad that we got all of the issues out on the table the way we did so we could make that decision early on instead of moving forward and proposing and then going on the trip and then living together. I think it would have been a lot messier if that were to happen,\" he said.",
      "His decision came down to attachment style and conflict resolution, as it appeared in the pods. \"I think she has different ways of dealing with conflict than I do, and again, that\u2019s totally fine. There\u2019s nothing right or wrong with either way, but I think we just realized that we are both on very different pages and that communication wasn\u2019t going to be easy,\" he said.",

      "He said he validated the \u201cwrong person\u201d because he was \u201cconfused\u201d at the time.",

To defend himself, Wes warned that he would target anyone who voted against him. His tactic didn't work and pushed the Faithfuls in the opposite direction, making them vote to banish him. \"The Challenge\" star delivered one of his signature boastful speeches before he left, calling himself \"one of the greatest reality competition players of all time.\" He added, \"I don't care about any of you. You are all chess pieces on a board. And so to all those people that have died until I got to this circle right here, I have no idea who killed them because I'm a Faithful.\"",
      "Derrick Levasseur",
      "Derrick Levasseur took a chance during the roundtable in Episode 6 and voiced his theory about Rob being a traitor. The next episode, his boldness came back to bite him. When the Traitors met in secret at the beginning of Episode 7, they begrudgingly decided the \"Big Brother\" winner needed to go to help rebuild trust between them. As Derrick learned his fate, he was unsurprised. \"I knew that after I called out Rob directly last night, and he chose to instead go at Wes, that he was not going to give me another roundtable, which I guess I have to take as a compliment,\" Derrick said. He proudly added, \"I'm the most dangerous person in here for the Traitors, and they know it.\" He said he would have made the same move and that he was \"honored\" to have been a part of the season.",
      "Rob 'Boston Rob' Mariano",
      "Rob's smooth-talking and cunning ways could no longer save him by Episode 7. Before he departed, Derrick planted seeds to his fellow Faithfuls, cautioning them that Rob was a Traitor. At breakfast, Rob posed the theory that the Traitors had murdered Derrick to make the \"Survivor\" star look guilty. But \"Vanderpump Rules\" star Tom Sandoval was unconvinced and realized that it was the third time a Faithful was murdered after publicly going against Rob. So, Tom presented that evidence during the roundtable, hoping that others would jump on board. After everyone voted, Rob received a majority of votes \u2014 including two from his fellow Traitors \u2014 and was banished, ending his masterful run this season. \"First of all, I just want to tell all of you that I have really enjoyed meeting you and playing this game with you. I've had a ton of fun,\" he said during his final speech. \"I am, and always have been, from the very beginning, a Traitor.\"",
      "Chrishell Stause",
      "At the start of Episode 8, Chrishell Stause was one of the few remaining players that did not secure a shield in the previous mission. So, she had to dress to the nines and go to the chapel to learn if the Traitors decided to murder her. While the other vulnerable players turned around and saw Cumming waiting for them near the pews, Chrishell came face to face with the two remaining Traitors. The \"Selling Sunset\" star seemed slightly shocked as she discovered the Traitors' identities. They explained that she would've never been banished, so they needed to eliminate her. \"That's unfortunate,\" Chrishell simply said. In her final confessional interview, she said that all of the Faithfuls had been \"idiots\" and that one particular Traitor was \"playing the best game.\" She added, \"I wasn't ready to leave. But, if I must go, I appreciate the fabulous send off.\"",
      "Ciara Miller",
      "The remaining Faithfuls desperately searched for any evidence that could point them in the direction of a Traitor. Sam Asghari suggested that the group revisit the theory that one of the Traitors was in the coffins in Episode 3. With Jeremy murdered and Nikki banished, that left Ciara as the only possible option. At the round table in Episode 8, Ciara explained that her passionate speech after she was placed in the coffin was an example of her pleading for her life in the game. She also tried to cast doubt on two contestants. But, the other players did not trust her and all voted to banish the \"Summer House\" star. \"I don't really do speeches, but I'll always go down fighting. I'm never succumbing to anyone,\" she said during her final remarks. \"Even the Traitors, because I am a Faithful.\"",
      "Sam Asghari",
      "Episode 9 began with the remaining Traitors, once again, butting heads about the next murder. They ultimately agreed that murdering Sam would be the best move. They pointed out that he was improving at picking up on suspicious behavior and that other Faithfuls were starting to listen to him. When the actor learned his stint on the show was over, he was unsurprised. \"Alright, my time has come to an end,\" he said. \"I was sort of expecting this. I had some good ideas around the roundtable. I was getting good at it and the only way to get me out of the castle was to murder me.\" He said he was leaving with no regrets. \"I've played with honor, respect, I got to know people, and I got to have fun. So I wouldn't change one thing.\"",
      "Carolyn Wiger",
      "Carolyn's run as the most undetected Traitor in the game came to a dramatic end in Episode 9. Throughout the episode, Carolyn started to hint to other players that they shouldn't trust her fellow Traitor Danielle. Meanwhile, Danielle was secretly plotting to expose Carolyn as a Traitor. In the chess game mission, Danielle took a back seat while Carolyn was vocal, making the other players think for the first time that something was off. Then at the roundtable, Danielle showed off her convincing debate skills. She called Carolyn out for attacking her in a previous episode, noting that eliminated Traitors were very aggressive at the roundtable. Carolyn attempted to create a counter argument but was unsuccessful. After getting voted out, she tearfully approached the circle of truth and said, \"I'm somebody who, every day of my life, am judged because of who I am, my differences, my quirks.\" She revealed that she avoided building connections because of how emotional she is. \"Playing this game, it's not easy for me,\" she continued. \"I just wanted to have fun! But I have to get real with myself. Being a Traitor isn't fun.\""

Because it's very easy to praise and think about the impact of first responders when dealing with such a widespread, media-covered emergency, but we don't always think about them in quieter times. And so it's just a reminder that the show is there to try and make sure that that spotlight on them is constant, because they are always there at the ready.",

      "I think he obviously wants to be there for Eddie and be supportive, but it's hard not to also think about yourself in that situation and what he's losing in the fight that Eddie has to go and get his son back.",

And Buck's really going to be put into that place of feeling abandoned, and he's going to react to it in a really \u2014 and I don't say this about myself, I say this about the story \u2014 a really cute way, that I think will go down very well with viewers of the show.",
      "I guess if I was to think about it, I don't think they necessarily would have been really in contact. You know, I feel like maybe that would feel like going around Eddie, or going behind Eddie's back, maybe. Or even if Eddie was aware of it, maybe just making Eddie jealous, because Eddie can't have that relationship with him. So I think Buck has kind of not tried to intervene too much in the situation, or not insert himself into the situation, because as much as he is a part of their life, you know, that is his son, and I don't think you would want to overstep too much. So, yeah, I actually don't think that Buck is in contact with Christopher and that he's kind of letting Eddie handle his business and just being there at the ready if needed.",
      "I think we've seen \u2014\u00a0and obviously Buck is also post-breakup, you know, he has a lot of things and he seems to just kind of be running, not from them, but through them. Keeping himself busy, whether it be the baking, whether it be work \u2014\u00a0just keeping things happening so that maybe he doesn't have too much time to stop and think, which, you know, always catches up with you eventually. But I kind of feel like that's where we find Buck at the moment. He's just keeping himself occupied so that the silence and the thoughts don't creep in.",
      "I have experienced that in some of the earlier seasons. I think it was hard to quiet that noise. And then once you read one thing or another, it's difficult to not let it seep in, you know? But I've kind of found the balance, and I don't think, as an actor on the show, I don't think you should be involved in fandom of the show, and I don't think you should read fandom of the show. I think your job is your job, and you have to make the thing, and then it gets given over to the fans to do whatever they want with it. And so, actually finding that boundary between the two has been really, really healthy for me.",
      "Season Eight, this season. It's definitely a newer thing for me. But, you know, listen, anytime I'm on a social media app, and anything \"9-1-1\" or anything Oliver Stark-related comes up, I gleefully (click) \"not interested in this post\" and get it out of my algorithm. And it's really helped me just kind of think more positively about it. So, yeah, it's a newer thing, but something that I'm really happy that I made a step towards.",
      "Episode 11 I think is really special. Not even just because of story, but one of our own directed it. One of the cast directed it, which is the first time that's happened on the show. So that was a really special experience for me. Not me the director, me the actor on the show. It's not me.",
      "I think I'm really excited for that to air, just because, I just think it's a really special moment, and it's this particular actor's first time doing it. So, yeah, just, it felt like a big moment.",
      "I think so. I\u2019m pretty sure it'll be revealed ahead of time, but I think they are keeping it secret for now."

      "Another added, \u201cNorth West was not good in The Lion King. And her family/production did her no favors in letting her go on anyway. Not all kids are good at all things and they need to be taught that. There were likely dozens of experienced kids that should have been cast.\"",
      "Kardashian anticipated the backlash in the Season 6, Episode 3 of \u201cThe Kardashians.\"",

      "Their new song \u201cHey,\u201d Littrell tells TODAY.com, was originally created for their ninth studio album, 2019's \u201cDNA.\u201d At the time, the song didn\u2019t quite match sonically with the rest of the album.",
      "Littrell adds, \u201cWe were trying to cram it in last minute, and it just didn\u2019t work. So we were like, \u2018Hey, this is a gem. It\u2019s special.\u2019 We wanted to hold on to it and the time came around, this announcement happened, it was like, \u2018Oh my gosh, what better way to present a brand-new song?\u2019 So it turned out perfect.\u201d",
      "Fans will also get to hear the alternate version of \u201cI Want It That Way\u201d that the group says \u201cmakes sense,\u201d a nod to fans\u2019 questions over the years about what the original song actually means. Instead of \u201ctell me why,\u201d the lyrics are switched up with versions of \u201cno goodbyes,\u201d \u201cno more lies\u201d and \u201cthat is why.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have the rhyming scheme, it doesn\u2019t have the feel. You\u2019re going to understand why we chose to go with the other one,\u201d Richardson explains, with McLean adding that \u201csome of the lyrics are the same, but the majority is completely different.\u201d",
      "A look to the future and Grammy aspirations",
      "Dorough recalls a moment when they first started as a group and were touring high schools.",
      "\u201cThe microphones went out, we sang a cappella and still won all those kids over,\u201d Dorough says. \u201cRight from the beginning, we instilled that we can get through anything.\u201d",
      "With almost 32 years of history, the Backstreet pride is alive and well. Their accomplishments include millions of records sold, a slew of awards, a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and the distinction as the first pop band at Sphere, but the group is still holding out for one specific accolade.",
      "\u201cIt would be an honor for us to get established into our career with having a Grammy and the acknowledgement of that,\u201d Dorough says. \u201cThat\u2019s something I think we\u2019ve always had on our bucket list. And we\u2019ve been nominated, what, nine times? Every time we get it, we always get beat out by somebody about 30 years into the industry before us. So we\u2019re getting closer to that 30 years now, to maybe get one ourselves.\u201d",
      "According to the Grammys\u2019 website, the group has been nominated for eight awards. Their last nomination was in 2019 for best pop duo/group performance for their song \u201cDon\u2019t Go Breaking My Heart\u201d from \u201cDNA.\u201d Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper took the win for \u201cShallow.\u201d",
      "Despite the loss, McLean says, \u201cIt\u2019s just been this steady incline for us, and it\u2019s just been a blessing that we\u2019re still doing this 32 years later.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have the best fans in the world that keep wanting us to come back,\u201d he continues. \u201cAnd it just seems to happen organically, that opportunities like Sphere reignite this flame. They inspire us and it gets us excited again.\u201d"

Unlike Belle, Milla actually has cancer. (The real Belle Gibson admitted\u00a0to lying about having cancer in an interview with Australia\u2019s\u00a0The Weekly\u00a0in 2015.)",
      "In the show, doctors find a rare cancer \u2013 called pleomorphic sarcoma undifferentiated \u2014 in Milla\u2019s arm. Rather than follow their recommendations and amputate, the 22-year-old opts for an alternate medical regimen involving juice and coffee enemas. She builds a career on the idea that she healed her cancer holistically. It seems to work for a while, until the cancer comes back. This time, the spread is fatal and Milla dies.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the facts and fiction of Milla.",
      "Who is Milla Blake based on in real life?",
      "\u201cMilla is an amalgamation of wellness influencers at the time,\u201d Debnam-Carey tells\u00a0TODAY.com. \u201cWe created Milla as her own thing. That was what was so great about it \u2026 we could boost her up so that she could be going toe-to-toe with Belle.\u201d",
      "She says the character was inspired in part by\u00a0Jessica Ainscough, the editor of a teen magazine who was diagnosed with epithelioid sarcoma, a rare cancer, when she was 22, and nicknamed\u00a0herself\u00a0\u201cThe Wellness Warrior.\u201d",
      "Indeed, Ainscough and Milla share similarities. In Ainscough\u2019s now-deleted blog post on her five-year diagnosis anniversary in 2013, viewed on the Internet Archive, Ainscough remembered hearing of a sacrcoma diagnosis.",
      "\u201c'The results have told us that you have a rare type of cancer called epithelioid sarcoma.\u2019 I went numb. \u2018It\u2019s not treatable with chemotherapy or radiation, and there\u2019s a good chance we will have to amputate your arm but this disease is essentially terminal,\u2019\u201d\u00a0she wrote.",

      "Gerson Therapy is not scientifically proven, per Sloan Kettering. Ainscough, however, said it worked for her.",

      "Also like Milla, Ainscough\u2019s mother was also diagnosed with cancer. Sharyn Ainscough died in 2013 of breast cancer.",

      "After the show was released, Col Ainscough \u2014 Jessica Ainscough's father \u2014 expressed his distaste for the show, telling The Daily Telegraph that it is \"insensitive and clearly profit-driven with wildly inaccurate fictional writing about a deeply real and personal tragedy.\"",
      "\"They have chosen to create a dramatized story in which Jess and my family are inaccurately portrayed,\" the 72-year-old said.",
      "While the show never says it's a \"true story,\" instead opting to describe itself as a \"true-ish story based on a lie,\" Col Ainscough feels the relationship the show depicted between Milla and Belle was an upsetting false narrative.",
      "\"Jess and Belle Gibson were never friends,\" he said, adding that he hasn't seen the show and doesn't plan on it but learned of the inaccuracies from others.",
      "\"Continually linking Jess's name to Belle is appalling,\" he continued. \"Jess doesn't deserve her legacy to be tarnished by this.\"",
      "He also disliked his own characterization in the show, disagreeing with the idea that he was an \"aggressive and unsupportive husband and father,\" per The Daily Telegraph.",
      "He says in real life, he \"fully supported\" his daughter's decision to seek alternative treatment methods.",
      "\"I felt Jess had no real option but to seek alternatives,\" he said, complimenting her \"bravery and diligence\" to do so.",
      "\u201cJess was incredibly intelligent, and she and Sharyn spent months researching every possible option, including clinics worldwide,\" he continued. \"I did my own research, read about Gerson therapy and felt confident it was manageable for our family. I trusted Jess and Sharyn\u2019s judgement, knowing they wouldn\u2019t take such a decision lightly.\"",
      "He said that after 24 months in the program, Jess was cancer free, and she stayed that way for \"several years.\"",

    "story": [
      "American-Israeli hostage Sagui Dekel-Chen spent \u201cthe vast majority\u201d of his almost 500 days in captivity not knowing that his family had survived Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 terrorist attack or that his wife had given birth to their third child while he was held in Gaza, his father told NBC News.",
      "The 36-year old was released from Hamas captivity Saturday along with two other hostages in exchange for 369 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. He is the second U.S. citizen after Keith Siegel, 65, to be freed in phase one of the ceasefire and hostage release deal.",
      "His father, Jonathan Dekel-Chen, said in an interview Monday that his son, who was wounded in his right shoulder and his left leg when he was kidnapped from kibbutz Nir Oz during the October 2023 Hamas-led attack, \u201cwas given minimal medical treatment once he got to Gaza.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere was no follow-up treatment, and so there\u2019s considerable damage,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was in the tunnels for the vast majority of the time. Even in the short period that he was aboveground, there was no sunlight whatsoever,\u201d he added.",
      "On the morning of the attack, Dekel-Chen put his wife, Avital Dekel-Chen, 34, and their two daughters, Bar, 7, and Gali, 3, into the safe room of their home. He then went out to confront the militants storming their kibbutz and was taken captive.",
      "He was one of around 250 people taken hostage on a day that also saw 1,200 killed, according to Israeli tallies.",
      "Avital Dekel-Chen was seven months pregnant when her husband was kidnapped and gave birth to their third daughter two months later.",

      "\u201cIn the tunnels, they\u2019re in a complete information vacuum,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so Sagui only began to piece together a partial picture two days before he was released.\u201d",

      "During the pregnancy, Dekel-Chen jokingly referred to the unborn baby as Mazal, an old-fashioned name meaning \u201cluck\u201d in Hebrew, Jonathan Dekel-Chen said.",
      "Moments after Dekel-Chen was reunited with his wife in southern Israel on Saturday, she told him she had named their daughter, Shachar Mazal. Shachar is the Hebrew word for \u201cdawn.\u201d",
      "Video released by the Israel Defense Forces of the reunion shows Dekel-Chen becoming emotional after he learned the name of the baby he never met.",
      "\u201cWow, perfect,\u201d he whispered in response. \u201cWhat a name.\u201d",
      "Later, he held the year-old Shachar for the first time at Sheba Hospital in Tel Aviv, where he also reunited with Bar and Gali.",
      "\u201cThere are not words in the English language or any other language that I know that can truly express the power of that moment, of his reunion with his little girls.\u201d Jonathan Dekel-Chen said.",
      "In the lead up to Saturday\u2019s exchange, which also saw Sasha Alexander Troufanov, 29, and Yair Horn, 46, freed by Hamas, the militant group had threatened to indefinitely delay the release of the hostages, accusing Israel of violating the ceasefire by not allowing temporary shelters and heavy digging equipment into the Gaza Strip.",
      "That sparked a furious reaction from both Israel and President Donald Trump, who warned that unless they were freed, \u201call hell is going to break loose\u201d in Gaza, where health officials say more than 48,000 people have been killed since Israel launched its military campaign Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "The first phase of the agreement \u2014 which calls for the release of 33 hostages in exchange for a six-week ceasefire and the release of around 1,900 prisoners and detainees \u2014 is due to expire March 2.",
      "Negotiations are\u00a0 underway to try to reach the second phase of the agreement, which would see the release of all living hostages in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners and detainees, a permanent ceasefire and a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.",
      "Ultimately, ahead of Dekel-Chen\u2019s release, both sides backed down and reverted to the original terms of the ceasefire brokered by Qatar and 369 Palestinian prisoners were freed in exchange for the three men.",
      "The days of uncertainty were \u201cbrutal\u201d as they waited to see if the ceasefire would collapse, Jonathan Dekel-Chen said, adding, \u201chonestly, it was terrifying, not just for us but for the families of all of the remaining hostages.\u201d"

      "\u201cThis is a waste of government resources,\u201d said Luis Zavala de Alba, the director of Casa Monarca del Migrante, a shelter for migrant families in Monterrey, Mexico, and a visiting professor at Yale University.",
      "Migrants at Casa Monarca have told Zavala de Alba they might just stay in Mexico because they\u2019re not sure they can get to the U.S. But he said that \u201cthese measures will contain the flow temporarily, while organized crime finds ways of crossing desperate migrants.\u201d",
      "With border activity being significantly quieter than usual, NBC News pressed V\u00e1squez Hern\u00e1ndez on whether the troops were just a show for Trump \u2014 as critics argue.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have that answer,\u201d he said, declining to wade into politics. \u201cWe\u2019re just working under orders to maintain a presence.\u201d",
      "Guard members in full tactical gear are patrolling the border. Recently, they discovered a large, sophisticated tunnel just feet from El Paso, Texas. It measured 4 by 6 feet across with a complete lighting and ventilation system.",
      "Because most fentanyl is smuggled into the U.S. in vehicles through legal ports of entry \u2014 not through rural stretches of the border \u2014 the National Guard and the Mexican Army have increased their presence at official border crossings.",
      "Illegal border crossings dropped drastically after the U.S. tightened asylum restrictions during the latter part of President Joe Biden\u2019s administration.",
      "After Trump was re-elected, Customs and Border Protection said the number of crossings fell another 35% from December to January. Trump\u2019s border czar, Tom Homan, said this week that the Border Patrol was seeing just 229 encounters a day along the entire border, down from a peak of 11,000 a day during Biden\u2019s term.",
      "As part of its crackdown, the U.S. State Department has designated Mexican drug cartels as well as MS-13 and the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua as foreign terrorist organizations, according to a document published Thursday in the Federal Register. A U.S. official also told NBC News that the CIA has expanded drone surveillance flights to target cartels.",
      "Smuggling is down, but 'it won't make a difference'",
      "Donning a mask, Marcos, a human smuggler, agreed to speak to NBC News on the condition that his last name be withheld. He works in southern Mexico: The city of Tapachula is a major bottleneck for migrants coming from Central America.",
      "\u201cIt won\u2019t make a difference,\u201d he said of the troops. \u201cIt\u2019s foolishness.\u201d",
      "This is not the first time Mexico has deployed troops for border enforcement. On the campaign trail, Trump said that he had convinced Mexico to send thousands of troops during his first term.",
      "But the second Trump administration is eager to promote early successes in its current crackdown. According to a Customs and Border Protection internal memo obtained by NBC News, Honduran Frontier Police earlier this month intercepted a bus with 23 migrants who told them they were abandoning the journey to the U.S. and returning to their home countries because they\u2019d been detained in Mexico and deported to Guatemala.",
      "Marcos said he\u2019s been smuggling migrants for six years and won\u2019t stop \u2014 at least in the short term. When pressed on whether he considers himself a criminal, he responded that while what he does may be against the law, he rationalizes it morally.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never abandoned or robbed anyone,\u201d he insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s like a travel agency. \u2026. People have a dream. And if not for us, many of those in Latin America and elsewhere, it wouldn\u2019t be possible.\u201d",
      "But he did concede that his business has plummeted by 80% since Trump took office.",
      "He said the cost for his services depends on nationality. Someone from Central America costs $12,000-$18,000; from South America,  $14,000-$26,000; from Europe or Asia, $40,000.",
      "Migrants often scrounge up the money from relatives in the U.S. or by becoming indebted to cartels. But Marcos pleads ignorance.",
      "\u201cThis is something we don\u2019t ask,\u201d he said, adding that while he doesn\u2019t work for a cartel, he must often pay them to move migrants through their territory.",
      "\u201cMigration is a business for everyone,\u201d he said.",
      "Before Trump took office, he said his operations typically moved dozens of people per week, earning him personally about $5,000 to $6,000 a month. Now, he expects to make about $1,000 a month.",
      "Still, he thinks Trump is mistaken \u2014 his policies will not end up deterring people from coming to the U.S.",
      "\u201cI think he is focusing on the issue of migration the wrong way,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of closing the border, he should look farther south to implement measures against corrupt people in our countries.\u201d"

      "KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 A news conference that was planned to follow talks between Ukrainian President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelenskyy and U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s Ukraine envoy was canceled Thursday as political tensions deepened between the two countries over\u00a0how to end the almost\u00a0three-year war with Russia.",
      "The event was originally supposed to include comments to the media by Zelenskyy and retired U.S. Lt. Gen.\u00a0Keith Kellogg , but it was changed at the last minute to a simple photo opportunity where the two posed for journalists. They did not deliver statements or field questions as expected. The change was requested by the U.S. side, Ukrainian presidential spokesman Serhii Nikiforov said.",
      "Kellogg\u2019s trip to Kyiv coincided with\u00a0recent feuding between Trump and Zelenskyy that has bruised their personal relations and cast further doubt on the future of U.S. support for Ukraine\u2019s war effort.",
      "Dozens of journalists gathered at Ukraine\u2019s presidential office in Kyiv after being invited to take photos and observe a news conference with Zelenskyy and Kellogg. As the meeting began, photographers and video journalists were allowed into a room where the two men shook hands before sitting across from each other at a table.",
      "Journalists were then informed that there would be no news conference with remarks by the leaders or questions from reporters. Nikiforov gave no reason for the sudden change except to say that it was in accordance with U.S. wishes.",
      "The U.S. delegation made no immediate comment. The White House did not immediately respond to questions about why the news conference was called off.",
      "The two men were due to speak about Trump\u2019s efforts to end the war. Zelenskyy had previously said he looked forward to explaining what was happening in Ukraine and showing it to Kellogg.",
      "Kellogg, one of the architects of a staunchly conservative policy book laying out an \u201cAmerica First\u201d national security agenda, has long been Trump\u2019s top adviser on defense issues.",
      "Writing on his Telegram channel, Zelenskyy said the meeting with Kellogg was a \u201cgood conversation, lots of details.\u201d He said they discussed security guarantees for Ukraine and the return of Ukrainian prisoners from Russian custody.",
      "\u201cWe can and must make peace reliable and lasting so that Russia can never return with war again,\u201d he wrote. \u201cUkraine is ready for a strong, truly beneficial agreement with the President of the United States on investments and security.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy and Trump have traded rebukes in recent days.",
      "The spat erupted after Russia and the U.S. agreed Tuesday to\u00a0start working toward ending the war in Ukraine and improving their diplomatic and economic ties. With that, Trump abruptly reversed\u00a0the three-year U.S. policy of isolating Russia.",
      "Zelenskyy was unhappy that a U.S. team opened the talks without inviting him or European governments that have backed Kyiv.",
      "When Trump claimed Zelenskyy was deeply unpopular in Ukraine, the president said Trump was living in a\u00a0Russian-made \u201cdisinformation space,\u201d suggesting he had been duped by Putin.",
      "But Zelenskyy \u201cretains a fairly high level of public trust\u201d \u2014 about 57 percent \u2014 according to\u00a0a report released Wednesday by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology.",
      "Trump accused Zelenskyy of being \u201cA Dictator without Elections!!\u201d Due to the war, Ukraine did delay elections that were scheduled for April 2024.",
      "Trump also suggested that Ukraine was\u00a0to blame for the war .",
      "Russia\u2019s army crossed the border on Feb. 24, 2022, in an all-out invasion that Putin sought to justify by falsely saying it was needed to protect Russian-speaking civilians in eastern Ukraine and prevent the country from joining NATO.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump warned Zelenskyy that he\u00a0\u201cbetter move fast\u201d to negotiate an end to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine or risk not having a nation to lead.",
      "European leaders quickly threw their support behind Zelenskyy.",
      "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz whose country has been Kyiv\u2019s second-biggest weapons supplier after the U.S., said it was \u201cwrong and dangerous\u201d to deny Zelenskyy\u2019s democratic legitimacy.",
      "Ukraine has been defending itself for nearly three years against a merciless war of aggression \u2014 day after day,\u201d Scholz told news outlet Der Spiegel.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer spoke to Zelenskyy on Wednesday and expressed support for him \u201cas Ukraine\u2019s democratically elected leader,\u201d Starmer\u2019s office said, adding that it was \u201cperfectly reasonable\u201d to postpone elections during wartime.",
      "Russian officials, meanwhile, are basking in Washington\u2019s attention and offering words of support for Trump\u2019s stance.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said \u201cthe rhetoric of Zelenskyy and many representatives of the Kyiv regime in general leaves much to be desired\u201d \u2014 a veiled reference to Ukrainian criticism of Putin.",
      "\u201cRepresentatives of the Ukrainian regime, especially in recent months, often allow themselves to make statements about the heads of other states that are completely unacceptable,\u201d Peskov said in a conference call with reporters.",
      "Amid the diplomatic clamor, Ukrainian civilians continue to endure Russian strikes. Russia fired 161 Shahed and decoy drones and up to 14 missiles of various types at Ukraine overnight from Wednesday to Thursday, according to military authorities.",
      "A Russian glide bomb struck an apartment block in the southern city of Kherson on Wednesday night, killing one person and wounding six, including 14-year-old twins, authorities said.",
      "The southern port city of Odesa also came under a Russian drone attack for the second consecutive night, leaving almost 50,000 homes without electricity in freezing winter temperatures, officials said."

      "\u201cIt was a very rich period,\u201d said British Egyptologist Chris Naunton, who was not involved in the excavation. But the mystery of Thutmose\u2019s tomb \u201cwas a glaring gap, and that gap has now been filled.\u201d",
      "The entrance and main corridor of the tomb, located just west of the Valley of the Kings, was first uncovered in 2022. A team of British and Egyptian archeologists later identified the tomb, initially believed to be that of a royal wife, as belonging instead to a pharaoh."

    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Traveling around Seoul in a prison transport vehicle, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol appeared in two different courts on Thursday, contesting his arrest on rebellion charges in one and fighting an effort to remove him from office in the other.",
      "Both cases \u2014 one on criminal charges, one an impeachment \u2014 are related to his brief imposition of martial law in December.",
      "Security was heightened at the Seoul Central District Court as the motorcade transporting Yoon arrived for a preliminary hearing that involved discussions of witnesses, proposed evidence and other preparations for his criminal trial.",
      "The court, which scheduled another preliminary hearing in March, was also reviewing a request by Yoon\u2019s lawyers to cancel his arrest and release him from custody. Such challenges are rarely successful. The court was expected to make a decision later Thursday.",
      "Yoon next traveled across the capital to the Constitutional Court, which is nearing a decision on whether to formally remove him from office after he was impeached by the National Assembly. Yoon temporarily left the courtroom when Prime Minister Han Duck-soo appeared as a witness. Yoon\u2019s lawyer explained to the justices that his client believed it would damage the country\u2019s image if both were seen in court together.",
      "Han supported Yoon\u2019s claim that the liberal opposition, with its legislative majority, had disrupted state affairs through pushing for impeachments of senior officials and undermining the government budget. However, Han repeated his previous statements to lawmakers and investigators that Yoon had violated constitutional requirements by failing to deliberate in a formal Cabinet meeting before declaring martial law on Dec. 3. Han said he didn\u2019t know of any Cabinet member who expressed support of Yoon\u2019s step.",
      "Yoon returned to the courtroom as the justices called another witness, Hong Jang-won, former first deputy director of South Korea\u2019s spy agency. Hong has said that Yoon ordered him to help a defense counterintelligence unit detain key politicians, including National Assembly speaker Woo Won Shik and opposition leader Lee Jae-myung.",
      "Yoon was indicted Jan. 26 on rebellion charges, which carry a potential punishment of death or life in prison. In South Korea, presidents have immunity from most criminal prosecutions, but not on charges of rebellion or treason.",
      "The indictment alleges his imposition of martial law was an illegal attempt to shut down the National Assembly and arrest politicians and election authorities. The conservative Yoon has said his martial law declaration was intended as a temporary warning to the liberal opposition and that he had always planned to respect lawmakers\u2019 will if they voted to lift the measure.",
      "Yoon\u2019s presidential powers were suspended when he was impeached Dec. 14, leaving him to fight for his political life at the Constitutional Court.",
      "Martial law was lifted about six hours after Yoon declared it but has caused political turmoil, disrupted high-level diplomacy and tested the resiliency of the country\u2019s democracy. Yoon\u2019s conservative supporters rioted at the Seoul Western District Court after it authorized his arrest last month, while his lawyers and ruling party have openly questioned the credibility of courts and law enforcement institutions handling the case.",
      "Yoon has continued to express contempt for his liberal rivals for obstructing his agenda and endorsed baseless conspiracy theories about election fraud to justify his ill-fated authoritarian push.",
      "Yoon\u2019s defense minister, police chief and several military commanders have also been arrested and indicted on rebellion, abuse of power and other charges related to the martial law decree, which involved hundreds of heavily armed troops deployed to the National Assembly and National Election Commission offices."
