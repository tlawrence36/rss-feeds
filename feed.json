    "story": [
      "The trade organization that represents movie theater owners in the U.S. and abroad is getting a rebrand",
      "In hindsight, NATO was an unnecessarily confusing acronym for a trade organization representing movie theater owners. For 60 years, the National Association of Theatre Owners has promoted interests of movie theaters, from the biggest chains to the one screen mom and pop shops. They\u2019ve also regularly gotten mail and phone calls intended for the other NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.",
      "But the theater owner\u2019s organization is looking to the future, with a new name and a refocused mission. The group will now be known as Cinema United, president and CEO Michael O\u2019Leary told The Associated Press Tuesday.",
      "\u201cIt can be a little complicated having the same name as a multinational military alliance,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cWe felt that it was time to look at our name and do a rebrand.\u201d",
      "They wanted the new name to reflect the \u201cpassion and energy of the people that run theaters,\u201d O\u2019Leary said, and to put the focus back on the exhibitors and movie theaters. Cinema United represents more than 32,000\u202fmovie screens in the U.S. and more than 30,000 screens in 88 countries. Their job, O\u2019Leary explained, is to promote and support theatrical exhibition. Moviegoing, the new tagline reads, is their mission.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had a challenging four or five years. But with each passing day, we put those challenges in the rearview mirror a little bit more. Our focus right now is on the future,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cI think that we stand on the precipice of the next great era of cinema.\u201d",
      "Just a few weeks ago, \u201cAnora\u201d filmmaker Sean Baker made his own case for theaters on the national stage. In accepting his best director Oscar, he used his time at the podium to make a \u201cbattle cry\u201d for the theatrical experience \u2013 for filmmakers to keep making movies for the big screen and for studios to keep releasing them there.",
      "\u201cPeople were ecstatic about it,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cHe has earned the unyielding allegiance of theater owners all around the world for his strong support over the years, and certainly at the Oscars.\u201d",
      "Movie theaters big and small were hit hard by the pandemic \u2013 many closed and never re-opened. Last year, they also faced a depleted release calendar due to the Hollywood strikes. It\u2019s all resulted in a depleted domestic box office that has yet to reach pre-pandemic levels. In 2024, the industry finished just over $8.7 billion, down 3.3% from 2023 and 23.5% from 2019.",
      "A fuller release schedule is expected this year, but currently the box-office total is down about 5% from where the industry was last year at this time.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really important that we not put too much emphasis on a single year like 2025. We need to constantly be building and growing and moving forward,\u201d O\u2019Leary said.",
      "Despite challenges, it remains an all-ages and affordable entertainment pasttime. A recent study from the National Research Group said 76% of the American population ages 12 to 74 attended at least one movie in 2024.",
      "And though theater closures often make headlines, like the E Street Cinema in Washington D.C., where Cinema United is headquartered, there\u2019s also been a spate of investment and refurbishment in theaters around the country, some spearheaded by famous filmmakers and actors.",
      "Jason Reitman along with more than 30 directors including Steven Spielberg, Christopher Nolan and Bradley Cooper last February acquired Westwood\u2019s Village Theater in Los Angeles, which dates back to 1931. Patrick Wilson also purchased and helped restore an historic theater in New Canaan, CT, joining big screen disciples like Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino who have all invested in movie theaters.",
      "Last fall, the eight biggest theater chains in the U.S. and Canada announced that they planned to invest more than $2.2 billion to modernize 21,000 movie theater screens over the next three years. This includes anything from projectors, lighting and sound to features in the concessions area. But upgrades in theaters are nothing new, O\u2019Leary said, they\u2019re just helping to draw attention to it.",
      "\u201cThe entire membership reinvests in their theaters on a regular basis,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cPart of the reason we made that announcement was because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s obvious to people that theater owners are constantly in the process of reinventing themselves and reinvesting.\u201d",
      "The announcement comes just over a week before some 6,000 movie theater employees from around the world convene in Las Vegas for the annual CinemaCon conference, which Cinema United hosts.",
      "All the major Hollywood studios, including The Walt Disney Studios, Warner Bros. Pictures, Universal Pictures and even Amazon/MGM will be making big, starry presentations on the main stage at Caesar\u2019s Palace \u2014 where executives and stars will show off new footage and trailers to make the case that they have the goods to get audiences in the theaters.",
      "NATO was coined in 1965, a merger of the nation\u2019s largest movie theater trade organizations: The Theater Owners of America, itself a product of a merger dating back to 1948, and the Allied States Association of Motion Picture Exhibitors, which goes back to the 1920s.",
      "Those at Cinema United like to say that \"we\u2019re not a Hollywood industry. We\u2019re a Main Street industry.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, the vast majority of our members are small businesses, so they feel the same pushes and pulls that other small businesses feel throughout the United States and around the world, O\u2019Leary said. \u201cThe headquarters of our biggest members are not in Los Angeles or New York. They\u2019re in Knoxville, Dallas and Kansas.\"",

    "story": [
      "An unprecedented exhibition at the Pompidou Center in Paris explores the presence and influence of Black artists in the city from the 1950s to 2000",
      "PARIS -- An unprecedented exhibition at the Pompidou Center in Paris explores the presence and influence of Black artists in the city from the 1950s to 2000, offering a vibrant immersion in France's cosmopolitan capital and a history of anti-colonial, civil rights struggles.",
      "The \u201cBlack Paris\u201d exhibition features the works of about 150 major artists of African descent, many of whom have never or rarely been displayed in France before. Running from March 19 to June 30, it's one of the final shows before the museum closes for a five-year renovation later this year.",
      "\u00c9va Barois De Caevel, associate curator, said that the exhibition is \u201cunprecedented,\u201d with more than 300 paintings and sculptures by artists of various backgrounds.",
      "\u201cSome are African Americans, some are Caribbeans, some are Africans, and some are Afro-descendants,\u201d said Barois De Caevel, adding that the focus of the exhibit is not geography or race, but rather \u201cBlack consciousness,\u201d shaped by the history of slavery and experience of racism shared by Black artists.",
      "After World War II, many African American painters, musicians, and intellectuals flocked to Paris, seeking a sense of freedom that they couldn't find in the United States at the time. Barois De Caevel pointed out that for many, Paris represented a break from the racial segregation that they faced back home.",
      "\u201cMany enjoyed being free in the streets of Paris \u2014 being able to go out with white women, enter cafes, bars and restaurants, and be treated like white people,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cBut they were not fooled,\" she added, noting that African American writer James Baldwin \"wrote about this early on, that in France, racism is especially targeting Black Africans and Algerians, who were really extremely mistreated. So it\u2019s an ambivalent relationship with Paris.\u201d",
      "The exhibition also shows how many African artists from French colonies \u2014 and later former colonies \u2014 came to Paris to join a political and intellectual movement fighting for civil rights and racial justice, while others from the Caribbean were supporting independentist movements, which were gaining strength there.",
      "Alicia Knock, curator of the exhibition, praised the ambitious scope of the show, which she described as \u201can incredible epic of decolonization,\u201d highlighting how Paris city served as both a \u201clab for Pan-Africanism,\u201d the movement that encouraged solidarity between peoples of African descent, and an \u201canti-colonial workshop.\u201d",
      "Visitors \u201cwill see how these artists contributed to rewriting the history of modernism and postmodernism,\u201d Knock said, and how they \u201dreframed abstraction and surrealism, and at the same time you will also see the Black solidarities that happened at the time.\u201d",
      "\"Many of these artists were not only creators, but also cultural ambassadors, teachers, poets, and philosophers,\u201d she added.",
      "For some coming from the U.S., Paris was also \u201ca gateway to Africa,\u201d Knock said, based on discussions she had with some of the artists' families: \"They told us that, in fact, they had come to Paris to go to Africa, and in the end they found Africa in Paris.\u201d",
      "The exhibition also includes installations from four artists chosen to provide contemporary insights, including Shuck One, a Black graffiti and visual artist native of the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe.",
      "In addition, the Pompidou Center has acquired around 40 of the show's artworks, which will remain part of the museum\u2019s collection.",
      "\u201cThis is just the beginning,\u201d Knock said. \u201cIt\u2019s a baby step for many French institutions, French museums and French universities to start working on these artists, start collecting them, writing about them, preserving their works in their archives and hopefully dedicating a lot of solo shows to many of these artists, because they really deserve it.\"",

      "Both took a dip -- but only a dip.",
      "With JuJu Watkins and Paige Bueckers and a host of other standout players leading the way, attendance across the country was just short of last season's record numbers in women's hoops and still the second-highest ever.",
      "More networks showed more games on TV this season and ratings were strong heading into March Madness that starts this week. ESPN will have the lion's share of tournament games again, but Fox increased its footprint in the sport with five games in primetime on Saturday nights and 18 total on the network.",
      "\u201cThere are great stars, great brands, we\u2019ve done more than we have done before and we\u2019re not alone in doing that,\u201d Fox Sports President of Insights and Analytics Mike Mulvihill said. \u201cThe 3-5-10 year trend clearly is an upward trend.\u201d",
      "While the network\u2019s overall ratings are down from last season\u2019s record mark that was due in large part to Clark being on Fox a lot, Mulvihill is happy with where they are.",

I love that we are able to put games on in primetime. It means something to the coaches and players.\u201d",

      "A doubleheader on Feb. 16 was huge for ESPN: UConn vs. South Carolina drew 1.8 million viewers while LSU vs. Texas had 1.7 million. In all, 15 games on ESPN networks averaged over 500,000 viewers, the most in a single year.",
      "ESPN, which owns the rights to the NCAA Tournament and shows women's games every week during the season, has faith that March Madness will deliver.",
      "Women's basketball programming director Dan Margulis knows that the network had a perfect storm last season to achieve the record ratings that saw the women's championship game outdraw the men. Clark, a generational player, had guided Iowa back to the championship game where they were facing an undefeated South Carolina team looking for its own place in history.",
      "\u201cWe're looking at early rounds and everything growing going into it,\u201d Margulis said. \u201cCompared to two years ago, we see that growth.\u201d",
      "It wasn't just the championship game that drew huge numbers. A rematch between Reese and Clark in the Elite Eight game was massive as well.",
      "\u201cCertainly the floor has risen dramatically,\u201d said lead ESPN announcer Rebecca Lobo. \u201cThe expectation for this year\u2019s tournament, Final Four or national championship shouldn\u2019t be what we saw a year ago. Will it be better than pre-Caitlin? That floor should be much higher than it was.\u201d",
      "While there isn't an undefeated team this year or a generational player like Clark on her last run, there is more parity in the sport.",
      "People aren\u2019t just watching on TV, but also showing up at games. The power conferences had strong attendance marks. The SEC led the way, setting numerous conference records, including total for its tournament and the mark in both the semis and the finals.",
      "The Big Ten had its second-highest average attendance in the last 15 years.",
      "\u201cGranted we get to see some of the best ones, but the energy was different throughout the country,\u201d Lobo said. \u201cThe South Carolina-LSU game on a Thursday night with 2,500 students has a different energy. The increase from students across the country has made for incredible environments.\u201d",

In an update to the court late last month, Brink told the court that his client had been discharged to a hospice facility and that his prognosis was poor. An accompanying letter from his doctor listed severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring supplemental oxygen and Parkinson's disease.",
      "Saliterman was in a wheelchair and on oxygen last March when he made his first court appearance. He was charged then with theft of a major artwork and witness tampering for his role in the ruby slippers case.",
      "The sequined red slippers were stolen in 2005 from the Judy Garland Museum in her hometown of Grand Rapids. Their whereabouts remained a mystery for nearly 13 years until the FBI recovered them in 2018. They fetched a record for movie memorabilia of $32.5 million in December, according to Heritage Auctions. The slippers were one of several pairs Garland wore during the filming. Only three other pairs remain.",
      "Terry Jon Martin, now 78, of Grand Rapids, used a hammer to smash the glass of the museum\u2019s door and display case to steal them. According to his attorney, an old associate with connections to the mob told him the shoes had to be adorned with real jewels to justify their $1 million insured value. But he got rid of the slippers when he learned they were fake, and they ended up with Saliterman. Martin pleaded guilty in 2023 and was sentenced last January to time served because of his poor health.",

      "\u00c9milie Dequenne, the Belgian actor who won a top Cannes Film Festival prize for her breakout role in \u201cRosetta,\u201d has died, a news report says. She was 43.",
      "Her family and agent told the news agency Agence France-Presse that Dequenne died Sunday of a rare cancer in a hospital outside of Paris. In 2023, Dequenne revealed she had been diagnosed with adrenocortical carcinoma. Representatives for Dequenne did not immediately respond to inquires from The Associated Press on Monday.",
      "Dequenne was only 18 when she was selected as best actress at Cannes in 1999. In \u201cRosetta,\u201d from Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne, she portrayed a teenager trying to escape her difficult life in a caravan park with an alcoholic mother. The film also won the Palme d\u2019Or that year.",
      "Born in Bel\u0153il, Belgium, in 1981, Dequenne had a performance streak from a young age. She studied drama at the Acad\u00e9mie de Musique de Baudour.",

Dequenne also portrayed police officer Laurence Renauld on the French series \u201cThe Missing.\u201d",

She was also nominated for several C\u00e9sar Awards throughout her career, finally winning best supporting actress in 2021 for the romantic comedy \u201cLove Affair(s).\u201d",
      "Speaking to The Guardian in 2013 about the difficult role in \u201cOur Children,\u201d she said, \u201cFor my part I went home every weekend, and stayed with my family, which is a very safe place. Making a film like that is something that you have to survive.\u201d",
      "More recently, she co-starred in \u201cClose,\u201d Lukas Dhont\u2019s tender boyhood drama, which brought her back to Cannes again in 2022. She saw similarities between her young co-star and her own breakout role with \u201cRosetta.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor me to be here and to come back here after 23 years, it\u2019s very emotional and there is like a reflection between Eden (Dambrine) and myself because I remember when I was here the first time with \u2018Rosetta,\u2019\u201d she told The Associated Press. \u201cIt was like a very powerful movie with this main character, which is in every scene, every, every shot. And that\u2019s the same for him.\u201d",
      "Dequenne returned to the festival again in 2024 for the 25th anniversary of \u201cRosetta.\u201d Her last film was Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Jardin\u2019s post-apocalyptic thriller \u201cSurvive,\u201d which came out earlier this year.",

      "\u201cI have been to Hollywood and had meetings, but really they don\u2019t do the kind of films I like to make. And everything is kind of boring, no?\u201d she said in the interview with The Guardian. \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s not a fun place, or at least not my kind of fun.\u201d",

Certain footage from the body cameras of the sheriff's deputies who responded to the home is included along with records from the state Office of the Medical Investigator.",

      "\u201cMy initial reaction to Mayor Meiner\u2019s threats was made under duress,\u201d Marthell said in a email Thursday. \u201cAfter reflecting on the broader implications for free speech and O Cinema\u2019s mission, I (along with the O Cinema board and staff members) agreed it was critical to screen this acclaimed film.\u201d",
      "O Cinema has always been committed to sharing films that not only entertain, but also challenge, educate and inspire meaningful dialogue, Marthell said.",
      "\u201cWe understand the power of cinema to tell stories that matter, and we recognize that some stories \u2014 especially those rooted in real-world conflicts \u2014 can evoke strong feelings and passionate reactions. As they should,\u201d Marthell said. \u201cOur decision to screen \u2018No Other Land\u2019 is not a declaration of political alignment. It is a bold reaffirmation of our fundamental belief that every voice deserves to be heard.\u201d",
      "In December and January, the city of Miami Beach executed two grants worth about $80,000 for O Cinema, according to the mayor's proposed resolution. About half the money has already been paid, but the resolution would stop the rest. The city began leasing space to O Cinema in 2019 with the ability to terminate the contract with 180 days of notice, which is what Meiner is seeking to do.",

      "A beloved reindeer in Alaska's biggest city is fighting for his life after falling mysteriously falling ill after someone tampered with his pen",
      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- An iconic reindeer so beloved that he has been in parades, featured on reality TV shows and visited by schoolchildren on field trips in Alaska's largest city is fighting for his life after mysteriously falling ill after someone tampered with his pen.",
      "Ever since, 8-year-old Star has had pneumonia, digestion issues and rapid weight loss. Star's owner, Albert Whitehead, has taken him to a veterinarian every other day to receive care and in hopes of finding a cause for the issues.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019ve done everything possible for him,\u201d Whitehead said. Veterinarian Sabrieta Holland said she the reindeer's prognosis is \u201cguarded.\u201d",
      "Star lives in a fenced-in pen attached to Whitehead\u2019s house at the edge of downtown Anchorage. It\u2019s been over 20 years since someone last tried to tamper with the enclosure where reindeer named Star have been kept for the last seven decades. Star is the seventh in a line of reindeer to carry that name.",
      "In early January, someone cut a huge hole in the fencing to gain entrance, spending about five minutes inside with Star before taking off. What the person did in the pen is unknown, but Star began having stomach issues and dropping weight shortly after.",
      "Then, on Feb. 20, Anchorage police found the friendly and trusting reindeer wandering around downtown and returned him home.",
      "When Whitehead reviewed his security cameras, he found someone had used bolt cutters to remove padlocks off Star\u2019s pen and an alley gate. Star followed the man out into the neighborhood, and the reindeer wound up alone downtown, familiar streets because that's where Whitehead walks him.",
      "The next night, the situation turned more serious.",
      "Whitehead was watching the video feed when a man wearing a scarf over his face sprayed something from two different cans into Star\u2019s pen and twice hit the reindeer in the face with an unknown substance.",
      "Whitehead rushed outside to confront the man.",
      "\u201cI yelled at him to stop, \u2018What the hell are you doing? What are you spraying on the animal? Don\u2019t do that, quit that!\u2019\u201d Whitehead said.",
      "The man replied: \u201cI\u2019m trying to help Star.\"",
      "\u201cI have no idea what he meant by that,\u201d said Whitehead, who suspects \u2014 based on the smells \u2014 that the sprays could have been a disinfectant and deodorizer.",
      "Whitehead and police believe it was the same man from the prior night. It\u2019s not known if the January tampering involved the same person.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the individual wanted to harm Star, but by his actions, he did,\u201d Whitehead said.",
      "Anchorage police posted the surveillance video on social media in hopes it would lead to the suspect\u2019s identity. So far, no viable tips have come in, spokesperson Christopher Barraza said in an email.",
      "Star's pneumonia worsened, and a cough leads Whitehead to believe Star ate something harmful, perhaps while loose.",
      "The pneumonia is likely due to him accidentally inhaling the chronic reflux or regurgitation of the contents in the largest of the reindeers\u2019 four stomachs, Holland said. The sprays possibly also contributed.",
      "It\u2019s possible there\u2019s a blockage, but the largest stomach of a reindeer is quite big and not easily obstructed, Holland said. However, ingested plastic bags causing chronic weight loss and indigestion problems are the most common foreign objects she's seen in reindeer.",
      "The next option would be surgery to look at the reindeer's abdomen and possibly remove any blockage, but it\u2019s generally a poor outcome, even in healthy deer, she said.",
      "The bond between Whitehead and Star is \u201cquite significant and precious,\" Holland said.",
      "\"Albert\u2019s daily life and reason for getting out for walks and such all are because of Star. And Star is really fond of Albert, too,\u201d Holland said in a text. \u201cIt will be quite devastating for him if he loses Star.\u201d",
      "Anchorage pioneers Oro and Ivan Stewart started the reindeer tradition, bringing the deer they received from an Alaska Native herder to Anchorage in the 1950s. Whitehead took over as caretaker from his friends in 2002.",
      "The average lifespan of a reindeer is about 15 years, but some Stars had long lives, like the first who lived to 23. Others didn't live as long, including the second Star, who was stolen, beaten to death and then butchered by a known Fairbanks meat thief. The third Star died after eating a plastic bag.",

      "Former reality TV star Jessie Holmes has won the longest-ever Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race in Alaska",
      "NOME, Alaska -- Jessie Holmes, a former reality television star, won the longest-ever Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race on Friday, celebrating with fist pumps to a cheering crowd and posing for photos with his two floral wreath-adorned head teammates, Hercules and Polar.",
      "Holmes was first to the finish line in the Gold Rush town of Nome, on the Bering Sea coast. The race began March 3 in Fairbanks after a lack of snow forced changes to the route and starting point.",
      "That made the normally 1,000-mile (1,609-kilometer) race a staggering 1,129 miles (1,817 kilometers) across the Alaska wilderness. Holmes finished in 10 days, 14 hours, 55 minutes and 41 seconds.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to put into words, but it\u2019s a magical feeling,\" Holmes said shortly after crossing the finish line. \u201cIt\u2019s not about this moment now. It\u2019s about all those moments along the trail.\u201d",
      "Holmes, who was competing for the eighth time, previously finished in the top 10 five times, including third last year and in 2022. In his first Iditarod, in 2018, his seventh-place finish earned him Rookie of the Year honors.",
      "Born and raised in Alabama, Holmes left at age 18 and worked as a carpenter in Montana for three years. He arrived in Alaska in 2004 and found adventure running dogs on a remote location of the Yukon River.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a truly amazing 10 days and I soaked in every part of it \u2014 the lows, the highs, the in-betweens. ... I\u2019m really proud of these dogs and I love them. And they did it. They deserve all the credit,\" Holmes said.",
      "He gave a special salute to his two lead canines, Hercules, his half-sprint dog, and Polar, saying, \u201cHe's the brains behind the operation.\u201d",
      "Holmes now lives in Nenana, where he works as a carpenter and lives a subsistence lifestyle. From 2015 through 2023, he was a cast member of \u201cLife Below Zero,\u201d a National Geographic program that documents the struggles of Alaskans living in remote parts of the state.",
      "Besides the lack of snow north of the Alaska Range that forced the change of starting point to Fairbanks, race organizers also had to make changes to the ceremonial start in Anchorage.",
      "With snow trucked in to cover streets in the state\u2019s largest city, the usual parade route there was shortened from 11 miles to under 2 miles (from about 18 kilometers to under 3.2 kilometers), and the number of dogs was reduced.",
      "Only 33 mushers started in Fairbanks, tied with 2023 for the smallest field ever. The drop in participants has raised concerns about the viability of the race, which has had to contend with inflation, climate change and pressure from animal rights groups.",
      "One dog died in this year\u2019s Iditarod: a pregnant female on the team of musher Daniel Klein, who under race rules scratched due to the death.",
      "Nearly a third of the mushers quit early, including eight who scratched and two who were withdrawn for not being competitive.",

      "NEW YORK -- After a well-reviewed emcee debut, the Golden Globes are bringing back comedian Nikki Glaser to host the 2026 ceremony.",
      "Dick Clark Productions, the producer of the award show, announced Thursday that Glaser will return for the 83rd Globes next January. Glaser, the first woman to host the show solo, successfully shepherded a ceremony she called \u201cOzempic\u2019s biggest night.\u201d",

Like this year's broadcast, next year's Globes will air on CBS and stream on Paramount+.",
      "\u201cNikki Glaser brought a refreshing spark and fearless wit to the Golden Globes stage this year,\" said Globes President Helen Hoehne. \u201cHer sharp humor, and bold presence set the tone for an unforgettable night, making the ceremony feel vibrant and most of all fun.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- U.S. births rose slightly last year, but experts don't see it as evidence of reversing a long-term decline.",
      "A little over 3.6 million births were reported for 2024, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention preliminary data. That's 22,250 more than the final tally of 2023 U.S. births, which was released Tuesday.",
      "The 2024 total is likely to grow at least a little when the numbers are finalized, but another set of preliminary data shows overall birth rates rose only for one group of people: Hispanic women.",
      "The rise \u2014 less than 1% \u2014 may just be a small fluctuation in the middle of a broader trend, said Hans-Peter Kohler, a University of Pennsylvania sociologist who studies family demographics.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d be hesitant to read much into the 2023-24 increase, and certainly not as an indication of a reversal of the trend towards lower or declining U.S. fertility,\u201d Kohler said, adding that more analysis is needed to understand any changes that happened in birth patterns last year.",
      "U.S. births and birth rates have been falling for years. They dropped most years after the 2008-09 recession, aside from a 2014 uptick. They also dropped in 2020, the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, then rose for two straight years after that, an increase experts partly attributed to pregnancies put off amid the pandemic.",
      "A 2% drop in 2023 put U.S. births at fewer than 3.6 million, the lowest one-year tally since 1979. Vermont had the lowest birth rate that year, and Utah had the highest, according to Tuesday's 86-page report on 2023 birth data.",
      "The report, based on a review of all the birth certificates filed that year, shows the average age of mothers at first birth has continued to rise, hitting 27 1/2 years. It was 21 1/2 in the early 1970s, before beginning a steady climb.",
      "Birth rates have long been falling for teenagers and younger women, but were rising for women in their 30s and 40s \u2014 a reflection of women pursuing education and careers before trying to start families, experts say. But in 2023, birth rates fell for women in almost all age groups, include women in their early 40s.",
      "Preliminary birth rate data for 2024 shows a continued decrease among teenagers and women in their early 20s. But it also showed increases for women in their late 20s, due entirely to a rise in births to Hispanic women. Increases also were seen for women in their 30s, due to rises among Hispanic and white women, and those in their 40s, due to rises among white women.",

      "A new report identifies ways to create resilient water and wastewater systems in communities hardest hit by climate change",
      "Malynndra Tome was helping to map livestock ponds in the Navajo Nation when she saw something that inspired her to act. An elderly woman was filling milk jugs with water at the back of a gas station in the Native American reservation, where about 30% of people live without running water.",
      "\u201cHow can we be living in the United States of America \u2026 one of the most powerful countries in the world, and people are living like this here?\u201d asked Tome, a citizen who grew up in the community of Ganado, Arizona, in the nation's largest Native American reservation at 27,000 square miles (69,930 square kilometers) in Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.",
      "A report published Tuesday identifies ways historically neglected communities most vulnerable to climate change, like Tome\u2019s, can create resilient water and wastewater systems. Its highlights include nature-based solutions, tailoring approaches to each community and using technology \u2014 all the while recognizing barriers to implementing them.",
      "\u201cWhat we hope to do with this report, what I hope, is that it actually gives people hope,\u201d said Shannon McNeeley, a report author and senior researcher with the Pacific Institute, which published the report with DigDeep and the Center for Water Security and Cooperation. \u201cIn spite of some of the major federal funding sources becoming uncertain and possibly not available, I think people will find other ways.\u201d",
      "Weather extremes made worse by climate change have disrupted people\u2019s access to water.",
      "In September, more than 100,000 residents in western North Carolina were under boil-water notices for nearly two months after Hurricane Helene destroyed much of a local water system. In January, several water providers declared their drinking water unsafe after wildfires roared through Los Angeles. One utility in Pasadena, California, sent out its first notice since it began serving water more than a century ago.",
      "Aging water systems leak trillions of gallons, leaving residents in some of the country\u2019s poorest communities with a substantial financial burden to fix them.",
      "An estimated 30% of the population in the Navajo Nation lives in homes that don\u2019t have running water, and many residents drive long distances to get water from public spigots, according to the Navajo Nation Department of Water Resources and the Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "The report also notes that some federal resources and funding have become unavailable since Donald Trump returned to the White House. The Trump administration has cut or paused funding for critical water infrastructure projects, touted a reversal of diversity, equity and inclusion policies, and eliminated environmental justice policies meant to protect the communities the report centers on.",
      "Greg Pierce, director of the Human Right to Water Solutions Lab at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the report \u201ccomes at a very depressing moment where we're not going to see federal action in this space, it doesn't seem, for the next four years.\u201d",
      "The report synthesizes existing literature about water, climate change and solutions. Its authors reviewed academic studies, government and private reports and interviewed experts to identify ways low-income and communities of color can build water and wastewater systems to withstand extreme weather.",
      "The report highlights technology like rainwater harvesting and gray water reuse systems that can decrease water demand and increase resilience to drought. But it adds that implementing and maintaining technology like it can be too expensive for poorer communities.",
      "The report also advocates nature-based solutions such as wetlands, which studies find can reduce the length and severity of droughts, provide flood control, reduce or remove pollutants in water and protect water supplies. Communities across the country are increasingly recognizing the benefits of wetlands. In Florida\u2019s Everglades, for example, officials have spent billions of dollars to build engineered wetlands that clean and protect a vital drinking water source.",
      "The report argues for government-funded water assistance programs to help poorer households pay water and sewer bills, like the Low Income Household Water Assistance Program launched during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Gregory Moller, a professor in the soil and water systems department at the University of Idaho, notes that some approaches are too complex and expensive for smaller or poorer communities. \u201cOur innovations also have to be on a scale and stage that is adaptable to small systems,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where I think some of the most serious challenges are.\u201d",
      "Some solutions the report highlights are benefiting communities. In the Navajo Nation, hundreds of solar-powered home water systems have brought running water to more than 2,000 people. Kimberly Lemme, an executive director at DigDeep, which is installing the systems, said it can be a complex and lengthy process. But it shows that solutions do exist.",
      "\u201cWater is a basic human right,\u201d said Tome, whose encounter with the elderly woman inspired her to pursue a doctorate in water resources. \u201cAnd in order for people to live productively, to have healthy lives, I think water is a big part of that.\u201d",

      "Arizona highest court has created a pair of AI-generated avatars to deliver news of all rulings issued by the justices",
      "PHOENIX -- Arizona's highest court has created a pair of AI-generated avatars to deliver news of every ruling issued by the justices, marking what is believed to be the first example in the U.S. of a state court system tapping artificial intelligence to build more human-like characters to connect with the public.",
      "A court in Florida uses an animated chatbot to help visitors navigate its website, but the Arizona Supreme Court is charting new territory with the creation of Victoria and Daniel. Made of pixels, the two avatars have a different job in that they serve as the face of news coming from the court just as a spokesperson made of flesh and blood would do \u2014 but faster.",
      "The use of AI has touched nearly every profession and discipline, growing exponentially in recent years and showing infinite potential when it comes to things as simple as internet searches or as complex as brain surgery. For officials with the Arizona Supreme Court, their venture into AI is rooted in a desire to promote trust and confidence in the judicial system.",
      "There was a protest outside the state Capitol last April and calls for two justices to be booted after the Arizona Supreme Court ruled that a Civil War-era law that banned nearly all abortions, except when a woman\u2019s life is in jeopardy, could be enforced. Emotions flared on both sides of the issue.",
      "When Chief Justice Ann Timmer took over the court last summer, she made public trust a key pillar of her platform. She had already been thinking about ways to reach out to the public using digital media for a few years, and the abortion ruling, among other rulings, helped her to solidify the idea that the court needs to be part of the narrative as people learn about opinions and what they mean.",
      "\u201cWe serve the public better by saying, OK, we\u2019ve issued this decision,\" she said. \"Now, let us help you understand what it is.\u201d",
      "Timmer told The Associated Press earlier this year that if the court had to do the abortion ruling over again, it would have approached the dissemination of information differently. In a Wednesday interview, she said that a news release and avatar video could have helped the public better understand the legal underpinnings of the lengthy decision \u2014 possibly including what it didn't do, which she said some misunderstood.",
      "\u201cWe got a lot of backlash for it and probably deservedly so, in terms of how can we complain that people don\u2019t understand what we did when we didn\u2019t really do enough to give a simplified version,\" she said in the January interview, explaining that people want to know the basis for the court\u2019s decisions and what they can do, such as lobbying state lawmakers for whatever changes in law would support their positions.",
      "Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a repeal of the ban last May, and in November, Arizona voters approved a constitutional amendment expanding abortion access up to the point of fetal viability.",
      "Created with a program called Creatify, Daniel and Victoria in a way bring to life the court's news releases. Videos featuring one or the other are being posted for every ruling by the high court, and may be used for Access to Justice projects, community programs and civics information in the future.",
      "The court has been sending out releases since October to summarize and explain rulings. After seeing success with the releases, it began exploring options to convey that information through video.",
      "The AI-generated avatars were the most efficient way to produce videos and get the information out, said court spokesperson Alberto Rodriguez. Producing a video usually can take hours, he said, but an AI-generated video is ready in about 30 minutes. The court might introduce more AI-generated reporters in the future, Rodriguez said in a news release.",
      "The justice who authors the legal opinion also drafts a news release, the wording of which must be approved by the entire bench. The justice then works with the court's communications team to craft a script for the avatars \u2014 the avatars aren't interpreting original court decisions or opinions, Rodriguez said.",
      "Daniel and Victoria's names and physical appearances were designed to represent a wide cross-section of people, Rodriguez said. He said they aren\u2019t meant to come off as real people and the court emphasizes their AI origins with disclaimers. The court is exploring different emotional deliveries, cadences and pronunciations as well as Spanish translations for the avatars, Rodriguez said.",
      "Mason Kortz, a clinical instructor at the Harvard Law School's Cyberlaw Clinic at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society, described the court's new cyber employees as \"quite realistic.\" While their voices might give them away, he said some people could be fooled into thinking that Daniel and Victoria are real reporters if viewers are only reading the subtitles and looking at the characters' movements and facial expressions.",
      "Kortz also said it would be better for the language of the disclaimer that is in the videos' text description to be featured more prominently.",
      "\u201cYou want to make it as hard as possible for someone to advertently or inadvertently remove the disclaimer,\u201d he said.",
      "Asheley Landrum, associate professor at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University, said the avatars feel robotic. She said a format that mimics real dialogue and storytelling might be more engaging than an AI reading of a news release.",
      "\u201cBecause it\u2019s not just about using AI or even creating videos,\u201d she said, \u201cbut about doing so in a way that really resonates with audiences.\u201d",
      "Still, it's fine line. She said engaging characteristics can help to build trust over time but the danger is that content could appear biased.",

      "A new study out Monday finds that even in the most optimistic scenarios, grass-fed beef is no less carbon-intensive than industrial beef",
      "For cattle fattened in fields instead of feedlots, the grass may be greener, but the carbon emissions are not.",
      "A study out Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences finds that even in the most optimistic scenarios, grass-fed beef produces no less planet-warming carbon emissions than industrial beef. The finding calls into question the frequent promotion of grass-fed beef as a more environmentally friendly option. Still, other scientists say grass-fed beef wins out on other factors like animal welfare or local environmental pollution, complicating the choice for conscientious consumers.",
      "\u201cI think that there is a large portion of the population who really do wish their purchasing decisions will reflect their values,\u201d said Gidon Eshel, a research professor of environmental physics at Bard College and one of the study's authors. \u201cBut they are being misled, essentially, by the wrong information.\u201d",
      "When it comes to food, beef contributes by far the most emissions fueling climate change and is one of the most resource- and land-intensive to produce. Yet demand for beef around the world is only expected to grow. And carefully weighing the benefits of grass-fed beef matters because in most parts of the world where beef production is expanding, such as South America, it\u2019s being done by deforesting land that would otherwise store carbon, said Richard Waite of the World Resources Institute.",
      "Experts say this study's finding makes sense because it's less efficient to produce grass-fed cattle than their industrial counterparts. Animals that are fattened up in fields instead of feedlots grow more slowly and don't get as big, so it takes more of them to produce the same amount of meat.",
      "The researchers used a numerical model of the emissions produced across the process of raising beef, then simulated many herds of industrial and grass-fed cattle. It compared differences in how much food they would eat, how much methane and carbon dioxide they would emit and how much meat they would produce. Those differences mirror real-life scenarios; cattle in arid New Mexico and lush northern Michigan have different inputs and outputs.",
      "Eshel and his team also analyzed previous studies that examined how much cattle grazing promotes carbon storage, but found that even in the best-case scenarios, the amount of carbon that grasses could sequester didn\u2019t make up for the emissions of the cattle.",
      "Randy Jackson, a professor of grassland ecology at University of Wisconsin-Madison who was not involved in the study, said he has found similar results in his own research showing that grass-fed beef has higher emissions assuming the same demand. In fact, Eshel's team cited his work. But he worries that the study is too focused on minimizing emissions \u201cwithout concern for the environmental impacts beyond GHG load to the atmosphere,\u201d like biodiversity and soil and water quality, he wrote in an email.",
      "The American Grassfed Association, a nonprofit membership group for producers of grass-fed livestock, did not immediately provide a comment on the study.",
      "Jennifer Schmitt, who studies the sustainability of U.S. agricultural supply chains at the University of Minnesota and also wasn't involved in the study, said she thinks the paper \u201chelps us get a little closer to answering the question of maybe how much beef should we have on the landscape versus plant proteins,\u201d she said.",
      "Schmitt said maybe if beef was scaled back on a large enough scale and if farmers could free up more cropland for other foods that humans eat, the localized environmental benefits of grass-fed cattle could make up for the fact that they come with higher emissions.",
      "It would be harder to convince Eshel, however. He thinks climate change is \u201csecond to none\u201d when it comes to global problems and should be prioritized as such.",
      "\u201cI have a hard time imagining, even, a situation in which it will prove environmentally, genuinely wise, genuinely beneficial, to raise beef,\" Eshel said.",
      "For consumers who truly want to be environmentally conscious, he added, \"don't make beef a habit.\"",

      "WASHINGTON -- Thousands of employees returned to the Food and Drug Administration's headquarters Monday to find overflowing parking lots, long security lines and makeshift office spaces without chairs and other basic supplies.",
      "The FDA is the latest agency scrambling to meet the Trump administration\u2019s return-to-office mandate, part of a flurry of actions \u2014 including firings and buyouts \u2014 intended to radically shrink the federal workforce. Monday was the first day that all rank-and-file FDA staffers were required to report to offices, including the agency\u2019s 130-acre campus just outside Washington.",
      "The Associated Press spoke with more than a half-dozen FDA staffers who described long lines to park and clear security, followed by hours of hunting for space and supplies in offices that were not designed to accommodate the agency\u2019s full workforce. The staffers spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak with the media.",
      "One staffer described \u201cchaos and lost work hours\" for commuting, security lines and shuffled office space.",
      "About half the FDA\u2019s 20,000 scientists, attorneys, inspectors and support staff report to the agency\u2019s main campus in White Oak, Maryland, which until the late 1990s was a naval weapons testing facility.",
      "While many agencies switched to telework during the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA began embracing the practice a decade earlier. Most employees had the option to work from home at least two days a week \u2014 flexibility that was seen as a competitive perk for recruiting highly trained experts who can often earn more working in industry.",
      "By 7:30 a.m., many on-campus parking lots were full, with cars parked along side streets, according to employees. Some workers reported waiting up to one hour to clear security checkpoints, and photos viewed by the AP showed lines of employees winding out doorways, along sidewalks and around corners.",
      "Once inside, employees confronted broken desks, missing chairs and locked offices for which they didn\u2019t have keys.",
      "\u201cAll of the staff is definitely bending over backwards to make an impossible situation work and get their work done,\u201d said one employee.",
      "Some employees were left to scour the campus for chairs and other essentials.",
      "\u201cPeople are looting chairs from conference rooms and other buildings,\u201d a staffer said. \u201cWe have no supplies. People are hunting around all of the buildings on campus for pads of paper and other basics.\u201d",
      "When employees did get situated, many shared cramped spaces with people from different divisions and teams, making it difficult to hold calls and meetings. Photos shared with the AP show folding chairs and tables setup in hallways and lobbies.",
      "An FDA spokesman said in an email Monday the agency \u201cis continuing its return-to-office activities to ensure staff remain able to conduct their important public health work.\u201d",
      "All the employees told the AP that they brought their own drinking water Monday. That\u2019s due to a monthslong issue involving Legionella, the bacteria that causes Legionnaires\u2019 disease, which was detected at several FDA buildings. The General Service Administration, which oversees federal buildings, has been working on the issue since last summer.",
      "FDA staff received an email earlier this month that all water is safe to drink, but it did not detail the latest testing results or corrective actions taken.",
      "Anthony Lee, who represents the local chapter of the federal union for FDA employees, said the agency has not granted the group's request for a meeting on the issue.",
      "Asked about the water, one staffer said: \u201cHonestly, none of us have tried it. After months of Legionella warnings, it\u2019s not very inviting.\"",

      "Aid agencies distributing U.S. food aid in Ethiopia's war-affected Tigray region say they have had to stop feeding millions of people because of the Trump administration's restrictions on foreign aid",
      "MEKELE, Ethiopia -- As a displaced person in Ethiopia\u2019s northern Tigray region, 76-year-old Haile Tsege is no stranger to hunger.",
      "During its war with Tigray fighters that devastated the region in 2020-2022, Ethiopian government restrictions on the rebellious region reduced aid flows to a trickle. Then in 2023, U.S. and U.N. aid distributions of grain were halted for months over a corruption scandal.",
      "Now the Trump administration\u2019s dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, has again halted food deliveries to a sprawling camp of over 20,000 people outside Tigray\u2019s regional capital, Mekele.",
      "\u201cWe will just die in silence,\u201d said Tsege, one of the 2.4 million people in Tigray who depend on humanitarian grain, most of it provided by the U.S.",
      "Ethiopia with its over 125 million people had been the biggest beneficiary of U.S. aid in sub-Saharan Africa, receiving $1.8 billion in the 2023 financial year. In addition to life-saving food, the funds were spent on HIV medications, vaccines, literacy programs and jobs creation, as well as services for 1 million refugees hosted by Ethiopia.",
      "Most of these programs have been stopped. The USAID staffers who oversaw them have been placed on administrative leave and told not to work, as they face the threat of termination. The U.S. Embassy didn't respond to questions.",
      "Emergency food was exempted from President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order, signed on his first day in office, suspending foreign aid during a 90-day review amid the administration's allegations of waste.",
      "Aid agencies in Ethiopia had to apply to USAID for waivers to continue handing out U.S. grain. These have been secured, but USAID\u2019s payments system is still not functioning.",
      "As a result, a consortium of aid agencies in Tigray has had to stop distributions to the over 1 million people it has been responsible for feeding with U.S.-provided grain. It has no money to pay for fuel, trucks and drivers to distribute existing food stockpiles.",
      "That includes 5,000 metric tons of sorghum \u2013 enough to feed 300,000 people for a month \u2013 stuck in a storage facility in Mekele that could rot before it reaches those in need.",
      "\u201cThis is just one warehouse. There are several others across the region,\u201d said Teklewoini Assefa, head of the Relief Society of Tigray, part of the consortium. \u201cThis will create malnutrition, disease. If this situation continues, what follows? Death.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cEverything boils down to the payment system.\u201d",
      "The effects of the aid cuts are widespread, with many USAID contracts terminated. Already, Ethiopia has been forced to lay off 5,000 local healthcare workers who were working on its HIV response.",
      "Tigray relied heavily on U.S. funds. More than two years after the war killed hundreds of thousands, full-scale recovery efforts are yet to start. The region\u2019s health system is in ruins and hundreds of schools remain closed.",
      "In 2024, child malnutrition stood at 21% in some areas, according to a survey reviewed by The Associated Press \u2014 far above the World Health Organization\u2019s threshold of 15% at which a situation is classified as an emergency.",
      "Now, aid workers say many programs to improve nutrition have halted. Projects to deliver medicines and vaccines have stopped. Dozens of camps for displaced people have had water sources cut off.",
      "\u201cThe impact has been huge,\u201d said Ashenafi Asmelash, executive director of Mums for Mums, which has had two USAID- funded programs terminated. One helped build long-term resilience among farmers. The other helped improve the nutrition of children and new mothers.",
      "Management Sciences for Health, another Tigray organization, has halted a project to combat tuberculosis and told its staff to expect mass layoffs in March, according to a senior executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.",
      "Efforts to assist thousands of women who were raped during the war have been derailed, said Rigat Bishaw at Ayder Hospital, Tigray\u2019s biggest healthcare facility.",
      "This includes counseling and physiotherapy sessions for survivors run by the U.S.-based Center for Victims of Torture, which received a stop-work order from the Trump administration in February and furloughed its staff.",
      "CVT also halted a program to train health workers to recognize sexual abuse cases and refer survivors to appropriate health services.",
      "\u201cThis sudden disruption is having a huge impact on the healing of traumatized people,\u201d said Yohannes Fisseha, a CVT manager.",
      "Major projects to support people living with HIV, improve access to life-saving nutrition services and improve relations between war-affected communities have also been cut off, said Yirga Gebregziabher, the Tigray branch manager of an Ethiopian organization called OSSHD, which helped implement the projects.",
      "The organization has been forced to fire dozens of expert staff.",
      "\u201cOur picture of America was as a protector of rights, a positive force in the world,\u201d Yigra said. \u201cThat image has now been broken. If there was a process, maybe the shock would have been less. But there was no consultation, no engagement.\u201d",

The aid cuts, which affect governments and their partners in the non-governmental sector, have shut down or disrupted projects tackling diseases ranging from malaria to AIDS.",

Many of the affected programs are in fragile countries that are highly reliant on U.S. aid to support health systems, nutrition programs and stave off starvation.",

      "The joint campaign \u2014 a year in the making \u2014 features billboards, digital ads and social media posts. It was unveiled Wednesday, days after authorities confirmed that actor Gene Hackman died at his Santa Fe home of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",
      "Hackman, like the majority of people with Alzheimer\u2019s and related dementias, lived at home. His wife, Betsy Arakawa, was his caregiver but died from hantavirus, a rare, rodent-borne disease. Experts believe Hackman, in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's, was unable to seek help.",
      "The goal of the new partnership between the state and the Alzheimer's Association is to spark conversations within families and to educate the public on warning signs and treatments. It also aims to publicize support services for family members and other caregivers.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s kind of the whole point of the campaign \u2014 to start talking, to start thinking, to take some action,\u201d said Joey Long, a spokesperson with the state Aging and Long-Term Services Department. \u201cSo it's like, maybe they\u2019ve been confused. Well, let\u2019s talk about what that means.\u201d",
      "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 7 million people are living with the disease in the U.S., where Alzheimer\u2019s is the seventh-leading cause of death. In New Mexico, estimates put the number of people with the disease at 46,000, with another 67,000 family members providing care at home within the last year.",
      "Alzheimer's kills more people in the U.S. than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined, according to statistics shared by the Alzheimer's Association, which is helping to fund research projects in dozens of countries around the world.",
      "One of the challenges is that only about half of the people who are living with the disease are ever diagnosed, said Jim Herlihy, a spokesperson for the association's Rocky Mountain region. The number of undiagnosed people is higher in communities of color, he said.",
      "Neurologists say it can take 20 years from the start of the disease taking shape in the brain to when it becomes recognizable and diagnosed, what Herlihy describes as a glacial pace.",
      "\u201cPeople think of this as either an old person\u2019s disease or something that happens to somebody else,\u201d Herlihy said. \u201cAnd unless it\u2019s happened in your family and you have seen a loved one decline from this disease, or you have been put into the role of being a caregiver, you don\u2019t realize the impact that this has.\u201d",
      "The nonprofit association published a special report last year detailing the importance of families mapping out a plan for care, acknowledging that it can be a complex maze involving social services, medications and specialists.",
      "The billboards and ads are simple. One of them pictures a caution sign in the road that reads: \u201cHoney, you've been confused.\u201d The messages urge people to talk about it and to visit a website that includes a hotline for those who don't know where to start.",
      "A significant percentage of New Mexico's population is aging, which has spurred officials to find ways to educate and prepare state residents. In addition to the awareness campaign, the state is planning a series of community forums on the subject this spring in rural areas with high rates of the disease.",
      "The Alzheimer's Association is hoping the campaign will expand to other states.",

      "\u201c(The) government urges foreign governments to provide a fair and just environment for enterprises,\u201d he said. \u201cWe oppose the abusive use of coercion or bullying tactics in international economic and trade relations.\u201d",
      "Lee avoided a direct mention of U.S. President Donald Trump and also stopped short of criticizing CK Hutchison or tycoon Li Ka-shing's family, which owns a controlling stake in the conglomerate.",
      "His comments followed a somewhat veiled backlash from Beijing.",
      "Since last Thursday, Beijing\u2019s offices handling Hong Kong affairs have reposted two commentaries by a Beijing-backed local newspaper that blasted the deal. That has raised questions over the sale.",
      "One of the newspaper commentaries suggested the deal is a betrayal to all Chinese and disregards national interests. The other described great entrepreneurs as patriots, but suggested that businesspeople who \u201cdance with\u201d predatory American politicians to reap quick profits were doomed to infamy.",
      "The articles signaled Beijing\u2019s disapproval of the deal, though its actual impact remains unclear.",
      "Posting of the articles has been seen as an indirect attack on the conglomerate by Chinese leaders. Trump, who has alleged Chinese interference with the operations of the critical shipping lane, hailed the deal, saying his administration would \u201creclaim\u201d the Panama Canal. Panama President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino accused him of lying.",
      "Lee said any business transaction must comply with Hong Kong's laws. The city will handle it according to the law, he said without elaborating.",
      "Increasing influence from Beijing is adding to pressure on business leaders in the former British colony, that was returned to Chinese rule in 1997.",
      "CK Hutchison did not comment on Lee\u2019s remarks or the articles. It was due to report its 2024 financial results on Thursday, but said it did not plan a news conference.",
      "The company surprised market watchers when it announced March 4 that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the consortium in a deal valued at nearly $23 billion, including $5 billion in debt. Hutchison said the transaction was purely commercial and unrelated to other developments surrounding the Panama Ports.",
      "The deal, if approved, will give the BlackRock consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including the ports of Balboa and Cristobal, located at either end of the Panama Canal. Other ports are in Mexico, the Netherlands, Egypt, Australia, Pakistan and elsewhere.",
      "The transaction requires approval by Panama\u2019s government. It does not affect a trust that operates ports in Hong Kong or any other ports in mainland China.",
      "Panama says it has full control over the shipping lane and Hutchison's operation of the ports does not amount to Chinese control over the canal. Selling it to a U.S.-based company does not represent any U.S. \u201creclaiming\u201d of the canal, it says.",
      "The United States built the canal in the early 1900s, seeking a faster way for commercial and military vessels to travel between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by then-President Jimmy Carter. Trump has claimed that Carter \u201cfoolishly\u201d gave the canal away.",
      "Some 70% of the sea traffic that crosses the Panama Canal leaves or goes to U.S. ports.",

      "Mexico City lawmakers have voted to ban violent bullfighting in the capital",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexico City lawmakers on Tuesday voted overwhelmingly to ban violent bullfighting, triggering outrage from aficionados and celebration from animal rights advocates.",
      "The legislation, approved by a 61-1 vote, prohibits the killing of bulls and the use of sharp objects that could injure the animals. It also sets time limits on how long bulls could be in the ring, all part of an initiative dubbed \u201cbullfighting without violence.\u201d",
      "The decision sparked angry protests from bullfighting supporters and matadors, some of whom tried to breach a police barricade at the local Congress. Some carried signs that read \u201cBeing a fan of la fiesta brava (bullfighting) is not a crime, it\u2019s a point of pride.\u201d",
      "Animal rights protesters celebrated, and were joined by Mexico City Mayor Clara Brugada of the ruling Morena party, who said the decision will help the Mexican capital become a place \u201cthat respects the rights of animals and that will not tolerate them being subjected to abuse or violence.\u201d",
      "Tuesday\u2019s vote appeared to be an attempt to broker a compromise between two warring sides of the debate after years of back-and-forth about the practice.",
      "Bullfighting has long been considered a tradition and a pastime in Latin American nations, but has come under criticism for animal cruelty because bulls are often killed at the end of the fight. Animal rights groups say that approximately 180,000 bulls are killed every year in bullfighting worldwide.",
      "The tradition, which has long drawn big crowds to arenas across Mexico, was dealt a blow when a judge in Mexico City banned the practice in June 2022, shutting down an arena that has been billed as the world\u2019s largest bullfighting ring. The judge ruled that bullfights violated city residents' rights to a healthy environment free from violence.",
      "While animal rights advocates celebrated it as a victory, and a step toward ending the bloody tradition, bullfighters said it dealt an economic blow to the city. The National Association of Breeders of Fighting Bulls in Mexico says bullfighting generates 80,000 direct jobs, and 146,000 indirect jobs across the country.",
      "In 2023, Mexico's Supreme Court overturned the ban without explanation, allowing bullfighting arenas to be flooded once again with fans of the so-called \u201cfiesta brava.\"",

      "Speaking to the Italian Senate ahead of a meeting of EU leaders this week, Meloni made her first wide-ranging comments touching on Trump policies that have shaken Europe in the two months since he took office.",
      "Meloni struck a diplomatic tone on tariffs and expressed favor for Trump\u2019s moves to establish a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine as a possible pathway to end the war in Ukraine. She also ruled out sending Italian troops to Ukraine, and spoke against the proposal for a security force by Britain and France. And she pledged to forge ahead with a controversial and stalled plan to vet migrants outside of the EU borders in Albania.",

      "\"We believe that the dispatch of European troops proposed in a draft by Britain and France is a very complex, risky and ineffective option,'' she said.",
      "Meloni said she hoped that a trade war with the United States can be avoided, after the EU responded to U.S. tariffs on steel with tariffs on American whiskey and spirits. Italian winemakers, whose exports to the U.S. last year grew to 2 billion euros, are among those bracing for threatened tariffs of up to 200% should the EU tariffs take effect on April 1.",
      "\u201cI am convinced that we need to work concretely and with pragmatism to find common ground and avoid a trade war that would not benefit anyone, not the United States, and not Europe,\u2019\u2019 Meloni said. She warned against retaliatory tariffs \u201cthat become a vicious circle where everyone loses.\u201d",
      "Meloni said Italy is determined to operate centers in Albania that it built last year to screen asylum seekers, saying she has received support for the project from other EU governments. The project has been stalled after Italian courts refused to approve deportation proceedings, which has been referred to the EU Court of Justice.",
      "\u201cI hope that the court will avoid the risk of compromising the repatriation policies not only of Italy, but all EU member states,'' she said, adding that it would \u201dundermine the very stability of Europe.\"",

      "Germany\u2019s would-be next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, is asking lawmakers to allow the country to put \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d into defense and to authorize an enormous fund for investment in its creaking infrastructure",
      "BERLIN -- Germany's would-be next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, asked lawmakers Tuesday to loosen the nation's strict debt rules to enable higher defense spending as doubts mount about the strength of the trans-Atlantic alliance, and to authorize an enormous fund for investment in its creaking infrastructure, financed by large-scale borrowing.",
      "Merz faced a major test in the outgoing parliament, which met for a final time to vote on the plans as his center-right Union bloc works to put together a governing coalition with the center-left Social Democrats of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz after winning last month's election.",
      "The plans need a two-thirds majority in parliament's lower house, the Bundestag, because they involve changes to Germany's strict self-imposed borrowing rules \u2014 the so-called \u201cdebt brake,\u201d which allows new borrowing worth only 0.35% of annual gross domestic product and is anchored in the constitution. That forced the prospective coalition partners into negotiations with the environmentalist Greens, whose votes will be needed to get enough support.",
      "The package would exempt from the debt rules spending on defense and security, including intelligence agencies and assistance to Ukraine, of more than 1% of GDP. It also foresees setting up a 500 billion-euro ($544 billion) fund, financed by borrowing, to pour funding into Germany's infrastructure over the next 12 years and help restore the stagnant economy \u2014 Europe's biggest \u2014 to growth.",
      "At the Greens' insistence, 100 billion euros from the investment fund will go into climate-related spending.",
      "The plans amount to an about-turn for Merz, whose party had spoken out against running up new debt before the election without entirely closing the door to future changes to the \u201cdebt brake.\u201d The Social Democrats and Greens had long argued for a reform of the borrowing rules.",
      "Recent weeks have brought new urgency to efforts to further strengthen Germany's long-neglected military. The outgoing government created a special 100 billion-euro fund to modernize it, which also helped Berlin meet the current NATO target of spending 2% of GDP on defense. But that pot will be used up in 2027, and doubts have grown recently about the Trump administration's commitment to European allies.",
      "Merz said earlier this month that Germany and Europe must quickly strengthen their defense capability and that \u201c\u2018whatever it takes\u2019 must also go for our defense now.\"",
      "On Tuesday, he pointed to the danger from Russian President Vladimir \u201cPutin's war of aggression against Europe \u2014 it is a war against Europe and not just a war against Ukraine's territorial integrity.\u201d He pointed to suspected Russian sabotage and disinformation in Europe.",
      "Merz said the prospective German government's move should be \u201cthe first step toward a new European defense community,\u201d which could include countries outside the European Union such as Britain and Norway.",
      "He acknowledged that many are struggling to digest the wider spending plans but argued that \u201cthey open prospects for our country that, in the times we are living in, are urgently needed.\u201d",
      "The package was brought to the old parliament \u2014 not the newly elected one, which will hold its first session March 25 \u2014 because parties that were unlikely to agree have just over one-third of the seats in the new chamber. The far-right Alternative for Germany portrays itself as a staunch defender of the \u201cdebt brake,\u201d while the Left Party opposes it but is skeptical about military spending.",
      "\u201cA politician's greatest asset is credibility and with this embarrassing action, dear Mr. Merz, you have already squandered yours completely,\u201d Alternative for Germany co-leader Tino Chrupalla said. \u201cVoters feel cheated by you, and rightly.\u201d",
      "In the outgoing Bundestag, the Union, Social Democrats and Greens have a combined 520 of the 733 lawmakers \u2014 31 more than are required for a two-thirds majority.",
      "If the package is approved Tuesday, it faces another hurdle Friday in parliament's upper house, which represents Germany's 16 state governments. They are also set to be given more freedom to borrow money.",
      "A two-thirds majority will also be needed in the upper house. That initially was uncertain because the parties behind the plans control only 41 of the 69 upper-house votes. But on Monday, the conservative-led governing coalition in Bavaria, which has six votes, also agreed to support the package.",

      "Italian daily Corriere della Sera published a letter to the editor from Francis, signed and dated March 14 from Rome's Gemelli hospital where the 88-year-old pontiff has been treated since Feb. 14 for a complex lung infection and double pneumonia.",

      "WARSAW, Poland -- Poland and the three Baltic nations said Tuesday that they want to withdraw from an international convention that bans antipersonnel land mines due to the growing threat from Russia to front-line NATO states.",
      "The defense ministers of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia said in a joint statement that they \u201cunanimously recommend withdrawing from the Ottawa Convention\" \u2014 the international antipersonnel mine ban convention that went into effect in 1999.",
      "They argue that the security situation along NATO's eastern flank has \"fundamentally deteriorated\u201d since they signed on to the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention, and that \u201cmilitary threats to NATO member states bordering Russia and Belarus have significantly increased.\u201d",
      "\u201cWith this decision, we are sending a clear message: Our countries are prepared and can use every necessary measure to defend our territory and freedom,\" they wrote.",
      "Despite the intention to leave the treaty, they said they would remain committed to humanitarian law, including the protection of civilians during armed conflict.",
      "The Ottawa Convention was signed in 1997 and went into force in 1999. Nearly three dozen countries have not acceded to it, including some key current and past producers and users of land mines such as the United States, China, India, Pakistan, South Korea and Russia.",
      "In a report released last year by Landmine Monitor, the international watchdog said land mines were still actively being used in 2023 and 2024 by Russia, Myanmar, Iran and North Korea.",

      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- An unusually large number of Chinese military ships, planes and drones entered airspace and waters surrounding Taiwan between Sunday and Monday, the self-governing island republic's Defense Ministry said.",
      "China said the drills were a response to recent statements and actions by the U.S. and Taiwan.",
      "The ministry on Tuesday published on its social media several images of Chinese drones and ships and said 43 out of 59 of them entered Taiwan\u2019s air defense identification zone but that no confrontations were reported. Taiwan monitored the situation and deployed aircraft, navy ships and coastal anti-ship missile defenses in response, the ministry said.",
      "China launches such missions on a daily basis in hopes of wearing down Taiwanese defenses and morale, although the vast majority of the island\u2019s 23 million people reject Beijing's claim of sovereignty over Taiwan and its threat to use force to assert its control.",
      "It\u2019s unclear what prompted the large Chinese deployment. Daily figures often vary widely based on statements by the Taiwanese authorities or their U.S. partners.",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Monday the drills were \u201ca resolute response to foreign connivance and support to Taiwan independence, and a serious warning to Taiwan separatist forces.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s military actions are \u201cnecessary, legal and justified measures to defend national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity,\u201d Mao said.",
      "\u201cIn particular, the United States deleted the literal expression that reflected the one-China principle and that did not support Taiwan independence on the website of the U.S. Department of State, which indicates wrong signals to Taiwan separatist forces,\u201d Mao was quoted as saying.",
      "Taiwanese President William Lai Ching-te also raised Beijing's hackles last week when he said that Taiwan law designates mainland China as a \u201cforeign hostile force\u201d and said tougher measures were being taken to prevent Chinese subversion through the media and civic exchanges. Lai also warned of the danger of influential figures and current and retired military members selling secrets to China.",

      "China on Saturday lashed out at accusations by top diplomats from the Group of 7 industrialized democracies who said Beijing is endangering maritime safety.",
      "The G7 had said in a joint statement: \u201cWe condemn China\u2019s illicit, provocative, coercive and dangerous actions that seek unilaterally to alter the status quo in such a way as to risk undermining the stability of regions, including through land reclamations, and building of outposts, as well as their use for military purpose.\u201d",

      "Israel has launched airstrikes across the Gaza Strip that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says are \u201conly the beginning\u201d and \u201ca necessary condition for freeing hostages.\u201d",
      "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- Israel launched airstrikes across the Gaza Strip early Tuesday that killed more than 400 Palestinians, local health officials said, shattering a ceasefire in place since January as it vowed to force Hamas to release more hostages and relinquish control of the territory.",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the strikes after Hamas refused Israeli demands to free half of the remaining hostages as a precondition for extending the ceasefire. Israel\u2019s deadliest bombardment of the territory in the 17-month war killed mostly women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.",
      "Netanyahu said the attack was \u201conly the beginning\u201d and that Israel would press ahead until it achieves all of its war aims \u2014 destroying Hamas and freeing all hostages held by the militant group.",
      "Hamas said at least six senior officials were killed in Tuesday\u2019s strikes. Israel said they included the head of Hamas\u2019 civilian government, a justice ministry official and two security agency chiefs.",
      "All further ceasefire negotiations will take place \u201cunder fire,\u201d he said in a statement aired on national television. The White House said it had been consulted and voiced support for Israel\u2019s actions.",
      "The Israeli military ordered people to evacuate eastern Gaza and head toward the center of the territory, indicating that Israel could soon launch renewed ground operations. The new campaign comes as aid groups warn supplies are running out two weeks after Israel cut off all food, medicine, fuel and other goods to Gaza\u2019s 2 million Palestinians.",
      "The pre-dawn barrage across Gaza struck homes and shelters and set a tent camp ablaze as families slept or prepared the \u201csohour,\u201d the meal Muslims eat before they start the daily fast in the holy month of Ramadan. In Gaza City, Omar Greygaa said that after the strikes, he ran out to help survivors in a nearby stricken building.",

      "The attack could signal the full resumption of a war that has already killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and caused widespread destruction across Gaza. It also raised concerns about the fate of the roughly two dozen hostages held by Hamas who are believed to still be alive.",
      "A senior Hamas official said Netanyahu\u2019s decision to return to war amounts to a \u201cdeath sentence\u201d for the remaining hostages. Izzat al-Risheq accused Netanyahu of launching the strikes to save his far-right governing coalition.",
      "There were no reports of any attacks by Hamas several hours after the bombardment.",
      "But Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels fired rockets toward Israel for the first time since the ceasefire began. The volley set off sirens in Israel\u2019s southern Negev desert but was intercepted before it reached the country\u2019s territory, the military said. The U.S. over the weekend launched deadly strikes against the Iranian-backed Houthis.",
      "Israel\u2019s return to a military campaign came as Netanyahu faces mounting domestic pressure, with mass protests planned over his handling of the hostage crisis and his decision to fire the head of Israel\u2019s internal security agency. His latest testimony in a long-running corruption trial  was canceled after the strikes.",
      "The strikes appeared to give Netanyahu a political boost. A far-right party led by Itamar Ben-Gvir that had bolted the government over the ceasefire announced Tuesday it was rejoining.",
      "The main group representing families of the hostages accused the government of \u201cdeliberately dismantling\u201d the ceasefire. Thousands of Israelis packed a Tel Aviv square Tuesday evening to protest Netanyahu\u2019s intention to fire the country\u2019s domestic security chief and demand the government to resume negotiations for a hostage deal.",
      "\u201cToday Netanyahu did not open the gates of hell on Hamas. He opened the gates of hell on our loved ones,\u201d said Einav Zangauker, whose son is among the hostages.",
      "After two months of relative calm during the ceasefire, stunned Palestinians found themselves once again digging loved ones out of rubble and holding funeral prayers over the dead at hospital morgues.",
      "\u201cNobody wants to fight,\u201d Nidal Alzaanin, a resident of Gaza City, said. \u201cEveryone is still suffering from the previous months.\u201d",
      "A hit on a home in Rafah killed 17 members of one family, according to the European Hospital, which received the bodies. The dead included five children, their parents, and another father and his three children. Another in Gaza City killed 27 members of a family, half of them women and children, including a 1-year-old, according to a list of the dead put out by Palestinian medics.",
      "By noon on Tuesday, Nasser Hospital had received the bodies of at least 28 children killed in recent violence, according to records shared by Ahmed Al-Farra, head of pediatrics and obstetrics.",
      "At Khan Younis\u2019s Nasser Hospital, patients lay on the floor, some screaming. A young girl cried as her bloody arm was bandaged. Wounded children overwhelmed the pediatric ward, said Dr Tanya Haj-Hassan, a volunteer with Medical Aid for Palestinians aid group.",
      "She said she helped treat a 6-year-old girl with internal bleeding. When they pulled away her curly hair, they realized shrapnel had also penetrated the left side of her brain, leaving her paralyzed on the right side. She was brought in with no ID, and \u201cwe don\u2019t know if her family survived,\u201d Haj-Hassan said.",
      "Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry said the strikes killed at least 404 people and wounded more than 560. Zaher al-Waheidi, head of the ministry\u2019s records department, said at least 263 of those killed were women or children under 18. He described it as the deadliest day in Gaza since the start of the war.",
      "In his statement Tuesday, Netanyahu blamed Hamas for civilian casualties, saying it operates among the population.",
      "The war has killed over 48,500 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and displaced 90% of Gaza\u2019s population. The Health Ministry doesn\u2019t differentiate between civilians and militants but says over half of the dead have been women and children.",
      "The war erupted when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages. Most have been released in ceasefires or other deals, with Israeli forces rescuing only eight and recovering dozens of bodies.",
      "The White House blamed Hamas for the renewed fighting. National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said the militant group \u201ccould have released hostages to extend the ceasefire but instead chose refusal and war.\u201d",
      "The ceasefire deal that the U.S. helped broker, however, did not require Hamas to release more hostages to extend the halt in fighting beyond its first phase.",
      "An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the unfolding operation, said Israel was striking Hamas\u2019 military, leaders and infrastructure and planned to expand the operation beyond air attacks.",
      "The official accused Hamas of attempting to rebuild and plan new attacks. Hamas militants and security forces quickly returned to the streets in recent weeks after the ceasefire went into effect. Hamas on Tuesday denied planning new attacks.",
      "Under the ceasefire that began in mid-January, Hamas released 25 hostages and the bodies of eight more in exchange for more than 1,700 Palestinian prisoners as agreed in the first phase.",
      "But Israel balked at entering negotiations over a second phase. Under the agreement, phase two was meant to bring the freeing of the remaining 24 living hostages, an end to the war and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Israel says Hamas also holds the remains of 35 captives.",
      "Instead, Israel demanded Hamas release half of the remaining hostages in return for a ceasefire extension and a vague promise to eventually negotiate a lasting truce. Hamas refused, demanding the two sides follow the original deal, which called for the halt in fighting to continue during negotiations over the second phase.",
      "Israel says it will not end the war until it destroys Hamas\u2019 governing and military capabilities and frees all hostages \u2014 two goals that could be incompatible.",
      "A full resumption of the war would allow Netanyahu to avoid the tough trade-offs called for in the second phase and the thorny question of who would govern Gaza.",
      "It would also shore up his coalition, which depends on far-right lawmakers who want to depopulate Gaza and rebuild Jewish settlements there.",

Palestinian hospital officials say more than 320 people have been killed, including women and children. Israel says the operation is open-ended and expected to expand, raising fears of the 17-month-old war fully reigniting.",
      "Here's what to know about how the strikes came about and what might come next.",
      "The ceasefire agreed to in mid-January was a three-phase plan, the first of which actually ended two weeks ago. Israel balked at entering substantive negotiations over the second phase, which were meant to lead to a long-term ceasefire, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the return of all hostages taken by Hamas in its Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel that started the war.",
      "The ceasefire was supposed to continue as long as talks over the second phase went on, according to the agreement reached after more than a year of negotiations mediated by the United States, Egypt and Qatar.",
      "During the first phase, Hamas returned 25 living hostages and the remains of eight others in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces also withdrew to buffer zones inside Gaza, and hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians returned to northern Gaza. No further hostage releases were called for under the agreement until the second phase.",

      "The attack came during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.

      "Germany\u2019s would-be next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, is asking lawmakers to allow the country to put \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d into defense and to authorize an enormous fund for investment in its creaking infrastructure",
      "BERLIN -- Germany's would-be next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, is asking lawmakers Tuesday to allow the country to put \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d into defense as doubts mount about the strength of the trans-Atlantic alliance, and to authorize an enormous fund for investment in its creaking infrastructure, financed by hefty borrowing.",
      "The outgoing parliament is set to meet for a final time to vote on the plans as Merz's center-right Union bloc works to put together a governing coalition with the center-left Social Democrats of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz after winning last month's election.",
      "The plans will need a two-thirds majority in parliament's lower house, the Bundestag, because they involve changes to Germany's strict self-imposed borrowing rules \u2014 the so-called \u201cdebt brake,\u201d which allows new borrowing worth only 0.35% of annual gross domestic product and is anchored in the constitution. That forced the prospective coalition partners into negotiations with the environmentalist Greens, whose votes will be needed to get enough support.",
      "The package would exempt from the debt rules spending on defense and security, including intelligence agencies and assistance to Ukraine, of more than 1% of GDP. It also foresees setting up a 500 billion-euro ($544 billion) fund, financed by borrowing, to pour funding into Germany's infrastructure over the next 12 years and help restore the economy \u2014 Europe's biggest \u2014 to growth.",
      "At the Greens' insistence, 100 billion euros from the investment fund will go into climate-related spending.",
      "The plans amount to an about-turn for Merz, whose party had spoken out against running up new debt before the election without entirely closing the door to future changes to the \u201cdebt brake.\u201d The Social Democrats and Greens had long argued for a reform of the borrowing rules.",
      "Recent weeks have brought new urgency to efforts to further strengthen Germany's long-neglected military. The outgoing government created a special 100 billion-euro fund to modernize it, which also helped Berlin meet the current NATO target of spending 2% of GDP on defense. But that pot will be used up in 2027, and doubts have grown recently about the Trump administration's commitment to European allies.",
      "Merz said earlier this month that Germany and Europe must quickly strengthen their defense capability and that \u201c\u2018whatever it takes\u2019 must also go for our defense now.\"",
      "He told ARD television Sunday that \u201cthe situation has once again escalated dramatically in recent weeks\u201d and that Germany's budget had turned out to be in worse shape than previously known.",
      "Of Tuesday's vote, he said: \u201cIt will be close, but it will work.\u201d",
      "\u201cOf course there is still persuasion to be done in all three parliamentary groups, but we should not less this opportunity go unused,\u201d he said.",
      "The package is being brought to the old parliament \u2014 rather than the newly elected one, which will hold its first session on March 25 \u2014 because parties that are unlikely to agree have just over one-third of the seats in the new chamber. The far-right Alternative for Germany portrays itself as a staunch defender of the \u201cdebt brake,\u201d while the Left Party opposes it but is skeptical about military spending.",
      "In the outgoing Bundestag, the Union, Social Democrats and Greens have a combined 520 of the 733 lawmakers \u2014 31 more than are required for a two-thirds majority.",
      "If the package is approved Tuesday, it faces another hurdle Friday in parliament's upper house, which represents Germany's 16 state governments. They are also set to be given more freedom to borrow money.",
      "A two-thirds majority will also be needed in the upper house. That initially was uncertain because the parties behind the plans control only 41 of the 69 upper-house votes. But on Monday, the conservative-led governing coalition in Bavaria, which has six votes, also agreed to support the package.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has fired two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission, intensifying efforts to exert his administration\u2019s control over independent agencies across the government",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump fired two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday, intensifying efforts to exert his administration's control over independent agencies across the government.",
      "Commissioners Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter said they'd been dismissed illegally and would sue to block Trump's order. They also said they consider themselves still part of the FTC, though whether they will still have access to their offices and logistical tools like email going forward was unclear.",
      "Removing Bedoya and Slaughter could free up space on the five-member FTC for new commissioners loyal to Trump and his priorities and policies.",
      "The White House confirmed the dismissals. FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson, a Republican whom Trump designated for the role upon taking office in January, released a statement on X saying he had no doubts about Trump's \u201cconstitutional authority to remove Commissioners, which is necessary to ensure democratic accountability.\u201d",
      "The FTC is a regulator created by Congress that enforces consumer protection measures and antitrust legislation. Its seats are typically comprised of three members of the president\u2019s party and two from the opposing party.",
      "Commissioners are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. They serve seven-year terms that are staggered to prevent multiple vacancies at once.",
      "The ousted commissioners pointed to past Supreme Court rulings that sought to solidify the body\u2019s independence and only allowed commissioners to be removed for cause.",
      "\u201cThe president just illegally fired me. This is corruption plain and simple,\u201d Bedoya, who was appointed in 2021 by President Joe Biden and confirmed in May 2022, posted on X.",
      "He added, \"The FTC is an independent agency founded 111 years ago to fight fraudsters and monopolists\u201d but now \u201cthe president wants the FTC to be a lapdog for his golfing buddies.\u201d",
      "The White House countered late Tuesday night that other Supreme Court rulings affirmed the president\u2019s \u201cunrestricted\u201d power to remove \"executive officers who had been appointed by him.\u201d",
      "Slaughter was first appointed to the FTC during Trump's first administration in 2018, and served as its acting chair in 2021. Biden renominated her for a second term in February 2023. Slaughter said in her statement that the \"law protects the independence of the Commission because the law serves the American public, not corporate power.\u201d",
      "\u201cRemoving opposition may not change what the Trump majority can do, but it does change whether they will have accountability when they do it,\" she wrote.",
      "In 1935, the Supreme Court held that the president couldn\u2019t fire leaders of independent agencies without cause. Otherwise, the agencies would become more political and less independent.",
      "While that restriction was eroded in a subsequent decision that came in 2020, it has largely remained in place.",
      "The firings will likely intensify the legal fight around key questions about the extent of presidential powers \u2014 battles that could have consequences for other independent agencies, including the Federal Reserve. But the Trump administration has so far been undeterred in its push to expand a president\u2019s ability to remove such officials at will.",
      "The president used a previous executive order to give the White House more control over the FTC and other regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Communications Commission.",
      "On a subsequent conference call with reporters, Bedoya noted that the FTC was engaged in cases involving tech giants and drug companies and predicted that the move will help powerful corporations while meaning higher prices for consumers.",
      "\u201cWho does this attempt to remove us help?\u201d Bedoya asked. \u201cWho it helps is billionaires. And I think it opens the door for corruption and for (a) law enforcement apparatus controlled, not by the law, but by money.\u201d",
      "Slaughter said on the same call that she and Bedoya were informed at the end of the day about Trump's action and that no specific reason was given for the dismissals.",
      "\u201cWe are not going to go,\" Slaughter said. \"And we certainly are not going to go quietly.\u201d",
      "She added, \"Markets should be worried.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a sign that the guardrails are coming off the protections for freedom and fairness in our economy,\" Slaughter said. \u201cAnd it is a sign that honest businesses should be worried about corruption permeating markets.\u201d",
      "The issue of Trump asserting greater influence is particularly fraught for the Federal Reserve, an institution that has long sought to protect its independence. Economists and financial markets broadly support an independent Fed because they worry a politicized version would be more reluctant to take unpopular steps to fight inflation, such as raise interest rates.",
      "Trump has signaled he will let Fed chair Jerome Powell serve out his term, which ends May 2026. Yet he threatened to fire Powell in 2018 when Powell raised interest rates, a move that can often slow growth.",
      "The dismissals of Bedoya and Slaughter follow the Trump administration removing several years worth of online \u201cbusiness guidance\u201d blogs published by the FTC under the Biden administration. According to various snapshots from the Internet Archive, more than 350 blog posts published on the agency\u2019s website were taken down as of Tuesday.",
      "The removed blog posts covered a wide range of information, from steps the FTC was taking to prevent harms of AI-enabled voice cloning to an explanation of its lawsuit against Amazon\u2019s Prime subscription program. Blog posts published between 2010 and 2017, under Obama, are still up on the agency\u2019s website.",
      "Nidhi Hegde, executive director of the American Economic Liberties Project, an advocacy group that opposes monopolistic practices, said Bedoya and Slaughter's dismissals were \u201cillegal and void.\u201d",
      "\u201cIndependent agencies like the FTC exist to enforce the law as written by Congress and protect the public interest,\" Hegde said in a statement. \u201cNot to be gutted at the whim of a president.\u201d",
      "Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, the only Democrat on both the Judiciary and Commerce committees, called the dismals \u201ca blatantly illegal act.\"",
      "\u201cIt is another unconstitutional power grab. I'm glad you're suing,\u201d Klobuchar said on the conference call with Bedoya and Slaughter. \"In the end, I strongly believe that you will win and you will be reinstated as commissioners.\"",

      "States with aggressive climate goals like Oregon are facing a conundrum",
      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- The pothole outside Timothy Taylor's home was so deep, he could hear the clunk of cars hitting it from inside his house.",
      "The Portland, Oregon, resident could sympathize with those drivers: He knew to avoid his own neighborhood pothole, but another one damaged his car's suspension to the tune of $1,000.",
      "\u201cHearing that awful sound of your car bottoming out \u2014 it\u2019s horrible,\" he said.",
      "Oregon transportation officials say that without more funding, residents like Taylor could see further declines in the quality of roads, highways and bridges starting this year. But revenues from gas taxes paid by drivers at the pump are projected to decrease as more people adopt electric and fuel-efficient cars, forcing officials to look for new ways to fund transportation infrastructure.",
      "States with aggressive climate goals like Oregon are facing a conundrum: EVs can help reduce emissions in the transportation sector, the nation's largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, but they also mean less gas tax revenue in government coffers.",
      "\u201cWe now find ourselves right now in a position where we want to address fuel use and drive down reliance on gases and internal combustion engines. But we need the funds to operate our roads that EVs need to use as well,\u201d said Carra Sahler, director of the Green Energy Institute at Lewis & Clark Law School.",
      "Motor fuel taxes are the largest source of transportation revenue for states, according to the National Association of Budget Officers\u2019 most recent report on state expenditures. But the money they bring in has fallen: Gas taxes raised 41% of transportation revenue in fiscal year 2016, compared with roughly 36% in fiscal year 2024, the group found.",
      "In California, where zero-emission vehicles accounted for about a quarter of all car sales last year, legislative analysts predict gas tax collections will decrease by $5 billion \u2014 or 64% \u2014 by 2035, in a scenario where the state successfully meets its climate goals. California and Oregon are among the multiple states that will require all new passenger cars sold to be zero-emission vehicles by 2035.",
      "The downward revenue trend is already playing out in Pennsylvania, where gas tax revenues dropped an estimated $250 million last year compared with 2019, according to the state\u2019s independent fiscal office.",
      "Inflation has also driven up the cost of transportation materials, further exacerbating budget concerns.",
      "The Oregon Department of Transportation \u2014 citing inflation, projections of declining gas tax revenues and certain spending limitations \u2014 has estimated a budget shortfall topping $350 million for the next budget cycle.",
      "That could mean cuts to winter snow plowing and the striping and paving of roads, as well as layoffs of as many as 1,000 transportation employees.",
      "Republican lawmakers say the gas tax revenue issue has been compounded by the department mismanaging its money. An audit released in January found the department overestimated its revenue for the current budget cycle by over $1 billion and failed to properly track certain funds.",
      "\u201cIt really is about making sure that the existing dollars that are being spent by the department are being spent efficiently and effectively,\u201d said state Sen. Bruce Starr, GOP co-vice chair of the joint transportation committee.",
      "To make up for lost revenue, 34 states have raised their gas tax since 2013, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. California has the highest gas tax at over 69 cents a gallon when including other taxes and fees, while Alaska has the lowest at 9 cents a gallon, according to figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. In Oregon \u2014 which in 1919 became the first state to implement a gas tax \u2014 it is 40 cents a gallon.",
      "The federal gas tax of 18 cents a gallon, which isn\u2019t adjusted for inflation, hasn\u2019t been raised in over three decades.",
      "In Oregon, where there is no sales tax and tolling has met fierce opposition, lawmakers are debating next steps.",
      "Other states have taken steps ranging from indexing their gas tax to inflation, to raising registration fees for EVs, to taxing EV charging stations.",
      "To bolster transportation dollars, some have reorganized their budgets: In Michigan, where Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was first elected using the slogan \u201cFix the Damn Roads,\u201d some revenues from marijuana taxes and personal income taxes now go toward transportation. In Connecticut, the sales tax now brings in more money for its special transportation fund than gas tax revenues, a 2024 fiscal report shows.",
      "Another concept that could provide a long-term solution is a so-called road user charge. Under such a system, drivers pay a fee based on the distance they travel.",
      "In 2023, Hawaii established a road usage charge program for EV drivers that will phase in starting this July. In 2028, all EV drivers will be automatically enrolled, with odometers read at annual vehicle inspections.",
      "Three other states \u2014 Oregon, Utah and Virginia \u2014 have voluntary road usage fee programs. Drivers can opt to use GPS tools to track and report their mileage.",

      "The prime minister's office said that the Canadian $6 billion ($4.2 billion) \u201cOver-the-Horizon Radar\u201d system will provide early warning radar coverage from the Canada-United States border into the Arctic.",
      "Carney made the announcement at a military base in the capital of the Inuit-governed territory of Nunavut. It was his last stop after visiting Paris and London for meetings with leaders there.",
      "\u201cArctic sovereignty is a strategic priority of our government,\u201d Carney said. \u201cCanada is and forever will be an Arctic nation.\"",
      "The Australian radar system will consist of a series of pillars almost a mile (1.6 kilometers) in length. Officials said that the system would have a smaller footprint than what the similar American system would take up.",
      "Senior Canadian government officials, who briefed reporters on Carney's plane before the announcement, said that the purchase has been well received by top military officials in the North American Aerospace Defense Command, the joint U.S.-Canadian military command that overseas threats over the two countries.",
      "But the officials said they couldn't say how the Australian purchase would be received politically by Washington. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly.",
      "Canada\u2019s top military commander also planned to announce that the government will spend Canadian $420 million ($294 million) to expand Canada\u2019s Arctic operations and training exercises and deploy more personnel. Carney said Canada will have a \u201cgreater sustained year-round presence.\u201d",
      "The prime minister is in Iqaluit, which is by far the largest municipality in Nunavut, a vast territory straddling the Arctic Circle. Nunavut is roughly the size of the U.S. states of Alaska and California combined, with a mostly Inuit population of about 40,000.",
      "The prime minister\u2019s flight path took him over Greenland. U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s interest in Greenland, northeast of Nunavut, comes as part of an aggressively \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy platform that has included threats to take control of the Panama Canal and suggestions that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state.",
      "\u201cThe United States priorities, once closely aligned with our own, are beginning to shift,\" Carney said.",
      "Trump has threatened economic coercion to make Canada the 51st state. His constant talk of annexation has infuriated Canadians and turned around the political fortunes of the governing Liberal party, which was headed for a historic defeat but now has a chance of winning a fourth term. Carney is expected to call a general election by the end of the week.",
      "For much of the year, the weather in Iqaluit can be severe. In February 2010, Iqaluit hosted a meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven nations. Several of the dignitaries, including Carney when he was head of Canada\u2019s central bank, went dogsledding in subfreezing temperatures.",
      "It is a distinctive destination \u2014 home to about 7,500 people but not a single traffic light \u2014 with no road or rail links to the outside world.",
      "Increasing international tensions, global warming and the changing world economy have put the Arctic at the heart of the debate over global trade and security.",

      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- With U.S. support for Ukraine in doubt, Kyiv's European allies are weighing whether to seize $300 billion in frozen Russian assets and use the money to compensate Ukraine, support its military and help rebuild shattered homes and towns.",
      "For now, the assets are still on ice, with opponents of seizure warning that the move could violate international law and destabilize financial markets.",
      "Here are key things to know about the debate surrounding the Kremlin assets that were frozen shortly after Russia's full-scale invasion in early 2022:",
      "Originally, the money was in short-term government bonds held as reserves for the Russian central bank. By now, most of the bonds have have matured and turned into cash piling up in custodian banks. Some 210 billion euros are in European Union member states, with the biggest chunk, some 183 billion euros, at Euroclear, a Belgian clearinghouse for financial transactions. Other amounts are at financial institutions in Great Britain, Japan, France, Canada, Switzerland, Australia and Singapore.",
      "So far, the Group of Seven democracies have used the interest on the frozen cash to fund $50 billion in upfront assistance to Ukraine by borrowing against future interest income. That solution avoids legal and financial complications associated with outright confiscating the money and giving it it to Ukraine.",
      "Some of Ukraine's friends \u2014 Poland, the United Kingdom and the Baltic states Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia \u2014 want to do more by taking the principal as well, given the enormous damage Russia has done. The World Bank estimates that reconstructing Ukraine will cost $524 billion over 10 years, already more than the total of the Russian assets. If one or more Western governments resists seizing the assets, the others that want to could still go ahead.",
      "Meanwhile, Ukraine's allies in Europe are contemplating stepping up their financial aid in the wake of statements by U.S. President Donald Trump that Europe must take care of its own security. Several of those allies \u2014 France and Belgium, for instance \u2014 are already saddled with troublesome debt levels above 100% of gross domestic product.",
      "European leaders say seizing the assets now would mean they couldn't be used as a bargaining chip in any peace deal or to help enforce a ceasefire.",
      "French Finance Minister Eric Lombard said Tuesday that it was against international law to seize assets in central banks. If Russian assets were seized without legal grounds, \"it could pose a risk to European financial stability,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI advocate great caution when it comes to those frozen assets,\u201d Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever said at a March 6 EU summit. \u201cAt the moment, that is actually a chicken that also lays golden eggs. Those windfall profits are going to Ukraine.\"",
      "Opponents of seizure also fear that countries and investors would hesitate to use European financial institutions if they are afraid assets could be seized, undermining the euro's role as an international currency for state reserves.",
      "More specifically, governments worry that countries such as Saudi Arabia and China may sell European government bonds in response, said Elina Ribakova, an economist with the Bruegel think tank in Brussels. That would raise borrowing costs for governments already deep in debt.",
      "She favors seizure, however, arguing that the European Central Bank has tools to thwart any unjustified bond selloff by purchasing government bonds.",
      "Also looming over the issue are memories of the 2010-2012 European government debt crisis, in which borrowing costs spiked and raised concerns the euro currency could break up.",
      "There is a \u201cgood deal of PTSD in the EU around messing with the EU sovereign bond market\u201d because of that, said Tom Keatinge, director of the Centre for Finance and Security at the Royal United Services Institute in London.",
      "Some experts argue that seizure would be an appropriate \u201ccountermeasure.\u201d That's a specific legal term referring to an action that would normally be illegal but which is justified as a means to push Russia to stop its own violations of international law.",
      "\u201cThere is no dilemma between using an aggressor's assets to protect its victim and maintaining a commitment to the rules-based order,\u201d wrote Nigel Gould-Davies, senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies and Britain's former ambassador to Belarus, in a legal analysis.",
      "Other scholars say confiscation would not be a legitimate countermeasure.",
      "One reason: justifying a countermeasure as compensation for damages \u2014 instead of merely as pressure to behave \u2014 would be \u201ca very significant expansion of the way we have used countermeasures in the past,\" said Ingrid Brunk, professor of international law at Vanderbilt University Law School. \u201dI would term it as a violation of international law on countermeasures.\u201d",
      "Additionally, Brunk said international law grants strong protection to central bank reserves against seizure \u2014 a principle that has been \u201cabsolutely sacrosanct for a century.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt a time when countries agree on almost nothing, this is a widely, universally accepted rule,\u201d Brunk said, cautioning against \u201ddestabilizing one of the few ironclad bases for the international financial system.\u201d",
      "Keatinge said the legal question is a \u201c50-50 call.\u201d It boils down to a question of \u201cpolitical will.\"",
      "Frozen state assets were used to compensate victims of Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait and Iran's 1979 seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. Those actions were legally justified because they were part of post-conflict peace deals: a U.N. resolution in the case of Iraq, and by diplomatic accords in the case of Iran, noted Brunk.",
      "The Kremlin has repeatedly warned that the seizure of Russian assets would be illegitimate and erode investors\u2019 confidence. \u201cWe view those intentions as unlawful, and any attempt to fulfill them would entail very serious legal consequences,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters earlier this month.",
      "Russia could, in theory, seize the assets of the estimated 1,800 Western companies that continue to do business in Russia. Recent legislation would enable state seizure of companies based in countries designated as \u201cunfriendly,\u201d Russian news media report.",
      "However, there's less to seize on Russia's end. Foreign companies have suffered more than $170 billion in losses since 2022, often as they decided to leave Russia or scale back there, according to the Kyiv School of Economics.",

      "Laced with emojis, the videos posted by smugglers offer a simple promise: If you don\u2019t have a visa in the U.S., trust us. We\u2019ll get you over safely.",
      "At a time when legal pathways to the U.S. have been slashed and criminal groups are raking in money from migrant smuggling, social media apps like TikTok have become an essential tool for smugglers and migrants alike. The videos \u2014 taken to cartoonish extremes \u2014 offer a rare look inside a long elusive industry and the narratives used by trafficking networks to fuel migration north.",
      "\u201cWith God\u2019s help, we\u2019re going to continue working to fulfill the dreams of foreigners. Safe travels without robbing our people,\u201d wrote one enterprising smuggler.",
      "As President Donald Trump begins to ramp up a crackdown at the border and migration levels to the U.S. dip, smugglers say new technologies allow networks to be more agile in the face of challenges, and expand their reach to new customers \u2014 a far cry from the old days when each village had its trusted smuggler.",
      "\u201cIn this line of work, you have to switch tactics,\u201d said a woman named Soary, part of a smuggling network bringing migrants from Ciudad Juarez to El Paso, Texas, who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition that her last name would not be shared out of concern that authorities would track her down. \u201cTikTok goes all over the world.\"",
      "Soary, 24, began working in smuggling when she was 19, living in El Paso, where she was approached by a friend about a job. She would use her truck to pick up migrants who had recently jumped the border. Despite the risks involved with working with trafficking organizations, she said it earned her more as a single mother than her previous job putting in hair extensions.",
      "As she gained more contacts on both sides of the border, she began connecting people from across the Americas with a network of smugglers to sneak them across borders and eventually into the U.S.",
      "Like many smugglers, she would take videos of migrants speaking to the camera after crossing the border to send over WhatsApp as evidence to loved ones that her clients had gotten to their destination safely. Now she posts those clips to TikTok.",
      "TikTok says the platform strictly prohibits human smuggling and reports such content to law enforcement.",
      "The use of social media to facilitate migration took off around 2017 and 2018, when activists built massive WhatsApp groups to coordinate the first major migrant caravans traveling from Central America to the U.S., according to Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, a professor at George Mason University focused on the migrant smuggling industry.",
      "Later, smugglers began to infiltrate those chats and use the choice social media app of the day, expanding to Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Migrants, too, began to document their often perilous voyages north, posting videos trekking through the jungles of the Darien Gap dividing Colombia and Panama, and after being released by extorting cartels.",
      "A 2023 study by the United Nations reported that 64% of the migrants they interviewed had access to a smart phone and the internet during their migration to the U.S.",
      "Around the time of the study's release, as use of the app began to soar, that Correa-Cabrera said she began to see smuggling ads skyrocket on TikTok.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a marketing strategy,\u201d Correa-Cabrera said. \u201cEveryone was on TikTok, particularly after the pandemic, and then it began to multiply.\u201d",
      "Last year, Soary, the smuggler, said she began to publish videos of migrants and families in the U.S. with their faces covered and photos of the U.S.-Mexico border with messages like: \u201cWe\u2019ll pass you through Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, no matter where you are. Fence jumping, treks and by tunnel. Adults, children and the elderly.\u201d",
      "Hundreds of videos examined by the AP feature thick wads of cash, people crossing through the border fence by night, helicopters and airplanes supposedly used by coyotes, smugglers cutting open cacti in the desert for migrants to drink from and even crops of lettuce with text reading \u201cThe American fields are ready!\u201d",
      "The videos are often layered over heavy northern Mexican music with lyrics waxing romantically about being traffickers. Videos are published by accounts with names alluding to \u201csafe crossing,\u201d \u201cUSA destinations,\u201d \u201cfulfilling dreams\u201d or \u201cpolleros,\u201d as smugglers are often called.",
      "Narratives shift based on the political environment and immigration policies in the U.S. During the Biden administration, posts would advertise getting migrants access to asylum applications through the administration's CBP One app, which Trump ended.",
      "Amid Trump's crackdown, posts have shifted to dispelling fears that migrants will be captured, promising American authorities have been paid off. Smugglers openly taunt U.S. authorities: one shows himself smoking what appears to be marijuana right in front of the border wall; another even takes a jab at Trump, referring to the president as a \u201chigh-strung gringo.\u201d",
      "Comments are dotted with emojis of flags and baby chickens, a symbol meaning migrant among smugglers, and other users asking for prices and more information.",
      "Cristina, who migrated because she struggled make ends meet in the Mexican state of Zacatecas, was among those scrolling in December after the person she had hired to smuggle her to the U.S. abandoned her and her partner in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez.",
      "\u201cIn a moment of desperation, I started searching on TikTok and, well, with the algorithm videos began to pop up,\u201d she said. \u201cIt took me a half an hour\u201d to find a smuggler.",
      "After connecting, smugglers and migrants often negotiate on encrypted apps like WhatsApp and Telegram, doing a careful dance to gain each other's trust. Cristina, now living in Phoenix, said she decided to trust Soary because she was a woman and posted videos of families, something the smuggler admitted was a tactic to gain migrants' trust.",
      "Smugglers, migrants and authorities warn that such videos have been used to scam migrants or lure them into traps at a time when cartels are increasingly using kidnapping and extortion as a means to rake in more money.",
      "One smuggler, who asked to only be identified by his TikTok name \u201cThe Corporation\u201d due to fear of authorities tracking him down said other accounts would steal his migrant smuggling network's videos of customers saying to camera they arrived safely in the U.S.",
      "\u201cAnd there's not much we can do legally. I mean, it's not like we can report them,\u201d he said with a laugh.",
      "In other cases, migrants say that they were forced by traffickers to take the videos even if they haven't arrived safely to their destinations.",
      "The illicit advertisements have fueled concern among international authorities like the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration, which warned in a report about the use of the technology that \u201cnetworks are becoming increasingly sophisticated and evasive, thus challenging government authorities to address new, non-traditional forms of this crime.\u201d",
      "In February, a Mexican prosecutor also confirmed to the AP that they were investigating a network of accounts advertising crossings through a tunnel running under the border fence between Ciudad Juarez and El Paso. But investigators would not provide more details.",
      "In the meantime, hundreds of accounts post videos of trucks crossing border, of stacks of cash and migrants, faces covered with emojis, promising they made it safely across the border.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to cross and we\u2019re not scared,\u201d one wrote.",

      "Dallas-based Energy Transfer and its subsidiary Dakota Access alleged defamation, trespass, nuisance and other offenses by Netherlands-based Greenpeace International, its American branch Greenpeace USA, and funding arm Greenpeace Fund Inc. The pipeline company is seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in damages.",
      "The lawsuit stems from protests in 2016 and 2017 of the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline and its Missouri River crossing upstream of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's reservation. The tribe for years has opposed the pipeline as a risk to its water supply. The pipeline has transported oil since mid-2017.",
      "Trey Cox, an attorney for the pipeline company, previously said Greenpeace \u201cplanned, organized and funded a game plan to stop construction\u201d of the pipeline, \u201cwhatever the cost.\u201d",
      "Cox also alleged Greenpeace paid outsiders to come into the area to protest, sent blockade supplies, organized or led protester trainings, passed \u201ccritical intel\u201d to the protesters and told untrue statements to stop the line from being built.",
      "He said a letter signed by leaders of Greenpeace International and Greenpeace USA and sent to Energy Transfer's banks contained an allegedly defamatory statement that the company desecrated burial grounds and culturally important sites during construction.",
      "Greenpeace's \u201cdeceptive narrative scared off lenders\u201d and the company lost half its banks, Cox said.",
      "Attorneys for the Greenpeace entities denied the allegations, saying there is no evidence, they had little or no involvement with the protests and the letter was signed by hundreds of organizations from dozens of countries, with no financial institution to testify the organization received, read or was influenced by the letter.",
      "Greenpeace representatives have said the lawsuit is an example of corporations abusing the legal system to go after critics and is a critical test of free speech and protest rights. An Energy Transfer spokesperson said the case is about Greenpeace not following the law, not free speech.",

      "Shopping for a new home",
      "Shopping for a new home? Ready to renovate your kitchen or install a new deck? You'll be paying more to do so.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s tariffs on imported goods from Canada, Mexico and China \u2014 some already in place, others set to take effect in a few weeks \u2014 are already driving up the cost of building materials used in new residential construction and home remodeling projects.",
      "The tariffs are projected to raise the costs that go into building a single-family home in the U.S. by $7,500 to $10,000, according to the National Association of Home Builders. Such costs are typically passed along to the homebuyer in the form of higher prices, which could hurt demand at a time when the U.S. housing market remains in a slump and many builders are having to offer buyers costly incentives to drum up sales.",
      "We Buy Houses in San Francisco, which purchases foreclosed homes and then typically renovates and sells them, is increasing prices on its refurbished properties between 7% and 12%. That's even after saving $52,000 in costs by stockpiling 62% more Canadian lumber than usual.",
      "\u201cThe uncertainty of how long these tariffs will continue has been the most challenging aspect of our planning,\u201d said CEO Mamta Saini.",
      "The timing of the tariffs couldn\u2019t be worse for homebuilders and the home remodeling industry, as this is typically the busiest time of year for home sales. The prospect of a trade war has roiled the stock market and stoked worries about the economy, which could lead many would-be homebuyers to remain on the sidelines.",
      "\u201cRising costs due to tariffs on imports will leave builders with few options,\u201d said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com. \u201cThey can choose to pass higher costs along to consumers, which will mean higher home prices, or try to use less of these materials, which will mean smaller homes.\u201d",
      "Prices for building materials, including lumber, have been rising, even though the White House has delayed its tariffs rollout on some products. Lumber futures jumped to $658.71 per thousand board feet on March 4, reaching their highest level in more than two years.",
      "The increase is already inflating costs for construction projects.",
      "Dana Schnipper, a partner at building materials supplier JC Ryan in Farmingdale, New York, sourced wooden doors and frames for an apartment complex in Nassau County from a company in Canada that cost less than the American equivalent.",
      "Half the job has already been supplied. But once the tariff goes into effect it will be applied to the remaining $75,000, adding $19,000 to the at-cost total. Once JC Ryan applies its mark up, that means the customer will owe $30,000 more than originally planned, Schnipper said.",
      "He also expects the tariffs will give American manufacturers cover to raise prices on steel components.",
      "\u201cThese prices will never come down,\u201d Schnipper said. \u201cWhatever is going to happen, these things will be sticky and hopefully we\u2019re good enough as a small business, that we can absorb some of that. We can\u2019t certainly absorb all of it, so I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s going to be an interesting couple of months.\u201d",
      "Sidestepping the tariffs by using an alternative to imported building materials isn\u2019t always an option.",
      "Bar Zakheim, owner of Better Place Design & Build, a contracting business in San Diego that specializes in building accessible dwelling units, or ADUs, said Canada remains the best source for lumber.",
      "By sticking with imported lumber, Zakheim had to raise his prices about 15% compared with a year ago. He also has 8% fewer jobs lined up compared with last year.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not about to go out of business, but it\u2019s looking to be a slow, expensive year for us,\u201d he said.",
      "On March 6, the Trump administration announced a one-month delay on its 25% tariffs on certain imports from Mexico and Canada, including softwood lumber. Tariffs of 20% on imports from China are already in effect. A 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports \u2014 50% on those from Canada \u2014 kicked in on March 12.",
      "Tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods slated to go into effect next month will raise the cost of imported construction materials by more than $3 billion, according to the NAHB. Those price hikes would be in addition to a 14.5% tariff on Canadian lumber previously imposed by the U.S., ratcheting up tariffs on Canadian lumber to 39.5%.",
      "Building materials costs overall are already up 34% since December 2020, according to the NAHB.",
      "Builders depend on raw materials, appliances and many other components produced abroad. About 7.3% of all products used in single-family home and apartment building construction are imported. Of those, nearly a quarter come from Canada and Mexico, according to the NAHB.",
      "Both nations also account for 70% of the imports of two key home construction materials: lumber and gypsum. Canadian lumber is used in everything from framing to cabinetry and furniture. Mexican gypsum is used to make drywall.",
      "Beyond raw materials, refrigerators, washing machines, air conditioners and an array of other home components are manufactured in Mexico and China, which is also a key source of steel and aluminum.",
      "The tariffs will mean higher prices for home improvement shoppers, said Dent Johnson, president of True Value Hardware, which operates more than 4,000 independently owned hardware stores.",
      "\u201cThe reality is that many products on the shelves of your local hardware store will eventually be affected,\u201d he said in a statement emailed to The Associated Press.",
      "Confusion over the timing and scope of the tariffs, and their impact on the economy, could have a bigger chilling effect on the new-home market than higher prices.",
      "\u201cIf consumers can\u2019t plan, if builders can\u2019t plan, it gets very difficult to know how to price product because you don\u2019t know what price you need to move it,\u201d said Carl Reichardt, a homebuilding analyst at BTIG. \u201cIf people are worried about their jobs, worried about the future, it\u2019s very difficult to make the decision to buy a new home, whatever the price.\u201d",
      "The uncertainty created by the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs policy will probably result in increased volatility for home sales and new home construction this year, said Robert Dietz, the NAHB's chief economist.",
      "Still, because it can take several months for a home to be built, the larger impact of from building materials costs are going to happen \u201cdown the road,\u201d Dietz said.",
      "The impact tariffs are having on consumers is already evident at Slutsky Lumber in Ellenville, N.Y.",
      "\u201cThere are not as many people getting ready for spring like they usually are,\u201d said co-owner Jonathan Falcon. \u201cIt seems like people are just cutting back on spending.\u201d",
      "Falcon also worries that smaller businesses like his will have a tough time absorbing the impact of the tariffs.",
      "\u201cThis is just like another thing that\u2019s going to be harder for small lumber yards to handle than the big guys and just sort of keep driving businesses like us to not make it,\u201d he said.",

      "This weekend's strikes killed at least 53 people, including children, and wounded others. The campaign is likely to continue, part of a wider pressure campaign by Trump now targeting the Houthis' main benefactor, Iran, as well.",
      "Here's what to know about the U.S. strikes and what could happen next:",
      "The Houthi rebels attacked over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors, from November 2023 until January this year. Their leadership described the attacks as aiming to end the Israeli war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The campaign also greatly raised the Houthis' profile in the wider Arab world and tamped down on public criticism against their human rights abuses and crackdowns on dissent and aid workers.",
      "Trump, writing on his social media platform Truth Social, said his administration targeted the Houthis over their \u201cunrelenting campaign of piracy, violence and terrorism.\u201d He noted the disruption Houthi attacks have caused through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, key waterways for energy and cargo shipments between Asia and Europe through Egypt's Suez Canal.",
      "\u201cWe will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, the U.S. and the United Kingdom began a series of airstrikes against the Houthis starting in January 2024. A December report by The International Institute for Strategic Studies said the U.S. and its partners struck the Houthis over 260 times up to that point.",
      "U.S. military officials during that period acknowledged having a far-wider target list for possible strikes. While the Biden administration didn't go too far into explaining its targeting, analysts believe officials largely were trying to avoid civilian casualties and not rekindle Yemen's stalemated war, which pits the Houthis and their allies against the country's exiled government and their local and international allies, like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.",
      "The Trump administration, however, appears willing to go after more targets, based on the weekend's strikes and public remarks made by officials.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re doing the entire world a favor by getting rid of these guys and their ability to strike global shipping,\u201d U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told CBS News' \u201cFace The Nation\u201d on Sunday. \u201cThat\u2019s the mission here, and it will continue until that\u2019s carried out.\u201d",
      "Rubio added: \u201cSome of the key people involved in those missile launches are no longer with us, and I can tell you that some of the facilities that they used are no longer existing, and that will continue.\u201d",
      "In two words: More attacks.",
      "The Houthis said last week they'll again target \u201cIsraeli\u201d ships traveling through Mideast waterways like the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea, because of Israel's blocking of aid to the Gaza Strip. No rebel attack targeting commercial shipping has been reported as of Monday morning.",
      "However, the new U.S. campaign likely could inspire Houthi attacks at sea or on land beyond American warships. The rebels previously targeted oil infrastructure in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, two countries deeply involved in Yemen's war since 2015.",
      "\u201cAlthough the U.S. has been striking at Houthi targets for over a year, the scope and scale of this new campaign, including the targeting of senior Houthi figures, marks a significant escalation in the conflict,\u201d analysts at the Eurasia Group said Monday.",
      "Gulf Arab countries \"will distance themselves from ongoing hostilities but now face threats to their major oil infrastructure. The Houthis will want to hit President Donald Trump where it hurts, oil prices.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the Houthis likely will expand their possible targets for ship attacks, meaning shippers will continue to stay out of the region, said Jakob P. Larsen, the head of maritime security for BIMCO, the largest international association representing shipowners.",
      "Iran long has armed the Houthis, who are members of Islam\u2019s minority Shiite Zaydi sect, which ruled Yemen for 1,000 years until 1962. Tehran routinely denies arming the rebels, despite physical evidence, numerous seizures and experts tying the weapons back to Iran. That's likely because Tehran wants to avoid sanctions for violating a United Nations arms embargo on the Houthis.",
      "The Houthis now form the strongest group within Iran's self-described \u201cAxis of Resistance.\" Others like Lebanon's Hezbollah and the Palestinian militant group Hamas have been decimated by Israel after the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas that sparked Israel's war of attrition in the Gaza Strip. Allied Shiite militias in Iraq largely have kept their heads down since the U.S. launched retaliatory attacks last year over a drone attack that killed three American troops and injured at least 34 others at a military base in Jordan.",
      "While Iranian state television aired footage of civilian casualties from the weekend strikes in Yemen, top political leaders stayed away from suggestion Tehran itself would get involved in the fight. Revolutionary Guard chief Gen. Hossein Salami notably underscored the Houthis made their own decisions \u2014 while not offering any warning over what would happen if the strikes killed any members of the Guard's expeditionary Quds Force, who are believed to actively support the rebels on the ground.",
      "\u201cWe have always declared \u2014 and we declare again today \u2014 that the Yemenis are an independent and free nation in their own land, with an independent national policy,\u201d Salami said.",
      "Trump's national security adviser Mike Waltz, speaking to ABC's \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday, warned Guard officials training the Houthis \u201cwill be on the table too\u201d as possible targets for attack.",
      "Meanwhile, Iran is still trying to determine how to respond to a letter from Trump aiming to restart negotiations over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei said Monday officials continue to review the letter and will respond \"after investigations are completed.\u201d",
      "Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi separately traveled Sunday to Oman, which long has been an interlocutor between Tehran and the West. The Houthis also operate a political office in the sultanate.",
      "The attacks on the Houthis are \u201ca not-so-subtle signal to Iran, as President Trump has been unequivocal in his insistence that Iran return to the negotiating table to deal with its nuclear program,\u201d the New York-based Soufan Center said in an analysis Monday.",

      "Forever 21 has filed for bankruptcy protection for a second time as traffic in U.S. shopping malls fades and competition from online retailers like Amazon, Temu and Shein intensifies.",
      "F21 OpCo, which runs Forever 21 stores, said late Sunday that it will wind down the business in the U.S. under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection while determining if it can continue as a business with a partner, or if it will sell some or all of its assets.",
      "\u201cWhile we have evaluated all options to best position the company for the future, we have been unable to find a sustainable path forward, given competition from foreign fast fashion companies, which have been able to take advantage of the de minimis exemption to undercut our brand on pricing and margin,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Brad Sell said in a statement.",
      "The de minimis tax exemption lets shipments headed to U.S. businesses and consumers valued at less than $800 to enter the country tax free and duty free.",
      "Forever 21 stores in the U.S. will hold liquidation sales and the website will continue to run while operations wind down. The retailer's locations outside of the U.S. are run by other licensees and are not included in the bankruptcy filing. International store locations and websites will continue operating as normal.",
      "Authentic Brands Group owns the international intellectual property associated with the Forever 21 brand and may license the brand to other operators, F21OpCo said.",
      "Forever 21 first filed for bankruptcy protection in 2019. It was acquired by a consortium of parties including Authentic Brands Group and mall owners Simon Property Group and Brookfield Property Partners.",
      "Forever 21 was founded in 1984 and, along with other fast-fashion chains like H&M and Zara, rode a wave of popularity among young customers in the mid-1990s. Their popularity grew during the Great Recession, when shoppers were seeking bargains. But Forever 21 went on an aggressive expansion just as shoppers were moving more online.",
      "Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said in a statement that part of the problem now is that Forever 21's stores are too big for its current needs and it's in malls with not enough foot traffic.",
      "\u201cForever 21 was always a retailer living on borrowed time. Over recent years it has been hit with dual headwinds from a weak apparel market and stiff competition from cheap Chinese marketplaces,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth things have eroded its standing and depleted its market share.\u201d",

      "Thames Water has received court approval for up to 3 billion pounds of emergency funding",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 Thames Water, which serves 16 million people in and around London, has received court approval for up to 3 billion pounds ($3.7 billion) of emergency funding, preventing the company from falling into government administration.",
      "The High Court in London on Monday dismissed an appeal from a small group of creditors who argued that the funding package was too expensive and favored bigger lenders. The appeal challenged the court\u2019s earlier decision to authorize the deal, which has been backed by lenders holding about 90% of the company\u2019s debt.",
      "The court said it would release the reasoning behind its decision at a later date.",
      "Thames Water, which has about 17 billion pounds ($20.9 billion) of debt, was in danger of running out of money within days if the court had not authorized the new funding. That would have forced the government to consider nationalizing the company.",
      "Both the government and Thames Water say water will continue flowing to customers regardless of what happens.",
      "Thames Water is at the center of nationwide anger over sewage spills that have fouled lakes, rivers and beaches at a time when water and sewage companies are seeking billions of pounds in rate increases to modernize their systems and cope with the demands of climate change and population growth.",
      "Consumers and politicians have criticized the company, arguing that Thames Water created its own problems by paying overly generous dividends to investors and high salaries to executives while failing to invest in pipelines, pumps and reservoirs. Company executives say the fault lies with regulators who kept bills too low for too long, starving the company of the cash it needed to fund improvements.",
      "Ofwat, which regulates water companies in England and Wales, in December approved a 35% increase in Thames Water\u2019s consumer charges over the next five years. The company argued that bills needed to rise 53% in order to finance needed projects and provide the financial returns necessary to attract investors.",

      "The 67-year-old said it's the only way he knows to protest U.S. President Donald Trump's policies. He's furious about Trump's threat to seize the Danish territory of Greenland, but it's not just that. There are also the threats to take control of the Panama Canal and Gaza. And Trump's relationship with Elon Musk, who has far-right ties and made what many interpreted as a straight-armed Nazi salute.",

      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. shoppers stepped up their spending a just bit in February after a sharp pullback the previous month, signaling that Americans are shopping more cautiously as concerns about the direction of the economy mount.",
      "Retail sales rose just 0.2% in February, a small rebound after a sharp drop of 1.2% in January, the Commerce Department said Monday. Sales rose at grocery stores, home and garden stores, and online retailers. Sales fell at auto dealers, restaurants, and electronics stores.",
      "The small increase suggests Americans may be growing more wary about spending as the stock market has plunged and President Donald Trump's tariff threats and government spending cuts have led to widespread uncertainty among consumers and businesses.",
      "Some economists were relieved the numbers weren\u2019t worse. Still, many expect consumer spending will grow just 1% to 1.5% at an annual rate in the first three months of this year, far below the 4.2% gain in the final quarter last year.",
      "\u201cConsumer spending is on track to slow sharply this quarter, but not by as much as we previously feared,\u201d Stephen Brown, an economist at Capital Economics, a consulting firm, said in an email.",
      "On Friday, a measure of consumer sentiment fell sharply for the third straight month and is now down more than 20% since December. Respondents to the University of Michigan's survey cited policy uncertainty as a leading reason for the gloomier outlook. While the respondents were divided sharply by party \u2014 sentiment about the current economy fell among Republican by much less than for Democrats \u2014 Republicans' confidence in the economy's future dropped 10%.",

      "February sales also fell last month at gas stations, clothing stores, and sporting goods stores. The figures aren't adjusted for prices, and the cost of gas also declined in February, which likely accounts for most of the drop. Excluding gas and autos, retail sales rose 0.5%, a healthier figure but still modest after a plunge of 0.8% in January.",
      "Also Monday, the National Association of Homebuilders said its index measuring builder sentiment fell three points to 39, the lowest level in seven months, as economic uncertainty dimmed builders' outlook and fewer potential buyers visited homes.",
      "\u201cEconomic uncertainty, the threat of tariffs and elevated construction costs pushed builder sentiment down in March,\u201d the group said. The homebuilders estimate tariffs will add $9,200 to the cost of a new home.",

      "\u201cOur customers continue to report that their financial situation has worsened over the last year as they have been negatively impacted by ongoing inflation \u201d Vasos said during an earnings call. \u201cMany of our customers report that they only have enough money for basic essentials, with some noting that they have had to sacrifice even on the necessities.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "In the Central Mamuju district of Indonesia\u2019s West Sulawesi, where the Budong-Budong River meets the sea, people have long feared crocodiles",
      "BUDONG-BUDONG, Indonesia -- Nearly seven months after a crocodile attack almost took her life, Munirpa walked to the estuary outside her home with her husband and her children, ready to brave a reenactment.",
      "Munirpa, who like many Indonesians only uses one name, recounted how one early morning in August, she threw her household garbage into a creek about 50 meters (164 feet) away from her house, as she normally would.",
      "She didn't see what was coming next.",
      "By the time she realized a crocodile had attacked her, the four-meter-long (13-foot) beast had already sunk its teeth into most of her body, sparing only her head. She fought hard, trying to jab its eyes. Her husband, hearing her screams, ran over and tried to pull her by the thigh out of the crocodile's jaws. A tug-of-war ensued; the reptile whipped him with its tail. Fortunately, he saved Munirpa in time, eventually dragging her out of the crocodile's grip.",
      "People have long feared the ancient predators in the Central Mamuju district of Indonesia\u2019s West Sulawesi, where the Budong-Budong River meets the sea. For Munirpa, 48, that fear turned into a brutal reality when she became one of nearly 180 recorded crocodile attack victims in Indonesia last year. Residents like her are learning to coexist with the crocodiles, a legally protected species in Indonesia, as they balance conservation with looking out for their safety. But as attacks rise, several residents and experts have called for better government interventions to stop the problem from getting even worse.",
      "Following the attack, Munirpa was hospitalized for a month and has had two surgeries. By February this year, her fear was still clearly visible, as were the scars on her legs and thighs.",
      "\u201cI am so scared. I don\u2019t want to go to the beach. Even to the back of the house, I don\u2019t dare to go,\" said Munirpa. \u201cI am traumatized. I asked my children not to go to the river, or to the backyard, or go fishing.\"",
      "In the villages surrounding the Budong-Budong River, like Munirpa's, crocodiles have become a daily topic of conversation. Their presence has become so common that warning signs now mark the areas where they lurk, from the river mouth to the waterways which were once a popular swimming spot for children.",
      "In 2024, there were 179 crocodile attacks in Indonesia, the highest number of crocodile attacks in the world, with 92 fatalities, according to CrocAttack, an independent database. Social media videos showing crocodile appearances and attacks in Sulawesi and other regions in Indonesia are also on the rise.",
      "The increase in attacks began about 12 years ago with the rise of palm oil plantations around the river mouth, said 39-year-old crocodile handler Rusli Paraili. Some companies carved artificial waterways, linking them to the larger part of the Budong-Budong River. That was when the crocodiles started straying, leaving the river and creeping to nearby residential areas, such as fish and shrimp ponds, he explained.",
      "Palm oil plantations now dominate the landscape in West Sulawesi, from the mountains to the coast, and patrolling for crocodiles has become part of people's daily routine. When residents check the water pumps in their ponds, they have no choice but to keep out an eye for the beasts \u2014 flashlights in hand, scouring up, down and across canals and waterways \u2014 resigned to the uneasy reality of sharing their home with a predator.",
      "The saltwater crocodile has been a legally protected species in Indonesia since 1999, making it an animal that cannot be hunted freely. As a top predator, there is also no population control in nature.",
      "Paraili, the crocodile handler, said that while the law protects crocodiles from being killed, the rise in attacks is a major concern. In response, he's taken care of some of the crocs in a specially-designed farm away from human populations. He's received some financial support from the government and community donations, as well as support from palm oil companies for the last five years.",
      "The farm has four ponds and around 50 reptiles. Some have names: Tanker, the largest, shaped like a ship, or Karossa, named after the sub-district the animal was caught after fatally attacking someone.",
      "When funds run low, he uses his own money to ensure they\u2019re fed, at least once every four days.",
      "Amir Hamidy, who studies reptiles at the National Research and Innovation Agency, worries the rise in attacks indicates that crocodile numbers are becoming far too dangerous. Hamidy supports better population control.",
      "Being a protected species \u201cdoes not necessarily mean that the population cannot be reduced when it is at a level that is indeed unsafe,\" he said.",
      "Around a year ago in Tumbu village, Suardi, who goes by one name, was harvesting coconuts when they fell into the river. When he went to retrieve them, he was attacked by a crocodile he initially didn't notice. He's since made a full recovery.",
      "Still, the experience has made him more cautious. \u201cYes, I am worried. But what else can we do,\" Suardi said. \u201cThe important thing is that we are careful enough.\u201d",
      "Along with Munirpa, Suardi is one of 10 people in the region who was attacked by a crocodile last year. Three of those attacked were killed.",
      "Suyuti Marzuki, who's head of West Sulawesi Marine and Fisheries Agency, said the crocodile habitat shift is making people's everyday activities \u2014 like harvesting coconuts, fishing or even disposing of garbage like Munirpa \u2014 very risky.",
      "Marzuki said the government is looking at possible options that can provide both safety and economic alternatives for residents.",
      "While he acknowledged that crocodile population numbers and ecosystems need to be protected, Marzuki also raised the possibility of bolstering the local economy through the crocodile skin trade. That industry is controversial because of conservation and animal welfare issues.",
      "Paraili, the crocodile handler, also urged serious government interventions.",
      "\"This is a matter of human lives. So when the government is not serious, then our brothers and sisters in the future \u2014 in 5 or 15 years \u2014 there will be even more who will die from being attacked by crocodiles,\u201d he said.",
      "Residents like Munirpa and Suardi are waiting for more immediate and realistic steps from the authorities to ensure their community's and families' safety.",
      "\u201cIt is enough that I've been bitten by a crocodile,\" Munirpa said. \u201cI won\u2019t let it happen to my children.\u201d",

      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- A federal judge in New York granted the attorneys of a Russian woman permission Monday to issue subpoenas to access the financial records of Antigua and Barbuda\u2019s prime minister and other officials involved in the sale of a megayacht that her father had abandoned.",

      "\u201cThe financial records will speak for themselves,\u201d said Martin De Luca, with Boies Schiller Flexner LLP.",
      "He is one of the attorneys for Yulia Guryeva-Motlokhov, who claims she is the rightful owner of the Alfa Nero megayacht, which remained anchored off Antigua for a couple months before the local government seized and sold it last year.",
      "Browne did not immediately respond to a message for comment regarding the judge\u2019s ruling.",
      "The attorneys for Guryeva-Motlokhov alleged in a March 11 filing in federal court that Browne\u2019s administration has not released documents related to the $40 million sale of the yacht, once owned by Andrey Guryev, a Russian businessman who founded a fertilizer company and worked in the Russian government.",
      "He was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department in August 2022, and the megayacht was removed from the sanctions list in June 2023 so Antigua could liquidate it.",
      "Antigua\u2019s opposition leaders also have demanded details of how the proceeds from the yacht sale were spent.",
      "Browne has said that details related to the yacht sale are public. On Sunday, he sent The Associated Press several documents he said showed those details.",
      "\u201cThis is irrefutable evidence that the claim that $10M is missing from the proceeds is a fabrication,\u201d he wrote in a message, referring to claims made in the March 11 filing.",
      "However, key information was redacted in bank payment/transfer forms that made it difficult to confirm details of the loans and advances.",
      "Browne also accused Guryeva-Motlokhov of defamation.",
      "In July 2024, Browne\u2019s wife, Maria Browne, Antigua\u2019s Minister of Housing, told The Antigua Observer newspaper that the proceeds were used to pay off government debt. Days before the report was published, the prime minister had said his administration was considering using the money to build a resort.",
      "Attorneys for Guryeva-Motlokhov are seeking documents and information related to wire transfers and other transactions involving the prime minister and six other people, as well as 12 entities, in the past five years.",
      "The people targeted include Browne, his wife, their son and Antigua\u2019s general accountant and its port manager.",
      "The entities include West Indies Oil Co. Ltd., an Antigua-based petroleum storage and distribution company of which the government is a majority shareholder, and Fancy Bridge Ltd., a Hong Kong-based investment firm that owns shares in the oil company, as does Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela S.A., known as PDVSA.",
      "The institutions that the attorneys plan to subpoena are required to comply with the request for information unless Browne or someone else files a motion opposing the subpoenas.",
      "Legal cases related to Alfa Nero also are ongoing in Russia and the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court.",

      "Baseball in Japan \u2014 the game is called \"yakyu\" (field ball) in Japanese \u2014 carries more of a rock-concert vibe than its American cousin. And with Shohei Ohtani teasing fans for a week in Tokyo as the two-game series approached, it\u2019s a true spectacle.",
      "You don't see the following routinely in North America. You did Tuesday in the Tokyo Dome.",
      "Young women carry beer kegs on their backs, drawing a cold draft while you're seated watching the game. Fans are clearly more animated. Even elderly men come with a glove \u2014 just in case. And chopsticks are in use as fans watching the game snack on noodles or a rice dish.",
      "The food selection at the concession stands is mostly Asian, but popcorn and beer are plentiful. You can even buy a version of Cracker Jack.",
      "Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said he played baseball in Puerto Rico and Mexico and suggested the Japanese game and the Latin American game were linked.",
      "\u201cI would say the similarity is the passion from the fans. I think in Tokyo it's a little more controlled emotion, chaos. Where in Latin America, playing winter ball \u2014 in the best possible way \u2014 it's chaotic and a lot of passion.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's definitely close,\" Dodgers Venezuelan shortstop Miguel Rojas said. \u201cThey enjoy the game a little bit different than the United States. This is the closest thing you will find (to Latin America).\"",

      "The two biggest names in college basketball these days will be playing in the women\u2019s tournament when March Madness gets into full swing",
      "It\u2019s no stretch to say the two biggest names in college basketball these days will be playing in the women\u2019s tournament when March Madness goes into full swing later this week.",
      "Whether the presence of Juju Watkins of USC and Paige Bueckers of UConn will overcome the game\u2019s loss of Caitlin Clark and drive a repeat of last year\u2019s history-making surge in viewership is among the underlying questions over the next three weeks.",
      "One of the surest signs of the growing popularity of the women's game came last year, when the final of the tournament, featuring Clark's Iowa Hawkeyes against coach Dawn Staley\u2019s South Carolina juggernaut,drew more viewers than the men\u2019s final between UConn and Purdue.",
      "It was a first, driven in part by the fact that the men\u2019s game wasn\u2019t on an over-the-air network and the women\u2019s was, but also thanks to the legion of Clark fans, many of whom have followed her to the WNBA.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m hard-pressed to believe they\u2019re going to reach the Caitlin Clark number again, because that was a comet that probably won\u2019t be repeated this year,\u201d Kevin Hull, a sports media professor at South Carolina, said of the 18.87 million who tuned into the women's title game last year. \u201cBut they\u2019re going to get a really good number again. It\u2019s a great time to be in women\u2019s sports.\u201d",
      "Besides Duke freshman Cooper Flagg, there aren\u2019t any men\u2019s players who can rival the numbers Bueckers or Watkins put up in what might be the most important metric in today's world \u2013 their social media followings. Last week, in a notable transaction, Watkins became the first woman college athlete to sign an endorsement deal with Fanatics.",
      "It\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t compelling story lines in the men\u2019s tournament. But as has often been the case, they have more to do with coaches \u2013 think, Rick Pitino at St. John\u2019s \u2013 or programs \u2013 think Duke or North Carolina \u2014 than with individual players.",
      "Last year's biggest name on the men's side was Purdue's Zach Edey, a well-spoken but generally quiet 7-foot-4 center from Canada whose old-school post-up game sparked a fascinating debate for hardcore hoops junkies, but didn't bring the rest of the world in.",
      "For decades, though, none of that ever prevented the men\u2019s tournament from outdrawing the women. Among the advantages for the men: more backing from the NCAA, a longer history as a sport and a deeper, more competitive field from 1-68, which, in turn, spawns more upsets and Cinderella stories.",
      "Without some of those built-in advantages, the women\u2019s game has had to embark on a slow, steady climb.",
      "Hull believes one landmark moment was the success of the U.S. women\u2019s soccer team in the 1990s, which \u201ckind of changed the game when it came to all women\u2019s sports.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd we\u2019ve seen it in the years since, with the WNBA and all these other sports,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Caitlin Clark was the right person at the right time, who just sort of turned the spark into a flame.\u201d",
      "The women\u2019s tournament was already surging in popularity in 2021 (the first year ESPN broadcast every game nationally) when Sedona Prince lit a fuse with her viral video of the sparse weight room available to the players at their base in San Antonio.",
      "It forced a reckoning with some of the longstanding inequalities between the men\u2019s and women\u2019s games. The most devastating was the huge disparity of the TV contracts but perhaps the best illustration of the imbalance came in the fact that the NCAA didn\u2019t even use the \u201cMarch Madness\u201d title for the women\u2019s tournament.",
      "The renegotiation of the TV contract (some say for not enough), combined with Clark\u2019s rise and a layering of some Magic-vs.-Bird-like racial tension between Clark and Angel Reese (who say they have no problem with each other) helped push popularity and viewership to the heights seen last year.",
      "Len Elmore, the longtime player and TV analyst who now teaches sports management at Columbia, suggested the Clark vs. Reese vibe created a tension that many Americans can't turn away from. He also said \u201csome people like the women\u2019s game better than the men\u2019s game for a number of fundamental basketball reasons.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year, the NCAA announced that women's teams, for the first time, would receive payments \u2014 known as \u201cunits\u201d \u2014 for playing in March Madness.",
      "\u201cA lot of it has to do with us being treated like a sport now,\u201d said Staley, whose Gamecocks are top seeded as they embark on their quest for back-to-back titles. \u201cWhen you treat us like a sport, you will get a return on your investment.\u201d",
      "Most signs point toward last year\u2019s ratings as part of a sustainable trend.",
      "A matchup between Watkins and Bueckers in December averaged 2.2 million viewers, making it the second-most watched women\u2019s game ever on Fox, behind one last season in which Clark set the NCAA scoring record. ESPN\u2019s regular-season ratings were up 3% from last year and 41% from two seasons ago.",
      "Next comes March Madness, where Watkins and Bueckers could face a rematch in the regional finals, while Staley and South Carolina are positioned on the other side of the bracket, setting up a possible meeting with one of them in the final on April 6.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m pretty confident in saying that the days of the men\u2019s Final Four dwarfing the women\u2019s -- double, three-times viewership \u2013 those days are long gone,\u201d Hull said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me if the women\u2019s gets more. There\u2019s buzz now, and the TV networks are treating it as a big deal.\u201d",

She had 14 games with 30 or more points, including a 51-point outburst at Stanford, the most points by any men\u2019s or women\u2019s player in the nation.",
      "Still, the urge to be better is always there.",
      "\u201cShe looks at what she can improve first. She never points a finger at somebody else,\u201d USC coach Lindsay Gottlieb said. \u201cIt\u2019s always where can she grow and that\u2019s a pretty remarkable trait for a 19-year-old.\u201d",
      "Part of Watkins\u2019 support system is Phil Handy, a 53-year-old former Los Angeles Lakers assistant who coached in the women\u2019s Unrivaled Basketball League this season. They met through a mutual family friend when Watkins was in eighth grade.",
      "\u201cI saw the drive in her, I saw her curiousness, what does it look like to be great,\u201d Handy recalled in a phone interview.",
      "Watkins credits Handy for being \u201cvery there for me.\u201d He views himself as her \u201ctrainer, coach, big brother, uncle.\u201d They text regularly and watch game film together over Zoom. When Handy is in town, they hit the gym.",
      "\u201cWhenever there\u2019s work to do, she\u2019s never saying no,\u201d he said.",
      "Through watching more film this season, Watkins has toiled to match her basketball knowledge with her formidable skills on the court.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s really challenged herself in that way to become a smarter player to where she understands how to read defenses and what teams are doing,\u201d Handy said.",
      "Watkins chose to attend college in her hometown \u2014 just a few miles from her primarily Hispanic and Black neighborhood of Watts \u2014 and the community comes out to support her. Men, women and children of all ages and races clamor for photos and autographs after games and Watkins patiently rewards them.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s pretty remarkable in how she handles the sort of craziness around her,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cShe\u2019s a natural introvert.\u201d",
      "A massive three-panel mural of Watkins wearing her iconic bun in a Nike ad went up on a building in downtown Los Angeles last month.",
      "\u201cHow cool,\u201d Gottlieb said, \u201cbut she shows up here and I tell her to play better defense or make the right read. She\u2019s so coachable and humble.\u201d",
      "Watkins downplays talk of her succeeding Caitlin Clark as the face of women\u2019s college basketball.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s an honor, but I don\u2019t really think about that much,\u201d she said. \u201cThe main goal is just staying present here and handling business.\u201d",
      "Her off-court business overseen by Klutch Sports is thriving. She has NIL deals with Nike, Fanatics, snack maker Mondelez, United Airlines, Degree deodorant, State Farm, Gatorade and collectibles company Funko, among others. Her NIL valuation is one of the highest in the country at an estimated $739,000, according to On3.com.",
      "Watkins is bolstered by her family, including parents Robert and Sari, both former college athletes who are ever-present in the front row. Her sister, Mali, sometimes sings the national anthem at games.",
      "\u201cThey always tell me, \u2018Just go out there and do you,'\" she said.",
      "Seeing Watkins in person has become a hotter ticket. The Trojans\u2019 average home attendance rose to 5,932 this season from last year\u2019s 4,421. Celebrities like Snoop Dogg, Kevin Hart, Jason Sudeikis, Michael B. Jordan and Sanaa Lathan, who starred in \u201cLove & Basketball,\u201d one of Watkins\u2019 favorite movies, have showed up. The year before she arrived attendance averaged 1,037.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to make it feel like football,\u201d she said, referring to USC\u2019s biggest sport. \u201cThat\u2019s my goal here, to make it feel like a big thing.\u201d",
      "Watkins, of course, is the main focus of opposing defenders who by now know her go-to spots on the floor and try to take them away. But she\u2019s got a running mate in forward Kiki Iriafen, a graduate transfer from Stanford who returned to her hometown.",
      "Iriafen\u2019s 18.2-point average is second to Watkins while her field goal, 3-point and free throw averages are all higher than the sophomore.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s raising my IQ in all ways and pushing me to be a better player,\u201d Watkins said.",
      "UCLA coach Cori Close has seen Watkins up close, with the Bruins losing two of three to the Trojans this season. Close cites Watkins\u2019 \u201celite-level work ethic\u201d as one of the reasons she\u2019s so good. Watkins is known for hitting USC\u2019s gym at night to put up hundreds of shots, similar to the late Kobe Bryant\u2019s diligence.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re driven by success sometimes there is no balance,\u201d Handy said.",
      "Last year, a loss pushed Watkins to lonely hours of work, but she\u2019s learning moderation.",
      "\u201cSometimes it\u2019s OK to walk away from it for a little bit,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m watching \u2018Severance\u2019 right now. Just watch a TV show, chill and get back to it the next day.\u201d",
      "Watkins' placid facial expression belies whatever is happening on the court. Behind closed doors, however, Handy sees her fiery side when she misses shots or doesn't pick up something as quick as she expects.",
      "\u201cShe just has an appetite,\u201d he said. \u201cIt definitely reminds you of great athletes before her time, the Kobes, the MJs, the women's players.\u201d",
      "It's almost go-time for the Trojans and that means Watkins is narrowing her mental focus.",
      "\u201cNow I'm kind of in this space where nothing else is around me,\u201d she said. \u201cJust go tunnel vision for as long as possible.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe track\u2019s structure is done. We had it in our calendars to finish by March 16 and that\u2019s when it was finished,\u201d Fabio Saldini, the government commissioner in charge of rebuilding the century-old track in Cortina d\u2019Ampezzo, told The Associated Press on Tuesday.",
      "Construction workers celebrated Sunday\u2019s milestone by laying down a branch of an evergreen tree across the track.",
      "\u201cThe tree branch represents a starting point, like when (bobsled) teams get ready to push off before launching themselves down the track,\u201d said Luca Zaia, president of the Veneto region that includes Cortina. \u201cI hope that the enthusiasm builds minute by minute in a crescendo worthy of an event of this magnitude.\u201d",
      "Twenty workers preparing ice on the track day and night are slated to finish by Sunday.",
      "Then starting on Monday, bobsled, luge and skeleton athletes will perform test runs in order to secure preliminary certification \u2014 homologation is the technical word \u2014 for the track. Also coming are 26 coaches, plus officials from the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation, International Luge Federation, and the International Olympic Committee.",
      "Even preliminary approval would go a long way toward avoiding a backup Plan B option that the IOC had demanded and which would require moving the three sliding sports all the way to Lake Placid, New York, if the track in Italy wasn\u2019t finished in time.",
      "\u201cAs of today, 50% of the ice is ready,\u201d Saldini said. \u201cWe had some trouble last week due to high temperatures, rain and snow. But then we covered the track with nets and yesterday we actually put down too much ice.\u201d",
      "Security has been increased around the track since a refrigeration tube was removed and placed across a road in a reported act of sabotage last month, according to the government agency, Simico.",
      "Besides the sliding events, Cortina will also host women\u2019s Alpine skiing and curling during the Winter Games.",

      "MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. -- Calling the groups in charge of professional tennis \u201ca cartel,\u201d the players' association co-founded by Novak Djokovic filed an antitrust lawsuit against the women's and men's tours, the International Tennis Federation and the sport's integrity agency on Tuesday in federal court in New York.",
      "The suit by the Professional Tennis Players' Association says the organizations that run the sport hold \u201ccomplete control over the players\u2019 pay and working conditions\u201d and their setup constitutes \u201ctextbook violations of state and federal law\u201d that \u201cimmunize professional tennis from ordinary market forces and deny professional tennis players and other industry participants their right to fair competition.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit seeks a jury trial and wants players to gain access to more earnings, arguing that the governing bodies that oversee the four Grand Slam tournaments \u2014 Wimbledon, the U.S. Open, the French Open and the Australian Open \u2014 and other professional events \u201ccap the prize money tournaments award and limit players\u2019 ability to earn money off the court.\u201d",
      "The WTA Tour and ATP Tour issued separate statements Tuesday saying they would \u201cvigorously\u201d defend themselves.",
      "The WTA said it has \u201ccommitted to a $400 million increase in player compensation\u201d in recent years and labeled the PTPA action a \u201cbaseless legal case\u201d that is \u201cregrettable and misguided.\u201d The ATP touted a \u201cmajor increase in player compensation\u201d that created a jump of \u201c$70 million in the past five years,\u201d and called the PTPA's case \u201centirely without merit.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe PTPA has consistently chosen division and distraction through misinformation over progress,\u201d the ATP's statement said. \u201cFive years on from its inception in 2020, the PTPA has struggled to establish a meaningful role in tennis, making its decision to pursue legal action at this juncture unsurprising.\u201d",
      "The ITF and the International Tennis Integrity Agency \u2014 which investigates and adjudicates doping and corruption cases \u2014 declined to comment.",
      "The PTPA was founded by 24-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic and Vasek Pospisil in August 2020, aiming to offer representation for players who are independent contractors in a largely individual sport. One of the goals made clear along the way was to become a sort of full-fledged union that negotiates collective bargaining agreements like those that exist in team sports.",
      "\u201cFor the past few years, the PTPA, an organization I\u2019ve worked on tirelessly since its inception, has made countless efforts to collaborate with the tours in hopes of achieving positive change for players. Despite these efforts and attempts to engage in constructive dialogue, we were met with resistance and a lack of meaningful action. It is because of this ongoing disregard for players that we were left with no alternative but to take action of our own,\u201d Pospisil posted on social media. \u201cFor too long, players have been forced to accept a broken system that ignores our well-being, undervalues our contributions, and leaves us without real representation.\u201d",
      "Djokovic is not one of the players listed as a plaintiff.",
      "\u201cHis support for this is already explicit. It\u2019s redundant since PTPA (is) named as plaintiff, and he is on (the executive committee),\u201d PTPA spokesman David Cooper wrote in an email. \u201cHe wanted to allow others to step up since this is not just Novak\u2019s (organization).\u201d",
      "The PTPA said it met with more than 250 players \u2014 women and men, and a majority of the top 20 in the WTA and ATP rankings \u2014 before going to court.",
      "\u201cTennis is broken,\u201d PTPA executive director Ahmad Nassar said in a news release. \u201cBehind the glamorous veneer that the defendants promote, players are trapped in an unfair system that exploits their talent, suppresses their earnings, and jeopardizes their health and safety. We have exhausted all options for reform through dialogue, and the governing bodies have left us no choice but to seek accountability through the courts. Fixing these systemic failures isn\u2019t about disrupting tennis \u2014 it\u2019s about saving it for the generations of players and fans to come.\u201d",

      "Instead, the candidates were joined under a nearby tented cover with all their colleagues in the 109-strong International Olympic Committee membership, which votes in perhaps the most discreet and opaquely campaigned of sports elections.",
      "\u201cGreece and Greek civilization have given the world two wonderful gifts \u2014 democracy and the Olympic Games,\u201d said IOC President Thomas Bach, who has reached the maximum 12 years in office and formally leaves in June.",

      "Coe and Coventry are two-time Olympic champions \u2014 in track and swimming, respectively \u2014 and Samaranch is the longest-serving IOC member of the seven. The Spanish financier joined in 2001 when his father, also Juan Antonio Samaranch, left after 21 years as president.",
      "Coventry would be the first woman and first African leader in the IOC\u2019s 131-year history. She has long been seen as Bach\u2019s favored successor, giving her a solid base of votes though likely not decisive in the first round of voting.",
      "Also standing are Prince Feisal al Hussein of Jordan, a member of the IOC executive board, and three presidents of sports governing bodies: skiing\u2019s Johan Eliasch, who is also a billionaire sportswear brand owner; cycling\u2019s David Lappartient; and Morinari Watanabe of gymnastics.",
      "The winner Thursday must get an absolute majority of votes. Until then, the candidate with the fewest votes in each round will be eliminated. The term of office is eight years.",
      "IOC voters invited into the exclusive club are a global mix of royal family members, former lawmakers and diplomats, business leaders, sports officials and Olympic athletes.",
      "Challenges facing the next president include steering the Olympic movement toward the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, maintaining political balance with the United Nations and working with U.S. President Donald Trump, as well as protecting women\u2019s sports.",
      "At Ancient Olympia, the games started more than 2,800 years ago in 776 B.C. They lapsed for centuries until being revived in 1896 by Pierre de Coubertin, whose heart is buried at the site.",
      "On Tuesday, Bach explained why the IOC had come: \u201cA sacred pilgrimage to our ancient past. A homage to our modern origins and to our founder. And a manifestation of our faith in the future when we will elect a new president.\u201d",
      "The Greek head of state, President Constantine Tassoulas who was sworn in last week, suggested all future IOC presidential elections could be held at Ancient Olympia. After this week, the next one is scheduled in 2033.",

      "Porter Moser spent three seasons in the Big 12 before shepherding Oklahoma to the Southeastern Conference, making the longtime coach uniquely suited to compare the erstwhile best conference in America to the current king of college hoops.",
      "\u201cThe things is, there is no bottom,\u201d Moser explained. \u201cThat's what we felt in the Big 12 the last couple years. But the athleticism with the ages is the difference. The athleticism, in my opinion, I've never seen in any league in any era. The length, age, shooters, skill levels of the teams in the SEC this year \u2014 it's unbelievable. \u201d",
      "Unbelievable is a good way to describe Selection Sunday.",
      "The expanded SEC landed a record 14 teams in the 68-team bracket, populating it with the overall No. 1 seed (Auburn), another No. 1 seed (Florida) and four more among the top four seeds in their respective regions. The total was a full three more than the previous record, held by the Big East, back when it was considered the dominant league in the country.",
      "Buzz Williams was a part of that league, back when he was with Marquette. Then he moved to the ACC at Virginia Tech, which never seemed a whole lot easier. But these days? Every night, Williams knows his boys at Texas A&M are in for a fight.",
      "\u201cI do think what\u2019s transpiring is historic. And I don\u2019t think that when you\u2019re living in it, you\u2019re clapping as a fan or as a media member going, \u2018This is really cool,\u2019\u201d Williams said. \"You\u2019re trying to figure out how to not suffocate yourself from the burden that you feel that (every) possession can move the needle.\u201d",
      "So how exactly did the SEC reach this point? How did a league known for fall Saturdays in the South \u2014 the Iron Bowl, the Egg Bowl, the \u201cWorld\u2019s Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party\u201d \u2014 become the epicenter of winters on the hardwood?",
      "A good place to start is 2016, when Greg Sankey took over as the commissioner. The SEC only landed three schools in the NCAA Tournament that year, and Sankey was unwilling to accept any excuses from coaches, athletic directors and administrators.",
      "One of his first calls was to Mike Tranghese, the old Big East commissioner, who came aboard as a consultant. The next was to Dan Leibovitz, a former coach with NBA ties, who became associate commissioner in charge of basketball. When Leibovitz took over the Big East, Sankey brought in Garth Glissman, who had been vice president of basketball operations for the NBA.",
      "In other words, Sankey brought in basketball minds to lead a basketball resurrection.",
      "Then, that group convinced schools that winning in football and basketball wasn't an either-or proposition. They could succeed in both of college athletics' most lucrative games, provided they did a few seemingly simple things:",
      "\u2014 They invested in them. More than half of the teams in the current 16-team configuration have built new arenas or undertaken transformative renovations since Sankey was hired, and others have invested in player dormitories and practice facilities.",
      "\u2014 They hired the right coaches and paid them well. The common denominator has been track records as winning head coaches, either in other power conferences \u2014 such as Rick Barnes at Tennessee and Chris Beard at Ole Miss \u2014 or from the mid-major level, such as Missouri's Dennis Gates, Todd Golden at Florida, Nate Oats at Alabama and Mississippi State's Chris Jans.",
      "\u2014 They recruited the right players, transfers and freshmen alike. Three of the league's biggest stars got their start elsewhere: Auburn's Johni Broome at Morehead State, Florida's Walter Clayton Jr. at Iona and Alabama's Mark Sears at Ohio. Looking ahead to next season, 14 of the league's 16 teams have at least one top-100 freshman recruit.",
      "The coaches have managed to navigate a brave new world of the transfer portal and name, image and likeness compensation in college sports, keeping their best players with proper packages while bringing in others with robust support from alumni and administrators.",
      "\u201cWhen Vandebilt wins, it strengthens our connection to the university and to each other, as alumni and supports,\u201d said Mark H. Carter, a businessman who recently pledged a $1.5 million matching gift to the school to support NIL initiatives.",
      "\u201cIf we, in turn, invest in recruiting and holding onto the best of the best, we can do great things for the university,\u201d Carter said. \u201cWhen the whole world is watching Vanderbilt, the return on investment is exponential.\u201d",
      "On Sunday, Vanderbilt received its first NCAA Tournament bid in eight years. The Commodores deserved it, too, beating the likes of Seton Hall (Big East), Virginia Tech and Cal (ACC) and TCU (Big 12).",
      "It is hard to argue the SEC did not deserve its 14 tournament bids when you consider its teams combined to go 30-4 against the ACC, 14-2 against the Big 12, 10-9 against the Big Ten and 5-4 against the Big East.",
      "\u201cI thought it was a record non-conference success rate for all the teams in our league,\u201d Ole Miss coach Chris Beard said. \u201cThen when the league starts, it's just been a bloodbath. It's short-term memory. Two-game winning streak and free breakfast burritos in the morning; lose a couple games and fans think the world's falling apart.\u201d",
      "The only two SEC teams that missed the NCAA Tournament were LSU and South Carolina. The Tigers beat NCAA teams Arkansas and Oklahoma, while the Gamecocks beat the Razorbacks and fellow NCAA qualifier Texas.",
      "\u201cThere's no alpha in this league,\u201d said Dylan Caldwell, who helped Auburn spend eight weeks at No. 1 this season. \u201cWe were like, maybe five or six possessions away from being the 5-seed, you know?\u201d",

      "There was little doubt this was no ordinary baseball game.",
      "But the Japanese players who were playing in front of their home country at the Tokyo Dome on Tuesday night handled any jitters they had quite well, delivering in clutch moments as the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Chicago Cubs 4-1 in Major League Baseball's season opener.",
      "\u201cI was actually pretty nervous,\" Ohtani said through an interpreter. \"It\u2019s been a while since I was nervous, but today, definitely felt it.\u201d",
      "Ohtani finished with two hits in the Dodgers' win, including a single in the fifth and a double in the ninth. Both hard-hit balls brought roars from the roughly 42,000 fans at a packed Tokyo Dome and were instrumental in helping the Dodgers get off to a good start this season.",
      "\u201cI don't think I've ever seen Shohei nervous,\u201d Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. \u201cOne thing I did notice is how emotional he got during the Japanese national anthem. That was something very telling.\u201d",
      "Yamamoto pitched five quality innings to earn the win, giving up just one run on three hits and a walk while striking out four. The right-hander's fastball touched 98 mph and consistently sat in the 96-97 range, which is a few ticks higher than last year.",
      "It was the first time Yamamoto had been on the mound in a regular season game since his fantastic performance in Game 2 of the World Series, and the results carried over to the Tokyo Dome",
      "\u201cWhat I experienced in October, I learned a lot of things,\u201d Yamamoto said through a translator. \u201cWhat I should and what I shouldn't do in certain situations. Based on that, I feel more confident.\u201d",
      "Yamamoto said he wasn't trying to overthrow on his fastball. Instead, he said better mechanics have allowed him to throw a little harder. Roberts said there's no reason the 26-year-old can't compete for the NL Cy Young award if he pitches like he did against the Cubs and stays healthy.",
      "\u201cGreat outing, I thought he commanded the baseball really well tonight,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cThe fastball was as good as we've seen. Competed really well. There was some soft contact in there and he just navigated the game really well.\u201d",
      "Even in a losing effort, Cubs left-hander Shota Imanaga was fantastic through four scoreless innings, giving up no hits while walking four. The Imanaga vs. Yamamoto matchup was the first all-Japanese starting pitching duel on opening day in MLB history.",
      "\u201cImanaga and Yamamoto did a really good job handling the nerves of the start of the game,\u201d Cubs manager Craig Counsell said.",
      "Imanaga said he was pleased with his outing, even if the final result wasn't what he wanted. The lefty retired Ohtani twice, once on a groundout and another time on a lineout. He said the experience from Tuesday's game should serve him well throughout the season.",
      "\u201cOne of the lessons regarding the fastball was it felt really good,\u201d Imanaga said through an interpreter. \u201cOnce I go back to the US \u2014 obviously there's differences in humidity, environment and how far the ball goes \u2014 but bottom line if I can throw the fastball I did today all the time and have confidence in it, I'll be good.\u201d",
      "The only Japanese player who had a quiet night was Cubs slugger Seiya Suzuki, who finished 0 for 4 at the plate. With a runner on second in the eighth inning, he hit the ball fairly hard, but Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy was there to snag the line drive.",
      "Japanese rookie Roki Sasaki will make his MLB debut on Wednesday night when the teams meet against at the Tokyo Dome for the finale of the two-game set.",

      "UConn\u2019s Paige Bueckers established herself as the likely No. 1 pick in the upcoming WNBA draft well before she put together a second straight outstanding season and was named Big East player of the year for a third time",
      "UConn\u2019s Paige Bueckers established herself as the likely No. 1 pick in the upcoming WNBA draft well before she put together a second straight outstanding season and was named Big East player of the year for a third time.",
      "The only question is whether she wants to turn pro now or hold off for one more year.",
      "Bueckers, a fifth-year senior guard, still has one more year of eligibility remaining if she wants to remain at UConn. Azzi Fudd, her UConn teammate and another potential first-round pick, will face a similar decision at the end of UConn\u2019s NCAA Tournament run.",
      "Bueckers arrived at UConn in 2020 amid huge expectations and responded by emerging as the consensus national player of the year pick her freshman season. She played just 17 games the following season and missed the entire 2022-23 campaign with a torn anterior cruciate ligament but has since responded with two straight banner seasons.",
      "Now she has a chance to win the national title that has eluded her thus far. The 6-foot guard from Hopkins, Minnesota, has averaged 19 points, 4.5 rebounds, 4.9 assists and 2 steals this season while helping UConn (31-3) win 10 straight games. UConn (31-3) is a No. 2 seed and hosts Arkansas State (21-10) Saturday.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure on her, there\u2019s a lot of demands on her from a lot of different sources,\u201d UConn coach Geno Auriemma told reporters after Bueckers won her third Big East Tournament most outstanding player award. \u201cIt\u2019s a heavy weight to carry around everywhere you go. It can be demoralizing at times. No matter what you do, more is expected from you. For her to be able to constantly come up with these kinds of performances time and time again, she just has that thing that those kinds of players have.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s a look at some other players in this year\u2019s NCAA Tournament who figure to get taken early in next month\u2019s WNBA draft:",
      "First-round game: Saturday vs. UNC Greensboro.",
      "Notes: After averaging a double-double (19.4 points, 11 rebounds) for Stanford last season, Iriafen transferred to USC (28-3) and had similar production with 18.2 points and 8.3 rebounds per game. The 6-foot-3 forward is shooting 49.9% this season after making over 53% of her shots each of her three years at Stanford, but she\u2019s continued to show why she\u2019s one of the top draft-eligible frontcourt players.",
      "First-round game: Friday vs. Stephen F. Austin.",
      "Notes: Miles missed the entire 2023-24 season with a knee injury but returned as a more complete player. The 5-10 guard had made just 24.6% of her career 3-point attempts before the injury. She\u2019s making 40.9% of her attempts from beyond the arc this season. Miles already had made quite an impression on scouts with her playmaking ability. Her improved shooting makes here even more appealing. Miles isn\u2019t the only player from Notre Dame (26-5) who figures to get selected early in the draft. Sonia Citron also is a likely first-round pick.",
      "First-round game: Friday vs. San Diego State.",
      "Notes: After putting up big numbers at DePaul her first two seasons, Morrow has maintained similar production while playing with more talent around her at LSU (28-5) the last couple seasons. The 6-1 forward has 13.6 rebounds per game to lead all Division I players and also has 18.5 points per game. She was a first-team all-Southeastern Conference selection who also made the league\u2019s al-defense team. Morrow has averaged at least 2.5 steals each season.",
      "First-round game: Friday vs. Tennessee Tech.",
      "Notes: Paopao is in her second season at South Carolina (30-3) after playing three seasons at Oregon. South Carolina coach Dawn Staley has referred to the 5-9 Paopao as an \u201celevator\u201d because she elevates the entire team. Paopao is averaging a career-low 9.8 points this season, but she has 1,692 career points and has showcased her shooting ability by making 40% of her career 3-point attempts.",
      "First-round game: Saturday vs. Vermont.",
      "Notes: Rivers certainly impressed WNBA scouts last month when she collected 14 points, 13 rebounds and nine assists as N.C. State (26-6) pulled out a 104-95 double-overtime victory over a then-No. 1 Notre Dame team featuring the star-studded backcourt of Miles and Hannah Hidalgo. Rivers has averaged 11.7 points, 6.4 rebounds and 3.6 assists this season to earn first-team all-Atlantic Coast Conference honors alongside teammate Aziaha James, a WNBA prospect in her own right. The 6-1 Rivers is four inches taller than James, which could enable her to get drafted earlier.",
      "First-round game: Saturday vs. Norfolk State.",
      "Notes: Sellers has been a first-team all-Big Ten selection from the league\u2019s media each of the last three seasons and has earned that honor from the league\u2019s coaches for two straight seasons. The 6-2 senior is the first player in Maryland history to have 1,500 career points along with 500 rebounds and 500 assists. She has 14.1 points per game for the Terrapins (23-7) this season after averaging 15.6 last season and 13.9 in 2022-23. She also is shooting a career-best 44.4% from 3-point range.",

      "Winning The Players Championship gave Rory McIlroy so much he doesn't need",
      "PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. -- Rory McIlroy winning The Players Championship gave him so much of what he doesn't need.",
      "The $4.5 million prize is the largest for any tournament in the world. It pushed McIlroy's career earnings on the PGA Tour alone to just over $99.7 million, second only to Tiger Woods.",
      "The perks include a five-year exemption on the PGA Tour (his 28 wins make him a life member) and three-year exemptions to the majors (he's been eligible for all of them since 2009).",
      "It also raised expectations for McIlroy going into the Masters.",
      "He probably doesn't need those, either.",
      "Even at the TPC Sawgrass for the premier championship of the PGA Tour, the week for McIlroy started and ended with talk about the Masters.",
      "It was last Tuesday when a University of Texas golfer watched McIlroy hook his tee shot into the water on the 18th during a practice round and told him it was just like the shot McIlroy hit on the 10th hole at Augusta National \u2014 the one that started his shocking collapse in the 2011 Masters. That remains as close as McIlroy has come to winning a green jacket.",
      "McIlroy took his phone and handed it to security, the Longhorn lad was removed and McIlroy didn't want to talk about the incident a few days later.",
      "Far more pleasant was the end of the week.",
      "Disappointed after losing a three-shot lead with five holes to play in regulation Sunday, more nervous that he would have expected at the start of a three-hole playoff Monday, McIlroy made quick work of J.J. Spaun with three great swings. The last one was a three-quarter 9-iron in the wind that left everyone hopeful until it plopped down in the middle of an island at No. 17.",
      "Winning The Players is a big deal, and McIlroy now has won it twice.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to put any sort of label on it, but it is one of the biggest championships in the world,\u201d McIlroy said.",
      "This also is the first time in his career he has two victories leading to the Masters, having won at Pebble Beach last month. Go back to last November, when McIlroy won the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai, and that makes three wins in his last six starts.",
      "The first question from Sky Sports: \u201cHave you ever been in a better head space going into the majors after those two big wins?\u201d",
      "The majors start with the Masters. For McIlroy, it's always the Masters. This starts the 11th year since he last won a major, his 11th time going to Augusta National knowing it's the one major keeping him from the career Grand Slam.",
      "\u201cI've had good starts to years before,\u201d McIlroy said, and this much is true. Go back to 2019 when he started the year with seven straight top 10s, including a victory in The Players Championship. He tied for 21st at the Masters.",
      "\u201cLook, I'm in good form,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm playing well. I feel like all aspects of my game are under control. I just have to keep working hard, keep my head down. It's another opportunity to just refine little bits that need refining.\u201d",
      "But this is setting up nicely for him.",
      "Scottie Scheffler had to wait a month to get going because surgery to his right palm that was punctured by a wine glass he was using to make ravioli. Scheffler still hasn't had all the pieces fall together since returning at Pebble Beach, though he does not appear to be far off.",
      "Xander Schauffele, winner of two majors last year, just returned from two months away because of a rib injury. His only celebration has been making the cut on the number the last two weeks to extend his streak to 59 in a row.",
      "McIlroy plans one more tournament in Texas \u2014 Houston or San Antonio \u2014 before the Masters, the ultimate measure. He feels more equipped than ever, and he certainly has been hardened by more failures than he would like to remember.",
      "St. Andrews in 2022 and the U.S. Open the last two years were his for the taking and someone else took home the trophy. Pinehurst No. 2 was particularly brutal last year when he missed a pair of short putts on crispy greens down the stretch.",
      "McIlroy believes he began to turn the corner last fall in a playoff loss at Wentworth, and spending quality time on finding freedom in his swing. He also points to the second round of the Masters last year, when the wind came up and he went down with a 77 that effectively took him out of the tournament.",
      "Now he has a shorter swing for the occasion, once for his wedge and now down to the 7-iron. He employed those beautifully in the Pacific wind when he won at Pebble Beach. His 9-iron to the par-3 17th in the playoff at Sawgrass on Monday was masterful.",
      "\u201cWhen the conditions come like that,\u201d he said, reflecting on that Friday round at Augusta last year, \u201cI just feel like I\u2019m a lot better prepared to handle them. It's always been OK off the tee, but it\u2019s flighting the wedges and short irons, which have been the issue, and I feel like I\u2019ve been able to rectify that.\u201d",
      "It all leads to what he believes has made him a more complete player. There is a certain calmness to him, even with the nerves he felt Monday in the playoff. The pressure will be strong as ever when he gets to Augusta National.",
      "\u201cEverything feels like it\u2019s in good working order at the minute,\u201d he said. \u201cJust keep practicing and doing the right things and practicing the right habits. And day after day, week after week, they all add up to days like today.\u201d",

      "The report found that the average gross salary across all tiers was $10,900, but that number was skewed by 16 clubs in the top tier that paid players an average of more than $50,000. The average salary for top-tier teams was $24,030 globally \u2014 less than a living wage in many places.",

      "Two games after becoming the first player in NBA history to reach 4,000 3-pointers and three days after his 37th birthday, Curry struggled to find his shooting groove in a 114-105 loss to the undermanned Denver Nuggets on Monday night.",

      "Dan Hurley led the Huskies to their fifth national championship in 2023, retooled the roster and added No. 6 last season, becoming the first team since Donovan's Gators to go back to back.",
      "The ride to a third straight title has been a bumpy one.",
      "The Huskies opened the season No. 3 in the preseason AP Top 25, but went 0 for 3 at the Maui Invitational and have spent most of the season fighting injuries and inconsistencies, entering the bracket 23-10.",
      "UConn may not be as dominant now as it was when winning NCAA Tournament games by an average of 20 points per game the past two seasons, but this is March and the Huskies have shown they can tame the madness.",
      "\u201cEarly in the year, it (three-peating) was something that was talked about around here,\" said Hurley, whose team opens the NCAA Tournament against Oklahoma in Raleigh, North Carolina, on Friday. \u201cWith the way that we played to this point, it is not something we are talking about (now).\u201d",
      "Should the Huskies pull it off, they'll join rare company.",
      "John Wooden's UCLA teams of the 1960s and '70s set the standard for college basketball excellence, winning at a rate not seen before or since.",
      "The Bruins won consecutive titles in 1964-65 and set a mark that may never be broken, seven straight from 1967-73. UCLA had a massive advantage with those teams, first with Lew Alcindor (now Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), then with Bill Walton, two of the greatest centers in basketball history.",
      "\u201cWe set records that still stand to this day,\u201d Walton said in a 2024 interview with The Associated Press, a few months before he died in May. \u201cHe did not talk about winning and losing. He talked about effort and purpose, and we tried with everything we had to get to acknowledge that we were doing something right.\u201d",
      "Florida and Duke in 1991-92 were the only teams to have a chance at joining UCLA in winning at least three straight titles. Since Florida's back to back, no reigning champion had even made it to the title game the next season until UConn.",
      "Part of it is continuity. College players have limited eligibility, so it's rare for coaches to have the same rosters coming back. Injuries also can crush a team's chances, or a bad matchup in the lose-and-go-home NCAA Tournament can quickly halt a second deep March run.",
      "More potholes have been added over the past two decades.",
      "The one-and-done rule, implemented in 2005, allowed players to leave for the NBA after a single college season, often stripping teams of their best players.",
      "The transfer portal and NIL deals have made it even more difficult. The ability to transfer from a school without having to sit out a year has created a revolving door of rosters, forcing coaches to overhaul their teams nearly every year. NIL opportunities have turned into karats to lure players out of high school or from other programs.",
      "\u201cThe hardest part to me in the college piece would be college was a place where you could kind of build a program, because you had players that basically stayed for a period of time, and I think people could identify with those teams,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cBut now between the NIL and the transfer portal, you basically have a new team almost every year, and it\u2019s almost like free agency.\u201d",
      "Hurley has been one of the best at navigating this new world of college basketball. Keeping it going has proven to be difficult this season, but UConn still has a chance at the three-peat with the NCAA Tournament starting this week.",

      "The last time a Miami Heat team lost eight consecutive games, before now, was 2008",
      "MIAMI -- The last time a Miami Heat team lost eight consecutive games, before now, was 2008. Erik Spoelstra was an assistant coach in Pat Riley's final season on the sideline. And that team, to put it bluntly, was tanking.",
      "This team isn't.",
      "The Heat \u2014 who just followed an 0-5 homestand with two road losses that came by a combined 55 points \u2014 are back home for five more games starting Wednesday against Detroit, with their season either on the brink or possibly even more dire already.",
      "The latest loss, the eighth in a row overall and the team's 22nd in its last 31 games, was Monday at New York. Knicks 116, Heat 95 was the final, a game where Miami jumped out to a 12-0 lead that didn't mean much of anything.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all getting tested \u2014 I said this before \u2014 including myself,\" Spoelstra said after the loss to the Knicks, one that sent him to the longest losing streak of his career. \u201cThere\u2019s no one that\u2019s absolved from this. I have not come up with enough answers for this team. I have to do a better job. Our group has to do a better job.\u201d",
      "Miami has fallen to the No. 10 spot in the Eastern Conference, technically tied with No. 9 Chicago at 29-39 but the Bulls hold the tiebreaker edge. The play-in tournament is the only realistic path to the playoffs for the Heat now. If they stay 10th, they'd have to win two road games just to have the right to face the No. 1 seed \u2014 probably Cleveland \u2014 in Round 1.",
      "And this isn't a slump. This is a collapse. They can't score, they can't hold leads and nobody has any solutions.",
      "The Heat have been held under 100 points in three consecutive games for the first time since November 2018. They're 10 games under .500 for the first time since 2016-17, when they started 11-30 and then went 30-11 the rest of the way. They wasted a double-digit lead on Monday night \u2014 a 13-point edge \u2014 for the 18th time this season, tying Utah for the most such losses in the league.",
      "How did that 13-point lead get away? The Heat gave up a 76-36 run. That's how.",
      "\u201cIt's frustrating,\u201d Heat forward Jaime Jaquez Jr. said. \u201cWe\u2019re going through the dark days right now.\u201d",
      "They've lost 17 games in which they've led after the first quarter, the second-most such losses in the NBA this season. They've lost 11 games in which they've led going into the fourth quarter, tied for the most such losses in the league. They've been outscored by 20 or more points in a quarter seven times this season, including once on Monday.",
      "When it goes bad, it goes really bad for Miami.",
      "\u201cAnyone would just quit and get comfortable with losing and feel sorry for themselves,\u201d Heat guard Tyler Herro said. \"But obviously, nobody feels sorry for us. We have to dig ourselves out of this hole. It all starts in this locker room.\u201d",
      "Somehow, these days are even rougher for Miami than the Jimmy Butler suspension sagas were in December, January and February before he got traded to Golden State for Andrew Wiggins. Back then, the Heat were at least winning half the time or so. He missed 19 games because of injury or suspension between Dec. 21 and Feb. 5; the Heat were 10-9 in those games.",
      "In the 19 games since the trade, they're 4-15.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to play the right way,\u201d Heat captain Bam Adebayo said. \"Spo wants us to play the right way. So, we\u2019re going to keep competing.\u201d",
      "There have been issues outside of the obvious on the boxscore. Wiggins has been in-and-out of the lineup with injuries, Nikola Jovic \u2014 who was blossoming into a key part of the Heat rotation \u2014 is out with a broken hand and Miami has tried nine different starting lineups in its last 11 games.",
      "\u201cThis has been one of the biggest challenges of a regular season that I\u2019ve been a part of,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cAnd we just have to stay the course. This is the NBA. We\u2019ll have another game on Wednesday night. We have to collectively get our mind right where all these losses don\u2019t have to impact the next game. That is the mental discipline. That is a tough human condition to fight. It\u2019s human nature to stack up some of these memories and let that affect us for the next game.\u201d",
      "Detroit \u2014 one of the NBA's best success stories this season \u2014 awaits on Wednesday. Houston is at the Heat on Friday and Charlotte is the opponent on Sunday. Butler and Golden State visit on March 25 and Atlanta, a team Miami is chasing for play-in positioning, ends the homestand on March 27.",
      "That's the next stretch. It won't be easy. These days, nothing is for Miami. A team that goes into every season with championship aspirations now has an uphill fight ahead just to get into the playoffs.",
      "\u201cIs it easy? No. But you have a chance in this league,\u201d Spoelstra said. \"That\u2019s the beauty of this league. You have opportunities to develop your grit, to reveal your grit, to reveal your competitive character, to collectively develop it together and you do that through really tough experiences. And we\u2019re going through it right now.\u201d",

      "Canada's new leader has announced a radar purchase from Australia and an expansion of military operations in the Arctic while visiting Canada\u2019s far north in an effort to assert sovereignty over the increasingly contested region",
      "IQALUIT, Nunavut -- Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Tuesday announced a radar purchase from Australia and an expansion of military operations in the Arctic while visiting Canada's far north in an effort to assert sovereignty over the increasingly contested region.",
      "The prime minister's office said the Canadian $6 billion ($4.2 billion) Over-the-Horizon Radar system will provide early warning radar coverage from the Canada-United States border into the Arctic.",
      "Carney announced the purchase at a military base in the capital of the Inuit-governed territory of Nunavut on his last stop after visiting Paris and London for meetings with leaders there.",
      "\u201cArctic sovereignty is a strategic priority of our government,\u201d Carney said. \u201c\u201cCanada is, and forever will be, an Arctic nation.\"",
      "The Australian radar system will consist of a series of pillars almost a mile (1.6 kilometers) in length. Officials said that the system would have a smaller footprint than what the similar American system would take up.",
      "\u201cThis will be a significant export if this deal is finalized,\u201d Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said.",
      "Albanese had a phone call with Carney the prior night.",
      "\u201cObviously, there are issues taking place, particularly between Canada and the United States, I wouldn\u2019t have expected to have been happening in my lifetime,\" Albanese said.",
      "Senior Canadian government officials, who briefed reporters on Carney's plane before the announcement, said the purchase has been well received by top military officials in the North American Aerospace Defense Command, the joint U.S.-Canadian military command that overseas threats over the two countries.",
      "But the officials said they couldn't say how the Australian purchase would be received politically by Washington. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly.",
      "Carney also announced the government will spend Canadian $420 million ($294 million) to expand Canada\u2019s Arctic operations and training exercises and deploy more personnel. He said Canada will have a \u201cgreater sustained year-round presence.\u201d",
      "The prime minister\u2019s flight path took him over Greenland. U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s interest in Greenland, northeast of Nunavut, comes as part of an aggressively \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy platform that has included threats to take control of the Panama Canal and suggestions that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state.",
      "\u201cThe United States priorities, once closely aligned with our own, are beginning to shift,\" Carney said.",
      "Trump has threatened economic coercion to make Canada the 51st state. His constant talk of annexation has infuriated Canadians and turned around the political fortunes of the governing Liberal party, which was headed for a historic defeat but now has a chance of winning a fourth term. Carney is expected to call a general election by the end of the week.",
      "The president is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products and has already placed them on steel and aluminum.",
      "Carney and Trump have not spoken since Carney was elected as the new Liberal party leader and prime minister more than a week ago. Carney said at the \u201cappropriate time\u201d he will have a discussion with the U.S. president, as \u201ctwo sovereign nations, that is comprehensive and not targeted at one issue.\u201d",
      "But Trump keeps disrespecting Canada, saying twice on Fox News on Tuesday night that that \u201cCanada was meant to be the 51st state.\"",
      "He said that's why he's he's tougher on his neighbor than America's biggest adversaries.",
      "Trump also repeated several times that he didn't care that the Liberals might win the Canadian election now.",
      "\u201cThe Conservative that\u2019s running is stupidly no friend of mine. I don\u2019t know, but he said negative things,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo, when he says negative things, I couldn\u2019t care less. I think it\u2019s easier to deal actually with a Liberal. And maybe they\u2019re going to win, but I don\u2019t really care. It doesn\u2019t matter to me at all.\u201d",
      "Carney visited Iqaluit, which is by far the largest municipality in Nunavut, a vast territory straddling the Arctic Circle. Nunavut is roughly the size of the U.S. states of Alaska and California combined, with a mostly Inuit population of about 40,000.",
      "For much of the year, the weather in Iqaluit can be severe. In February 2010, Iqaluit hosted a meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven nations. Several of the dignitaries, including Carney when he was head of Canada\u2019s central bank, went dogsledding in subfreezing temperatures.",
      "It is a distinctive destination \u2014 home to about 7,500 people but not a single traffic light \u2014 with no road or rail links to the outside world.",

      "South African officials say a member of a research team at an isolated Antarctica base has been put under psychological evaluation after he allegedly assaulted and sexually harassed colleagues",
      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- A member of a South African research team that is confined for more than a year at an isolated Antarctica base was put under psychological evaluation there after he allegedly assaulted and sexually harassed colleagues, government officials said.",
      "The problems at the SANAE IV base were first reported by South Africa's Sunday Times newspaper, which said it had seen an email from a team member to authorities last month claiming the man had attacked the base leader and made threats.",
      "The email pleaded for help.",
      "\u201cHis behavior has escalated to a point that is deeply disturbing,\u201d the email said, according to The Sunday Times. \u201cI remain deeply concerned about my own safety, constantly wondering if I might become the next victim.\u201d The report said the man allegedly made a death threat.",
      "South Africa\u2019s Ministry of Environment, which oversees the research missions, said in a statement Monday night that the alleged assault on the base leader was reported on Feb. 27, and officials and counselors intervened remotely \u201cto mediate and restore relationships at the base.\u201d They were speaking with team members almost daily, it said.",
      "\u201cThe alleged perpetrator has willingly participated in further psychological evaluation, has shown remorse and is willingly cooperative,\u201d the ministry said, adding that he had written a formal apology to the victim of the alleged assault. It said the allegations were being investigated. No one was identified.",
      "The nine-member team, which includes scientists, a doctor and engineers, is expected to stay at the base for about 13 months until next year, authorities said, living in close quarters through the hostile Antarctic winter, whose six months of darkness begin in June.",
      "The base is on a cliff in Queen Maud Land and is surrounded by a glacial ice sheet, more than 4,000 kilometers (2,485 miles) from South Africa.",
      "The next planned visit by a supply ship is in December, according to the South African National Antarctic Program. It takes the ship around 10 days to travel from Cape Town.",
      "Authorities said they had decided not to evacuate anyone from SANAE IV, where the onset of unpredictable weather conditions meant the team was now confined to the base.",
      "The ministry said all team members had undergone evaluations ahead of the trip to ensure they are able to cope with the \u201cextreme nature of the environment in Antarctica\u201d and the isolation and confinement, and no problems were identified.",
      "\u201cIt is not uncommon that once individuals arrive at the extremely remote areas where the scientific bases are located, an initial adjustment to the environment is required,\u201d it said.",
      "Previous problems have been reported at another of South Africa's remote research bases on Marion Island, a South African territory near Antarctica.",
      "In 2017, a member of a research team there smashed a colleague's room with an ax over an apparent love triangle, according to a report to South Africa's Parliament. Lawmakers said it appeared the researchers were living in highly stressful conditions.",
      "The National Science Foundation, the federal agency that oversees the U.S. Antarctic Program, published a report in 2022 in which 59% of women in the U.S. program said they\u2019d experienced harassment or assault while on research trips in Antarctica.",

      "If closed, the-cash transaction, announced Tuesday, will become Google\u2019s most expensive acquisition in the company\u2019s 25-year history. The purchase gives Google new momentum in its efforts to compete in the cloud-computing business by offering more security for its services.",

      "Arizona highest court has created a pair of AI-generated avatars to deliver news of all rulings issued by the justices",
      "PHOENIX -- Arizona's highest court has created a pair of AI-generated avatars to deliver news of every ruling issued by the justices, marking what is believed to be the first example in the U.S. of a state court system tapping artificial intelligence to build more human-like characters to connect with the public.",
      "A court in Florida uses an animated chatbot to help visitors navigate its website, but the Arizona Supreme Court is charting new territory with the creation of Victoria and Daniel. Made of pixels, the two avatars have a different job in that they serve as the face of news coming from the court just as a spokesperson made of flesh and blood would do \u2014 but faster.",
      "The use of AI has touched nearly every profession and discipline, growing exponentially in recent years and showing infinite potential when it comes to things as simple as internet searches or as complex as brain surgery. For officials with the Arizona Supreme Court, their venture into AI is rooted in a desire to promote trust and confidence in the judicial system.",
      "There was a protest outside the state Capitol last April and calls for two justices to be booted after the Arizona Supreme Court ruled that a Civil War-era law that banned nearly all abortions, except when a woman\u2019s life is in jeopardy, could be enforced. Emotions flared on both sides of the issue.",
      "When Chief Justice Ann Timmer took over the court last summer, she made public trust a key pillar of her platform. She had already been thinking about ways to reach out to the public using digital media for a few years, and the abortion ruling, among other rulings, helped her to solidify the idea that the court needs to be part of the narrative as people learn about opinions and what they mean.",
      "\u201cWe serve the public better by saying, OK, we\u2019ve issued this decision,\" she said. \"Now, let us help you understand what it is.\u201d",
      "Timmer told The Associated Press earlier this year that if the court had to do the abortion ruling over again, it would have approached the dissemination of information differently. In a Wednesday interview, she said that a news release and avatar video could have helped the public better understand the legal underpinnings of the lengthy decision \u2014 possibly including what it didn't do, which she said some misunderstood.",
      "\u201cWe got a lot of backlash for it and probably deservedly so, in terms of how can we complain that people don\u2019t understand what we did when we didn\u2019t really do enough to give a simplified version,\" she said in the January interview, explaining that people want to know the basis for the court\u2019s decisions and what they can do, such as lobbying state lawmakers for whatever changes in law would support their positions.",
      "Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a repeal of the ban last May, and in November, Arizona voters approved a constitutional amendment expanding abortion access up to the point of fetal viability.",
      "Created with a program called Creatify, Daniel and Victoria in a way bring to life the court's news releases. Videos featuring one or the other are being posted for every ruling by the high court, and may be used for Access to Justice projects, community programs and civics information in the future.",
      "The court has been sending out releases since October to summarize and explain rulings. After seeing success with the releases, it began exploring options to convey that information through video.",
      "The AI-generated avatars were the most efficient way to produce videos and get the information out, said court spokesperson Alberto Rodriguez. Producing a video usually can take hours, he said, but an AI-generated video is ready in about 30 minutes. The court might introduce more AI-generated reporters in the future, Rodriguez said in a news release.",
      "The justice who authors the legal opinion also drafts a news release, the wording of which must be approved by the entire bench. The justice then works with the court's communications team to craft a script for the avatars \u2014 the avatars aren't interpreting original court decisions or opinions, Rodriguez said.",
      "Daniel and Victoria's names and physical appearances were designed to represent a wide cross-section of people, Rodriguez said. He said they aren\u2019t meant to come off as real people and the court emphasizes their AI origins with disclaimers. The court is exploring different emotional deliveries, cadences and pronunciations as well as Spanish translations for the avatars, Rodriguez said.",
      "Mason Kortz, a clinical instructor at the Harvard Law School's Cyberlaw Clinic at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society, described the court's new cyber employees as \"quite realistic.\" While their voices might give them away, he said some people could be fooled into thinking that Daniel and Victoria are real reporters if viewers are only reading the subtitles and looking at the characters' movements and facial expressions.",

      "NASA's stuck astronauts are heading home now that a replacement crew has arrived at the International Space Station",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were barely known outside space circles when they strapped in for what was supposed to be a quick test flight of Boeing's Starliner capsule last June. Nine months later, they've captured the world's attention \u2014 and hearts \u2014 as NASA's stuck astronauts.",
      "Their homecoming is imminent now that a new crew has arrived at the International Space Station to replace them after launching from Florida last week. They'll fly back with SpaceX as soon as Tuesday, their problem-plagued Starliner having returned to Earth empty months ago, leaving them behind in orbit.",
      "Here's a look at \u201cSuni and Butch\u201d and their drama-filled mission:",
      "The two test pilots came to NASA via the Navy. Wilmore, 62, played high school and college football in his home state of Tennessee before joining the Navy. Williams, 59, grew up in Needham, Massachusetts, a competitive swimmer and distance runner.",
      "Wilmore racked up 663 aircraft carrier landings, while Williams served in combat helicopter squadrons.",
      "NASA picked Williams as an astronaut in 1998 followed by Wilmore in 2000. Each had two spaceflights behind them including monthslong stints at the space station before signing up as Starliner's first crew.",
      "While they accepted their repeated homecoming delays, they noted it was much harder on their families. Wilmore\u2019s wife Deanna has held down the fort, according to her husband. Their oldest daughter is in college and their youngest in her last year of high school.",
      "Williams\u2019 husband, Mike, a retired federal marshal, has been caring for their two Labrador retrievers. She said her mother is the worrier.",
      "Besides reuniting with loved ones, Wilmore, an elder with his Baptist church, can\u2019t wait to get back to face-to-face ministering and smelling fresh-cut grass.",
      "Wilmore kept in touch with members of his congregation over the months, taking part in occasional prayer services and calling ailing members via the space station's internet phone.",
      "Williams looks forward to long walks with her dogs and an ocean swim.",
      "Several other astronauts have spent even longer in space so no special precautions should be needed for these two once they're back, according to NASA.",
      "\u201cEvery astronaut that launches into space, we teach them don't think about when you're coming home. Think about how well your mission's going and if you're lucky, you might get to stay longer,\u201d NASA's space operations mission chief and former astronaut Ken Bowersox said last week.",
      "Wilmore and Williams found themselves in the middle of a political storm when President Donald Trump and SpaceX founder Elon Musk announced at the end of January they would accelerate the astronauts' return and blamed the Biden Administration on keeping them up there too long.",
      "NASA officials stood by their decision to wait for the next scheduled SpaceX flight to bring them home, targeting a February return. But their replacements got held up back on Earth because of battery work on their brand new SpaceX capsule.",
      "SpaceX switched capsules to speed things up, moving up their return by a couple of weeks. The two will come back in the capsule that's been up there since last fall.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s great to see how much people care about our astronauts,\u201d Bowersox said, describing the pair as \u201cprofessional, devoted, committed, really outstanding.\u201d",
      "Astronauts almost always fly back in the same spacecraft they launched in. Wilmore and Williams launched aboard Boeing's Starliner and will return in SpaceX's Dragon.",
      "Their first flights were aboard NASA's space shuttle, followed by Russia's Soyuz capsule. Both the Starliner and Dragon are completely autonomous but capable of manual command if necessary.",
      "As test pilots, they were in charge of the Starliner. The Dragon had fellow astronaut Nick Hague in command; he launched in it last September with a Russian and two empty seats reserved for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "Starliner almost didn't make it to the space station. Soon after the June 5 liftoff, helium leaked and thrusters malfunctioned on the way to the orbiting lab.",
      "NASA and Boeing spent the summer trying to figure out what went wrong and whether the problems would repeat on the flight back, endangering its two test pilots. NASA ultimately decided it was too risky and ordered the capsule back empty in September.",
      "Engineers are still investigating the thruster breakdowns, and it's unclear when Starliner will fly again \u2014 with astronauts or just cargo. NASA went into its commercial crew program wanting two competing U.S. companies for taxi service for redundancy's sake and stand by that choice.",

      "A new study out Monday finds that even in the most optimistic scenarios, grass-fed beef is no less carbon-intensive than industrial beef",
      "For cattle fattened in fields instead of feedlots, the grass may be greener, but the carbon emissions are not.",
      "A study out Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences finds that even in the most optimistic scenarios, grass-fed beef produces no less planet-warming carbon emissions than industrial beef. The finding calls into question the frequent promotion of grass-fed beef as a more environmentally friendly option. Still, other scientists say grass-fed beef wins out on other factors like animal welfare or local environmental pollution, complicating the choice for conscientious consumers.",
      "\u201cI think that there is a large portion of the population who really do wish their purchasing decisions will reflect their values,\u201d said Gidon Eshel, a research professor of environmental physics at Bard College and one of the study's authors. \u201cBut they are being misled, essentially, by the wrong information.\u201d",
      "When it comes to food, beef contributes by far the most emissions fueling climate change and is one of the most resource- and land-intensive to produce. Yet demand for beef around the world is only expected to grow. And carefully weighing the benefits of grass-fed beef matters because in most parts of the world where beef production is expanding, such as South America, it\u2019s being done by deforesting land that would otherwise store carbon, said Richard Waite of the World Resources Institute.",
      "Experts say this study's finding makes sense because it's less efficient to produce grass-fed cattle than their industrial counterparts. Animals that are fattened up in fields instead of feedlots grow more slowly and don't get as big, so it takes more of them to produce the same amount of meat.",
      "The researchers used a numerical model of the emissions produced across the process of raising beef, then simulated many herds of industrial and grass-fed cattle. It compared differences in how much food they would eat, how much methane and carbon dioxide they would emit and how much meat they would produce. Those differences mirror real-life scenarios; cattle in arid New Mexico and lush northern Michigan have different inputs and outputs.",
      "Eshel and his team also analyzed previous studies that examined how much cattle grazing promotes carbon storage, but found that even in the best-case scenarios, the amount of carbon that grasses could sequester didn\u2019t make up for the emissions of the cattle.",
      "Randy Jackson, a professor of grassland ecology at University of Wisconsin-Madison who was not involved in the study, said he has found similar results in his own research showing that grass-fed beef has higher emissions assuming the same demand. In fact, Eshel's team cited his work. But he worries that the study is too focused on minimizing emissions \u201cwithout concern for the environmental impacts beyond GHG load to the atmosphere,\u201d like biodiversity and soil and water quality, he wrote in an email.",
      "The American Grassfed Association, a nonprofit membership group for producers of grass-fed livestock, did not immediately provide a comment on the study.",
      "Jennifer Schmitt, who studies the sustainability of U.S. agricultural supply chains at the University of Minnesota and also wasn't involved in the study, said she thinks the paper \u201chelps us get a little closer to answering the question of maybe how much beef should we have on the landscape versus plant proteins,\u201d she said.",
      "Schmitt said maybe if beef was scaled back on a large enough scale and if farmers could free up more cropland for other foods that humans eat, the localized environmental benefits of grass-fed cattle could make up for the fact that they come with higher emissions.",
      "It would be harder to convince Eshel, however. He thinks climate change is \u201csecond to none\u201d when it comes to global problems and should be prioritized as such.",
      "\u201cI have a hard time imagining, even, a situation in which it will prove environmentally, genuinely wise, genuinely beneficial, to raise beef,\" Eshel said.",
      "For consumers who truly want to be environmentally conscious, he added, \"don't make beef a habit.\"",

      "NEW YORK -- Researchers have long wondered how iguanas got to Fiji, a collection of remote islands in the South Pacific. Most modern-day iguanas live in the Americas \u2014 thousands of miles and one giant ocean away.",
      "They thought maybe they scurried there through Asia or Australia before volcanic activity pushed Fiji so far away.",
      "But new research suggests that millions of years ago, iguanas pulled off the 5,000 mile (8,000 kilometer) odyssey on a raft of floating vegetation \u2014 masses of uprooted trees and small plants. That journey is thought to be a record \u2014 further than any other land-dwelling vertebrate has ever traveled on the ocean.",
      "Scientists think that's how iguanas got to the Galapagos Islands off of Ecuador and between islands in the Caribbean. Initially they thought Fiji might be a bit too far for such a trip, but in a new study, researchers inspected the genes of 14 iguana species spanning the Americas, the Caribbean and Fiji. They discovered that Fijian iguanas were most closely related to desert iguanas from North America, and that the two groups split off around 31 million years ago.",
      "The researchers created a statistical model using that information and other tidbits about where iguanas live today and how they may spread. It suggested that the iguanas most likely floated to Fiji from North America.",
      "\u201cGiven what we know now, their result is by far the most strongly supported,\u201d said Kevin de Queiroz, an evolutionary biologist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, who was not involved with the new study.",
      "The research was published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.",
      "The journey from North America to Fiji could have taken a few months, but these desert iguanas would have been ideal passengers because they were adept at resisting dehydration and could have snacked on the plants underfoot.",

      "It\u2019s the most visible sign of AI\u2019s inroads into health care, where hundreds of hospitals are using increasingly sophisticated computer programs to monitor patients' vital signs, flag emergency situations and trigger step-by-step action plans for care \u2014 jobs that were all previously handled by nurses and other health professionals.",
      "Hospitals say AI is helping their nurses work more efficiently while addressing burnout and understaffing. But nursing unions argue that this poorly understood technology is overriding nurses' expertise and degrading the quality of care patients receive.",
      "\u201cHospitals have been waiting for the moment when they have something that appears to have enough legitimacy to replace nurses,\u201d said Michelle Mahon of National Nurses United. \u201cThe entire ecosystem is designed to automate, de-skill and ultimately replace caregivers.\u201d",
      "Mahon\u2019s group, the largest nursing union in the U.S., has helped organize more than 20 demonstrations at hospitals across the country, pushing for the right to have say in how AI can be used \u2014 and protection from discipline if they decide to disregard automated advice. The group raised new alarms in January when Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the incoming health secretary, suggested AI nurses \u201cas good as any doctor\u201d could help deliver care in rural areas. On Friday, Dr. Mehmet Oz, who\u2019s been nominated to oversee Medicare and Medicaid, said he believes AI can \u201cliberate doctors and nurses from all the paperwork.\u201d",

It has since dropped that language, instead touting its services and seeking to assure customers that they have been carefully tested. The company did not grant requests for an interview.",
      "Hospitals have been experimenting for years with technology designed to improve care and streamline costs, including sensors, microphones and motion-sensing cameras. Now that data is being linked with electronic medical records and analyzed in an effort to predict medical problems and direct nurses' care \u2014 sometimes before they've evaluated the patient themselves.",
      "Adam Hart was working in the emergency room at Dignity Health in Henderson, Nevada, when the hospital's computer system flagged a newly arrived patient for sepsis, a life-threatening reaction to infection. Under the hospital's protocol, he was supposed to immediately administer a large dose of IV fluids. But after further examination, Hart determined that he was treating a dialysis patient, or someone with kidney failure. Such patients have to be carefully managed to avoid overloading their kidneys with fluid.",
      "Hart raised his concern with the supervising nurse but was told to just follow the standard protocol. Only after a nearby physician intervened did the patient instead begin to receive a slow infusion of IV fluids.",
      "\u201cYou need to keep your thinking cap on\u2014 that\u2019s why you\u2019re being paid as a nurse,\u201d Hart said. \u201cTurning over our thought processes to these devices is reckless and dangerous.\u201d",
      "Hart and other nurses say they understand the goal of AI: to make it easier for nurses to monitor multiple patients and quickly respond to problems. But the reality is often a barrage of false alarms, sometimes erroneously flagging basic bodily functions \u2014 such as a patient having a bowel movement \u2014 as an emergency.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re trying to focus on your work but then you\u2019re getting all these distracting alerts that may or may not mean something,\u201d said Melissa Beebe, a cancer nurse at UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to even tell when it\u2019s accurate and when it\u2019s not because there are so many false alarms.\u201d",

      "Renault is testing a new driverless mini-bus in Barcelona this week",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- Commuters in downtown Barcelona have been able to ride the bus for free this week. There\u2019s just one catch: this mini-bus has no one at the wheel.",
      "The bus pulls away from the stop with its passengers on its own, brakes before changing lanes and eases down one of Barcelona\u2019s most fashionable boulevards.",
      "Renault is testing a new driverless mini-bus in Barcelona this week. The autonomous vehicle is running on a 2.2-km (1.3-mile) circular route with four stops in the center of the Spanish city. Adventurous commuters can jump on free of charge.",
      "The French carmaker has teamed up with WeRide, a company specializing in autonomous vehicles, to make the prototype. It unveiled the driverless bus at the French Open venue last year, but now it is testing it on the open road in Barcelona. It also has testing projects going in Valence, France, and at the Zurich airport.",
      "Pau Cugat was one of the curious to step aboard for a short ride along Passeig de Gracia boulevard.",
      "\u201cWe just passed by a regular, combustion-engine city bus, and I thought, \u2018Look, there is a bus of the past, and right behind it you have the bus of the future,\u2019\u201d the 18-year-old student said.",
      "Driverless taxis and buses are being tried out by companies in other cities, from San Francisco to Tokyo.",
      "But Renault\u2019s initiative comes as Europe generally lags behind the United States and China in driverless vehicle technology, where companies are fiercely competing to get ahead.",
      "\u201cThe US is doing a lot of experimentation with autonomous vehicles, the same thing in China,\u201d Patrick Vergelas, head of Renault's autonomous mobility projects, told The Associated Press. \u201cUntil now we don\u2019t have a lot in fact in Europe. And this is why we want to show that this works and prepare Europe to this route in public transportation.\u201d",
      "The electric bus can run for 120 kilometers without a recharge and reach 40 kilometers per hour (25 mph). It is equipped with 10 cameras and eight lidars (sensor arrays) to help it navigate the streets filled with cars, motorbikes and pedestrians. The company says the bus is able to drive safely on a given course through a busy downtown like that of bustling Barcelona.",
      "Carlos Santos, of Renault\u2019s autonomous driving group, said that he has seen all types of reactions from riders.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of behaviors of people. Some of them were smiling, (while) other people just start crying, taking photographs or even try to open the doors,\" Santos said before he insisted that the bus ride was a safe one.",
      "Barcelona's city officials said that they have had no reports of accidents caused by the experimental bus.",

      "The quake was the strongest in recorded history around the Phlegrean Fields, a sprawling area of ancient volcanoes that covers a broad swath of the Naples metropolitan area. It matched the magnitude of another quake in the same area last May that has put the population on alert.",
      "Residents shaken awake by the early-morning quake sought safety in the streets, as they did in May.",
      "The temblor, which loosened stone and cement from some facades, was centered just offshore from Pozzuoli, a seaside suburb bordering Naples. Mayor Gaetano Manfredi told reporters that one church, a seven-story residential building and another building were declared off-limits due to damage, and some schools were closed as a precaution.",

      "In all, 11 people sought hospital treatment. One woman was injured after part of a ceiling fell, and several others suffered cuts from glass that broke in the quake, Manfredi said.",
      "Seismologists have reported a fresh increase in activity around the Phlegrean Fields over recent weeks. Authorities last summer conducted drills in preparation for a major emergency as the frequency of temblors increased.",
      "The area around the Phlegrean Fields, which encompasses western neighborhoods of Naples and its suburbs, is both seismically and volcanically active. The surface has been pushed up 1.3 meters (4.3 feet) since 2006, which is higher than prior to the last major event in 1984, but seismologists have emphasized it is impossible to predict when an eruption or stronger quake might occur.",
      "At least 500,000 people live in the zone most at risk should the volcano erupt. Italy's national institute for geophysics and vulcanology has called for a governmental plan to ensure that structures can withstand a quake of at least a magnitude 5.0.",
      "During the 1984 event, 40,000 residents were evacuated during a period of intense seismic activity as a precaution against a feared eruption that did not occur.",

Some schools already have shelved projects because of the cuts, which have been delayed temporarily by a court challenge.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- The FBI and the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency are warning against a dangerous ransomware scheme.",
      "In an advisory posted earlier this week, government officials warned that a ransomware-as-a-service software called Medusa, which has launched ransomware attacks since 2021, has recently affected hundreds of people. Medusa uses phishing campaigns as its main method for stealing victims' credentials, according to CISA.",
      "To protect against the ransomware, officials recommended patching operating systems, software and firmware, in addition to using multifactor authentication for all services such as email and VPNs. Experts also recommended using long passwords, and warned against frequently recurring password changes because they can weaken security.",

      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. stock market has just dropped 10% from its high set last month, hurt by worries about the economy and a global trade war.",
      "T he fall for the S&P 500 is steep enough that Wall Street has a name for it: a \u201ccorrection.\u201d Such drops have happened regularly for more than a century, and market pros often view them as potentially healthy wipeouts of overdone euphoria, which could send stock prices too high if unchecked.",
      "But corrections are frightening in the moment, particularly for every new generation of investors that gets into the market at a time when it seems like stocks only go up.",
      "The S&P 500 is coming off two straight years with gains of more than 20%. Such stellar gains left the market looking too expensive to critics, who pointed to how prices rose faster than corporate profits.",
      "Culling too-high enthusiasm among day traders is one thing. The larger fear always accompanying a correction is that it could be a warning sign of a coming \"bear market,\" which is what Wall Street calls a drop of at least 20%.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at what history shows about past corrections, and what market watchers are expecting going forward.",
      "The U.S. stock market initially jumped after President Donald Trump's election in November on hopes he'd bring lower taxes, less regulation for businesses and other policies that would drive corporate profits higher. All those gains have since disappeared, as Wall Street faces the potential downsides of Trump's White House for the economy.",
      "The president has been making announcements on tariffs at a dizzying pace, first placing them on trading partners, then exempting some and then doing it all over again. The tariffs could hit every country that trades with the United States, which would raise prices for U.S. households and businesses when high inflation has already proven stubborn to fully subdue.",
      "The fear is that tariffs could slow or even halt the solid growth the U.S. economy was showing when it ended 2024. Even if Trump ultimately goes forward with less painful tariffs, all the uncertainty around the will-he-or-won't-he rollout could prove damaging by freezing economic activity. Such concerns have shown up in the latest readings on consumer confidence, as well as companies' forecasts for future profits.",
      "Trump himself has acknowledged his plans could affect the U.S. economy's growth.",
      "All the uncertainty is also making things more complicated for the Federal Reserve, which had been cutting interest rates after getting inflation nearly all the way down to its 2% target. Cutting rates further would help the economy, but it could also put upward pressure on inflation.",
      "The brunt of this sell-off has also hit stocks that critics were saying looked the most expensive after running wild through the frenzy around artificial intelligence. Nvidia, for example, has already dropped roughly 14% in 2025 so far after surging more than 800% through 2023 and 2024.",
      "Most of the other big stocks in the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d that have dominated the market recently have also been lagging the rest of the S&P 500. Those seven stocks alone had accounted for more than half the S&P 500\u2019s total return last year.",
      "Every couple years, on average. Even during the historic, nearly 11-year-long bull run for U.S. stocks from March 2009 to February 2020, the S&P 500 stumbled to five corrections, according to CFRA. Worries about everything from interest rates to trade wars to a European debt crisis caused the pullbacks.",
      "The U.S. market's last correction was in 2023, when the S&P 500 dropped 10.3% from the end of July into October. At the time, high Treasury yields were undercutting stock prices as traders accepted a new normal where the Fed would keep rates high for a while. But stocks would quickly turn higher as optimism revived that cuts to rates were on the horizon.",
      "The last correction that did graduate into a bear market was in 2022. That's when the Fed first began cranking up interest rates to combat the worst inflation in generations. Worries rose that high rates would slow the economy enough to create a recession, one that ultimately never came.",
      "Through the 2022 bear market, the S&P 500 fell 25.4% from Jan. 3 to Oct. 12.",
      "Looking only at corrections since 1946 that managed to right themselves before turning into a bear market, the S&P 500 has taken an average of 133 days to hit bottom and lost an average of nearly 14% along the way, according to CFRA. The index has taken an average of 113 days to recoup its losses.",
      "For declines that become bear markets, the damage is much worse. Going back to 1929, the average bear market has taken an average of nearly 19 months to hit bottom and caused a loss of 38.5% for the S&P 500, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.",
      "On paper, an investor can lose most of their money. From late 1929 into the middle of 1932, the stock market fell a little more than 86%, for example.",
      "A bear market can also feel interminable: One lasted more than five years, from 1937 into 1942, where U.S. stocks lost 60%, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.",
      "In Japan, after the Nikkei 225 index set a record at the end of 1989, it sank and then took decades to fully recover. It wasn't until 2024 that it got back to that peak.",
      "The Japanese example is an outlier, though. In almost every case, investors would have made back all their losses from a downturn for U.S. stocks if they simply held on and didn't sell. That includes the 2000 dot-com bust, the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 coronavirus collapse.",
      "No one knows. Some investors on Wall Street say they expect Trump to pull back on some policies if they prove to be too damaging, while others say the uncertainty alone is creating enough pain.",
      "The economy has given signals that it's still relatively solid at the moment, including last month's jobs report, but the outlook looks cloudier than usual given all the unknowns.",

      "\u201cSteak \u2019n Shake has been great, we\u2019re very grateful for them,\u201d Kennedy said, in between nibbles of fries that the Midwestern franchise recently announced would be cooked in beef tallow instead of common cooking oils that Kennedy says are bad for Americans' diet.",
      "It's the kind of endorsement that doctors have implored him to make about the childhood vaccines used to prevent deadly diseases, like measles as outbreaks worsened in Texas and New Mexico during his first month in office.",
      "The secretary of Health and Human Services has, instead, raised doubts about vaccines, most recently saying in his interview with Hannity that the shots cause \u201cdeaths every year,\" although he later added that vaccinations should be encouraged.",
      "In his first month in office, Kennedy, who vowed to \u201cMake America Healthy Again,\u201d has delivered an inconsistent message that has the nation's top infectious diseases specialists worried that his tepid recommendations of vaccines will undermine access to long-proven remedies.",
      "During his first address to thousands of workers at the federal public health agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as the Food and Drug Administration, Kennedy promised to \u201cinvestigate\u201d the childhood vaccine schedule. Days later, the CDC cancelled a public meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Panel, a group of doctors and scientists who make recommendations on vaccines. That meeting has not been rescheduled.",
      "In another case, a cancelled public meeting of vaccine advisers who make recommendations on the flu vaccine every year for the FDA also has not been given a new date. This week, the National Institutes for Health, also under Kennedy's purview, began cancelling funding for some research on vaccines.",
      "The CDC also is preparing to research autism and vaccines, planning to \"leave no stone unturned in its mission to figure out what exactly is happening,\u201d HHS spokesman Andrew Nixon said in a statement. Agency officials did not comment further for this article.",
      "Numerous studies have concluded that there is no link between the two, a fact the agency states on its website.",
      "\u201cWhat he is trying to do is scare about the safety of vaccines,\u201d Dr. Paul Offit, an FDA vaccine adviser and infectious disease doctor at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, said of Kennedy's first month in office. \u201cIt shouldn't surprise anybody. His agenda has always been to get vaccines off the market, or to make them less available.\u201d",
      "Offit worries that the cancellation of the FDA\u2019s flu vaccine meeting, held every March for at least 30 years, is just the beginning. The committee's June meeting to recommend the COVID-19 vaccine's formulation has also not been scheduled, he said.",
      "Democrats and Republicans pushed back when Dr. Marty Makary, the FDA nominee, wouldn\u2019t commit to rescheduling the committee's flu meeting .",
      "\u201cWhat is lost is the transparency,\u201d said Sen. Bill Cassidy, the Louisiana Republican who chairs the Senate health committee who is also a physician.",
      "During his senate confirmation hearings earlier this year, Kennedy repeatedly rejected any notion that he would undermine vaccines. \u201cI support vaccines. I support the childhood schedule,\u201d he said. He promised Cassidy, who was unsettled about Kennedy's anti-vaccine advocacy work, that he would not change existing vaccine recommendations.",
      "But Kennedy\u2019s skeptical views of vaccines have emerged during interviews and public statements since his confirmation.",
      "He's sent \u201cmixed messages\u201d on vaccine safety, even though the U.S. has \u201cthe most elaborate vaccine adverse event surveillance system in the world,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University. Serious problems, including death, are very rare and the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks, he said.",
      "\u201cA simple way to describe this to the average person is the serious adverse events generally occur at a rate of 1 to a few cases per million doses of vaccine,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a needle in a haystack.\u201d",
      "In an opinion piece on FoxNews.com earlier this month, Kennedy said the measles outbreak in West Texas that left a six-year old child dead was a \u201ccall to action\u201d but stopped short of recommending that people receive the vaccine that prevents 97% of cases. Despite the U.S. registering its first measles death in a decade, Kennedy has repeatedly downplayed this year's outbreaks, noting that when he was a child \u201ceverybody got measles.\"",
      "This year's cases \u2014 reported at 250 \u2014 are on track to far outpace last year's reports of 286 measles infections.",
      "Pediatricians are fielding more questions from confused parents in their exam rooms, said Dr. Susan Kressly. Worried about reports of cancelled vaccine meetings, they\u2019re wondering about their access to next year\u2019s flu vaccines. Others are asking if they should get doses of the Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccine earlier. Kressly said there\u2019s a clear message the government can send to help stop the rising case count.",
      "\u201cThe only way to stop an outbreak is increased coordinated positive messaging around vaccinating,\u201d Kressly said.",
      "The CDC has assisted with vaccination efforts in West Texas. But Kennedy himself has publicly advocated for an alternative treatment for measles: Vitamin A. Under his watch, the CDC\u2019s guidance was updated to say that Vitamin A should be given to children with severe measles and prescribed in doses under a doctor\u2019s supervision.",
      "Vitamin A supplementation has been recommended for decades to reduce pneumonia and death in malnourished children in developing countries, but the benefits in well-nourished children in countries like the U.S. are less clear.",
      "\u201cWe need to use Vitamin A for those kids who are unlucky enough to get measles,\u201d said Dr. Andy Pavia, a pediatric infectious disease expert at the University of Utah. \u201cBut it can\u2019t prevent measles and it can only provide some help in reducing the severity.\u201d",
      "When administered correctly, using Vitamin A in kids with severe measles will \u201cdo no harm,\u201d Pavia said. But if improperly done, high doses of Vitamin A can be toxic and deadly.",
      "Abrupt staffing changes have also dominated Kennedy's first weeks in office, with CDC pick Dave Weldon withdrawing from the nomination mere minutes before his hearing, Kennedy's top HHS spokesman quitting two weeks into the job and the Food and Drug Administration's newly minted chief counsel departing 48 hours into the position.",
      "Trump and Kennedy's supporters, however, have dismissed concerns about the rocky start.",
      "His newfound platform as health secretary and talk of healthier foods is already affecting change in the American diet, advisers close to Kennedy and Trump have claimed on social media.",
      "They credit Kennedy with prompting Republican legislators to introduce bills in Utah and Texas that would ban soda in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, for example. And then there's Steak \u2018n Shake\u2019s new fries.",
      "\u201cRFK Jr. just ate Steak \u2019n Shake on live TV, the fast food joint that\u2019s bravely frying everything in beef tallow,\u201d conservative podcaster Charlie Kirk said this week in a tweet. \u201cThis is the way.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, after a meeting with a handful of executives from the nation's largest food manufactures, Kennedy released a slickly-produced video that promised more change would be on the way, saying companies were taking his \u201cMAHA\" movement seriously.",
      "\u201cThey understand they have a new sheriff in town,\u201d Kennedy said.",
      "He did not share any details about what was discussed at the meeting.",

      "Struggling chipmaker Intel has hired former board member and semiconductor industry veteran Lip-Bu Tan as the latest in a succession of CEOs to attempt to turn around the company that helped define Silicon Valley",
      "Struggling chipmaker Intel has hired former board member and semiconductor industry veteran Lip-Bu Tan as the latest in a succession of CEOs to attempt to turn around a once-dominant company that helped define Silicon Valley.",
      "Tan, 65, will take over the daunting job next Tuesday, more than three months after Intel's previous CEO, Pat Gelsinger, abruptly retired amid a deepening downturn that triggered massive layoffs and raised questions about the chipmaker's ability to survive as an independent company.",
      "This won't be Tan's first time running a semiconductor company, nor his first association with Intel. He spent more than a decade as CEO of Cadence Design Systems, which makes software that helps designs processors, and joined Intel's board of directors in 2022 before stepping down last August. Tan will rejoin Intel's board in addition to becoming CEO.",
      "\u201cLip-Bu is an exceptional leader whose technology industry expertise, deep relationships across the product and foundry ecosystems, and proven track record of creating shareholder value is exactly what Intel needs in its next CEO,\u201d Intel's interim Executive Chairman Frank Yeary said.",
      "Intel has been led by interim co-CEOs, David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus, since Gelsinger walked away from a job that he undertook in February 2021.",
      "Although Gelsinger arrived at Intel amid high hopes, his tenure was a major letdown as Intel's stock price plunged 60%, wiping out $160 billion in shareholder wealth. Leading up to his departure last year, Intel laid of 17,500 of its employees \u2014 about 15% of its workforce \u2014 and suspended its dividend to save money on its way to an annual loss of $19 billion.",
      "More recently, Intel delayed the opening of two new chip factories i n Ohio to ensure the projects are completed in a \u201cfinancially responsible manner.\u201d The project is supposed to draw upon the $7.8 billion in funding earmarked for Intel in the CHIPS Incentives Program created during the administration of President Joe Biden.",
      "It was the latest sign of distress for Intel, a Santa Clara, California, company that helped launch Silicon Valley by developing the microprocessors that enabled the personal computer revolution under the leadership of its CEO at that time, Andy Grove.",
      "But as its leadership changed Intel missed the technological shift to mobile computing triggered by Apple's 2007 release of the iPhone, and it's lagged more nimble chipmakers. Intel's troubles have been magnified since the advent of artificial intelligence \u2014 a booming field where the chips made by once-smaller rival Nvidia have become tech's hottest commodity.",
      "Nvida now boasts a market value of $2.8 trillion compared to Intel's $90 billion. Intel's stock price rose more than 10% in Wednesday's extended trading after Tan's hiring was announced, indicating investors believe he will revive the company's fortunes.",
      "While Tan was Cadence Design's CEO from January 2009 to May 2021, the company's stock price increased by 44-fold.",
      "Tan's past accomplishments resulted him being named winner of the Semiconductor Industry Association's 2022 Robert Noyce Award \u2014 an honor named after one of Intel's co-founders.",

    "summary": "NASA astronauts are returning to Earth after nine months in space. Experts have said a prolonged period in space can come with changes to human physiology and psychology.",
    "story": [
      "Extended time in space can bring changes to human physiology and psychology.",
      "NASA astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams are returning to Earth after spending an unplanned nine months in space.",
      "The pair performed the first astronaut-crewed Boeing's Starliner capsule flight to the International Space Station (ISS) in June 2024.",
      "Wilmore and Williams were only supposed to spend about one week in space. However, issues with Starliner extended their mission by several months and delayed their return until early 2025.",
      "Experts have said that spending a prolonged period in space -- especially many months -- can come with many changes to human physiology and psychology.",
      "Changes due to microgravity",
      "One of the biggest changes comes from spending time in microgravity, which allows astronauts to float inside a spacecraft or outside during spacewalks.",
      "During this period, there is a decrease of muscle mass -- due to decreased use and lack of stimulus through exercise equipment -- and bone loss, according to NASA.",
      "Without Earth's gravity, bones that support the body's weight can lose 1% to 1.5% of mineral density on average per month in space, the federal health agency says.",
      "Additionally, without eating a proper diet and getting proper exercise, astronauts lose\u00a0muscle mass\u00a0faster in microgravity than they would on Earth.",
      "NASA also says that in microgravity, blood and cerebrospinal fluid often shift upward from the lower extremities to the head and eyes, which is believed to cause eye and brain structural changes.",
      "Crews are at risk of developing kidney stones due to dehydration or excreting calcium from their bones without preventive or countermeasures.",
      "Upon returning to Earth, astronauts are often examined by a medical team as they work to readapt to Earth's gravity and rebalance their equilibriums for everyday tasks such as walking and standing upright.",
      "Space radiation",
      "Space radiation is different from radiation experienced on Earth. It's made up of three kinds of radiation: particles trapped in Earth's magnetic field, particles from solar flares and galactic cosmic rays NASA said.",
      "Earth is surrounded by a system of magnetic fields, called the magnetosphere, that protects people from harmful space radiation. However, the higher a person is in altitude, the higher the dose of radiation they are exposed to.",
      "Due to prolonged exposure, astronauts can be at significant risk for radiation sickness and have a higher lifetime risk of cancer, central nervous system effects and degenerative diseases, according to\u00a0NASA.",
      "Crews aboard the ISS receive an average of 80 mSv to 160 mSv during a six-month stay, according to a\u00a02017 NASA report. Millisieverts (mSv) are units of measurement for how much radiation has been absorbed by the body.",
      "Although the type of radiation is different, 1 mSv of space radiation is roughly the same as receiving three chest X-rays, the federal space agency said.",
      "By comparison, a person on Earth receives an average of 2 mSv every year from just background radiation, NASA said.",
      "\"In low earth orbit where the ISS is, astronauts are at least partially protected by the magnetosphere that protects Earth from the radiation exposure of deep space,\" Dr. Rihana Bokhari, acting chief scientific officer at Baylor College of Medicine's Translational Research Institute for Space Health, previously told ABC News.",
      "\"However, they do have a greater radiation exposure than those on Earth because the ISS passes through areas of trapped radiation in their orbit,\" she continued. \"Butch and Suni, since they are on the ISS, will not be exposed to enough radiation to seriously cause large impacts on body systems but the long duration exposure to greater radiation than on Earth could lead to an increase in the risk of cancer.\"",
      "Isolation in space",
      "There are also physical and psychological effects that come from being\u00a0isolated and in a closed environment for a long duration.",
      "NASA says that crews selected for ISS missions are carefully chosen and trained to make sure they can handle a mission that may last for six months or longer.",
      "However, research has shown that this type of environment, regardless of whether someone is in space, can lead to behavioral changes and cause fatigue, stress and sleep loss.",
      "NASA said researchers are investigating ways to help ward off the negative effects of isolation including using virtual reality to \"stimulate relaxing environments\" or engaging in activities such as learning a language or tending to a space garden.",
      "Dr. Jennifer Fogarty, chief scientific officer at Baylor College of Medicine's Translational Research Institute for Space Health, previously told ABC News that there are also changes to the immune system during this time, often a result of chronic stress, which is why it's important to create as healthy of an environment as possible for astronauts going on missions.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump signed an order in January to release the remaining records.",
      "The National Archives on Tuesday released thousands of pages of declassified records related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963.",
      "The records were posted to the National Archives' website, joining recently released records posted in 2023, 2022, 2021 and 2017-2018.",
      "\"This release consists of approximately 80,000 pages of previously-classified records that will be published with no redactions,\" said the announcement from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. \"Additional documents withheld under court seal or for grand jury secrecy, and records subject to section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code, must be unsealed before release.\"",
      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 23 directing the release of all remaining records related to the assassination, saying it was in the \"public interest\" to do so.",
      "Tuesday's initial release contained 1,123 records comprising 32,000 pages. A subsequent release on Tuesday night contained 1,059 records comprising 31,400 additional pages.",
      "Among the material was the long-awaited, unredacted text of a June 1961 memo on the CIA, sent to President Kennedy by aide Arthur Schlesinger Jr. The memo contained harsh criticism of the spy agency just months after the CIA backed the ill-fated Bay of Pigs invasion of Fidel Castro's Cuba.",
      "Previously-released versions of the 63-year-old memo had contained more than a full page of redactions -- classification markings that generated a great deal of interest among researchers and conspiracy theorists, particularly those who hold the unsubstantiated view that the CIA may have played a role in Kennedy's killing.",
      "Schlesinger had argued to Kennedy that the CIA's reliance on \"controlled American sources\" had been encroaching on the traditional functions of the State Department, and that the CIA may have been seeking to infiltrate the politics of America's allies.",
      "\"CIA today has nearly as many people under official cover overseas as State,\" Schlesinger wrote in 1961, adding that in certain countries, the CIA's presence \"outnumbers regular State Department personnel.\"",
      "The previously-classified portion of the memo cites the specific number of CIA personnel that had been stationed at the U.S. embassy in Paris, where \"CIA has even sought to monopolize contact with certain French political personalities, among them the President of the National Assembly,\" the memo said.",
      "Schlesinger also details the number of CIA sources in Austria and Chile, information in the memo that had been classified until now.",
      "Several of the newly-released pages detail how the CIA went about tapping telephones in Mexico City between in December 1962 and January 1963 to monitor the communications of the Soviets and Cubans at their diplomatic facilities, which Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey Oswald visited in the months before the assassination.",
      "The previously-redacted pages spell out specific instructions for CIA operatives on how to wiretap, including the use of certain chemicals to create markings on telephone devices that could only be seen by other spies under UV light.",
      "For decades, the CIA has urged the continued secrecy of these details out of fear that they would reveal the methods of the agency's spy craft.",
      "One 79-page record contains 15 newly unredacted pages -- though several of them remain unreadable due to the degraded quality of the typeface after many rounds of photocopy duplication.",
      "The newly-disclosed portions detail CIA surveillance of Soviet embassies in Mexico City and efforts to recruit double agents from Soviet agency personnel -- and reveal the names and positions of those who were recruited. The CIA officials writing these memos tout the efficacy of their efforts, with one trumpeting, \"I cannot help but feel that we are buying a great deal for our money in this project.\"",
      "The memo also details the CIA's surveillance of an American man described as a Communist living in Mexico. The bulk of the memo is a listing of phone numbers that were tapped by the U.S. government. This file has long been sought by researchers due to Oswald's visits to the Soviet and Cuban embassies in Mexico City, but the document includes no mention of Oswald by name.",
      "\"The first JFK files release of 2025 is an encouraging start,\" Jefferson Morley of the Mary Ferrell Foundation, a nonprofit that operates a database of government records on the Kennedy assassination, said on X. \"We now have complete versions of approximately a third of the redacted JFK documents held by the National Archives (1,124 of approximately 3,500 documents ). Rampant overclassification of trivial information has been eliminated and there appear to be no redactions, though we have not viewed every document.\"",
      "\"Seven of ten JFK files held by the Archives and sought by JFK researchers are now in the public record. These long-secret records shed new light on JFK's mistrust of the CIA, the Castro assassination plots, the surveillance of Oswald in Mexico City, and CIA propaganda operations involving Oswald,\" Morley posted. \"The release does not include two thirds of the promised files nor any of 500-plus IRS record, nor any of the 2,400 recently discovered FBI files. Nonetheless, this is most positive news on the declassification of JFK files since the 1990s.\"",
      "Many of the documents have long been in the public domain, except for minor redactions, such as the blacking out of personally-identifiable information of CIA sources or employees that the CIA had fiercely fought to keep secret.",
      "One such document from August 1966 recommends a \"certificate of distinction\" for a CIA official who led the spy agency's technical division. Previous releases of the same document contained redactions striking sentences that described how this individual led a team that \"conceived and developed\" the use of \"fluoroscopic scanning\" and X-rays, which allowed the CIA to \"detect hidden technical listening devices\" for the first time. The official, James McCord, would go on to become head of security for Richard Nixon's reelection campaign in 1972 -- and gain infamy for his role as one of the Watergate burglars whose break-in precipitated the Watergate scandal of the 1970s.",
      "The release of the JFK materials comes a day after Trump announced to reporters that the administration would begin releasing the records on Tuesday, prompting a scramble inside the Justice Department to free up attorneys to assist with the declassification process.",
      "Congress voted in 1992 to require the government to release and declassify all records related to the assassination and subsequent investigations by 2017, but that deadline was repeatedly pushed back by Trump and President Joe Biden due to national security concerns.",
      "Tuesday's release represents a small, outstanding tranche of the more than six million pages of Kennedy assassination records collected by the National Archives -- the majority of which have already been declassified and are available online or in person for review, according to the agency.",
      "Also released Tuesday were 14 documents related to the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., totaling about 1,050 pages and 21 documents regarding Robert F. Kennedy, totaling about 2,500 pages.",
      "Of the RFK documents released, only one directly mentioned his assassination in 1968. An intelligence document from 1968 -- previously released in 2018 -- discusses how RFK's assassination stoked interest in his brother's assassination and New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison's investigation into the matter.",
      "\"The forthcoming trial of Sirhan, accused of the murder of Senator Kennedy, can be expected to cause a new wave of criticism and suspicion against the United States, claiming once more the existence of a sinister 'political murder conspiracy,'\" the dispatch said.",
      "Some of the other documents detailed operations to potentially overthrow Castro in Cuba. According to a 1964 document, two intelligence assets discussed potentially assassinating Castro under the administration of Lyndon Johnson.",
      "\"CIA allegedly was formerly in favor of such a plan; however, inasmuch as Attorney General ROBERT KENNEDY Would have no part of it, it was shelved. Now the plan has allegedly been brought up again for consideration,\" the document said.",
      "Another previously released document detailed RFK being briefed on potential plans to kill Castro.",
      "\"RFK asks to be told before the CIA works with the Mafia again,\" a footnote of the document read.",
      "Some of the documents appear to have originated from the United States President's Commission on CIA Activities within the United States, also known as the Rockefeller Commission. In a 1964 intelligence document, a station chief noted an interest in developing a source whose daughter is a secretary in RFK's senate office. That document was released in 2018.",

      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- Alabama lawmakers on Tuesday approved a ban on Glock switches and other conversion devices that convert semi-automatic weapons into machine guns, after a deadly year that included multiple mass shootings.",
      "A bipartisan coalition pushed the Alabama legislation after several multiple mass shootings last year, including the shooting deaths of four people outside a Birmingham nightclub in September. The devices are already banned under federal law, but there\u2019s currently no state law that bans them.",
      "The Alabama Senate voted 24-2 to accept the House of Representatives changes to the bill. The measure now goes to Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey, who is expected to sign it after calling for its passage in her State of the State address.",
      "\u201cPassing gun safety legislation in Alabama is not easy. But the hard work of building a bipartisan coalition has resulted in the passage of this life-saving legislation,\u201d said state Rep. Phillip Ensler, a Montgomery Democrat, who had urged the measure for three years.",
      "\u201cWhile laws cannot bring back victims of gun violence, this ban can help save lives moving forward,\u201d he said.",
      "Republican state Sen. Will Barfoot of Pike Road sponsored the bill that was approved this year. Possessing or selling the devices would be a Class C felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison.",
      "The measure will take effect immediately if it is signed into law.",
      "The devices are banned under federal law and in 23 states, according to Everytown for Gun Safety. Supporters said a state ban will allow local law enforcement to prosecute people for the possession of the devices. Police say the devices produce a rapid, hard-to-control spray of bullets that increase the number of casualties during a shooting.",
      "The bill passed without significant opposition, a rare consensus on gun legislation in the deeply red state. Alabama lawmakers in 2022 voted to end the requirement to get a permit to carry a concealed handgun in public.",
      "Alabama has one of the highest rates of gun violence in the U.S. In 2022, there were 1,278 gun-related deaths in Alabama, which was the fourth-highest gun death rate in the country, ranking below Mississippi, Louisiana and New Mexico.",

      "President Donald Trump continued Tuesday to rail against the federal judge who issued an order stopping deportation flights of noncitizens to other countries under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "\u201cMany people have called for his impeachment, the impeachment of this judge. I don't know who the judge is, but he's radical left,\" Trump told Fox News' Laura Ingraham in an excerpt from an interview that will air later Tuesday. \"He was Obama-appointed, and he actually said we shouldn't be able to take criminals, killers, murderers, horrible, the worst people, gang members, gang leaders, that we shouldn't be allowed to take them out of our country.\"",
      "\"Well, that's a presidential job that's not for a local judge to be making that determination,\u201d Trump said, echoing the argument other members of his administration have made since U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued his order on Saturday to stop deportation flights.",

      "Congress can impeach a judge if a simple majority is reached in the House. If the articles were taken up and ultimately clear the House, the Senate would need to hold a trial. It would require a two-thirds majority vote in the upper chamber to convict a judge.",
      "It's rare, but not unprecedented, for members of Congress to file articles of impeachment against a judge.",
      "In February, GOP Rep. Eli Crane filed articles of impeachment against U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer, who issued a sweeping restriction on the Department of Government Efficiency's access to sensitive Department of Treasury payment systems. More than a dozen judges have been impeached in U.S. history and only a handful have been convicted.",
      "Trump argued on Tuesday that he should not be prevented from carrying out his immigration agenda, saying in his social media post, \"I'm just doing what the VOTERS wanted me to do.\"",

      "Boasberg, in verbal instructions during a hearing on Saturday, gave orders to immediately turn around two planes carrying noncitizens if they are covered by his order, including one that potentially took off during a break in the court's hearing. However, sources said top lawyers and officials in the administration made the determination that since the flights were over international waters, Boasberg's order did not apply, and the planes were not turned around.",
      "On Monday, Boasberg questioned whether the Trump administration ignored his orders to turn the planes around, saying it was \"heck of a stretch\" for them to argue that his order could be disregarded.",
      "Deputy Associate Attorney General Abhishek Kambli argued Monday during the \"fact-finding\" hearing convened by Boasberg that the judge's directive on Saturday evening to turn around the flights did not take effect until it was put in writing later that evening.",

      "While Roberts didn't mention Trump or the specific judge by name, the rebuke was squarely aimed at the president, his senior adviser Elon Musk and congressional Republican allies who have called for the removal of district court judges who block, temporarily or otherwise, any administration action.",
      "Trump had singled out U.S. District Court Judge Jeb Boasberg, who days earlier had ordered the administration to temporarily halt deportation flights of alleged Venezuelan gang members. Boasberg was seeking information on the detainees, who were arrested and removed without any due process under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.",
      "The government continued the flights anyway and is currently appealing Boasberg's order. Trump nonetheless asserted the judge should be removed. \"This Radical Left Lunatic of a Judge, a troublemaker and agitator who was sadly appointed by Barack Hussein Obama, was not elected President,\" Trump wrote on social media.",

      "That Roberts chose to respond at this moment is an indication of the seriousness of his concern about the current relationship between this White House and the courts.",
      "Just days before Trump was sworn in a second time, Roberts warned of precisely the types of attacks on judges now proliferating.",
      "\"Within the past few years, elected officials from across the political spectrum have raised the specter of open disregard for federal court rulings,\" Roberts wrote in his annual report on the judiciary, just days before Trump was sworn in for a second time. \"These dangerous suggestions, however sporadic, must be soundly rejected.\"",
      "\"Every Administration suffers defeats in the court system -- sometimes in cases with major ramifications for executive or legislative power or other consequential topics,\" Roberts wrote. \"Nevertheless, for the past several decades, the decisions of the courts, popular or not, have been followed.\"",
      "Allies of the president note that, for all his bluster, he never openly flouted a federal court ruling during his first term in office.",
      "\"I always abide by the courts, always abide by them. And we'll appeal,\" Trump said last month from the Oval Office. But he has also shown openness to a different approach: \"He who saves his Country does not violate any Law,\" he later posted on social media.",
      "Legal scholars say recent rhetoric from the Trump administration has brought the nation to the brink of a constitutional crisis -- a moment when the democratic system of government, with three independent branches providing a check on the others, fails to function properly.",
      "\"There's a centuries-old understanding that if the impeachment power is used to punish judges for their rulings, it undermines the vital independence of the judicial branch,\" wrote Douglas Keith, a constitutional scholar and attorney with the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan legal advocacy group.",
      "In 2018, Roberts and Trump famously clashed in public over a similar scenario: a district court judge blocking a Trump immigration policy.",
      "\"We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges,\" Roberts wrote in a Thanksgiving Day statement. \"What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\"",
      "Trump at the time shot back: \"Sorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but you do indeed have 'Obama judges,' and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country.\"",

He added, \"I think the country will not have moved in a progressive direction during that time, it will have become more conservative.\"",
      "The donor was one of the over 20 donors that ABC News spoke with from Harris' 2019 National Finance Committee who supported Harris as a junior senator, during the most crowded Democratic presidential race in history, and remained unified during her 2024 bid.",
      "The support Harris spent years cultivating faces deep fissures.",
      "Another donor, Areva Martin, who has known Harris since college, said Harris has a history of quieting the doubters.",

      "Case for Harris running for governor",
      "Nearly every member of Harris' 2019 National Finance Committee who spoke with ABC News backed her for a gubernatorial run.",
      "Harris' aides previously told ABC News she will make a decision by the end of summer. Some supporters see a successful Harris bid for governor in 2026 as a dealbreaker to run for president in 2028, because of the short window between a gubernatorial inauguration and a potential presidential launch.",
      "Bakari Sellers, former co-chair of Harris' 2020 campaign, said, \"If she wants to run for governor, I don't think the Katie Porter's of the world are formidable. I think if she wants to run for president, she has to ask: is the country ready for her? I don't know the answer to that. \u2026 a lot of things are going to change in the next three and a half years.\"",
      "Others avoided commenting about a potential 2028 run, citing timing, but expressed confidence in a Harris gubernatorial run.",
      "\"My opinion and my dedication to her hasn't changed one iota. I believe she's one of the most talented, brilliant, kind, empathic people that I have met in all my time in politics,\" lawyer Judith Barnett told ABC News.",
      "The lifetime Democratic donor who said she has known Harris for nearly a decade added, \"I would think running for governor, running the 5th largest economy in the world, would be a good move. It's not my decision \u2026 it's all hers. But I think it's a wonderful step,\" Barnett said.",
      "Asif Mahmood, who led Asian outreach for Harris' 2019 campaign, said Harris could follow in another Californian's footsteps.",
      "\"Reagan ran for president. He lost, came back to California, served his state as governor, went back and ran for president and won twice,\" said Mahmood, who was also Hillary Clinton's deputy national finance chair.",
      "Multiple donors pointed out that if Harris were to win a gubernatorial race, she'd make history. She'd be the first Asian American woman and the first Black woman to be governor of any state.",
      "Only one donor who spoke with ABC News said he was not enthusiastic about supporting Harris for governor.",
      "\"If she even thinks of running for president, it will be very bad. If she even puts feelers out it will be embarrassing,\" he said, adding, he would need to be convinced to write big checks for her for any race.",
      "He claimed donors struggled after Harris' presidential loss to get answers from staffers, \"I don't want to deal with her campaign apparatus.\"",
      "Democrats vs Democrats",
      "Some donors who spoke with ABC News believe the lack of consensus over Harris says more about Democrats than it does about her.",
      "\"The Democratic party is well known for killing their losers and finding someone else,\" said one donor.",
      "\"I think losing to Donald Trump is the cardinal sin of the Democratic party. The left and people that supported her don't appear to be trying to articulate that this loss was narrow and her ideas were popular,\" said one loyalist.",
      "\"It's tough for anyone to come back from a loss and run again. Trump is, of course, an exception. In my opinion, I don't think she would get significant support as a presidential nominee.\" Dr. Manan Trivedi, a donor and former candidate for Pennsylvania's 6th congressional district, told ABC News.",
      "Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, William Henry Harrison, Grover Cleveland, Richard Nixon, Trump were all presidential nominees who lost before winning a general election. Grover Cleveland was the only Democrat to accomplish the feat.",
      "Some donors were skeptical of Harris joining that list.",
      "\"If Kamala wanted to be president of the United States, she needed to position herself as the leader of the resistance. Not only has she not done that but no other leader has pushed themselves forward,\" said one donor.",
      "Montgomery County Commissioner Neil Makhija met Harris during her 2010 attorney general run and said he believes Democrats have time to better position themselves for a successful presidential run.",
      "\"I think she has the luxury of not having to dive into the political fray during this time. By focusing on the human impact of what this administration is doing. It could draw on her strength as an empathetic leader. It could make a difference in these interim years,\" Makhija told ABC News.",
      "Another donor said Democrats need to be strategic.",
      "\"I want to win. I am not supporting a woman, a Black person, or a gay person. I am supporting the non-threatening white dude. Even if a woman were the best candidate, I would have a hard time until it became really clear that there is a real pathway,\" said one female donor.",
      "Democratic bundler Alex Heckler said he has remained a big fan of Harris' but fears Democrats are playing a defensive game.",
      "While he says he's happy with the new party chair, he says, \"Democrats over-correct. Three white men led the votes for party chair - it's ridiculous. We can't help ourselves. I struggle being a Democrat these days.\"",
      "\"Democrats are reactionary - they think two women lost - we can't put a woman up again,\" Heckler said.",
      "Activist Tina Duryea said she's also frustrated with the party.",
      "\"She [Harris] could run on: 'look how miserable everything is now you could have had me' that could be a very powerful message. I don't have a lot of tolerance for people living in fear. Democrats overthink things,\" Duryea told ABC News. She said she's \"100% behind\" any decision Harris makes.",
      "Rapidly changing political landscape",
      "Like any voter, donors change their minds about politics. Multiple did during the course of this reporting.",
      "Two weeks ago, one prominent donor said, \"I don't think she has it in her,\" adding he believed the next democratic nominee \"will be one of the governors.\"",
      "But the donor changed his mind after Harris' recent appearances. \"Putting your heart and soul into an election is devastating. Watching her [Harris] over the last few weeks, she seems to be getting her legs back. She's been out there speaking,\" the donor said.",
      "He added, \"If the world is falling apart economically and geopolitically and she gets a head start on fundraising, with her name recognition and leadership, she could easily become the frontrunner and win.\"",
      "Others acknowledged their positions could change.",
      "California donor Mark Buell said he is watching how California's gubernatorial and the presidential races unfold before he publicly endorses anyone.",
      "\"I've learned my lesson, you have to wait to be able to see the full landscape. \u2026We have many issues in this country. If I have to hold my nose to vote for a Democratic who I don't like but think would win - I would. It's not who my favorite is or who I love.\"",
      "Another donor cited a possible fundamental change in American democracy, led by Trump's actions.",
      "\"I am very reluctant to back a horse. Because I'm not even sure we're horse racing anymore,\" he said.",
      "\"Are we going to have an election in 2028? When he [Trump] jokes about it, I don't know if he's joking. But I think she would be great. I still think she would have been great,\" donor Mara Cohen told ABC News.",

      "Like several other donors, Janni Lehrer-Stein, a longtime Harris donor and disability advocate, said she has seen Harris multiple times since the election, and has not received any indication as to what she plans to do in the future, but said, \"Kamala Harris is going to lead us toward justice and a better life for everyone.

    "summary": "President Donald Trump has called for the expansion of U.S. coal production, claiming that an increase of \"clean\" coal produced in the U.S. will soon take place.",
    "story": [
      "Coal may be \"cleaner than ever,\" but it's still not \"clean\" energy, experts say.",
      "President Donald Trump has called for the expansion of U.S. coal production, claiming that an increase of \"clean\" coal produced in the U.S. will soon take place.",
      "In a post on Truth Social Monday night, Trump wrote, in part, \"I am authorizing my Administration to immediately begin producing Energy with BEAUTIFUL, CLEAN COAL.\"",
      "The comments follow plans announced last week for a sweeping rollback of longstanding regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency -- which the Trump administration is calling the \"biggest deregulatory action in U.S. history.\"",
      "Several of the 31 actions announced by the agency last week targeted prior regulations meant to restrict emissions and pollution related to the use of coal. Chief among these was the announcement to \"reconsider\" President Joe Biden's \"Clean Power Plan 2.0,\" which was a group of regulations targeting coal and natural gas power plants announced last year.",
      "The \"Clean Power Plan 2.0\" tightened the emissions standards for coal-fired power plants for toxic metals like mercury and forced plants to control and clean coal ash released during their operations. But during his campaign, Trump spoke favorably about using more coal to power America's energy needs.",
      "On Monday, Trump called for an immediate expansion of coal production on Truth Social, writing, \"After years of being held captive by Environmental Extremists, Lunatics, Radicals, and Thugs, allowing other Countries, in particular China, to gain tremendous Economic advantage over us by opening up hundreds of all Coal Fire Power Plants, I am authorizing my Administration to immediately begin producing Energy with BEAUTIFUL, CLEAN COAL.\"",
      "Coal is an abundant, energy-dense resource with a higher concentration in the U.S. than any other country in the world, but it is also a fossil fuel and creates carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas) when burned, which contributes to global warming and human-amplified climate change. Coal emissions can also lead to health issues, including respiratory illness, lung disease, acid rain, smog, and neurological and developmental damage.",
      "While coal-fired electricity has become \"cleaner than ever,\" according to the U.S. Department of Energy, the fossil fuel is still responsible for significant greenhouse gas emissions and environment-polluting coal ash. So \"clean coal\" is a bit of a misnomer, sometimes referring to types of technology used to physically clean coal before it is burned or capture carbon related to its burning, according to Michelle Solomon, senior policy analyst at Energy Innovation.",
      "\"Burning coal could never be technically considered clean regardless of the treatment applied to it before combustion \u2013 it will always emit the largest concentration of greenhouse gases of any fossil fuel, and soil and water pollution from coal and coal ash (what's left after it's burned) will never go away,\" Solomon said. \"Even the best technologies that reduce air pollutants like sulfur and nitrogen oxides still allow many of these to get through.\"",
      "These technologies are also not widely used in the U.S. According to a December 2023 report from the Congressional Budget Office, 15 carbon capture and storage facilities are operating in the United States. And none of them are being used at coal-burning power plants. The CBO also found that the 15 facilities can capture \"0.4% of percent of the United States' total annual emissions of CO2.\"",
      "According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the most significant factor in recent reductions of energy-related carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S. has been the decline in coal usage. In 2022, coal-fired electricity generation was largely replaced by other sources, primarily natural gas and renewables. As the production of cleaner alternatives continues to grow, the reliance on coal to meet the country's energy needs continues to diminish.",

      "The Army and Navy, the two largest services and the most ailing from recruiting challenges, both say they've recruited at promising rates in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, which began on Oct. 1. However, neither the Army nor the Navy could readily point out a reason, and the Navy said it is too early in the fiscal year to evaluate.",
      "\"We've seen momentum unlike anything we've [had] in a decade,\" said Gen. James Mingus, the Army's vice chief of staff, at a congressional hearing on Wednesday, March 12 -- when he disclosed that five months into its recruiting year the Army had already signed up close to 73% of the year's annual goal of 61,000 recruits.",
      "The upward recruiting trends for the military services began last summer and have continued at a high pace. Some service chiefs projected then that the numbers would quickly surpass this year's annual recruiting goals and build up the pool of recruits needed to start off the new recruiting year in October.",
      "From 2023 to 2024, during the final year of the Biden administration, recruitment across the services jumped 12.5%, according to the Department of Defense.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said increased recruitments after President Donald Trump's election were a reflection of a new mindset the Pentagon would promote to service members -- a \"warrior ethos\" that Hegseth has said would focus away from diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives he said were a distraction from a focus on military lethality.",
      "\"I think we've seen enthusiasm and excitement from young men and women who want to join the military actively because they are interested in being a part of the finest fighting force the world has to offer and not doing a lot of other things that serve oftentimes, too often, to divide or distract,\" Hegseth said after becoming secretary.",
      "At his confirmation hearing to be secretary, Hegseth said the military's strongest recruiting asset was the commander in chief himself. \"There is no better recruiter in my mind for our military than President Donald Trump,\" he told senators.",
      "One commanding general of recruitment, Air Force Brig. Gen. Christopher Amrhein, told ABC News that \"there is no one silver bullet\" for recruiting, but he said the Air Force had \"honed in on the right ingredients, and they're all working.\"",
      "Alex Wagner, a former senior Pentagon official in the Biden administration, said Hegseth's conception of recruiting by promoting a warrior ethos amounted to \"little more than a restatement, not even a rebranding, of existing efforts.\"",
      "Hegseth's approach brings \"nothing new of any substance,\" said Wagner, who, as Air Force assistant secretary for manpower and reserve affairs, was a civilian leader in recruiting.",
      "\"People want to come into the military for a number of reasons, but one of the key reasons is to be something bigger than yourself and to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States,\" he added. \"I think we've long been building a warrior ethos.\"",
      "In his address to a joint session of Congress earlier this month, Trump said the U.S. Army \"had its single best recruiting month in 15 years.\"",
      "That claim may be a reference to the Army's recruiting success this past January. A defense official told ABC News that in January, the Army recorded the highest average growth in contracts per day since January 2010.",
      "Mingus attributed the turnaround to changes in \"who you recruit, where you recruit, how we recruit, more professionalizing of our recruit[ing] force [and] expanding the population.\"",
      "\"All of those things [that] we've been working [on] for the last 18 to 24 months, we believe are coming to fruition,\" he said.",
      "The president took the credit for steady recruiting gains among the services, falsely claiming in the address to Congress that \"it was just a few months ago where the results were exactly the opposite.\"",
      "Hegseth said in the past women should not serve in combat roles and that \"normal\" white men had been pushed away from serving.",
      "\"I'm straight-up just saying that we should not have women in combat roles -- it hasn't made us more effective, hasn't made us more lethal, has made fighting more complicated,\" Hegseth said on the \"Shawn Ryan Podcast\" in November.",
      "Critics have worried it could have a chilling effect on recruitment for groups including women and non-white men.",
      "\"In recent weeks, for the very first time, I've heard from a number of women, both in the service and who would consider the service, questioning whether or not the military is a place for them,\" Wagner said. \"Clearly this stems from the secretary's firing of the military's two most senior women, who earned their positions -- and the respect of their peers -- based solely on merit.\"",
      "Asked for demographic data on the first quarter 2025 figures, only the Air Force was able to answer ABC News' query. A spokesperson said Air Force officials \"weren't tracking any significant demographic change\" at this point.",
      "A Navy spokesperson said it was \"too early to tell\" about demographics but pointed to successful early-year figures. Comparing the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 to that of fiscal year 2024, the Navy contracted 4,000 new sailors and shipped 5,000 more to boot camp, the spokesperson said.",
      "It set its recruiting goal at its highest in 20 years, a turnaround from the pandemic era, when benchmarks and enlistments slumped.",
      "\"We are on pace to exceed recruiting goals in 2025,\" said Adm. James Kilby, the Navy's vice chief of naval operations, in the congressional hearing on Wednesday, March 12. \"We've made some progress in the Navy, as the other services have. We have stopped the problem.\"",
      "The Navy spokesperson said the service makes assessments on figures on an annual basis but noted that some policies that enlarged the pool of recruits, including a preparatory course that helps potential sailors meet Navy academic and physical standards, have helped the effort.",
      "The Navy's prep course followed the success of the Army's Future Soldier Preparatory Course that contributed close to a quarter of last year's Army recruiting goal of 55,000 recruits.",
      "\"We did open up the aperture a little bit for people that want to serve in uniform, and we expanded various policies to increase opportunities for qualified candidates,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Policies that open the aperture enable services to tap into a wider range of potential recruits -- and the prep courses are intended to help them reach the academic or physical shape to meet standards.",
      "Katherine Kuzminski, the director of studies at the Center for a New American Security, said the Army and Navy prep courses act as a sort of \"pre-basic training\" program.",
      "Only 23% of youth are eligible based on service standards to serve in the military, and 9% of youth are interested in signing up, Kuzminski said, narrowing the pool to a \"Venn diagram [that] does not necessarily overlap.\"",
      "The Air Force has also had a recruiting success story, said an Air Force Accessions Center spokesman, due largely to more recruiters in the field. The Air Force, under which the tiny Space Force is folded, has hiked its recruiting goals by 20% in 2025.",
      "Wagner said the Biden administration had \"initiate[d] a comprehensive review of military [entry] standards to ensure they made sense in the year 2025,\" paving the way for it to meet its 2024 goals and even adjust them higher before the fiscal year ended.",
      "Part of the approach was \"making sure that our requirements were realistic, rather than an outdated vestige of a different era,\" said Wagner, who also served under secretaries of defense in the Obama administration.",
      "The Air Force during the Biden administration loosened body fat standards, which were stricter than the Army and Navy standards, he said, and it lifted a lifetime ban for airmen who tested positive for THC, as other military services had after recreational marijuana was legalized in parts of the United States.",
      "Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin, in a March 3 post on X, said recruitment for December, January and February were at 15-year highs and that the delayed entry program, or the DEP, is at its largest in nearly 10 years.",
      "The DEP, which allows services to recruit future service members and ship them to boot camp at a later date, is a product of sustained work, Wagner said.",
      "\"I mean, you don't build the healthiest DEP in a decade over the course of five weeks, right?\" he added.",
      "It's unclear whether early success for military recruiters is a consequence of Biden administration policies such as the prep courses or enthusiasm for the new president -- or a combination of both.",
      "It is too early to assign credit, Kuzminski said.",
      "\"We can't dismiss the fact that perhaps [the current administration] did affect either American youth's decision to join the military or, more likely, their parents' willingness to let them go into the military, for some portion of those folks,\" she said.",
      "\"But the reality is that over the last three years, we've seen a lot of structural changes that improved the recruiting enterprise as a whole,\" she added.",
      "The smallest military service, the U.S. Marine Corps, has been historically resilient to recruiting shocks like the pandemic.",
      "A Marine official said in a statement to ABC News that the Marine Corps \"consistently meets its required accession mission.\" That \"enduring success,\" the official said, \"is directly attributed to the hard work of our Marine Recruiters.\"",

      "Dust storms have proven deadly to motorists across the U.S. for years",
      "TOPEKA, Kan. -- A gust of wind sweeps over bare soil, kicking up enough dirt and dust to cut visibility to nearly zero, and for drivers, the dust storm seems to come out of nowhere.",
      "Such conditions resulted in a pileup on Interstate 70 last week in western Kansas involving dozens of cars and trucks that left eight people dead. Blinding dust also prompted New Mexico's transportation department to close Interstate 25 from the Colorado border southwest to Las Vegas, New Mexico.",
      "Hazy or dust-darkened skies have recalled the \u201cDust Bowl\u201d of the 1930s, when millions of tons of blowing soil buried farms and coated towns across the Great Plains. Lesser storms occur every year, particularly in the western U.S., particularly when farmland hasn't been planted yet in the spring. Some scientists worry that many motorists don't take them seriously enough.",
      "\u201cWe have a very low level of public awareness of a dust storm and what damage it can cause,\u201d said Daniel Tong, an associate professor of atmospheric chemistry at George Mason University who is among the authors of a 2023 paper on dust storm deaths.",
      "The High Plains Museum in Goodland displays a photo of a tractor buried in blown soil in the 1930s, a reminder of the consequences of a severe drought across the Great Plains that came after farming had destroyed native grasses.",
      "The fatalities Friday near Goodland were the first in the area in a dust storm since 2014, said Jeremy Martin, the Weather Service meteorologist in charge there.",
      "But they came less than a month after an 11-car pileup on I-25 left three people dead, with heavy dust cited as a factor, according to Albuquerque TV's KRQE. Similarly, a dust storm on I-55 between St. Louis and Springfield, Illinois, in 2023 led to a fatal pileup involving dozens of vehicles.",
      "In 1991, 17 people died in an accident involving more than 100 vehicles on I-5 in California's San Joaquin Valley, blamed on blowing dust.",
      "Tong and four co-authors concluded in their paper published in 2023 in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society that there were 232 deaths from \u201cwindblown dust events\u201d from 2007 through 2017, far higher than the number recorded by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association data.",
      "In January, he and four colleagues concluded that the economic damaged caused by wind erosion and dust is four times higher than previously calculated and more than $154 billion a year.",
      "Martin said a cold front moved through the area of the pileup after it had been warm and dry for six hours. Winds that reached 70 miles per hour (113 kph) kicked up dust that then became trapped in the cold front.",
      "\u201cThat's when you get that classic wall of dust,\" he said.",
      "As blowing dust cut visibility on the road to almost zero, drivers slowed down, causing collisions, authorities said.",
      "A preliminary investigation found that 71 vehicles were involved, said Kansas Highway Patrol spokesperson April McCollum. Aerial photos showed at least 10 were semis.",
      "\u201cIt was hard to even keep your eyes open outside because there was so much dust in the air,\u201d said Jeremy Martin, the National Weather Service meteorologist in charge in Goodland. \u201cIt kind of stung to even breathe out in it.\u201d",
      "Similar conditions in eastern Colorado prompted the Colorado State Patrol to warn drivers: \u201cZero visibility due to high winds and blowing dirt.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou couldn\u2019t see,\u201d said Jerry Burkhart, the fire and emergency services chief in Lamar, Colorado. \u201cThe best thing to do is get way off the road in a parking lot or something like that.\u201d",
      "Martin said it's hard to tell how thick dust is from a distance, so motorists often don't know they won't able to see until they're in it.",
      "Weather Service forecasters also said some of the advice for motorists in a dust storm is counter-intuitive. Michael Anand, a NWS meteorologist in Albuquerque, said motorists should pull off the road as safely as possible, turn off all lights and never use their high beams.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t want people behind you to think you\u2019re going in the road,\u201d Martin said. \u201cThat light from your tail light might be the only thing they can see. They\u2019re thinking the road suddenly curves.\u201d",
      "High winds make cars harder to control, and a dust storm coats the road with fine particles that slow breaking, and drivers panic, Tong said.",
      "He said dust storms are frequent and widespread enough across the U.S. that states should test prospective drivers on what to do in a dust storm on license exams.",
      "\u201cThat could be, actually, a very easy way to educate drivers,\u201d he said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A federal program designed to prevent targeted violence and terrorism in the United States has lost 20% of its staff after layoffs hit its probationary staffers.",
      "The Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships was a redefined version of programs created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks as a way to identify people who could pose new terrorism threats or carry out violence and prevent tragedies by getting them help. It has a mission enlisting parents, coaches, teachers and ministers to head off trouble before it starts by training them to look for signs of trouble in advance.",
      "That job became far more difficult after eight members of the center's staff were fired in early March as part of the Trump administration's efforts to trim the government by getting rid of probationary staffers. According to a Department of Homeland Security employee and a center employee who was fired, the staffers were rehired late Monday but were then put on administrative leave, following two March 13 court decisions ordering the Republican administration to rehire fired probationary staffers.",
      "The administration vowed to fight the decisions. The staffers spoke on the condition of anonymity out of concerns they might be targeted for retribution.",
      "The center's director confirmed the terminations in a statement to The Associated Press. William Braniff said that with his appointment to the director's job ending soon, he decided the best thing he could do for the staffers and for the center was to \u201cresign alongside of them, as some agencies and departments have rehired people in mission critical offices once they were made aware of the implications of those terminations.\u201d",
      "Braniff said there is a huge demand for the assistance provided by the center, called CP3 for short.",
      "\u201cCP3 is the inheritor of the primary and founding mission of DHS \u2014 to prevent terrorism,\u201d he said, adding that the center's approach \"is as effective for preventing school shootings as it is for terrorism prevention.\u201d",
      "In a post on LinkedIn before he resigned, Braniff said grant applications last year increased 82% and 27 states were lined up to work with the center to create plans to address targeted violence and prevent terrorism; 16 states already had plans in place or were creating them.",
      "The employees terminated included former social workers, mental health professionals and state public health officials. Before the layoffs there had been more than 40 staff members at the center, with most based in Washington, D.C.",
      "In a statement, Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said President Donald Trump is leading an effort to make \u201csweeping cuts and reforms\u201d across the federal government to get rid of \u201c egregious waste and incompetence.\u201d",
      "She said leaders at the department \u201cidentified non-mission-critical personnel in probationary status\u201d and added: \u201cDHS remains focused on supporting law enforcement and public safety through funding,\u202ftraining, increased public awareness, and partnerships.\u201d",
      "Tom Warrick, a former counterterrorism official at Homeland Security who's now at the Atlantic Council, said the center, launched in 2021 under the Biden administration, was intended to develop projects that try to identify people before they turn violent, regardless of ideology or motivation, and steer them toward help through community health programs.",
      "Warrick said that the center has been doing \u201cpioneering\u201d work and that the payoff is \u201cenormous\u201d in terms of shootings and attacks averted.",
      "\u201cWhat they really need to do is to expand it, not cut it back,\u201d he said.",
      "The grants provide funding to state, local, tribal and territorial governments, nonprofits and education institutions to help them establish or grow their own programs to address targeted violence and terrorism.",
      "The center replaced the Trump-era Office for Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention, which itself replaced an Obama-era program called Countering Violent Extremism. Earlier iterations of the program were criticized for unfairly targeting Muslim and minority communities, and critics said it was difficult to measure results.",
      "Some of those concerns still remain, said Spencer Reynolds, senior counsel to the Brennan Center's Liberty and National Security Program. He said the Brennan Center has long had concerns about the program's civil liberties protections. Even with the emphasis on bringing in public health providers, he said, there's still too much of an emphasis on law enforcement.",
      "Last year, the center announced $18 million in grant funding to 35 recipients.",
      "Those grants included $700,000 to the Palm Beach County Sheriff\u2019s Office in Florida as it worked to \u201cincrease community awareness of the signs that someone may be on a pathway to violence.\u201d Another $344,982 went to the Southwest Texas Fusion Center to help it expand its behavioral threat assessment and management team to cover more counties in southwest Texas, where it works to help schools reduce violence.",

      "Top Democrats on the House Judiciary and House Oversight committees have filed a lengthy Freedom of Information Act request about the Department of Government Efficiency",
      "WASHINGTON -- Top Democrats on the House Judiciary and House Oversight committees have filed a lengthy Freedom of Information Act request questioning whether the Trump administration\u2019s DOGE Service is operating \u201coutside the bounds of federal law,\u201d The Associated Press has learned.",
      "Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Rep. Gerald Connolly of Virginia are seeking detailed information about the authority of the Department of Government Efficiency Service, including billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk and some 40 other people, to carry out firings of federal workers and dismantling of federal agencies.",
      "They also are requesting detailed information about DOGE's access to sensitive data, its use of artificial intelligence, the resumes and training of its staff and its communications related to Musk-held entities including SpaceX, Starlink and Tesla.",
      "\u201cThe Administration and Mr. Musk have hidden behind a veil of secrecy as they systematically dismantle the federal government of the United States,\" the Democrats wrote in a letter to DOGE administrator Amy Gleason accompanying the FOIA request, which was obtained by the AP. \"The American people deserve answers, and we are committed to using every tool at our disposal to expose the truth about DOGE\u2019s operations.\"",
      "They are seeking expedited review of the request, with a response within 20 days.",
      "The FOIA request is the latest in an escalating confrontation between Congress and the executive branch as President Donald Trump is rapidly slashing routine aspects of the federal government by doing away with thousands of workers and unwinding various longstanding agencies and services.",
      "The Oversight Committee Democrats have already issued a formal request for information from the Republican president's administration on Musk's potential conflicts of interest, which is pending. Their attempt to subpoena Musk was rejected by committee Republicans, who hold the majority in Congress.",
      "While generally anyone can file a FOIA request, the Democrats on the panels are utilizing the avenues at their disposal as the minority party to press for oversight of the Republican administration any way they can. It's also a potential step toward more binding measures, including legal action.",
      "In the FOIA request, Raskin and Connolly, who are the ranking Democrats on the committees, wrote that the information is necessary \u201cto provide answers to the many open questions and an explanation to the public.\"",
      "They said, \u201cThere exist possible questions concerning the government\u2019s integrity regarding DOGE\u2019s operations, formation, and activity, which form the basis of this request, as many of DOGE\u2019s actions may be outside the bounds of federal law.\"",
      "It\u2019s unclear if the Trump administration will respond.",
      "Trump and Musk have shown little regard for the protests coming from Democrats \u2014 and some Republicans \u2014 in Congress as their teams march across the federal government. Musk has vowed transparency, but the Democrats noted he has met privately with House and Senate Republicans.",
      "The Trump administration is purging employees, shuttering federal agencies and otherwise disrupting operations in the name of rooting out waste, fraud and abuse. Some 100 lawsuits have been filed, with judges slowing and stopping some actions, while allowing others.",
      "In the sweeping request, the Democrats seek four main types of information about the authority involved with DOGE\u2019s activity: its access to sensitive data; the guidance and decision-making around its firings of federal employees; the potential conflicts of interest around its leadership; and its internal communications.",
      "They seek the names, job titles and qualifications of DOGE staffers who have \u201cbeen granted access to personally identifiable or sensitive information\" since inauguration day, Jan. 20, and their purpose for doing so.",
      "Additionally, they want to know about the various computer programs, including but \u201cnot limited to, artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs), your agency is using to store, process or analyze personally identifiable or sensitive information or data.\"",
      "The request seeks all DOGE directives, guidance and analyses around the firing of federal workers, including the dismissal of inspectors general, and the undoing of various government agencies, including the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Department of Education and others.",
      "Democrats are also requesting information about DOGE's authority to direct and execute these directives as well as details around the funding of DOGE operations.",
      "Musk, DOGE administrator Gleason and some 40 other employees are listed in the FOIA request, which seeks information about their resumes, salaries, any conflict of interest waivers and any non-disclosure agreements involving their employment.",
      "The request also seeks all communication from those workers, including via text message, and various messaging platforms, and specifically around key words including Musk-related entities SpaceX, Starlink, Twitter, Tesla and others.",

      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- The immunity hearing for an Alabama police officer charged with murder will proceed in March, a criminal appeals court ruled, after finding no evidence to support the officer's accusation that the judge overseeing the case improperly divulged his intentions to rule against him.",
      "All five judges in the state criminal appeals court ruled that attorneys for former Decatur police officer Mac Marquette failed to present \u201cany sworn affidavit or factual evidence\u201d that proved Alabama circuit court judge Charles Elliot had compromised his integrity in the case. Marquette\u2019s lawyers filed an appeal with the state criminal appeals court after Elliot denied their motion that he recuse himself.",
      "Marquette is charged with murder for fatally shooting Steve Perkins in 2023 while accompanying a tow-truck driver to repossess Perkins' truck. Marquette's lawyers said Perkins pointed a gun at the tow-truck driver, and that the officer should be granted immunity under \u201cstand your ground\" laws, which remove the duty to retreat before using deadly force in the face of danger.",
      "A neighbor's home surveillance video, broadcast by WAFF, appears to show Marquette firing his weapon almost 20 times. The shooting sparked intense public outcry and protests across Decatur, a city of approximately 60,000 people in northern Alabama. Protesters and civil rights attorneys say Marquette didn't give Perkins time to follow his orders.",
      "In a petition to the state court of criminal appeals, Marquette's attorneys accused Elliot of engaging in improper communication outside of official court proceedings on multiple occasions, and called for a hearing to present evidence on those allegations. In at least one instance, Marquette's lawyers accused Elliot of telling Decatur Police Department Lt. Mike Burleson that he had already decided to deny Marquette immunity because of the high-profile nature of the case, and out of fear for the safety of his family and potential backlash in his 2026 reelection campaign.",
      "The petition cited an unidentified witness who told Marquette that they overheard the conversation.",
      "In a written affidavit, Elliot said defense lawyers filed the motion for his recusal \u201crecklessly and with disregard for the truth.\u201d He said he had a longtime friendship with Burleson but vehemently denied that the conversation took place.",
      "The recusal petition also said Elliot attempted to \u201cintimidate\u201d and \u201cbully\u201d one defense attorney in a call made on a holiday outside of official court proceedings. The appeals court ruled that it was not improper for Elliot to call the defense attorney because the call was procedural.",
      "Attorneys for Marquette did not respond to an emailed request for comment Tuesday morning. A call to Elliot's office was not returned.",
      "The immunity hearing will begin March 25.",

      "The Portland, Oregon, resident could sympathize with those drivers: He knew to avoid his own neighborhood pothole, but another one damaged his car's suspension to the tune of $1,000.",
      "\u201cHearing that awful sound of your car bottoming out \u2014 it\u2019s horrible,\u201d he said.",
      "Oregon transportation officials say that without more funding, residents like Taylor could see further declines in the quality of roads, highways and bridges starting this year. But revenues from gas taxes paid by drivers at the pump are projected to decrease as more people adopt electric and fuel-efficient cars, forcing officials to look for new ways to fund transportation infrastructure.",
      "States with aggressive climate goals like Oregon face a conundrum: EVs can help reduce emissions in the transportation sector, the nation's largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, but they also mean less gas tax revenue in government coffers.",
      "\u201cWe now find ourselves right now in a position where we want to address fuel use and drive down reliance on gases and internal combustion engines. But we need the funds to operate our roads that EVs need to use as well,\u201d said Carra Sahler, director of the Green Energy Institute at Lewis & Clark Law School.",
      "Motor fuel taxes are the largest source of transportation revenue for states, according to the National Association of State Budget Officers\u2019 most recent report on state expenditures. But the money they bring in has fallen: Gas taxes raised 41% of transportation revenue in fiscal year 2016, compared with roughly 36% in fiscal year 2024, the group found.",
      "In California, where zero-emission vehicles accounted for about a quarter of car sales last year, legislative analysts predict gas tax collections will decrease by $5 billion \u2014 or 64% \u2014 by 2035, in a scenario where the state successfully meets its climate goals. California and Oregon are among the multiple states that will require all new passenger cars sold to be zero-emission vehicles by 2035.",
      "The downward revenue trend is already playing out in Pennsylvania, where gas tax revenues dropped an estimated $250 million last year compared with 2019, according to the state\u2019s independent fiscal office.",
      "Inflation has also driven up the cost of transportation materials, exacerbating budget concerns.",
      "The Oregon Department of Transportation \u2014 citing inflation, projections of declining gas tax revenues and certain spending limitations \u2014 has estimated a shortfall topping $350 million for the next budget cycle.",
      "That could mean cuts to winter snow plowing and the striping and paving of roads, as well as layoffs of as many as 1,000 transportation employees.",
      "Republican lawmakers say the gas tax revenue issue has been compounded by the department mismanaging its money. An audit released in January found the department overestimated its revenue for the current budget cycle by over $1 billion and failed to properly track certain funds.",
      "\u201cIt really is about making sure that the existing dollars that are being spent by the department are being spent efficiently and effectively,\u201d said state Sen. Bruce Starr, GOP co-vice chair of the joint transportation committee.",
      "To make up for lost revenue, 34 states have raised their gas tax since 2013, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. California has the highest gas tax at over 69 cents a gallon when including other taxes and fees, while Alaska has the lowest at 9 cents a gallon, according to figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. In Oregon \u2014 which in 1919 became the first state to implement a gas tax \u2014 it is 40 cents a gallon.",
      "The federal gas tax of 18 cents a gallon, which isn\u2019t adjusted for inflation, hasn\u2019t been raised in over three decades.",
      "In Oregon, where there is no sales tax and tolling has met fierce opposition, lawmakers are debating next steps.",
      "Oregon is among the states that have already raised registration fees for EVs.",
      "Other states have taken such steps as indexing their gas tax to inflation, raising registration fees for EVs and taxing EV charging stations.",
      "To bolster transportation dollars, some have reorganized their budgets. In Michigan, where Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was first elected using the slogan \u201cFix the Damn Roads,\u201d some revenues from marijuana taxes and personal income taxes now go toward transportation. In Connecticut, the sales tax now brings in more money for its special transportation fund than gas tax revenues, a 2024 fiscal report shows.",
      "Another concept that could provide a long-term solution is what are often known as a road user charge. Under such a system, drivers pay a fee based on the distance they travel.",
      "In 2023, Hawaii established a road usage charge program for EV drivers that will phase in starting this July. In 2028, all EV drivers will be automatically enrolled, with odometers read at annual vehicle inspections.",
      "Three other states \u2014 Oregon, Utah and Virginia \u2014 have voluntary road usage fee programs. Drivers can opt to use GPS tools to track and report their mileage.",

      "California's sport and commercial fishermen have been walloped by two years of salmon closures and are bracing for a potential third, which they blame on a years-earlier drought and state and federal water management policies they say have made it tough for the species to thrive. The closures have taken a toll on people's livelihoods in coastal communities where salmon, fishermen say, is a special fish.",
      "Salmon must swim upstream to lay their eggs, and young fish make their way out to the ocean through California's waterways \u2014 something done more easily when cool water flows are abundant. The fishery has long been strained and the Pacific Fishery Management Council, which manages West Coast fisheries, said there will be very limited salmon fishing this year in California, if at all. A decision is due in April.",

Trump has professed his love for farmers and contends too much heed is paid to the tiny delta smelt, a federally-threatened species seen as an indicator of the health of California's Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.",
      "But salmon depend on this same water system for their survival. And some in the fishing community are wondering if fishermen aren't people, too.",
      "\u201cWe are people that are hardworking and it's our jobs on the line,\u201d said Sarah Bates, a commercial fishing captain in San Francisco. She said local markets have been devastated by the salmon closures and Bay Area restaurants aren't snapping up halibut or other catch as they did salmon.",
      "The history of commercial salmon fishing in California dates back more than a century, and in the 1970s and 1980s the fishery thrived off the state's coast. Over time, salmon fishing has declined with swings in stocks amid volatile weather patterns in a drought-prone state and water management decisions about when surface water, and how much of it, should flow to farms, burgeoning cities and the ecologically-sensitive bay delta.",
      "California's salmon fishing industry includes commercial fleets and charters that take anglers out for recreation.",
      "Jamie O\u2019Neill, owner of Seattle-based Dock Street Brokers, said many of California's commercial salmon fishermen are getting out of the business, selling their permits or simply letting them expire. Permits now sell for a fraction of what they used to, and there are fewer than 900 permits compared to 1,200 in 2010, he said.",
      "Charter operators, meanwhile, have branched out to host boat tours and party cruises, especially since short trips require little fuel and can help offset the cost of boat maintenance.",
      "While fishermen can still catch halibut, cod and striped bass along the extensive Pacific coastline, they say without the all-popular King Salmon, anglers just aren\u2019t coming like before. Each fish requires a different bait and technique, and a fast-swimming salmon is a fighter that anglers aspire to catch.",
      "\u201cOne is hamburger, and one is filet mignon,\u201d said Andy Guiliano, whose sportfishing boat the Pacific Pearl in Emeryville has expanded its historic tour offerings since the closure. \u201cIt makes the cash register ring.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump is escalating his attacks on the federal judiciary by calling for the impeachment of a judge who has tried to block his deportations",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said Tuesday that a federal judge who tried to stop his deportation plans should be impeached, escalating his conflict with a judiciary that's been one of the few restraints on his administration's aggressive plans.",
      "Trump has routinely criticized judges, especially as they limit his efforts to expand presidential power and impose his sweeping agenda on the federal government. But his call for impeachment \u2014 a rare step that is usually taken only in cases of grave ethical or criminal misconduct \u2014 represents an intensifying clash between the judicial and executive branches.",
      "The Republican president described U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg in Washington, as an unelected \u201ctroublemaker and agitator\u201d in a post on Truth Social, his social media platform. Boasberg recently issued an order blocking deportation flights under wartime authorities from an 18th century law that Trump invoked to carry out his plans.",
      "\u201cHE DIDN\u2019T WIN ANYTHING! I WON FOR MANY REASONS, IN AN OVERWHELMING MANDATE, BUT FIGHTING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION MAY HAVE BEEN THE NUMBER ONE REASON FOR THIS HISTORIC VICTORY,\u201d Trump wrote on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m just doing what the VOTERS wanted me to do. This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges\u2019 I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!!!\u201d",
      "The Alien Enemies Act of 1798 has been used only three times before in U.S. history, all during congressionally declared wars. Trump issued a proclamation that the law was newly in effect due to what he claimed was an invasion by the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. His administration is paying El Salvador to imprison alleged members of the gang.",
      "Boasberg, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, convened a hearing on Monday to discuss what he called \u201cpossible defiance\u201d of his order after two deportation flights continued to El Salvador despite his verbal order that they be turned around to the U.S.",
      "Trump administration lawyers defended their actions, saying Boasberg's written order wasn't explicit, while an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union said \u201cI think we're getting very close\u201d to a constitutional crisis.",
      "The Constitution gives the House of Representatives, where Republicans hold a slim majority, the power to impeach a judge with a simple majority vote. But, like a presidential impeachment, any removal requires a vote from a two-thirds majority from the Senate.",
      "The president\u2019s latest social media post aligns him more with allies like Elon Musk, who has made similar demands.",
      "\u201cWhat we are seeing is an attempt by one branch of government to intimidate another branch from performing its constitutional duty. It is a direct threat to judicial independence,\u201d Marin Levy, a Duke University law professor who specializes in the federal courts, said in an email.",
      "Only one day earlier, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, \u201cI have not heard the president talk about impeaching judges.\u201d",
      "Just 15 judges have been impeached in the nation\u2019s history, according to the U.S. courts governing body, and just eight have been removed.",
      "The last judicial impeachment was in 2010. G. Thomas Porteous Jr. of New Orleans was impeached on charges he accepted bribes and then lied about it. He was convicted by the Senate and removed from office in December 2010.",
      "Calls to impeach judges have been rising as Trump\u2019s sweeping agenda faces pushback in the courts, and at least two members of Congress have said online they plan to introduce articles of impeachment against Boasberg. House Republicans already have filed articles of impeachment against two other judges, Amir Ali and Paul Engelmayer, over rulings they\u2019ve made in Trump-related lawsuits.",

      "ALBANY, N.Y. -- A lawsuit against New York alleging sexual abuse decades ago was tossed out by the state\u2019s top court Tuesday because it lacked specific information, drawing criticism from advocates concerned about setting unrealistically high standards for survivors to recall traumatic events.",
      "The state Court of Appeals reversed a lower appeals court and granted the state's motion to dismiss the claim from a man who says he was repeatedly sexually assaulted around a state-run theater in Albany from 1986 to 1990, starting when he was 12. The suit was filed under the Child Victims Act, a 2019 state law that temporarily allowed people to sue over sexual abuse they suffered long ago as children.",
      "The judges unanimously sided with the state attorney general's office, which argued the lawsuit did not meet legal standards for bringing a claim against the state. The court said allegations in the lawsuit were too vague to allow the state to investigate the extent of its liability.",
      "\u201cThe claim lacks critical information about the abusers. It alleges that the perpetrators included teachers, coaches, counselors, and perhaps other employees of the State, but it does not explain whether those employees were ... teachers, coaches, and counselors, or why, as a child, he was in their company multiple times between 1986 and 1990,\u201d according to the decision by Judge Caitlin Halligan.",
      "The case deals only with requirements for suing New York, not private institutions such as churches or youth groups.",
      "The Associated Press typically does not name people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they come forward publicly and provide consent.",
      "The case is among roughly 300 filed against the state during a two-year window under the Child Victims Act. Most of the more than 10,800 CVA lawsuits named private institutions.",
      "Jessica Schidlow, legal director of the advocacy group CHILD USA, said the court's decision imposes unrealistic expectations on victims who sued the state under the CVA.",
      "\u201cThis interpretation neglects the modern scientific consensus on the neurobiological impact of trauma which can severely disrupt memory, and it perpetuates decades of procedural hurdles that shut victims out of court,\u201d Schidlow wrote in an email.",
      "The lawsuit was initially dismissed by a state Court of Claims judge who cited the lack of specific dates. A mid-level appeals court reversed that decision in 2023.",

    "story": [
      "Louisiana has used nitrogen gas to put a man to death, marking the first time the state has used that execution method",
      "ANGOLA, La. -- Louisiana used nitrogen gas to put a man to death Tuesday evening for a killing decades ago, marking the first time the state has used the method as it resumed executions after a 15-year hiatus.",
      "Jessie Hoffman Jr., 46, was pronounced dead at 6:50 p.m. at the Louisiana State Penitentiary, authorities said, adding the nitrogen gas had flowed for 19 minutes during what one official characterized as a \u201cflawless\u201d execution.",
      "Witnesses to the execution said Hoffman appeared to involuntarily shake or had \"some convulsive activity.\u201d But the three witnesses who spoke \u2014 including two members of the media \u2014 agreed that, based on the protocol and what they learned about the execution method, nothing seemed out of the ordinary.",
      "Witness Gina Swanson, a reporter with WDSU, described the execution from her viewpoint as \u201cclinical\u201d and \u201cprocedural.\u201d She said there was nothing that occurred during the process that made her think, \u201cWas that right? Was that how it was supposed to go?\u201d",
      "Hoffman declined to make a final statement in the execution chamber. He also declined a final meal.",
      "It was the fifth time nitrogen gas was used in the U.S. after four executions by the same method \u2014 all in Alabama. Three other executions, by lethal injection, are scheduled this week \u2014 in Arizona on Wednesday and in Florida and Oklahoma on Thursday.",
      "Hoffman was convicted of the murder of Mary \u201cMolly\u201d Elliott, a 28-year-old advertising executive who was killed in New Orleans. At the time of the crime, Hoffman was 18 and has since spent much of his adult life at the penitentiary in rural southeast Louisiana, where he was executed Tuesday evening.",
      "After court battles earlier this month, attorneys for Hoffman had turned to the Supreme Court in last-ditch hopes of halting the execution. Last year, the court declined to intervene in the nation\u2019s first nitrogen hypoxia execution, in Alabama.",
      "Hoffman\u2019s lawyers had unsuccessfully argued that the nitrogen gas procedure \u2014 which deprives a person of oxygen \u2014 violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. The man\u2019s lawyers, in a last-ditch appeal, also argued the method would infringe on Hoffman\u2019s freedom to practice religion, specifically his Buddhist breathing and meditation in the moments leading up to death.",
      "Louisiana officials maintained the method is painless. They also said it was past time for the state to deliver justice as promised to victims\u2019 families after a decade and a half hiatus \u2014 one brought on partly by an inability to secure lethal injection drugs.",
      "The Supreme Court voted 5-4 in declining to step in.",
      "Hours earlier at a hearing Tuesday, a 19th Judicial District Court Judge Richard \u201cChip\u201d Moore also declined to stop the execution. He agreed with the state's lawyers who had argued the man\u2019s religion-based arguments fell under the jurisdiction of a federal judge who had already ruled on them, according to local news outlets.",
      "Under the Louisiana protocol, which is nearly identical to Alabama\u2019s, officials had earlier said Hoffman would be strapped to a gurney before a full-face respirator mask fitted tightly on him. Pure nitrogen gas was then pumped into the mask, forcing him to breathe it in and depriving him of the oxygen needed to maintain bodily functions.",
      "The protocol called for the gas to be administered for at least 15 minutes or five minutes after the inmate\u2019s heart rate reaches a flatline indication on the EKG, whichever is longer.",
      "Two media witnesses to Tuesday's execution said Hoffman was covered with a gray plush blanket from the neck down. In the chamber with Hoffman was his spiritual advisor. Ahead of the execution and after the curtains closed to the viewing room, witnesses said they could hear Buddhist chanting.",
      "The gas began to flow at 6:21 p.m. and Hoffman started twitching, media witnesses said. His hands clenched and he had a \"slight head movement.\" Swanson said she closely watched the blanket over Hoffman's chest area and could see it rise and fall, indicating that he was breathing. She said his last visible breath appeared to be at 6:37 p.m. Shortly after, the curtains between the chamber and witness viewing room closed. When they reopened, Hoffman was pronounced dead.",
      "Seth Smith, chief of operations at the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections, witnessed the execution and also acknowledged Hoffman's movements. Smith, who has a medical background, said he perceived the convulsions to be an \"involuntary response to dying\" and that Hoffman appeared to be unconscious at the time.",
      "Each inmate put to death using nitrogen in Alabama had appeared to shake and gasp to varying degrees during their executions, according to media witnesses, including an Associated Press reporter. Alabama state officials said the reactions were involuntary movements associated with oxygen deprivation.",
      "Alabama first used nitrogen gas to put Kenneth Eugene Smith to death last year, marking the first time a new method had been used in the U.S. since lethal injection was introduced in 1982.",
      "Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Oklahoma specifically authorize execution by nitrogen hypoxia, according to records compiled by the Death Penalty Information Center. Arkansas was added to the list on Tuesday.",
      "Seeking to resume executions, Louisiana\u2019s GOP-dominated Legislature expanded the state\u2019s approved death penalty methods last year to include nitrogen hypoxia and electrocution. Lethal injection was already in place.",
      "On Tuesday, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed legislation allowing executions using nitrogen gas, making hers the fifth state to adopt the method. Arkansas currently has 25 people on death row.",
      "Over recent decades, the number of executions nationally has declined sharply amid legal battles, a shortage of lethal injection drugs and waning public support for capital punishment. That has led a majority of states to either abolish or pause carrying out the death penalty.",
      "On Tuesday afternoon, a small group of execution opponents held a vigil outside the rural southeast Louisiana prison at Angola, where the state\u2019s executions are carried out. Some passed out prayer cards with photos of a smiling Hoffman and planned a Buddhist reading and \u201cMeditation for Peace.\u201d",
      "Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said she expects at least four people to be executed this year in the state. Following Hoffman\u2019s execution, she said justice had been delayed for far too long and now Hoffman \u201dfaces the ultimate judgement, the judgement before God.\"",

      "Rivera Holmes, 45, is the seventh woman to hold statewide office in Georgia and the first woman of Hispanic descent. John King, the current insurance commissioner originally appointed by Kemp, was the first Hispanic man to hold statewide office. Although elected Republicans at the state level are still overwhelmingly white men, Kemp has made some diverse appointments, recognizing that the GOP needs to broaden its appeal in a state that is now only half white.",
      "Kemp made the announcement in a ceremony at the state Capitol in Atlanta, where he lauded Rivera Holmes for her \u201cunique skill set\u201d in workforce development and education. Holmes was appointed as a member of the board of regents overseeing the University System of Georgia in 2018 by Gov. Nathan Deal.",
      "\u201cShe brings an unmatched combination of knowledge and ability to this role that will benefit all those looking for work,\" said Kemp, a Republican.",

      "The department has been run since Thompson\u2019s death by interim commissioner Louis DeBroux, who was Thompson\u2019s chief of staff.",
      "Rivera Holmes will serve the remainder of Thompson's four-year term until early 2027, giving her a chance to make herself known as a statewide officeholder. She said she will run for a full term in the office as a Republican in 2026.",
      "\u201cYes, she'll run; yes, she'll run as a Republican,\u201d Kemp said.",
      "Georgia is one of only four states that elects its labor commissioner, with the governor appointing the position in other states.",
      "The Labor Department was battered during the pandemic by a huge wave of unemployment claims, raising questions about the management of the department. The department also struggled with a budget that was cut during the Great Recession more than a decade ago, leaving it with fewer employees and a 40-year-old computer system. Thompson announced a plan in 2023 to update that computer system. Rivera Holmes said she planned to evaluate how that changeover was going after she takes office.",
      "Rivera Holmes has led the Albany Area Chamber since 2015. She announced her resignation Monday, saying it would take effect on March 28. Kemp said Rivera Holmes would be sworn into her new statewide post on April 4.",
      "Kemp said he chose Rivera Holmes because he was looking for someone who works well as part of a team to aid economic development and job growth. He also said it was part of his commitment to aid economic opportunity in areas outside metro Atlanta, citing Rivera Holmes' work in southwest Georgia, one of the state's poorest regions.",
      "\u201cBeing situated outside of metro Atlanta is certainly an advantage,\" Rivera Holmes told reporters. \"Life is different outside of the metro area. The challenges are different, and the opportunities are different.\u201d",

      "That is the tricky scenario that officials at the US central bank will have to address at their interest rates meeting on Wednesday.",
      "The Federal Reserve, which is supposed to keep both prices and employment stable, typically lowers borrowing costs to help support the economy, or raises them to slow down price rises, as it did when prices shot up in 2022.",
      "Though analysts widely expect the Fed to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, they are far more divided about what to expect in the months ahead, as tariffs could both raises prices and slow economic growth.",
      "\"Their job has become a lot harder,\" said Jay Bryson, chief economist at Wells Fargo.",

      "In this month's survey of consumer sentiment by the University of Michigan, concerns about the job market surged to the highest level since the Great Recession, while household expectations of long-term inflation also jumped, in the biggest one-month rise since 1993.",
      "Those are troubling signals for the US, in which consumer spending accounts for roughly two thirds of the economy.",
      "\"It's not like the consumer is falling apart, but we're seeing some cracks,\" said Mr Bryson, who puts the odds of a recession at one in three, up from one in five at the start of the year.",
      "\"If consumers retrench... the entire economy is going to go down with it,\" he said.",
      "White House officials have acknowledged the likelihood of \"a little disturbance\", while promising that the short-term pain will lead to long-term gain.",

      "Software engineer Jim Frazer, who did not vote for Trump, said the administration's assurances have done little to ease his concerns, as he sees policies change by the hour, the stock market sink, and prices for staples such as eggs rise.",
      "Around the end of last year, the 49-year-old, who lives in Nebraska, purchased a new phone and television, betting such items would be affected by the tariffs Trump said he planned to put on imports from China.",

    "story": [
      "The diver had found the fibre optic cable lying on the seabed of the North Sea. He swam closer, until it was near enough to touch.",
      "He reached out his hand. But someone could tell he was lurking there. Someone was watching.",
      "\"He stops and just touches the cable lightly, you clearly see the signal,\" says Daniel Gerwig, global sales manager at AP Sensing, a German technology company. \"The acoustic energy which travels through the fibre is basically disturbing our signal. We can measure this disturbance.\"",
      "Multiple reports of damaged telecommunications cables in the Baltic Sea have raised alarm in recent months.",
      "So important are these cables, which carry huge volumes of internet data between countries, that Nato has launched a mission called \"Baltic Sentry\", to patrol the Baltic Sea with aircraft, warships and drones.",
      "The EU is also stepping up measures to monitor and protect cables.",
      "Despite those efforts the authorities cannot be everywhere at once.",
      "So, some companies are trying to monitor what's going on in the vicinity of any cable \u2013 by using fibre optic signals to listen out for surreptitious underwater drones, or hostile vessels dragging their anchors along the seabed.",
      "It was during tests of AP Sensing's system last year \u2013 not a real attempt at sabotage \u2013 that the diver patted his hand on the subsea cable watched over by the firm.",
      "The company also deployed ships, drones and divers with sea scooters to find out how accurately its software could pick out and identify the presence of these vehicles.",
      "And, the team tested whether their cable could \"hear\" a vessel plunging its anchor into the water.",
      "When pulses of light travel along a fibre optic strand, tiny reflections sometimes bounce back along that line. These reflections are affected by factors including temperature, vibrations or physical disturbance to the cable itself.",
      "Noticing a temperature change along part of a buried cable could reveal that part has become unburied, for example.",
      "AP Sensing shows me a video of a man walking across a lawn before lifting up a rifle and firing it during a test. A fibre optic cable buried in the ground a few metres away picked up the whole sequence.",
      "\"You see every single footstep,\" says Clemens Pohl, chief executive, as he points to a chart revealing disturbances in the fibre optic signal. The footsteps appear as brief blips or lines and the gunshot as a larger splodge.",
      "With this technology, it is even possible to work out the approximate size of a vessel passing above a subsea cable, as well as its location and, in some circumstances, its direction of travel. That could be correlated with satellite imagery, or even automatic identification system (AIS) records, which most ships broadcast at all times.",
      "It is possible to add monitoring capabilities to existing fibre optic cables if one unused, \"dark\" fibre is available, or a lit fibre with enough free channels, the firm adds.",
      "There are limitations, however. David Webb at Aston University says that fibre optic sensing technology cannot pick up disturbances from very far away, and you need to install signal listening devices, or interrogators, every 100km (62 miles) or so along a cable.",
      "AP Sensing says that it can pick up vibrations hundreds of metres away but \"usually not several kilometres away\". The company confirms that its technology is currently deployed on some cable installations in the North Sea, though declines to comment further.",
      "\"People really need an early warning in order to determine what to do,\" says Paul Heiden, chief executive of Optics11, a Dutch firm that also makes fibre optic acoustic sensing systems.",
      "Mr Heiden argues that cables installed solely for the purpose of monitoring marine activity could be especially useful \u2013 one might place such listening cables, say, 100km from a vital port, or in the vicinity of a key gas pipeline or telecommunications cable, rather than within those assets themselves.",
      "That could give operators an overview of vessel traffic in the area, and potentially advance notice of a ship heading towards a critical asset.",
      "Optics11's fibre optic listening technology can be deployed on military submarines, Mr Heiden adds, and he says the firm is soon to begin testing a monitoring cable installed somewhere on the floor of the Baltic Sea.",
      "Demand for fibre optic sensing technology is growing, says Douglas Clague at Viavi Solutions, a network testing and measurement company: \"We do see the number of requests increasing.\"",
      "Some of the cables damaged in recent incidents were made by Swedish cable company Hexatronic, says Christian Priess, head of Central Europe, Middle East, Africa and submarine cable business at the firm.",
      "Acoustic sensing is an emerging technology that Mr Priess suggests will become more common in the future. But there's relatively little one can do to protect a cable from sabotage, in terms of physical strengthening.",
      "Today's fibre optic cables already have metal casings folded and welded shut around the fibres, he says. There is also \"armoury wire\", thick metal cords, running along the outer parts of the cable and in some cases there are two layers of these cords. \"On the UK side of the Channel where you have a lot of rocks and a lot of fishing, you want to have it double-armoured,\" says Mr Priess.",
      "But should a vessel deliberately drag its heavy anchor across even a double-armoured cable, it will almost certainly still damage it, Mr Priess says \u2013 such is the force of the collision or pulling action.",
      "While it is possible to bury cables in the seabed for additional protection, this might become prohibitively expensive over long distances and at depths below a few dozen metres.",
      "\"Cables break all the time,\" says Lane Burdette, research analyst at TeleGeography, a telecoms market research firm. \"The number of cable faults per year has really held steady over the last several years,\" she adds, explaining that the 1-200 faults that typically occur annually has not risen despite ever more subsea cables being installed during that period.",
      "Ms Burdette also notes that, even when a cable is severed, telecommunications networks typically have significant redundancy built into them, meaning that end users often don't notice much disruption to their service.",
      "Still, the visible military response to cable breakages in the Baltic Sea is welcome, says Thorsten Benner, co-founder and director of the Global Public Policy Institute, a think tank: \"It's good that Nato and the European Union have woken up.\"",
      "And while cable sensing technology might be useful, its efficacy in terms of preventing damage rests on how quickly coastguard or military patrols could receive alerts about potential sabotage and react. \"The question is how quickly you could establish contact with a vessel,\" Says Benner.",

      "Incapacity benefits under universal credit will be frozen in cash terms for existing claimants at \u00a397 per week from April next year - this means they will not be increased in line with inflation until 2029/30.",
      "The amount will be reduced to \u00a350 per week in 2026/2027 for new claimants.",
      "But those receiving the new reduced universal credit health element after April 2026, who have the most severe, life-long health conditions, who have no prospect of improvement and will never be able to work, will see their incomes protected through an additional premium.",

      "There are two elements - a daily living component and a mobility component. Claimants may be eligible for one or both.",
      "Under the government's proposals, assessments for the daily living part will be tightened, potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of people.",
      "Pip assessments involve questions about tasks like preparing and eating food, washing and getting dressed. Each is scored on a scale from zero - for no difficulty - to 12 - for the most severe - by a health professional.",
      "From November 2026, the government says people will need to score at least four on one item, instead of qualifying for support with a score that could describe less severe difficulties (ones and twos) across a broad range of activities.",
      "For example, needing help to wash your hair, or your body below the waist, would be awarded two points, but needing help to wash between the shoulders and waist would equate to four points.",

      "Pip is usually paid every four weeks and is tax-free. It does not change depending on your savings or income and does not count as income affecting other benefits, or the benefit cap. You can get Pip if you are working.",
      "At present, the payment is made for a fixed period of time between one and 10 years, after which it is reviewed. A reassessment could come earlier if your circumstances change.",
      "The government plans more frequent reassessments for many people claiming Pip. However, those with the highest levels of a permanent condition or disability will no longer face reassessment.",
      "Pip is paid in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.",

      "The basic level of universal credit is worth \u00a3393.45 a month to a single person who is 25 or over.",
      "But if you have limited capacity to work because of a disability or long term condition, this payment more than doubles, due to a top up of \u00a3416.19.",
      "Under the proposals, claimants will not be eligible to get this incapacity top-up until they are aged 22 or over.",
      "New claimants will also see this top-up fall from \u00a397 extra per week in 2025 to \u00a350 a week by next year.",
      "The higher rate for existing health-related claimants will be frozen until 2029-2030.",
      "However, the basic payment level for universal credit will rise, reaching a \u00a3775 annual increase by the year 2029-30.",
      "What is being done to get more people into work?",
      "The government says it wants to help those who can work back into employment, while doing more to protect those with severe conditions who are unable to do so.",
      "As part of this it will invest \u00a31bn in \"high-quality, tailored and personalised support\"  to help people find jobs.",
      "A number of changes have been announced which, the government says, break the link between trying to get into work and losing benefits.",
      "The work capability assessment, which checks eligibility for the health related top-up to universal credit, will be scrapped by 2028.",
      "Instead, claimants will have to go through the Pip system to claim for a health benefit. The government says they will be assessed on how their disability affects their daily life, rather than on their capacity to work.",
      "While you can receive universal credit or Pip while in employment, universal credit is means-tested and tapers off, while Pip is not affected by how much someone works or their level of savings.",
      "Under a new \"right to try\" system people will not be penalised for trying to get back in to work, the government says.",

      "Why is the government aiming to cut welfare spending?",
      "Overall, the government currently spends \u00a365bn a year on health and disability-related benefits. This is projected to increase to \u00a3100bn by 2029.",
      "Pip is now the second-largest element of the working-age welfare bill, with spending expected to almost double to \u00a334bn by 2029-30.",
      "When Pip was introduced in 2013, the aim was to save \u00a31.4bn a year by reducing the number of people eligible for payments. However, initial savings were modest and the number of claimants has risen.",
      "About 1.3m people now claim disability benefits primarily for mental health or behavioural conditions.",
      "That is 44% of all working age claimants, according to the independent economic think-tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS)."

      "\"The customers are spooked, the customers are wanting to go to other suppliers to make sure they don't get caught in the tariff warfare,\" he said.",
      "Mr Nair was giving evidence to the committee's inquiry into the UK government's forthcoming industrial strategy.",
      "He said existing customers had contacted the company to cancel orders, and in other cases were asking for \"compensation\" from Tata Steel towards the cost of the tariffs, which must be paid by the importer in the USA.",
      "In response to the US tariffs the European Union imposed a raft of retaliatory measures on American goods being exported to the EU.",
      "But the UK has resisted retaliating directly, with the Westminster government continuing to push for a wide-ranging trade deal with the Trump administration.",
      "Asked if the UK should retaliate with its own tariffs, Rajesh Nair called instead for greater protection for UK steelmakers from foreign imports.",
      "\"We have got to act in a manner and a way in which we protect and safeguard the industry in a way in which the incumbent players can continue to do business, and the customer gets a fair deal at the end of it all.",

      "Steelmakers' union Community, which also appeared before the committee on Tuesday, said it was concerned about the impact of tariffs and diverted steel on the UK workforce.",
      "\"We are worried about what this means for jobs and for the sustainability of the industry,\" said Alasdair McDiarmid, assistant general secretary of Community.",
      "He said tariffs were \"a terrible idea, it is a terrible idea for the US just as much as it is for us\".",
      "Asked if workers were angered by the change in trade policy, Mr McDiarmid said: \"Yes they are angry, of course they are angry.",
      "\"They are worried about their livelihoods, and the future of their plant and their communities as well. It is not a situation they would choose to be in.\"",
      "He said the \"biggest concern\" for the union was the diversion of steel from the US market to the UK, and said Britain must move \"extremely quickly and decisively\" to strengthen trade defences.",
      "The UK government's business and trade secretary Jonthan Reynolds has previously said that he wanted to pursue \"pragmatic and positive engagement\" with President Trump's administration \"to agree a wider economic deal in both our interests\"."

    "summary": "Beijing hopes better wages and discounts can encourage spending and stave off greater economic trouble.",
    "story": [
      "The Chinese government has promised new child care subsidies, increased wages and better paid leave to revive a slowing economy. That is on top of a $41bn discount programme for all sorts of things, from dishwashers and home decor to electric vehicles and smartwatches.",
      "Beijing is going on a spending spree that will encourage Chinese people to crack open their wallets.",
      "Simply put, they are not spending enough.",
      "Monday brought some positive news. Official data said retail sales grew 4% in the first two months of 2025, a positive sign for consumption data. But, with a few exceptions like Shanghai aside, new and existing home prices continued to decline compared to last year.",
      "While the US and other major powers have struggled with post-Covid inflation, China is experiencing the opposite: deflation - when the rate of inflation falls below zero, meaning that prices decrease. In China, prices fell for 18 months in a row in the past two years.",
      "Prices dropping might sound like good news for consumers. But a persistent decline in consumption - a measure of what households buy - signals deeper economic trouble. When people stop spending, businesses cut prices to attract buyers. The more this happens, the less money they make, hiring slows, wages stagnate and economic momentum grinds to a halt.",
      "That is a cycle China wants to avoid, given it's already battling sluggish growth in the wake of a prolonged crisis in the property market, steep government debt and unemployment.",
      "Three reasons Trump tariffs aren't China's only problem",
      "China says it is ready for 'any type of war' with US",
      "The cause of low consumption is straightforward: Chinese consumers either don't have enough money or don't feel confident enough about their future to spend it.",
      "But their reluctance comes at a critical moment. With the economy aiming to grow at 5% this year, boosting consumption is a top priority for President Xi Jinping. He is hoping that rising domestic consumption will absorb the blow US tariffs will inflict on Chinese exports.",
      "So, will Beijing's plan work?",
      "China is getting serious about spending",
      "To tackle its ailing economy and weak domestic demand, Beijing wrapped up its annual National People's Congress last week with increased investment in social welfare programmes as part of its grand economic plan for 2025.",
      "Then came this week's announcement with bigger promises, such as employment support plans, but scant details.",
      "Some say it is a welcome move, with the caveat that China's leaders need to do more to step up support. Still, it signals Beijing's awareness of the changes needed for a stronger Chinese consumer market - higher wages, a stronger social safety net and policies that make people feel secure enough to spend rather than save.",
      "A quarter of China's labour force is made up of low-paid migrant workers, who lack full access to urban social benefits. This makes them particularly vulnerable during periods of economic uncertainty, such as the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "Rising wages during the 2010s masked some of these problems, with average incomes growing by around 10% annually. But as wage growth slowed in the 2020s, savings once again became a lifeline.",
      "The Chinese government, however, has been slow to expand social benefits, focusing instead on boosting consumption through short-term measures, such as trade-in programmes for household appliances and electronics. But that has not addressed a root problem, says Gerard DiPippo, a senior researcher at the Rand think tank: \"Household incomes are lower, and savings are higher\".",
      "The near-collapse of the property market has also made Chinese consumers more risk-averse, leading them to cut back on spending.",
      "\"The property market matters not only for real economic activity but also for household sentiment, since Chinese households have invested so much of their wealth in their homes,\" Mr DiPippo says. \"I don't think China's consumption will fully recover until it's clear that the property sector has bottomed out and therefore many households' primary assets are starting to recover.\"",
      "Some analysts are encouraged by Beijing's seriousness in targeting longer-term challenges like falling birth rates as more young couples opt out of the costs of parenthood.",
      "A 2024 study by Chinese think tank YuWa estimated that raising a child to adulthood in China costs 6.8 times the country's GDP per capita - among the highest in the world, compared to the US (4.1), Japan (4.3) and Germany (3.6).",
      "These financial pressures have only reinforced a deeply ingrained saving culture. Even in a struggling economy, Chinese households managed to save 32% of their disposable income in 2024.",
      "That's not too surprising in China, where consumption has never been particularly high. To put this in perspective, domestic consumption drives more than 80% of growth in the US and UK, and about 70% in India. China's share has typically ranged between 50% to 55% over the past decade.",
      "But this wasn't really a problem - until now.",
      "When shopping fell and savings rose",
      "There was a time when Chinese shoppers joked about the irresistible allure of e-commerce deals, calling themselves \"hand-choppers\" - only chopping off their hands could stop them from hitting the checkout button.",
      "As rising incomes fuelled their spending power, 11 November in China, or Double 11, came to be crowned as the world's busiest shopping day. Explosive sales pulled in over 410 billion yuan ($57bn; \u00a344bn) in just 24 hours in 2019.",
      "But the last one \"was a dud,\" a Beijing-based coffee bean online seller told the BBC.  \"If anything, it caused more trouble than it was worth.\"",
      "Chinese consumers have grown frugal since the pandemic, and this caution has persisted even after restrictions were lifted in late 2022.",
      "That's the year Alibaba and JD.com stopped publishing their sales figures, a significant shift for companies that once headlined their record-breaking revenues. A source familiar with the matter told the BBC that Chinese authorities cautioned platforms against releasing numbers, fearing that underwhelming results could further dent consumer confidence.",
      "The spending crunch has even hit high-end brands - last year, LVMH, Burberry and Richemont all reported sales declines in China, once a backbone of the global luxury market.",
      "On RedNote, a Chinese social media app, posts tagged with \"consumption downgrade\" have racked up more than a billion views in recent months. Users are swapping tips on how to replace expensive purchases with budget-friendly alternatives. \"Tiger Balm is the new coffee,\" said one user, while another quipped, \"I apply perfume between my nose and lips now \u2013 saving it just for myself.\"",
      "Even at its peak, China's consumer boom was never a match for its exports. Trade  was also the focus of generous state-backed investment in highways, ports and special economic zones. China relied on low-wage workers and high household savings, which fuelled growth but left consumers with limited disposable income.",
      "But now, as geopolitical uncertainties grow, countries are diversifying supply chains away from China, reducing reliance on Chinese exports. Local governments are burdened by debt, after years of borrowing heavily to invest, particularly in infrastructure.",
      "Xi Jinping has already vowed \"to make domestic demand the main driving force and stabilising anchor of growth\". Caiyun Wang, a National People's Congress representative, said, \"With a population of 1.4 billion, even a 1% rise in demand creates a market of 14 million people.\"",
      "But there's a catch in Beijing's plan.",
      "For consumption to drive growth, many analysts say, the Chinese Communist Party would have to restore the consumer confidence of a generation of Covid graduates that is struggling to own a home or find a job. It would also require triggering a cultural shift, from saving to spending.",
      "\"China's extraordinarily low consumption level is not an accident,\" according to Michael Pettis, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"It is fundamental to the country's economic growth model, around which three-four decades of political, financial, legal and business institutions in China have evolved. Changing this won't be easy.\"",

      "A pharmacy's NHS contract accounts for about 90% of its revenue, on average.",
      "And with increases in National Insurance, the National Living Wage and business rates, from 1 April, pharmacies say the lack of agreement over their contract is causing worry and uncertainty.",
      "This comes on top of a decade of cuts to funding, which has seen 30 pharmacies close since the start of this year, the NPA says.",
      "Some 3,000 pharmacy owners in England, Wales and Northern Ireland voted in favour of action, in November.",
      "This could involve cutting pharmacy opening times to 40 hours a week, which is the minimum set out in the current NHS contract, with shops less likely to be open at weekends and in the evenings.",

    "story": [
      "What happens today, here in Berlin, will impact the entire future of Europe's defence and its ongoing support for Ukraine.",
      "Germany's Parliament, the Bundestag, is voting on whether to take the brakes off defence spending. This could pave the way for a massive uplift in military investment just as Russia makes gains in Ukraine and Washington signals that Europe can no longer rely on US protection.",
      "\"This vote in the Bundestag is absolutely crucial,\" says Prof Monika Schnitzer, who chairs Germany's Council of Economic Experts.",
      "\"After the Munich Security Conference, then the Trump-Zelensky row, Europe got a wake-up call. For the first time Europeans may not be able to rely on Washington. A lot of people had sleepless nights after that.\"",
      "\"The outlook for European defence spending hinges on developments in Germany, as the holder of the region's largest defence budget,\" agrees Dr Fenella McGerty, senior fellow for defence economics at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies.",
      "Defence spending in Germany rose by 23.2% last year, helping to drive a record 11.7% rise in European defence outlay.",
      "\"The remarkable initiatives announced in Germany are key to enabling further growth,\" adds Dr McGerty.",
      "\"Without them, any progress made on strengthening Germany's military capability may have stalled.\"",
      "Germany's incoming new Chancellor, Friedrich Merz, is in a race against time.",
      "The new parliament convenes on 25 March and not everyone is in favour of all this money being spent, especially on defence.",
      "Both the far-right AfD party and the far-left Linke have vowed to oppose it. The vote needs two-thirds in favour to go through, so Merz has a better chance of this happening today, under the existing (old) parliament. It then needs to be approved by Germany's upper house.",
      "Meanwhile Europe is still coming to terms with the shock of announcements coming from the Trump administration.",
      "At last month's Munich Security Conference I watched as delegates sat open-mouthed listening to US Vice-President JD Vance's blistering attack on Europe's policies on migration and free speech.",
      "This was preceded days earlier by US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth telling Nato members that America's 80-year-long defensive umbrella for Europe should no longer be taken for granted.",
      "Defence strategists in Europe are already planning for the unthinkable: a semi-victorious Russia making gains in Ukraine, then rebuilding its army and threatening Nato's eastern members, such as the Baltic states, within three years or less.",
      "This, at a time when the US commitment to Europe's defence is looking extremely shaky. President Trump is being urged by some in his circle to pull US troops out of Europe and even to withdraw from Nato altogether.",
      "Historical caution",
      "There is talk of France extending its national nuclear deterrent to cover other European nations.",
      "Meanwhile, most European governments are under pressure to raise defence spending after years of cuts.",
      "The British Army has now shrunk to its smallest size since the Napoleonic Wars, over 200 years ago, and experts predict it would run out of ammunition within two weeks of fighting a full-scale conventional war in Europe.",
      "Germany has long been cautious about defence spending, not just for historical reasons dating back to 1945, but also due to the global debt crisis of 2009.",
      "Which brings us back to today's crucial vote in the Bundestag. It is not just about defence. One part is about freeing up \u20ac500bn (\u00a3420bn) for German infrastructure \u2013 fixing things like bridges and roads, but also to pay for climate change measures, something the Green Party insisted on.",
      "The other part is about removing the restrictions in the constitution on borrowing that could, in theory, free up unlimited billions of euros for defence spending, both for Germany's armed forces and for a pan-European defence fund. On 4 March European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen announced plans for an \u20ac800bn defence fund called The ReArm Europe Fund.",
      "The proposal being voted on in Berlin is that any spending on defence that amounts to more than 1% of Germany's GDP (national wealth) would no longer be subject to a limit on borrowing. Until now this debt ceiling has been fixed at 0.35 pct of GDP.",
      "Other countries will be watching closely to see if this proposal passes. If it does not, then the EU Commission's 'ReArm Europe' project could be off to a shaky start.",
      "The challenge today for Europe's security is a stark one. If the US no longer has its back, or at the very least cannot be relied upon to come to Europe's defence, then what does the continent need to do to fill the gap?",
      "Let's start with the numbers. According to the Kiel Institute, which meticulously tracks these things, Europe spends just 0.1% of its wealth on helping to defend Ukraine, while the US has been spending 0.15%.",
      "\"That means,\" says the Kiel Institute's Giuseppe Irto, \"that if Europe is to make up the shortfall then it needs to double its contribution to 0.21%.\"",
      "But regardless of what happens today in Berlin this is not just about money.",
      "Many of the most sought-after weapons in Ukraine's armoury have come from the US, like Patriot air defence and long-range artillery systems like Himars. The Kiel Institute puts the proportion of Ukraine's rocket artillery at 86% coming from the US, with 82% of its howitzer ammunition also being US-sourced.",
      "Then there is the whole question of US intelligence aid for Kyiv, much of it derived from satellites and geospatial imagery. If Washington were to permanently switch that off, then Ukrainian forces risk being partially blinded.",
      "If America's nuclear arsenal is taken out of the equation then there is a massive disparity between Russia's 5,000-plus warheads and the combined total of Britain and France's nukes which amount to less than a tenth of that. But that still theoretically leaves enough to act as a nuclear deterrent.",
      "Culture shift",
      "When it comes to \"conventional\", ie. non-nuclear arms, Western defence chiefs are fond of saying that Nato's combined forces are superior to Russia's.",
      "Maybe, but if there is one glaring lesson to come out of the Ukraine war it is that \"mass\" matters. Russia's army may be of poor quality but President Putin has been able to throw such huge numbers of men, drones, shells and missiles at Ukraine's front lines that the Russians are inexorably advancing, albeit slowly and at huge cost.",
      "This should not come as a surprise. Moscow put its economy on to a war footing some time ago. It appointed an economist as its defence minister and retooled many of its factories to churn out vast quantities of munitions, especially explosive-tipped drones.",
      "While many European nations have dragged their feet over raising defence spending much above the Nato-mandated 2% of GDP, Russia's is closer to 7%. Around 40% of Russia's national budget is spent on defence.",
      "So Europe has a fair bit of catching up to do if it is to even come close to shoring up its defence and security.",
      "\"If the vote passes then it will be significant for Germany and for Europe,\" says Ed Arnold, senior research fellow for European security at the Royal United Services Institute think tank.",
      "\"It will set a precedent and allow others to follow... However, three years on from the invasion of Ukraine the case of Germany is a reminder that more money for defence is necessary but not sufficient.",

    "summary": "The debate has sparked a wider dilemma about the broader purpose of welfare",
    "story": [
      "In the next 24 hours and then over the following fortnight up until the Spring Statement, the government is going to talk a lot about a broken welfare system that is failing the people who use it, the economy and taxpayers.",
      "Taking a tough call on fixing it goes against the instincts of much of the Labour Party and has already sparked an internal backlash that could rise to ministerial level, as well as protests.",
      "The government is making two key related judgements. The first is that the country cannot afford to sustain recent ballooning increases in the health-related benefit bill and caseload, in particular for mental illness.",
      "At the same time, it will argue that a job is the best medicine.",
      "Underlying this is an assumption that a health-related benefits system that was built-up to deal with industrial injuries can't apply to the post-pandemic service economy workforce.",
      "The net result is likely to be significant changes to Personal Independence Payments, aiming to reduce eligibility for the highest levels of payments, especially among those of working age with mental illness.",
      "In addition, there will be a levelling of the generosity of the health component of Universal Credit. This will save billions of pounds, and about a billion of that will be reinvested in trying to help get those capable of part-time work some help for a partial return.",
      "Mapping welfare trends",
      "The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is rolling in real-time data. \"Cluster analysis maps\" reveal to ministers exactly who is claiming out of work benefits and where they are.",
      "As the numbers continue to increase, the data is being cut by sector, postcode, age and type of illness. Every pattern is being analysed.",
      "The idea was that the data would firstly offer the government insight into how it could make billions of pounds of cuts to a rapidly growing bill in order to help the Chancellor meet her self-imposed government borrowing rules.",
      "Secondly, it was meant to point to more fundamental reforms to welfare, also designed to temper the same ballooning rise in the costs of dealing with ill health among the working population.",
      "The data has thrown up answers.",
      "That poor mental health is driving the rise in claimants is clear. To a lesser extent, so too is the role that raising the state pension age has played, with many thousands who would previously have been retired now claiming health-related benefits.",
      "But it has also thrown up a major question too: does cutting welfare to incentivise people to work more hours in fact do the opposite - nudging them out of the workforce altogether and ultimately increasing the benefit bill?",
      "If this is the case - and it is by no means a universally accepted interpretation of what has happened - then the question is whether further cuts could in fact increase the numbers claiming? And should Labour instead invest in getting people back into work?",
      "Growing sickness",
      "When I visited a job centre in Birmingham alongside the Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall in the Autumn, I was taken aback by how the work coaches were talking as much about health as about work.",
      "\"There's a lot of mental health, depression and anxiety,\" Qam told me.",
      "GPs have reported that their surgery time is dominated by trying to work out whether their patients are \"fit for work\". Roughly 11 million fit notes are issued every year in England alone, with 93% assessing the patient as \"not fit for work\". That has doubled over a decade. In the latest quarter, 44% were for 5 weeks or more absence.",
      "From that pool of growing in-work sickness, a significant proportion ends up on some form of incapacity benefits. The Treasury's bill for health and disability benefits, which was \u00a328bn in the year before the pandemic, is now \u00a352bn a year. It is forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to hit \u00a370bn by the end of the decade.",
      "The pure financial aim here is to \"bend the curve\" down to nearer \u00a360bn in that period. This means restricting both the generosity and eligibility of some - or all of such - payments. It could require a wholesale cash freeze so that benefits do not rise with inflation, for example, or the abolition of entire categories of recipients.",
      "'Deaths of despair'",
      "An Institute for Fiscal Studies report published last week showed that wider measures of mental ill health have rocketed since the pandemic. Between 2002 and 2024, the number of 16-64-year-olds claiming disability benefits for mental or behavioural health conditions increased from 360,000 to 1.28 million.",
      "Every day in 2023 there were 10 extra \"deaths of despair\" (defined as deaths from alcohol, drugs or suicide) in England and Wales than the average between 2015 and 2019. Average sickness absence rates across the whole economy remained structurally higher than pre-pandemic.",
      "Of particular concern is how this affects young people. In a recent report DWP adviser Prof Paul Gregg points to the \"incredibly low\" chances of sustained returns to the workforce once a person has been on incapacity benefits for two years.",
      "About two fifths of new incapacity benefit claimants under 25 came directly from education. The latest DWP analysis shows these trends are now closely related to broader socio-economic vulnerabilities such as limited education and also with precarious sectors such as retail and hospitality.",
      "The question that remains is whether so many people really are more sick - and what role (if any) is played by the reduction in stigma around mental health.",
      "But then there is the question of how to address it.",
      "Overly binary",
      "Another major factor is that rise in the state pension age, which the DWP calculates, resulted in 89,000 older workers instead claiming health-related benefits. However, the sharp increase in claimants of such benefits since the pandemic is not only attributable to ageing populations or increasing mental health diagnoses.",
      "Research suggests there are significant systemic and policy-driven causes. At its heart the problem is perceived to be that the current welfare structure has become overly binary, failing to accommodate a growing demographic who should be able to do at least a bit of work.",
      "This rigidity - what ministers refer to as a \"hard boundary\" - inadvertently pushes individuals towards declaring complete unfitness for work, and can lead to total dependence on welfare, particularly Universal Credit Health (UC Health), rather than facilitating a gradual transition back into employment.",
      "This has been bad for the economy, for employers, terrible for the public finances, and deeply concerning for the career prospects of individuals.",
      "History helps here. Health-related benefits are often a disguised form of unemployment. The caseload for incapacity benefits (which include not just UC Health but previous incarnations) since the 1970s shows the UK heading for a record of one in 12 adults of working age in receipt.",
      "But this is not the first such build-up. It happened in the late 1980s when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister, and it was reversed in the early 2000s under New Labour.",
      "The launch in 1986 of Restart Programme, a forerunner to JobSeekers Allowance modelled on Ronald Reagan's policies in the US, helped return many claimants to the workforce but also pushed a staggering number into incapacity claims.",
      "Over the decade and a half of this policy, there was a 1.6 million increase in people in receipt of the benefit. But at the time this migration from claimant unemployment into incapacity was apparently a deliberate strategy, as it helped deal with headlines about \"three million unemployed\".",
      "A middle ground",
      "The government has not yet published its analysis on the jobs market, but Prof Gregg's early thinking was made clear in a report for the Health Foundation. He argued that, historically, the welfare system responded effectively through a middle ground that allowed individuals to combine part-time work with partial welfare benefits. He puts this down to reforms introduced in the early 2000s, such as tax credits.",
      "This is essentially the crystallisation of Iain Duncan Smith's critique of then chancellor George Osborne's welfare cuts of 2016. He told me at the time that they were \"deeply unfair\" on working people and the vision of a proper welfare-to-work scheme \"could not be repeatedly salami-sliced\".",
      "Some argue that those reforms created a situation where individuals, unable to sustain full-time work, gravitate towards more generous health-based welfare program.",
      "Crucially, claims began to rise in 2018. At the DWP ministers have tried to research the reasons behind the increase in caseload - and found that about a third of the increase can be explained as the predictable consequence of policy or of demographics.",
      "Prevention rather than cure",
      "With an ongoing flow of new claimants arriving in the system (nearly half a million in the last financial year) the onus is now on finding a prevention rather than a cure.",
      "And this is where it becomes tricky - one suggestion involves eliminating the current welfare trap by reintroducing intermediate support for part-time work. However, that requires extra funding, as well as a way of providing more personalised job searches and better mental health support.",
      "Another option is passing responsibilities to employers. In the Netherlands, employers bear significant responsibilities and financial costs if they fail to adequately support employees facing health challenges. In the early 2000s, the Dutch also had very high levels of incapacity but they now report employment rates of 83%.",
      "The structure of the jobs market in the UK makes that challenging to replicate - for example there are more insecure zero hours contracts.",
      "And given that businesses feel under pressure from National Insurance rises and a slow economy, could they really be cajoled into helping?",
      "Faster cuts",

      "The chancellor has told regulators there is \"too much bureaucracy\" as she aims to slash red tape to boost economic growth.",
      "Rachel Reeves met industry watchdogs on Monday, revealing plans to cut the cost of regulation, including on environmental measures, and axe some bodies entirely.",
      "It comes as a leading think tank cut its UK growth forecasts for 2025 and 2026 as it downgraded prospects for the global economy over trade war concerns.",
      "The government has made boosting growth its main priority, but the Conservatives said Labour's taxes were harming growth and called on Reeves to set out a \"real plan\".",
      "Reeves told regulators at the 40-minute meeting that the current level of bureaucracy made it \"too slow to get things done\".",
      "\"There are a number of things over the last decade or so that have held back growth, and one of them - if we are honest and you know better than anyone - is the regulatory landscape,\" she said.",
      "Reeves also spoke about reducing the duplication of work done by regulators.",
      "'Global headwinds'",
      "In its latest forecast, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) cut its predictions for UK growth to 1.4% in 2025, from its previous forecast of 1.7%, and to 1.2% in 2026, down from 1.3%.",
      "However, the forecast is more optimistic than the Bank of England, which earlier this month cut its UK growth forecast for 2025 to 0.75%.",
      "Economic forecasts are not always accurate but predictions from the OECD are looked at closely.",
      "The OECD said that for the world economy, growth would slow from 3.2% in 2024 to 3.1% in 2025, largely as a result of the trade tensions sparked by US President Donald Trump's introduction of tariffs on imports into the US.",
      "In response to the OECD's forecast, Reeves said: \"This report shows the world is changing, and increased global headwinds such as trade uncertainty are being felt across the board.\"",
      "The UK economy shrank unexpectedly in January, contracting by 0.1%, which was weaker than forecast, driven mainly by a decline in the manufacturing sector.",
      "Ahead of Monday's meeting with regulators, Reeves said. \"By cutting red tape and creating a more effective system, we will boost investment, create jobs and put more money into working people's pockets.\"",
      "Changes announced by the government include streamlining the environmental regulatory process for major projects including Lower Thames Crossing (subject to planning approval) and future ones such as a Heathrow expansion.",
      "Meanwhile, environmental guidance, including hundreds of pages on protection of bats, will be reviewed, while environmental permits for some low-risk and temporary projects will be removed.",
      "This plan comes alongside 60 measures agreed upon by watchdogs \"following weeks of intense negotiations\" that are designed to make it easier to do business in the UK.",
      "Those measures include:",

      "The government has already announced plans to fold another quango, the Payments Systems Regulator, into the Financial Conduct Authority.",
      "Reeves announced on Monday the abolition of a third - the Regulator for Community Interest Companies, which will be folded into Companies House.",
      "The chancellor has promised to significantly cut the number of regulators by the end of the Parliament.",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said that Labour's taxes and trade union red tape were preventing businesses from focusing on growth.",
      "\"Rachel Reeves has nine days until her emergency budget, where the Conservatives are calling on her to set out a real plan for\u00a0growth,\" Stride said.",
      "Mark Allan, chief executive of commercial property firm Landsec, said: \"We have been through a period over many years of having regulation laid on top of existing regulation.\"",
      "While moves by the government were \"very positive\", he added that \"we're starting from quite a low base, so to me this is more of a three-year project than a three-month project before we start to see that coming through.\"",

    "summary": "Despite dire predictions of climate breakdown, more Sports Utility Vehicles are being spotted on, and off, the roads.",
    "story": [
      "Across the globe more and more Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) are being spotted on \u2013 and off \u2013 the roads.",
      "This is despite predictions from the United Nations of an inevitable pivot towards smaller and more environmentally friendly vehicles because of the urgency of the climate crisis and the rising cost of living.",
      "That pivot has not materialised: globally, 54% of the cars sold in 2024 were SUVs, including petrol, diesel, hybrids and electric makes. This is an increase of three percentage points from 2023 and five percentage points from the year before, according to GlobalData.",
      "Of the SUVs which are now on the road \u2013 both new and older models \u2013 95% are burning fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).",
      "Manufacturers, however, say their new fleets of such cars are increasingly becoming electric, and that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "SUVs are hard to miss. They are heavy and larger with spacious interiors, higher ground clearance and a high driving position with a better view of the road, although smaller versions are also on the market.",
      "Environmental campaigners such as Greenpeace see SUVs as one of the villains of the climate crisis and argue that their manufacturing consumes significant resources given their size.",
      "Experts also say they require larger batteries to power their electric versions, which then further increases the demand for critical minerals, putting even more pressure on the planet.",
      "Momentum was thought to be with smaller, energy-efficient electric vehicles. But the sales of standard-sized electric vehicles (EVs) has actually decreased in major markets such as Japan and Germany, and their sales growth has slowed in India.",
      "And in Europe, sales of SUVs have outpaced those of EVs despite indications more than half a decade ago of an opposite trend. In Europe in 2018, 3.27 million small hatchbacks \u2013 both those powered by fossil fuels and those by electricity \u2013 were sold while 2.13 million were sold in 2024, according to GlobalData.",
      "Its sales forecast manager Sammy Chan said: \"This is partly because of the SUV alternatives being offered in smaller [sizes] whose sales in Europe have now grown to nearly to 2.5 million in 2024 from 1.5 million in 2018.\"",
      "China saw the largest sales of nearly 11.6 million SUVs in 2024 followed by the US, India and Germany, according to GlobalData.",
      "What is driving this SUV growth?",
      "Industry experts say people's purchasing power has been improving in many fast-emerging economies, making SUVs the likelier choice of car.",
      "\"Manufacturers respond to consumer demand and, increasingly, drivers are attracted to dual purpose vehicles given their practicality, comfort and good view of the road,\" said Mike Hawes who is the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).",
      "Automobile industry analysts also say that manufacturers are attracted to high profit margins from SUVs: they can make more money from SUVs even though they make fewer vehicles.",
      "\"It is the industry that has driven the demand through huge marketing and advertising campaigns in recent years,\" said Dudley Curtis, the communications manager at the European Transport Safety Council.",
      "\"SUVs offered the industry a simple way of charging more for a vehicle that does the same thing [as others],\" he said.",
      "Are SUVs an issue?",
      "Because of the robust growth in SUVs sales, the IEA says oil consumption of these  vehicles has increased by 600,000 barrels per day globally between 2022 and 2023, accounting for more than a quarter of the total annual rise in global oil demand.",
      "\"If ranked among countries, the global fleet of SUVs would be the world's fifth largest emitter of CO2, exceeding the emissions of Japan and various other major economies,\" said Apostolous Petropolous, an energy modeller with the IEA.",
      "The agency says that even when compared to medium-sized cars that run on petrol and diesel, SUVs burn 20% more of such fuels as they weigh up to 300 kg more on average.",
      "In fact, road transport is responsible for more than 12% of global carbon emissions which is the main driver of global warming. Scientists say all sectors must rapidly decarbonise if we are to avoid a climate catastrophe.",
      "But industry representatives say in response that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "BMW delays electric Mini over 'uncertainty'",
      "Why don't Europeans buy more American cars?",
      "\"Around two in five of these [new] vehicle models are zero emission as their body type lends itself well to electrification with longer battery range that can reassure consumers concerned about charging accessibility,\" said Hawes, from the SMMT.",
      "\"This has led to the average CO2 emissions of new dual purpose cars more than halving since 2000, helping the segment lead the decarbonisation of UK road mobility.\"",
      "Although the vast majority of new SUVs still burn fossil fuels, IEA officials have said that over 20% of SUVs sold in 2023 were fully electric, up from 2% in 2018.",
      "As for hybrids that can run on both electricity and fossil fuels, a study in Europe by the International Council on Clean Transportation in 2022 found only around 30% of the total distance driven by plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (all types including SUVs) was in electric mode on average.",
      "Similar results were found in other major economies such as the US and China.",
      "Overall, the back-gear towards SUVs, some experts say, has caused a significant setback in the decarbonisation of the transport sector.",
      "\"The trend toward heavier and less efficient vehicles such as SUVs (in countries where it is happening) has largely nullified the improvements in energy consumption and emissions achieved elsewhere in the world's passenger car fleet,\" said the IEA.",

      "Stewart Kenny, who helped found the Irish company in the 80s, believes online slot games spin too fast, which contributes to them being addictive.",
      "He thinks new government rules limiting the stakes are not enough to render them safe, and thinks the games should also be slowed down.",
      "From April, slots will be limited to \u00a35 per spin for over 25s. In May, 18-24-year-olds will be limited to \u00a32 per spin.",
      "This follows a government review of the 2005 Gambling Act, and the publication of a white paper which introduces new measures to strengthen gambling harm legislation.",
      "Online slots are web versions of slot machines you see in a casino. The punter enters money and spins a wheel. If the symbols or pictures match, they could win money.",
      "The government said it was bringing in stake limits for them because they are \"a higher-risk gambling product associated with large losses, long sessions, and binge play\".",
      "But in a new documentary series on Radio 4, Stewart Kenny, who resigned from the board of the betting company in 2016, says the speed of the games is what makes them addictive.",
      "He says the gap between investment and results being \"only seconds\" means punters can \"repeat the dose\" at high speed.",
      "In addition to this, he says the machines provide \"plenty of noise and plenty of colours\", as well as near misses, which are \"fundamental to gambling addiction\".",
      "The Department for Culture Media and Sport said the Gambling Commission introduced requirements that changed speed and intensity of slots in 2021: \"This included a minimum speed of 2.5 seconds per spin, a ban on autoplay and features that increase play intensity, such as turbo, quick spin and slam stop, or give the illusion of 'false wins'.\"",
      "Gambling companies make a significant proportion of their profits from online slots. Acording to market data collected by the Gambling Commission up to December 2024, the profits from slots increased 15% year on year to a new high of \u00a3709m. The number of spins increased 9% in the previous quarter to a new peak of \u00a323.9bn.",

      "Stewart Kenny resigned from the board of Flutter, saying he felt the company was not doing enough to protect vulnerable customers using its websites.",
      "Mr Kenny no longer has any financial interest with the company, and receives no payment for taking part in the programmes.",
      "In the documentary series Changing the Odds, Mr Kenny teams up with journalist Lydia Thomas, who has reported on the betting industry for a decade, to chart 20 years since the 2005 Gambling Act. The act paved the way for the UK betting industry to revolutionise gambling and take it online.",
      "For many years, the UK has been the biggest online betting market in the world \u2013 with the industry worth \u00a315.6bn. Only recently has the United States overtaken as more states allow online gambling.",
      "And it is the move online that sparked Mr Kenny's worries when he was sitting on the board. He believes the internet by its very nature can be addictive and that adding online casinos in the mix has \"made the cocktail too strong\".",
      "Mr Kenny still enjoys gambling, and regularly bets on horse and dog racing, which he believes is a less addictive gambling product. But he criticises the industry for encouraging sports betting punters to move to online slots.",
      "\"I have always said I have been very relaxed about my kids opening up betting accounts. But, I would be horrified if my grandchildren open up a betting account.",
      "\"What the bookmakers do is, when you open a betting account at the age of 18 to have a bet, and you're a kid and you want to have a fiver on your local team, within 48 hours, the bookmakers will try and suck you into the highly addictive online casino by sending you free spins.\"",
      "Mr Kenny believes it is up to the government and regulators to make gambling safe.",
      "\"There's a balance here. If you want to bet, you should be allowed to bet. It's a free society. So you don't want to interfere with people's entertainment too much.  It's so easy to blame the betting companies. This is a matter for legislators.\"",
      "Flutter Entertainment said it recognised that the gambling industry had not always got things right in the past but said its UK business had \"evolved significantly in the years since Stewart's involvement, which ended over eight years ago\".",
      "It said in that time, it had been \"a vocal and constructive supporter\" of the Gambling Act Review and the white paper, while \"leading the industry on proactive change\" with its introduction of deposit limits for under-25s and the setting of a \u00a310 stake limit on online slot products.",
      "\"We were pleased that some of these measures were publicly praised by Stewart as we respect his views.\"",

      "Some of those oil and gas pipelines are under-used and could be repurposed to carry greener fuels like hydrogen or exhaust gases for disposal.",
      "One just transition campaigner - who wants to ensure people and communities are treated fairly during the change away from fossil fuels - told me that if you were looking for the ideal place to set up these new green industries, you would choose Grangemouth.",
      "With the refinery closing, the main industry at the plant is now the production of chemicals like ethylene, polyethylene and polypropylene, which are components in the manufacture of plastics.",
      "These are then used for a whole range of applications, from making PPE to cabling, building materials and dyes.",
      "But this is incredibly energy-intensive, making Grangemouth the most polluting site in Scotland.",
      "The cluster of business there were responsible for 7.2% of Scotland's emissions in 2022, according to the Just Transition Commission.",
      "Prioritising a carbon capture and storage scheme - called the Acorn Project - is seen as a vital step in reducing Grangemouth's carbon footprint.",
      "It would catch planet-warming gases before they enter the atmosphere, pipe them underground to St Fergus in Aberdeenshire and store them in depleted oil and gas wells under the North Sea.",
      "But the project missed out on the first round of UK government support and campaigners want a clear signal that it will be given full backing by ministers.",
      "One thing that is definitely going to be created at Grangemouth is a new import terminal to replace the closing refinery.",
      "That would mean the procession of tankers which deliver aviation fuel to Edinburgh Airport can be maintained.",
      "In the longer-term, a facility creating sustainable aviation fuel could use some of the skills of the existing workforce.",
      "It is on the political agenda.",
      "Since January, the UK government has mandated that 2% of UK jet fuel has to come from renewable sources - which means alternatives to fossil fuels. This will increase to 10% by the end of the decade.",
      "But there's been no commitment that Grangemouth will be the source of some of that fuel.",
      "The other potential options include a \"biorefinery\" which could use waste whisky and food in chemical production processes to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.",
      "Advanced recycling methods could also be developed which would produce high quality plastics able to be used in food packaging and health care.",
      "That would involve a process called \"cracking\" which breaks down the products into smaller molecules.",
      "It's a technique which is already carried out on fossil-fuel based chemicals at the Ineos site.",
      "Hydrogen will also play an increasingly important role in our economy over the coming decades as a clean energy, particularly in heavy transport and industry.",
      "Scotland's abundance of wind means generating green hydrogen from electricity has huge potential.",
      "Some hydrogen is already made at Grangemouth, and plans have previously been announced to significantly increase production by 2030.",
      "That hydrogen would then be used to displace gas to generate high temperatures in industrial processes.",
      "Grangemouth, however, does not currently have the right conditions to store hydrogen in significant quantities.",
      "Large underground salt caverns are ideal - but the nearest potential sites are in East Yorkshire and Cheshire.",
      "So either expensive storage units would have to be built above ground near Grangemouth, or the hydrogen would have to be piped hundreds of miles.",
      "The Project Willow report, when it's released, is expected to put figures to some of these propositions.",
      "It will cover the likely costs, the potential jobs and the value to the Scottish and UK economies.",
      "That will not be the end of the matter; in fact, it's barely the beginning.",
      "Attracting the public and private investment will be far more challenging than outlining the options.",
      "But talking about it early - and in a co-ordinated way - will surely maximise the chances of securing a long-term future for a site so intrinsically linked with fossil fuels."

    "story": [
      "Ieva Mackeviciute lives in Kaunas, Lithuania's second-largest city, but works in the capital, Vilnius.",
      "She takes the hour-long train into her company's Vilnius office once a week, where she uses a car-sharing service to drive herself to client meetings throughout the day.",
      "Through an app, she can find where the nearest available car is, and drive off, paying by the minute - a system she finds convenient and flexible.",
      "Some providers even include parking in the price, and if she takes an electric car, it's even better, as they qualify for free parking around the city.",
      "\"The ability to move around a big city quickly, and not worry about parking, helps me have a more flexible schedule and better control of my time,\" says Ms Mackeviciute, 30, who works in communications.",
      "Yet despite being a regular car-sharing user, Ms Mackeviciute still owns a car in Kaunas, which she regularly uses for visiting family living in the countryside. And even while working in Vilnius, occasional issues with car sharing can disrupt Ms Mackeviciute's day.",
      "\"It can sometimes be hard to find a vehicle nearby. And sometimes, when you're in a rush the closest vehicle can have not one, but a few, maintenance lights on. While I do understand that fleet maintenance is a challenge, especially as a business grows, it is still disappointing,\" she says.",
      "When it comes to cars, most people feel like Ms Mackeviciute - they still want to own one.",
      "Despite brands like Zipcar being around since 2000, industry data shows car sharing to still be a niche service.",
      "There are just two million car sharing users in the UK, while around 35 million people still own a car.",
      "\"Consumers are still tied to exclusive access to their car. Clear scepticism about the ability for car-sharing options to provide a car to hand whenever they need it, and concerns about hassle, are the biggest issues,\" explains Felicity Latcham, associate partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants.",
      "\"This concern gets greater for families and older individuals who are particularly tied to being able to leave things in their vehicle.\"",
      "But the growing electrification of the car sharing market might be attractive to younger, eco-conscious drivers.",
      "In a 2023 McKinsey survey of 4,000 people in the UK, France and Germany, 32% of those in the Gen Z bracket said they wanted to use shared-mobility schemes more, wishing to reduce private car reliance.",
      "The survey also suggested that 50% of Gen Z also want their next car to be fully electric.",
      "The car-sharing industry is heading in that direction.",
      "Almost a quarter of European car sharing companies now offer a 100% electric fleet.",
      "A third of shared cars in the EU are electric vehicles, data from Statista shows. Meanwhile, Zipcar doubled its electric fleet in 2023 in the UK, with plans to go fully electric this year.",
      "Spark, the Lithuanian car-sharing company Ms Mackeviciute frequently uses, launched with a fully electric fleet in 2016.",
      "Its recent performance has been encouraging, with a registered user base up by 30% since 2022, and annual trip numbers up by 11%.",
      "Since July last year, users of the Bolt ride-sharing app - the Baltic states' answer to Uber - can also now book Spark vehicles.",
      "Spark founder Nerijus Dagilis is confident that the increasing availability of electric vehicles can get more people on board with car sharing, especially with the support of the city of Vilnius, which, on top of free parking for electric cars, allows them to be driven in bus lanes, too.",
      "\"Our customer pool is increasing every month, so that means we are creating a certain value for people, who prefer electric cars for sustainability reasons. It's becoming a daily habit for many people, especially families - we see more of them downsizing from two cars to one,\" says Mr Dagilis.",
      "\"The performance of electric cars is improving quickly, so while there is still some scepticism, as soon as an electric car can drive 500km on a single charge, I think people's anxiety should disappear.\"",
      "Canada's Kite is a car sharing company with a twist. Not only is it fully electric, but it partners with property developers to offer Kite cars to apartment building residents as either an included service, or for a subsidised membership fee, akin to a gym or pool.",
      "A Kite hub is installed usually on the first level of the building's underground parking, for residents to book their choice of up to 40 fully charged electric cars.",
      "In some locations, Kite users have the option of returning their car to a different building. Kite is currently live in 20 buildings across Canada, with plans to add 70 more in the next 18 months, adding properties in the US and Europe.",
      "Kite founder, Scott MacWillam, says the convenience and saving they offer to prospective residents is a draw.",
      "\"There's a growing trend of more people with a busy city life wanting a 'turnkey' lifestyle. Real estate developers see this as a sales and marketing advantage,\" says Mr MacWilliam.",
      "\"Residents can save money by kind of ditching their privately-owned car, and that cost saving means they now can afford to live in the building, or maybe they can even upgrade their apartment.\"",
      "Mr MacWilliam says Kite gives thousands of building residents the chance to try both car sharing, and an electric vehicle, without any pressure or commitment, in a package where everything is covered - from charging and maintenance to insurance.",

      "Deena Ghazarian had only been in business for a year when the trade policies of President Donald Trump's first term of office sent her company into a tailspin.",
      "It was 2019 and her California-based firm, Austere, had just agreed to supply several big US retailers with its high-end audio and video accessories that are largely manufactured in China.",
      "Then Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on China, and overnight Deena found herself paying a 25% surcharge on every cable and component she imported \u2013 up from zero previously.",
      "She was forced to absorb the costs and for a while thought she would go bust.",
      "\"I literally thought I am going to start and end a business in less than a year,\" she says. \"I had spent all this time, money and effort, and to have something like this blindside you was shocking.\"",
      "The firm pulled through, but like numerous other US businesses it now finds itself in a strikingly similar situation.",
      "Since returning to office in January, Mr Trump has raised tariffs on all goods imported from China by 20%, and put taxes of 25% on Canadian and Mexican products, only to delay some of them until April.",
      "The president says he wants to force these countries to do more to stop flows of illegal drugs and migrants into America, to bring more manufacturing back to the US, and to address what he sees as unfair trade imbalances.",
      "But the duties are much broader in scope than last time, when they were phased in gradually and many products were granted exemptions.",
      "Goods like smartphones, desktop computers and tablets are now incurring tariffs for the first time, while taxes on others have climbed higher.",
      "\"US importers have to pay these taxes not the exporters,\" says Ed Brzytwa, vice president of international trade at the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), a North American trade body that represents more than 1,200 tech firms.",
      "\"It's American businesses and consumers who will suffer.\"",
      "Businesses like Ms Ghazarian's are particularly exposed. China is still the number one supplier of electronic products to the US, with imports totalling $146bn (\u00a3112bn) in 2023, according to official data.",

      "'I will have to raise prices by 10%' - toymakers warn of tariff pain",
      "China retaliates against US tariffs - but it also wants to talk",
      "While many American companies like Austere have diversified their supply chains away from China since Mr Trump's first term, countries such as Thailand, Taiwan and Vietnam still do not offer the same manufacturing capabilities and expertise.",
      "At the same time, the US president is now targeting Mexico - another major electronics supplier. And while domestic manufacturing in the US has increased, partly due to tariffs, it is still limited by higher costs and stricter regulations.",
      "\"Yes, Apple now makes some iPhones in India and [the Taiwanese chipmaker] TSMC has been diversifying to Arizona,\" says Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC.",
      "\"But China is still a massive part of the supply chain. Relationships with new suppliers take time to develop, they are costly to develop.\"",
      "Research suggests that companies pass on a large proportion of the costs of tariffs by putting up prices. Earlier this month Corie Barry, boss of US electronics retailer Best Buy, said that the \"the vast majority\" of the new tariffs will \"probably be passed on to the consumer\" because vendors in the industry have such small margins.",
      "In February, Taiwanese firm Acer said the price of its laptops would likely rise by 10% based on the 10% duties in place on China at the time, while US group HP has warned its profits would be lower because of the tariffs.",
      "Ms Ghazarian says she may have to raise her prices this year, but worries it could backfire. \"There is a price point where the customer is satisfied with the value of goods provided.",
      "\"The moment I shift above that I start to lose customers. High inflation has squeezed Americans.\"",
      "During Mr Trump's first term, companies such as Apple successfully secured exemptions for products, and we may yet see carve-outs.",
      "Insiders have also suggested Mr Trump views tariffs as a negotiating tactic and could ease them if he wins concessions, as he did when China agreed to buy more American goods in a deal reached in 2020.",
      "Fears of a US economic slowdown could also make him change course.",
      "For the time being, though, tensions look likely to escalate. China, Mexico and Canada have vowed to retaliate against any US duties imposed on them, and this week Mr Trump threatened to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium only to row back at the last minute.",
      "He plans to impose \"reciprocal tariffs\" on the rest of the world soon, and threatened tariff increases of up to 60% on Chinese goods while on the campaign trail.",
      "There is a risk this could drive up the price of tech goods around the world if China is forced to relocate manufacturing to countries where labour costs are higher. Moreover, countries may hit back with tariffs on imported US technology.",
      "Ms Ghazarian says she is worried but at least she's prepared this time. Like many other US business-owners she bulk-ordered extra inventory before Mr Trump took office, and is storing it in her east coast warehouse.",
      "She hopes that will get the company through the next year until it can \"pivot\" again.",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Mar 2025 22:16:48 GMT",
    "summary": "The former banker may not have been elected to office before, but his experience managing global economic crises will help.",
    "story": [
      "The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, became Canada's prime minister after he was sworn in on Friday. He will need all his experience handling global economic crises as the country faces a trade war launched by US President Donald Trump.",
      "Mark Carney was the first non-British person to become governor of the Bank of England in its more than 300-year history when he took the job in 2013.",
      "He had previously steered his home country through the Great Recession as the governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, before being poached for Britain's top banking job.",
      "But unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he won the contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau handily. Now, he must lead the country through one of its toughest challenges yet - an escalating trade war with its biggest trading partner, the United States.",
      "But holding on to the role of PM will be a fight in and of itself. Canada's next federal election is scheduled for this October, but many expect Carney to call it soon after he is sworn in.",
      "Carney wins race to succeed Trudeau as PMA simple guide to Canada's federal electionHow Trump's threats have changed everything about Canada's politics",
      "Carney wins race to succeed Trudeau as PM",
      "A simple guide to Canada's federal election",
      "How Trump's threats have changed everything about Canada's politics",
      "Early life and childhood",
      "Although Carney has travelled the globe, working in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.",
      "With three out of four grandparents hailing from County Mayo in Ireland, Carney holds both Irish and Canadian citizenship. He got British citizenship in 2018, but recently said he intends to relinquish his British and Irish citizenship because he thinks the prime minister should only hold Canadian citizenship.",
      "The son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey.",
      "In 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University, where he wrote his thesis on whether domestic competition can make an economy more nationally competitive - a subject that is sure to come up as Canada works to make internal trade easier in the face of American tariffs.",
      "\"Mark was an extraordinarily versatile student, rapidly mastering new approaches, perspectives and challenges,\" recalled his former doctoral supervisor Meg Meyer, in a press release sent by the university after Carney won the leadership race.",
      "\"These skills will undoubtedly serve him well as he leads Canada during these turbulent times.\"",
      "Previous experience",
      "In 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.",
      "In 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.",
      "Although central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them.",
      "That move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.",
      "He is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.",
      "In 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.",
      "Interest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.",
      "Confusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a moniker that stuck around long after the original controversy died down.",
      "Unlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.",
      "In 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.",
      "Before the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.",
      "In the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.",
      "He described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.",
      "The Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.",
      "His final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\".",
      "Crossing paths with Trump",
      "Carney's time at the Bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.",
      "From 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board, which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.",
      "He was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.",
      "Although he kept his thoughts on the US president to himself at the time, he has been much more frank in recent days.",
      "After Trump made repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state, he was less diplomatic, comparing him to the villain in the Harry Potter books.",
      "\"When you think about what's at stake in these ridiculous, insulting comments of the president, of what we could be, I view this as the sort of Voldemort of comments,\" Carney said.",
      "\"Like I will not even repeat it, but you know what I'm talking about.\"",
      "He seems prepared to dig in his heels as the trade war continues, noting he would continue to impose counter-tariffs \"until the Americans show us respect \u2026 and [make] credible and reliable commitments to free and fair trade\".",
      "Political ambitions",
      "The Liberals have reportedly courted him for a decade, but until recently the 59-year-old had brushed off the idea.",
      "\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.",
      "Things changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.",
      "Reports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.",
      "Freeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.",
      "\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\"",
      "Still, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada.",
      "The Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.",
      "They have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets, which Carney currently does not need to do as he is not an elected member of parliament.",
      "His team has said he will comply with all applicable ethics rules and guidelines once he is prime minister.",
      "Where does Carney stand on issues?",
      "In addition to Carney's get-tough-on-Trump approach, he has proposed a number of policies to address at-home issues as well.",
      "He is known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.",
      "One of the most contentious parts of Trudeau's platform has been the carbon tax, which saw Canadians pay a tax on carbon emissions, and receive a rebate. Conservatives repeatedly promised to end the tax, which they say does little for the environment.",
      "Shortly after being sworn in, Carney signed an order-in-council scrapping the tax from 1 April. \"This will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians,\" he said.",
      "On immigration, Carney has advocated for a cap on current immigration targets, in order to ensure that Canada's housing and healthcare systems are not stressed. The issue had come to the fore last year, with Trudeau lowering targets amid critics saying the country's immigration system was overrun.",
      "His biggest mission, he had said, will be to keep Canada's economy growing, despite slowed trade with the US.",
      "There are early signs that Carney's rhetoric is being well received - a recent poll, conducted before Carney became PM, indicated Canadians believe Carney is better able to deal with Trump than Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre."

      "While education unions have supported the government in some areas, they have also been critical in others, including on the proposals for new Ofsted report cards.",
      "But Ms Spielman claimed the changes to Ofsted were being done \"to please unions\", by making it \"much less likely that inspection will detect weaknesses or convey a negative message.\"",
      "Speaking to Radio 4's World at One programme, Ms Spielman said she thought it was \"surprising\" that education unions were approached for comments on stories about Ofsted.",
      "A government source's comment, which said Ms Spielman should \"spend less time criticising the reforms this government is bringing, and more time reflecting on her failure at Ofsted\", was also put to the ex-Ofsted boss during the interview.",
      "She responded by saying it was \"fascinating because that's a union line\", reiterating her criticism of the organisations which she says have been \"attacking accountability and attacking inspection from long before I became chief inspector\".",
      "In The Telegraph piece, the ex-Ofsted head also says the government's proposals for academies will \"cut the autonomy of schools and school groups right back\".",

      "When the Scottish Funding Council publishes its delayed annual assessment of the sector, it is expected to say that more than half of Scotland's institutions are running a deficit.",
      "They all face similar pressures, but some have done better than others at foreseeing the danger and planning for it.",
      "So what are the challenges facing the sector in Scotland?",
      "The level of student funding",
      "Scottish students get \"free tuition\". Undergraduates don't have to pay fees for their courses if they can secure one of the limited number of places.",
      "The Scottish government has committed to pay the tuition costs, which it does through the Scottish Funding Council (SFC).",
      "Universities Scotland, which represents the 18 institutions, says that level of funding has not kept pace with inflation or with the number of students.",
      "It says there has been a decade of under-investment by the Scottish government in the higher education sector.",
      "The figures differ according to how you measure inflation, but it told MSPs that funding per student had fallen by 39% in real terms.",
      "It says research funding from the government is down by 43% since 2014/15, and its members say Scotland has lost much of the sizeable lead it held over the rest of the UK in attracting research funding.",
      "While the Scottish government proudly points to its provision of \u00a31.1bn for the sector, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has noted that the \u00a31,810 fee per student has not changed for 15 years.",
      "But that's far from all the money allocated. With block grants for tuition, the average being spent per student was calculated as \u00a37,530 this year.",
      "Using a different measure for inflation, the IFS says spending per student is down by 22% since 2013. Half of that reduction has been in the most recent three years, when costs have been rising most steeply.",
      "The IFS said that while the surplus of Scottish universities stood at 5.2% in 2022/23, it has concerns that finances are getting rapidly worse.",
      "How does that compare with elsewhere?",
      "Undergraduates in the rest of the UK are required to pay fees, often building up debt to do so.",
      "These are capped at \u00a39,250 per year for a typical three-year degree course - less for part-time students, more for accelerated courses.",
      "Students from the rest of the UK must pay an equivalent amount to study at Scottish universities, although the cost is usually spread over the four years of a Scottish degree.",
      "While the number of Scottish students is capped, there is no limit on the number of undergraduates from elsewhere. As a result, they became an important source of income for Scottish institutions.",
      "However, the growth in funding per student has not kept up with inflation. It has been increased only slightly from \u00a39,000 in 2012.",
      "The maximum annual fee is going up next year by nearly \u00a3300 to compensate universities for the higher cost of employer National Insurance contributions from next month, but there is no equivalent increase for Scottish students funded through Holyrood.",
      "Because England and Wales have more open competition to recruit students - and attract their fee income - there have been sharper divergences in financial fortunes than you'll see in Scotland, where the SFC allocates places to institutions.",
      "The more prestigious Russell Group of research-rich universities have gone after the students that would previously have gone to middle-ranking institutions, leaving the latter financially flailing.",
      "The vice-chancellors of English universities complain that fees fail to cover the cost of educating undergraduates. Yet the total they receive is around \u00a32,500 per student higher than the funding for Scottish-based students doing courses in Scotland.",
      "With these shortfalls in income compared with costs, there had to be a new stream of funding, and that's where foreign fees have become a vital part of the solution - and the problem.",
      "The overseas recruitment drive",
      "UK universities have been on a recruitment splurge to draw in students from other parts of the world, charging them much higher fees than UK students \u2013 from about \u00a310,000 up to \u00a340,000 per year.",
      "The number of European Union students fell by half as Britain left the EU, but the numbers from other countries have soared. The share of foreign students has risen from one in 20 in the 1990s to more than one in four.",
      "For those with a prestigious reputation, including Scotland's older universities, the share of foreign students has been closer to 40%.",
      "The most recent figures show there were about 750,000 international students studying in the UK in 2022/23 - with the number of new arrivals almost doubling in the space of five years.",
      "This has brought controversy - about the quality of learning, standards of English language ability, and the surge in demand for student accommodation.",
      "It has also brought vulnerability if the demand for places falls away.",
      "Growth in foreign fees swelled university income, and the increase was most marked as the pandemic ended, reaching a peak in 2022.",
      "It fell by 5% the following year, and is thought to have continued falling - quite steeply for some universities.",
      "The volatility of that income stream reflects many international factors.",
      "A growing concern about universities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, becoming too dependent on Chinese students saw recruitment shift to other countries.",
      "Chinese recruitment remains high, but has stopped growing, and post-grads are down.",
      "Nigeria was one new target, encouraged by the UK government.",
      "But the market there depends on the strength of the Nigerian currency, which fell sharply and cut off the number of people who could afford to come to the UK.",
      "Dundee was one of the universities hit hard by the falling numbers.",
      "Numbers were also affected by visa restrictions.",
      "In order to meet pressure to cut immigration numbers, the Conservative government increased the annual fee for using the NHS and made it more difficult for graduates to reach the pay threshold for a work visa after they graduate.",
      "It also restricted visas for students' family dependents.",
      "The biggest cash cow among foreign students has been in taught post-graduate degrees.",
      "These tend to be older students with families who won't come if there is a restriction on partners and families.",
      "Some international markets are sensitive to the signals sent out by the UK government, including India, where UK visa changes and reports of attacks on Indian students in British universities can make the front page of national newspapers.",
      "A further factor is that competition has been growing.",
      "The UK used to see its main competitors for English-language degrees as the US, Canada and Australia.",
      "That now extends to about 20 countries, including Ireland and Singapore and extending to polyglot Holland and Germany.",
      "What about spending?",
      "To increase capacity for teaching and studying for all those additional students, universities have had to increase spending.",
      "And with more foreign fee income, they have been investing in buildings and equipment as well as more staff.",
      "Ten years ago, Edinburgh University had 35,000 students and an income of \u00a3819m, with expenditure of \u00a3793m.",
      "In 2023/24, student numbers were nearing 50,000 and income was at \u00a31.43bn, with expenditure of \u00a31.3bn.",
      "That level of increased activity is harder to handle where there are so many moving parts to the income.",
      "It becomes impossible if financial planners fail to see the risk that the growth in foreign student fee income can stall and reverse, while they continue with expansion plans, prestigious new buildings and more debt.",
      "So what happens next?",
      "An external inquiry will be carried out at Dundee University, which is expected to highlight major management failures and a shonky IT system for student recruitment.",
      "Its interim principal, Prof Shane O'Neill, says the financial crisis has \"challenged us to ask some very fundamental questions about the size, shape, balance and structure of the university\".",
      "Dundee's response points to job losses and a narrowing of course options for students. Fewer modules will be offered, and that may also be the case elsewhere.",
      "Subjects that don't bring in enough income will be vulnerable.",
      "Language departments are a common target when cuts are needed. There's not much research or consultancy income, and there's competition from commercial software.",
      "The Scottish Funding Council faces deficits in the majority of the institutions it funds, and pressure from Holyrood ministers to make sure the pain is eased and that no institution is allowed to fail.",
      "But money is tight, and there are limited powers to intervene because these are autonomous institutions.",

      "Edinburgh University to seek \u00a3140m in savings",
      "Record foreign student numbers at Scottish universities",
      "Some see sense in mergers, cutting out the duplication of back office costs and the notoriously high salaries of principals.",
      "Others see shared services and teaching space as the way to go, with other universities, colleges and with other organisations such as the NHS.",
      "And there may be value in a crisis such as this.",
      "With a period of rapid growth now ended, one principal told me this is the time to reflect on what university is for: how to re-shape Scotland's universities towards the needs of the next 20 to 30 years, using artificial intelligence in learning and teaching.",
      "On funding, that principal warned said we need to move on from the simplistic \"fee or free\" argument over tuition costs in Scotland.",
      "What comes out of that reflection matters profoundly to Scotland, to its people and to its economy.",
      "In the various scenarios for Scotland's economic future, universities form the one sector where there is world-leading expertise and reputation.",
      "Scotland punches above its weight. But if it is to continue doing so, it will have to change."

      "Thieves smashed their way in and ripped out the functional toilet, hours after a glamorous launch party at the Oxfordshire stately home in September 2019.",
      "Michael Jones was found guilty of planning the burglary. Fred Doe was convicted of conspiring to sell the gold, while Bora Guccuk was cleared of the same charge.",
      "The BBC can now reveal the full criminal history of the heist gang's kingpin James Sheen. He has been jailed at least six times since 2005 and has led organised crime groups that made more than \u00a35m from fraud and theft - money authorities have largely failed to recover.",
      "Five men were seen on CCTV carrying out the heist, but only two - Sheen and Jones - have ever been caught.",
      "Within days the artwork, called America, had been broken up and sold on, the court heard. None of the gold has been recovered.",
      "Sheen, from Oxford, pleaded guilty last year after police found his DNA at the scene and gold fragments in his clothing. He was described in court as the \"common denominator\" - having been charged with planning and transferring criminal property, as well as burglary.",
      "The 40-year-old, who has previous convictions for fraud, theft and a firearms offence, was arrested four weeks after the heist, on suspicion of planning it, but he was released on bail.",
      "He continued his crime spree, including a similar raid eight months later at the National Horseracing Museum in Newmarket, Suffolk, where he stole gold and silver trophies worth \u00a3400,000, none of which have ever been recovered.",
      "The court heard how the gang had meticulously researched the burglary at Blenheim Palace - a UNESCO World Heritage Site to the north of Oxford.",
      "Jones, 39, from Oxford, visited the palace for a second time the day before the heist, and took pictures of the golden toilet, a lock on the door and a nearby window. Later that day, the artist Maurizio Cattelan hosted his launch party.",
      "A few hours after guests left, the gang used two stolen cars to ram through palace gates, smash a window, wrench the toilet from its fittings and roll it out of the building, the court heard.",
      "The BBC has discovered they exploited a series of security flaws at the palace - where there were no guards patrolling the exhibition or the grounds. Overnight, the artwork was locked behind a thin wooden door and was not monitored by CCTV.",
      "External CCTV showed the gang were inside for less than three minutes. Palace chief executive Dominic Hare told the BBC the \"facts speak for themselves\".",
      "\"We took possession of this precious item and managed to lose it within a day,\" he said, because the thieves simply \"drove through the gates, smashed through the window, they picked it up and they went\".",
      "Police arrived within five minutes of the alarm sounding but the thieves had already left.",
      "As a work of art, the toilet weighed 98kg (216lbs) and was insured for $6m (\u00a34.8m). Gold prices at the time would have meant the metal alone was worth \u00a32.8m, the court was told.",
      "It is not known exactly when the gang broke the toilet into smaller pieces, or whether they melted the gold themselves. But the court heard within two days of the heist, Sheen was looking for buyers, offering gold at about \u00a325,500 per kilo.",
      "He contacted Fred Doe, and, in a series of coded voice messages, asked for help in selling it.",
      "Doe, 36, from Windsor and also known as Fred Sines, admitted trying to help Sheen sell the gold but said he had no idea it was stolen.",
      "Jurors heard the pair arranged to meet with jeweller Bora Guccuk, and visited him at his shop in Hatton Garden - London's famous jewellery quarter, negotiating a price for about 5kg of gold.",
      "Mr Guccuk, 41, from west London, denied he knew it was stolen and the court heard negotiations broke down and no sale took place. He was cleared by the jury.",
      "However, Sheen admitted selling some of the stolen gold in Birmingham, within a fortnight of the heist.",
      "A photograph found by police on his phone showed a carrier bag stuffed with cash, which was sent on WhatsApp with the message \"520,000 ha ha ha\".",
      "Four weeks after the heist - on 16 October 2019 - Sheen was arrested. But he was released on bail and over the next eight months was involved in at least 12 more crimes, including the burglary at the National Horseracing Museum.",
      "He was only later charged when police confirmed his DNA on a sledgehammer found inside the palace, and in a stolen car abandoned nearby. Fragments of gold were also found some time later on clothing at his home.",
      "Thames Valley Police said the forensic analysis of Sheen's clothing and DNA was \"complicated work, which often takes time\", adding that as a result there was not enough evidence to charge him at the time of arrest and they could not continue keeping him in custody.",
      "His offending only came to an end when he was recalled to prison in June 2020 for breaching the terms of an earlier release. He had been let out of prison on licence in 2017, halfway through a 14-year sentence for his role in the shooting of two innocent bystanders.",
      "Sheen and his brother had chased another family through the streets of Coventry in 2009, firing a shotgun from the window of their Range Rover.",
      "A young couple on their way home from a night out were caught in the crossfire. One still has pellets lodged in their face. The victims said they were \"haunted\" by that day more than 15 years later.",
      "In a statement to the BBC, the victims and their families said Sheen was \"a serious danger to the public and should never be allowed out of prison again\".",
      "Despite spending about half of the past 20 years in prison, Sheen has personally made about \u00a32m from his crimes, not including the golden toilet heist. Gangs he led have made more than \u00a35m profit, according to archived court records accessed by the BBC.",
      "In the months before and after the Blenheim heist, Sheen was leading another group of thieves that made more than \u00a32.6m by blowing up cash machines, stealing high-value farm machinery and other thefts across the south and east of England, including the Newmarket museum raid.",
      "He was sentenced to 17 years for these offences in 2022, more than a year before he was charged with the Blenheim heist. After that trial at Oxford Crown Court, a judge ruled Sheen had personally made \u00a3900,000 from the crimes - but was ordered to pay back just \u00a31.",
      "Thames Valley Police said it obtained a confiscation order for a \"nominal sum\" of \u00a31, which allowed a \"parallel financial investigation\" to be carried out. It said that - five years after the crimes - financial investigations were \"actively ongoing\u2026 for a significant amount in assets\".",
      "Former home secretary David Blunkett said Sheen was \"making a monkey of the system\", adding, \"we can't allow that to continue\".",
      "In 2002, Lord Blunkett introduced the Proceeds of Crime Act - a flagship Labour policy that was supposed to show that crime did not pay by giving police and courts new powers to recover criminals' assets.",
      "But the peer said the act was failing, and believed it was because police, enforcement agencies and the judiciary have never been given adequate training or funding to properly implement the law.",
      "\"The only thing that will deter a prolific offender who's doing very well out of the proceeds of crime is to get those proceeds back, it's as simple as that,\" he said.",
      "Following the verdicts, Shan Saunders of the Crown Prosecution Service said the raid had been \"carefully planned and executed\".",
      "\"But those responsible were not careful enough, leaving a trail of evidence in the form of forensics, CCTV footage and phone data,\" he added.",
      "\"While none of the gold was ever recovered \u2013 no doubt having been broken up or melted down and sold on soon after it was stolen \u2013 we are confident this prosecution has played a part in disrupting a wider crime and money laundering network.\"",
      "Det Supt Bruce Riddell of Thames Valley Police said it had been a \"complex investigation\".",
      "\"It is clear that Sheen has only one intent, and that is to do whatever he can to steal money and property regardless of the impact it has on others and communities.",
      "\"Jones was clearly keen to assist Sheen in the burglary, carrying out the recces on his behalf and it is our case that he benefitted financially from the crime and we believe he also was present at the raid.\"",
      "Figures obtained by the BBC showed Sheen's case was not an isolated example.",
      "We asked each police force in England and Wales for their 10 biggest proceeds of crime investigations from 2024 where there had been convictions. Thirty forces responded, providing a snapshot of 300 high-value cases.",
      "In total, in the 300 cases, criminals had made more than \u00a3300m - but had been ordered to repay just 10% of that figure. Many who had made millions of pounds from crime were ordered to pay back just tens of thousands - often as little as \u00a31.",
      "The Home Office said its criminal asset recovery system was regularly reviewed, adding that the Crime and Policing Bill - which is being considered by Parliament - would \"bolster the current system\" and \"improve the recovery rate of assets\".",
      "It said when police could not find a criminal's assets, courts could grant confiscation orders for a \"nominal sum\" - often \u00a31 - but this could be increased if assets were ever uncovered.",
      "Thames Valley Police said it was committed to \"bringing offenders to justice\" and had carried out a \"thorough and extensive investigation\" into the Blenheim heist.",
      "It added that a \"financial investigation will be conducted alongside our partners to recover any assets from the theft\", but said this could only begin now the trial had finished.",
      "Sheen, Jones and Doe will be sentenced at a later date.",

    "summary": "Herbie Hancock on 80 years of playing the piano and being this year's recipient of the Polar Music Prize.",
    "story": [
      "Herbie Hancock is an all-time jazz great, so it is reassuring to hear that he suffers from the same modern day procrastination problems as the rest of us mere mortals.",
      "\"I fall into rabbit holes on YouTube. A lot of them. New music writing software, things about health, tech things.\"",
      "That is his explanation as to why he has not made an album for 15 years.",
      "\"I get victimised by it, so to speak, but that's life,\" he chuckles.",
      "Speaking from his house in west Hollywood, the ridiculously sprightly 84-year-old pianist has never been afraid to embrace technology, but normally he is the one doing the mastering, not vice versa.",
      "Hancock's half century... and more",
      "Discovered by trumpeter Donald Byrd at the start of the 60s, Hancock signed to Blue Note Records, and wrote jazz standards including Watermelon Man, Cantaloupe Island and Maiden Voyage.",
      "In the 70s he was an early adopter of synthesisers, blending genres with the electro-funk classic Head Hunters.",
      "In the 80s, he had a bona fide worldwide hit single with Rockit after embracing turntablism and scratching, winning five awards at the first ever MTV Awards for its classic dancing robots video.",
      "Deee Lite's Groove Is in the Heart? The riff that drives that song is a sample from Hancock's Blow-Up soundtrack. Madonna, Janet Jackson and NWA are amonst the plethora of performers to have incorporated his music into their own.",
      "While as recently as 2008, he beat Amy Winehouse and Kanye West to win his first album of the year award at the Grammys.",
      "The reason we are talking is that Hancock has been announced as one of the recipients of this year's Polar Music Prize, the closest music has to a Nobel prize.",
      "Previous laureates have included Sir Paul McCartney, Dizzy Gillespie, Stevie Wonder, Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell and Quincy Jones.",
      "\"It's a huge, fantastic list of people I've admired,\" says Hancock before expressing particular delight that the saxophonist Wayne Shorter was chosen for the honour in 2017, six years before his death. Together they made up two fifths of Miles Davis's Second Great Quintet.",
      "Working with Miles Davis",
      "Joy comes over Hancock's face when reminiscing about the period between 1964 to 1968, when he toured the world with the man Rolling Stone magazine called \"the most revered jazz trumpeter of all time\".",
      "\"I was always frightened playing with Miles,\" he laughs.",
      "\"It was very intimidating. I always wanted to be at my best, because I admired him so much. He was such a big part in my own development as a musician.",
      "\"It was fear on one hand. On the other hand, it was exciting. And when things were at their best, it was really inspiring. When were all in sync, that made life worth living.\"",
      "On the pianist's favourite distraction, YouTube, there is a clip that has been viewed almost five million times, showing a furious Davis, on stage in Milan in 1964, stopping his improvised solo to send dagger eyes at Hancock.",
      "Online there is much debate as to what caused this trumpet temper tantrum. But for Hancock, this was a regular occurrence.",
      "\"A lot of times I would be surprised at what would upset Miles, what would make him a little angry. I didn't always know. He was not always easy to figure out, so I got used to that slight discomfort,\" he says grinning.",
      "\"That's life. But I was always looking to learn from those discomforts.\"",
      "And when he embarks on his European tour this summer, which includes three UK dates at London's Barbican, Hancock will be thinking about another lesson he learnt from Davis - this one about the make-up of his audience.",
      "He adopts a low, deep whispering voice and does a full-on Miles Davis impression, recreating the conversation from the mid 1960s, when the trumpeter gave him a stern warning: \"If all you see are dudes in the audience, that means your music is dead.\"",
      "Herbie Hancock is pretending to be Miles Davis to an audience of me. It is a glorious moment.",
      "\"He used more expletives than I just did,\" Hancock chortles. \"But you get the idea,\" clearly enjoying his mimicry as much as I did.",
      "Hancock has been playing the piano for almost 80 years, but the instrument still gives him so much joy, that on occasion, during a session on the keys, he finds himself sobbing.",
      "\"If I've solved some kind of problem that I've had with the tune and made some kind of discovery that surpassed my expectations, I've been known to cry, to have tears coming down my face.\"",
      "I ask what kind of problem leaves him reaching for Herbie hankies.",
      "\"It's difficult to explain,\" he responds, \"But, trying to make something work out, where there's no easy answer. Where, 'this is not supposed to work', but 'how can I make it work?'\"",
      "It feels like we have been invited inside Hancock's brain and are seeing the cogs turn. At speed.",
      "He continues: \"There may be something that I want to connect, but all the ways I know of connecting them are not the solution. And I have to find some other means.",
      "\"And sometimes that [means] can come from looking at it in a different way. And not necessarily through music.\"",
      "This answer goes a long way to explaining the difference between someone who is a musical genius and someone who is not.",
      "Hancock went to college to study electrical engineering, so it is no surprise that he has taken a huge interest in the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI).",
      "He believes our fears about the technology are overblown, and says he prefers to \"embrace it\". Hancock acknowledges concerns that AI lacks an ethical framework but asks: \"Who are the worst examples of understanding ethics and being able to live a life with ethics? We, human beings, we're the worst, right?\"",
      "He is on a roll now.",
      "\"I have this feeling that AI is going to help us all understand and get closer to becoming more ethically responsible people that are helping each other, instead of hurting or killing each other. Helping the planet instead of killing the planet with environmental issues.\"",
      "And the man who once released an album called Future Shock, has some simple advice for us all.",
      "\"When I'm using ChatGPT or Siri on my iPhone, I always say thank you and they usually say, 'You're welcome.'\"",
      "\"I try to treat AI like it's human and it actually manifests itself in an extremely positive way and that makes me feel better.\"",
      "At the age of 84, Herbie Hancock is still determined to try and future-proof himself, by getting the robots on his side.",
      "Finally, I ask him a question on behalf of parents all round the world. My 11-year-old Charlie loves playing the piano, but hates practising. What advice would he give anyone in that situation?",
      "He nods.",
      "\"I understand your pain. I don't like practising either.\"",
      "Hancock, pauses and thinks before adding: \"But you know, I look at it as, 'OK, this is something, even if I don't want to do it, I need to do it.' And once I get into it, then I feel like I've conquered an obstacle in my life.\"",
      "He pauses again, before concluding: \"I don't always win that battle, but I've gotten to this point. So I guess I didn't lose a lot of battles.\"",
      "And has he practised today?",
      "\"No. I didn't today. And I probably won't.\"",
      "Once again he laughs, and with that he departs, ready for the rest of the day and to watch some more YouTube.",
      "Herbie Hancock will be presented with the Polar Music Prize  in Stockholm, Sweden on 27 May 2025."

    "summary": "The BBC said there had been a significant change in audience behaviour away from long-running shows.",
    "story": [
      "BBC Scotland is to scrap its flagship soap River City after more than 20 years.",
      "The drama which began in September 2002 will continue filming for another 12 months before airing its final series in autumn next year.",
      "The BBC said there had been a significant change in audience behaviour away from long-running series and towards shorter runs.",
      "It said total investment in drama would increase over the next three years with the focus on \"world-class productions\" that can be sold internationally.",
      "River City was set in the fictional west of Scotland area of Shieldinch and filmed on a specially-built set in Dumbarton.",
      "It was originally seen as a Scottish competitor to Eastenders and Coronation Street but was never shown on a UK-wide network.",
      "Stephen Purdon, who was nicknamed Shellsuit Bob in the early years of the show, is the only original member of the cast who still appears in the soap.",
      "In its early days, the soap attracted stars such as Stefan Dennis, from Neighbours, and Lorraine McIntosh from pop band Deacon Blue.",
      "Simon Webbe from pop band Blue also had a part in the show as well as young Sam Heughan, the actor who would go on to star in hit show Outlander.",
      "Singer Susan Boyle, broadcaster Lorraine Kelly and Radio 2 DJ Scott Mills are among the celebrities to have made cameo appearances over the years.",
      "BBC Scotland director Hayley Valentine said: \"The team have done a brilliant job and I know they have some big plans for the finale next year.",
      "\"But as viewing patterns change and competition intensifies, this is the right time to invest in the next generation of high-impact drama series from across Scotland showcasing storytelling across the UK.\"",
      "At the same time as announcing the end of River City, the BBC said three new dramas - Counsels, Grams and The Young Team - would create new opportunities across the independent TV production sector.",
      "It said total investment in BBC drama from Scotland over the next three years is expected to rise to over \u00a395m in total.",
      "As well as the new dramas, the BBC said that popular show Granite Harbour will return for a third series as well as Shetland coming back for its 10th series and Vigil for a third.",
      "Philippa Childs, head of the Bectu union, which represents TV crew, said the news was \"incredibly disheartening\".",
      "\"The loss of such a long-running production is devastating for the workers impacted and for the local industry,\" she said.",
      "\"As viewing habits change, broadcasters rightly have to make tough decisions, but it's imperative that the impact on the workforce and the diversity of the industry is accounted for,\" Ms Childs added.",
      "The BBC says the decision to bring River City to an end is driven by changing tastes.",
      "Audiences for soap operas and continuing dramas have been declining across the board.",
      "The focus is shifting towards shorter series which make a high impact.",
      "Shows such as Shetland can be \"appointment to view\" TV which are sold abroad, streamed for a long time and repeated on smaller channels.",
      "The falling audiences for soaps - along with the inflationary costs which have faced drama productions - have led to some hard decisions for commissioners, with daytime soap Doctors and the medical drama Holby City coming to an end.",
      "The challenge for the BBC will be to demonstrate that the resources freed up by this move are being spent effectively on other Scottish dramas.",
      "When the programme started in 2002, the hope was that River City would build a strong relationship with its audience  - especially those viewers who may not have felt well-served by the BBC in general.",
      "It is only natural some regular viewers and fans will be disappointed by today's decision.",
      "But there is also the question of the impact on employment - for actors, writers and production staff.",
      "Many of those who work on River City are freelancers.",
      "It will be vital for the BBC to demonstrate that other commissions balance out River City's loss and ensure there are still plenty of employment opportunities.",
      "It is likely to face scrutiny to ensure a creative decision which will disappoint some viewers does not prove to be bad news for the TV production industry."

    "summary": "The theft of an oil sketch from a stately home in Northamptonshire remained a riddle for 70 years.",
    "story": [
      "An Exeter University art historian has solved the 70-year mystery over the theft of an original oil sketch, by Flemish painter Anthony van Dyck, from a stately home in Northamptonshire.",
      "The Portrait of Wolfgang Wilhelm of Pfalz-Neuburg was stolen in 1951 from Boughton House, the home of the Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry.",
      "It was part of a collection - described as \"a puzzle missing a central piece\" - of 17th Century oil sketches that had been housed at the property since 1682.",
      "But the artwork's disappearance was only noted in 1957, when Mary Montagu Douglas Scott, Duchess of Buccleuch and Queensberry, visited one of Harvard University's galleries - and saw it on display.",
      "Now, thanks to an investigation by Dr Meredith Hale, senior lecturer in Art History and Visual Culture at the University of Exeter, the riddle of how the sketch made its way to the US via prominent members of the art world - including Christie's auction house in London - has been solved.",
      "Dr Hale noted how through \"new archival research in the UK, US and Canada\" she was able to \"reconstruct the painting's movements over three generations\".",
      "She said it \"passed through the hands of experts, conservators, auctioneers, dealers, and collectors from London to Toronto\".",
      "\"Not only do these sources reveal a dynamic picture of events as they unfold,\" she added, \"but they highlight the factors that contributed to the success of the theft, foremost among them the conceptual and material complexity of Van Dyck's iconography project - and the audacity of a thief cloaked in the respectability of expertise.\"",
      "The artwork has now been returned and the story of its journey has been chronicled in a new paper in the British Art Journal.",
      "Money for new curtains",
      "The thief, Dr Hale said, was Leonard Gerald Gwynne Ramsey, the editor of the journal The Connoisseur, and a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries.",
      "Ramsey visited Boughton in July 1951 with a photographer in order to gather material for a piece for the journal's year book.",
      "Among the objects housed at the property for safekeeping during the war were the 37 wooden panels from Van Dyck's unfinished iconography project.",
      "Each panel featured an oil-painted sketch of a prominent prince, scholar, military leader or artist, and would have been used to create prints for sale.",
      "Correspondence between Ramsey and art historian Ludwig Goldscheider revealed that the former intended to sell two paintings because he needed the money to buy new curtains.",
      "According to the research, Goldscheider supplied a certificate of authentication and the picture was sold anonymously at Christie's for \u00a3189 in April 1954.",
      "Dr Hale traced the sale of the picture, less than a year later, to an art dealer in New York, before it moved on to a second dealer who sold it for $2,700 to Dr Lillian Malcove; who in turn donated it to the Fogg Art Museum of Harvard University.",
      "In her paper, Dr Hale chronicles terse correspondences between the museum's art director, Professor John Coolidge, and Ramsey once concerns had been raised by the duchess.",
      "Ramsey, it shows, claimed he'd bought the picture from a market in Hemel Hempstead, and he also attempted to cast doubt on the authenticity of the picture.",
      "With doubts growing, the museum returned the picture to Dr Malcove in 1960, and after she died in 1981, it was donated to the Art Museum of the University of Toronto.",
      "Dr Hale said the findings have helped to \"resolve the question of whether this was the picture stolen from Boughton\".",
      "It resulted in the executive committee of the University of Toronto voting to return it to the Duke of Buccleuch, 73 years after it was stolen.",
      "\"Without this painting, the Boughton oil sketches were like a puzzle that's missing a central piece,\" said Dr Hale.",

      "In a bid to mitigate some of its financial problems, Village Roadshow is proposing to sell its extensive film library for $365m (\u00a3281m).",

      "Peck's review in the Times began: \"Wow. Just wow. I'm tempted to type out the word 'wow' a further 700 times or so, followed by, 'Don't miss Adolescence on Netflix,' and then be done with it.\"",
      "The Telegraph's TV critic Anita Singh said it was \"a devastating watch\", adding: \"It is a drama so quietly devastating that I won't forget it for a very long time.\"",

      "The New York Times' Margaret Lyons called it \"a rich work of social critique\", describing the standout episode, the third, as \"one of the more fascinating hours of TV I've seen in a long time\".",
      "On BBC Radio 5 Live's Must Watch, Hayley Campbell said the drama doesn't attempt to solve the problems it raises.",
      "\"It's bringing it up, it's looking at it. It's about the rise of misogyny, especially in young boys, brought about by people like Andrew Tate, who's namechecked in this, but only once. It's not about him.",
      "\"The drama is more about the horror of how little control you have over your kid and what they're doing on their phone.\"",

    "story": [
      "Cher Horowitz has brought her life of Beverly Hills high fashion, friendship and matchmaking to London's West End, as classic 1990s teen film Clueless has been given a musical makeover.",
      "Clueless has been brought to the stage by the film's original writer and director Amy Heckerling - who says keeping the 90s theme was integral to the show.",
      "Heckerling insists she has \"no interest in being modern\" - which will come as a relief to the audiences who grew up quoting \"As if!\" and aspiring to Cher's plaid and Prada-filled wardrobe.",
      "The story follows the life of the na\u00efve and lovably spoiled teenager, who plays matchmaker with her friends before ultimately finding love herself.",
      "An adaption of Jane Austen's Emma, Clueless captured the teen spirit of the 90s and inspired countless school dramas like Mean Girls, Gossip Girl and Legally Blonde.",
      "The stage version has songs in the form of an original score by singer-songwriter KT Tunstall.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, Tunstall says the film was \"omnipotent\" in the 90s and influenced everything from the clothes people wore to the music people listened to.",
      "The Scottish singer, best known for songs like Black Horse and the Cherry Tree and Suddenly I See, says working on the show was a \"dream project\".",
      "She says the original soundtrack was a big inspiration, and describes the music as \"a mixtape of all your favourite 90s bangers\".",
      "The process of creating the soundtrack for Clueless: The Musical was intense for Tunstall, who says it's no easy feat to add music to an adaptation of a film that didn't originally have it.",
      "\"You really have to think about whether a song fits the structure and flow of the story and whether it actually helps the audience understand the narrative better,\" she says.",
      "Heckerling says she actually wishes the film had been a musical because \"there were natural moments in the script where characters could have sung\".",
      "\"Those types of films weren't very common in the 90s but I'm glad we could add in music now,\" she says.",
      "Critics had mixed thoughts about the new songs - the Guardian called them \"disappointingly flat-footed\" in a two-star review and said the lyrics \"too often serve as exposition rather than raising the emotional drama\".",
      "Similarly, the Telegraph's Dominic Cavendish wrote that the show has \"numbers designed to sound in keeping with the period but which are so generic they don't ring with real-world authenticity\".",
      "But What'sOnStage praised Tunstall's \"infuriatingly catchy tunes\" and Glenn Slater's \"nifty, witty lyrics\".",
      "For Emma Flynn, who is making her West End debut as Cher, the music has another important function in the show - it allows characters to easily share their inner thoughts with the audience.",
      "\"In the film you hear these really funny inner monologues of Cher, but the great thing about this show is you can hear all of the character's thoughts, which makes you feel more connected to them.\"",
      "Flynn has been praised by critics, with the Evening Standard noting her \"powerfully-sung breakout performance\" and describing it as channelling \"both Alicia Silverstone in the original movie and Sabrina Carpenter today, while making the role entirely her own\".",
      "Co-star Keelan McAuley, who plays nerdy Josh, tells the BBC he loves the play's nostalgia factor.",
      "\"The flip phone was the most advanced technology they had in the 90s and there's something so enchanting about a time where there was no access to social media,\" he says.",
      "Nostalgia fest",
      "The show stays almost entirely true to the 1995 film, with everyone sporting the latest 90s fashions, carrying a glitzy pager, and listening to angsty teen bangers on a Walkman.",
      "While it may feel like a nostalgia fest, Heckerling admits she doesn't \"like to stick to real life\", and even her sunny film was far from the reality of what the 90s were like for most teenagers in LA, with race riots and other political problems.",
      "The Independent's three-star review says the show \"sticks to the original movie like chewing gum to the underside of a school desk\" at first, but changes tack by the second half.",
      "\"[Director Rachel] Kavanaugh and Heckerling gain the confidence to part ways a bit from the movie's script, and to let the story's heart show,\" Alice Saville wrote.",
      "For Tunstall, what sets Clueless apart from traditional rom-coms and high school dramas is that there isn't a typical villain and there's no nastiness or bad intentions from the main characters.",
      "Jane Austen famously thought her main character wouldn't be a widely liked heroine, but Tunstall says she is often people's favourite character because of her honesty and depth.",
      "\"People can relate to her on a deeper level, like how she is trying to process the death of her mother and help keep her family in order.",
      "\"Those themes are universal and that's what makes this story so enduring.\""

    "story": [
      "Netflix's latest big-budget film The Electric State, starring Millie Bobby Brown and Chris Pratt, is one of the most expensive movies ever made, and had some of the most scathing reviews in recent memory. But that doesn't mean it will flop.",
      "Film critics haven't minced their words when delivering their verdicts on The Electric State.",
      "It is \"a turgid eyesore\" and \"top-dollar tedium\", according to the Times. It's \"slick but dismally soulless\", declared the Hollywood Reporter, while the New York Times called it  \"obvious, garish and just plain dumb\".",
      "Paste pointed out its eye-watering budget, billing it as \"the most banal way you can spend $320m\". Warming to the theme, the magazine summed it up as \"one hell of an artistically neutered, sanitized boondoggle\".",
      "There have been some kinder reviews. Empire said it was \"breezily watchable\" and worth three stars, while the Telegraph awarded four stars to the \"Spielbergian treat\".",
      "But overall, its 15% Rotten Tomatoes score is a meagre return for any major film, especially one costing such a lot. The $320m (\u00a3247m) figure has been widely reported but neither confirmed nor denied by Netflix. It would make The Electric State the most expensive streaming film ever.",
      "Critics' opinions, however, have become more irrelevant in the streaming age. The bad reviews didn't stop The Electric State from going straight to number one on Netflix's chart after its release on Friday.",
      "It fits into Netflix making star-packed, entertaining and escapist movies that often get panned by reviewers - but are watched by hundreds of millions of subscribers.",
      "\"I would love to say that what I've written and what other critics have written will matter, but I just don't think it will,\" says Digital Spy movies editor Ian Sandwell.",
      "Sandwell awarded the film two stars out of five, noting that the action and visual effects are \"decent\", the robots are \"impressive\" and the finale is \"epic\".",
      "\"My main problem was they'd created this really impressive, visually spectacular world and then just told quite a generic seen-it-all-before story inside it,\" he says.",
      "Bad reviews might have put people off paying to see the film if it had been released in cinemas, he says. \"But on Netflix, I think it will still be absolutely massive. I don't think bad reviews will matter at all.\"",
      "While a critic's job is to analyse a movie, \"audiences probably do just want a big, spectacular blockbuster to watch at home, with two massive stars\", he adds.",
      "The Electric State follows Brown, Pratt and a succession of zany robots in an alternative version of 1990s America, where there has been a war between humans and intelligent bots.",
      "It also stars Ke Huy Quan, Stanley Tucci and the voices of Woody Harrelson and Brian Cox, and is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo - who have made four Marvel movies, including the wildly successful Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame.",
      "The Electric State is based on the graphic novel by Simon St\u00e5lenhag, although some critics pointed out that Netflix had missed the book's point about the perils of a consumerist society addicted to technology.",
      "The film is \"absolutely not\" value for money in terms of quality, says City AM's film editor Victoria Luxford.",
      "And it remains to be seen whether the film makes financial sense for Netflix, she says.",
      "The streaming giant's most popular ever film, 2021's Red Notice, has had 231 million views, according to Netflix's measurements.",
      "\"The Electric State will be hoping for that kind of performance, just as a $320m theatrically released movie would be aiming to break box office records,\" Luxford says.",
      "\"The higher the price, the higher the target for success, even with a business model as opaque as Netflix's.\"",
      "Red Notice, an action-packed art crime caper starring Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot and Ryan Reynolds, has a lukewarm 39% critics' score on Rotten Tomatoes - but a 92% audience rating.",
      "Other recent Netflix hits have been lapped up by viewers more than reviewers.",
      "Brooke Shields' lightweight multi-generational rom-com Mother of the Bride has a 13% critics' score, Jennifer Lopez's AI action thriller Atlas is on 19%, Cameron Diaz and Jamie Foxx's family spy escapade Back In Action has 29%, and Kevin Hart's heist comedy Lift is on 30%.",
      "They are enjoyable but forgettable - and easy to watch in the midst of potential distractions at home. The Hollywood Reporter described Atlas as \"another Netflix movie made to half-watch while doing laundry\" - summing up this new genre.",
      "In December, N+1 magazine quoted several screenwriters as saying a common request from Netflix executives is for characters to announce what they're doing \"so that viewers who have this programme on in the background can follow along\".",
      "\"Electric State does feel like that,\" Sandwell continues, \"where there are just random big dumps of the characters explaining exactly what's happened, sometimes something we've seen recently, just in case you're not following along.",
      "\"But it does depend on the movie.\"",
      "Netflix does have serious and critically-acclaimed movies, too, of course, but they are often not such crowd-pleasers. Emilia Perez, which led this year's Oscar nominations, has not troubled the Netflix global top 10 charts.",
      "Another critic, Gav Squires, says many of Netflix's films are \"very average\", but don't usually have such astronomical budgets as The Electric State.",
      "\"Netflix know what they're doing,\" he says. \"They know that people are probably watching on a second screen, they're not paying full attention. So when they're putting stuff out that costs $30m that people aren't really watching and is kind of average, I'm not too fussed about it.",
      "\"But when they're spending $320m on a movie, I start getting really angry. $320m would have paid the budgets for the last, I think, 10 best picture Oscar winners.",

    "summary": "Versace took over the Italian fashion house after her brother's untimely death and made it her own.",
    "story": [
      "As Donatella Versace steps down from designing after 27 years at the helm of the Italian brand, the fashion world has been reflecting on her achievements and what this means for the future.",
      "The 69-year-old took over the family business after her brother Gianni was murdered in 1997, with many unsure whether she had what it takes to steer the fashion house.",
      "Her appointment was seen at the time as \"a sentimental appointment by a shell-shocked family,\" the Guardian's fashion editor Jess Cartner-Morley wrote.",
      "But she proved the doubters wrong, anointing herself in the process as a global fashion icon.",
      "She leaves the job as \"one of the most successful female designers in modern fashion history\", Cartner-Morley added.",
      "New York Times fashion director Vanessa Friedman declared that Donatella \"wore her struggles - with personal tragedy, self-doubt, finding her creative feet, and drugs - with as much aplomb as her long platinum hair\".",
      "As singer and Versace ambassador Dua Lipa put it in a tribute on Instagram: \"No-one does it like you @donatella_versace!!!!!\"",
      "She did it all with \"grit, kindness and, even in the troughs of addiction, an infectious sense of humour\", the Telegraph's head of fashion Lisa Armstrong wrote.",
      "However,  Versace \"never set a fashion agenda\" under Donatella as it had under her brother, Armstrong added - but her \"nose for a story could nevertheless produce fashion magic\".",
      "Her magic moments included dressing Jennifer Lopez in the green jungle dress at the 2000 Grammy Awards, generating so much interest that Google created its image search function.",
      "As former Miu Miu design director Dario Vitale takes over, Donatella will now become an ambassador for the Versace brand.",
      "The big question is what that means for both the company and Donatella herself, who has poured her life into the company, dealing with grief, drug addiction and divorce along the way?",
      "Speculation is growing over whether the company will be sold to the Prada Group by its current owner Capri Holdings.",
      "Capri paid \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.67bn) for the fashion house in 2018 and owns other companies such as Michael Kors.",
      "Prada has been credited with developing a strong vision in recent years, which has translated to healthy sales during a climate of slowdown in the fashion economy.",
      "Imran Amed, CEO of The Business of Fashion, told the BBC World Service that \"Versace is one of the most iconic brands in the fashion industry\" and has \"a very clear design and brand DNA\".",
      "He believes it \"would be a mistake to dilute\" the company or merge it with another, so hopes that if Versace is bought, the vision is to grow it into something bigger.",
      "Amed said Versace makes about $1bn (\u00a3772m) a year, while rivals such as Louis Vuitton and Gucci make $20bn (\u00a315.5bn) and $8bn (\u00a36.2bn) respectively.",
      "Some have touted that Versace's failure to expand into the beauty industry and other affordable luxuries is why it has been left behind financially by its rivals.",
      "Luisa Zargani, Milan bureau chief for Women's Wear Daily, said Donatella had probably stepped back because she knows a \"moment of creative upheaval\" is coming for the brand.",
      "\"There has been a lot of talk about the future of Versace and for the last few years she has been very involved with all her charity work, so she will continue to do [that] while continuing to be part of the Versace family,\" she told BBC News.",
      "Zargani said Donatella \"has always championed young designers\" such as Christopher Kane, Jonathan Anderson and Anthony Vaccarello, and she expects her to continue to be involved as Vitale moves from Miu Miu.",
      "\"[Vitale] is a very solid designer, he's very steady, very creative and has been key in building Miu Miu, so I'm sure she has had her input in this,\" Zargani added.",
      "Friedman said Donatella had probably been thinking about her succession plan \"for a while\".",
      "\"There's a lot of turmoil in the luxury industry at large, and she may have decided it was time for a change,\" she told the World Service's Newshour.",
      "Friedman called her replacement \"a very talented designer\", adding: \"He's been working behind the scenes at Miu Miu for two years and it has been the single hottest brand in fashion over that time period.\"",
      "Vitale has helped steer the brand to record profits, which she said was \"mind boggling\" when \"every other brand in the fashion world has declined during that period\".",
      "Versace herself can be proud of how she has successfully transformed from her brother's muse to a fashion powerhouse, Friedman added.",
      "\"She wasn't the person toiling away with pattern-making back in the atelier, but she really did prove herself, and more credit to her.\"",
      "Donatella's final show earlier this month was staged in a tram station in northern Milan, drawing some of the world's biggest celebrities - once again showcasing how her star power has helped keep the brand a talking point in the fashion world.",
      "Friedman said the show, which featured the brand's signature bold aesthetic, \"reflected the fuzziness around the fate of Versace\" by lacking any clear direction.",
      "Her exit was not announced at the show, but many speculated it was coming because the collection featured references to her late brother's final designs from autumn/winter 1997.",
      "Everyone is now talking about what Donatella does next.",
      "A book or documentary about her would undoubtedly be well received. She is also an advocate for several women's and LGBTQ charities, so could increase her input into those in the future. But she will continue to cast a shadow over the catwalk."

    "summary": "Measures include restricting eligibility for disability payments and cutting benefits for health conditions.",
    "story": [
      "The government has unveiled sweeping changes to the benefits system, aimed at saving \u00a35bn a year by 2030.",
      "Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall said the overhaul would create a more \"pro-work system\" to encourage people to take up jobs, while protecting those who cannot work.",
      "The changes will make it harder for people with less severe conditions to claim disability payments. Extra benefit payments for health conditions will also be frozen for current claimants and nearly halved for new applicants.",
      "And people aged under 22 could be prevented from claiming universal credit top-up payments for health conditions.",
      "The government has not given a precise breakdown of the forecast savings but the bulk are expected to come from changes to eligibility for disability payments.",
      "The overall benefits bill will continue to rise - but Kendall told the BBC the changes would put welfare on a more \"sustainable footing\" by getting people into work.",
      "Spending on health and disability-related benefits has ballooned since the Covid pandemic, and has been forecast to increase from \u00a365bn a year currently to \u00a3100bn by 2029.",
      "The proposals are the result of months of work but they have become more urgent with the worsening economic backdrop, which has made it more difficult for the government to meet its self-imposed rules on borrowing and spending.",

      "At-a-glance: Key changes to benefits in welfare shake-up",
      "What are Pip disability payments and how are they changing?",
      "Charities and some Labour MPs are worried benefit cuts will push disabled people into poverty.",
      "The government responded to their concerns by scrapping plans to freeze personal independence payments (Pips), which provide extra living costs for people who have a long-term physical or mental health condition.",
      "But Kendall said eligibility for Pips - the main disability benefit in England, Wales and Northern Ireland - would be tightened from November 2026.",
      "It will become harder to qualify for the daily living component of Pip, which is for people who need help with everyday tasks and starts at \u00a372.65 a week.",
      "There will be no change to the mobility component, for those who need help getting around.",
      "Kendall told the BBC details on how many people would be affected would be set out alongside Chancellor Rachel Reeves' Spring Statement next week.",
      "The Resolution Foundation think tank has estimated between 800,000 and 1.2 million people could lose support because of restrictions on claiming Pip.",
      "Kendall also announced work capability assessments, which are used to determine whether someone is fit to work and if they can receive additional benefits payments because of a health condition or disability, would be scrapped in 2028.",
      "She said the assessments were \"complex, time-consuming and often stressful for claimants\", as well as being based \"on a binary can-can't work divide\".",
      "In the future, financial support for health conditions will only be available through the Pip assessment, based on the impact of someone's health condition rather than their capacity to work.",
      "Reassessments to determine whether someone is still eligible for benefits will increase, although those with the most severe conditions that will never improve will not be reassessed.",
      "From April next year the extra amount of universal credit for a health condition or disability will be frozen for existing claimants until 2029/30 and cut by almost half for new claimants.",
      "There will be an additional premium for people with severe, lifelong conditions that mean they will never work.",
      "Meanwhile, there will be a permanent, above-inflation rise to the standard allowance of universal credit \u2013 equivalent to a \u00a3775 annual increase in cash terms by 2029/30.",
      "The government will also introduce a \"right to try\" to guarantee that people who try out a job will not lose their existing benefits if it does not work out.",

      "Faisal Islam: A million people will lose thousands after benefit changes",
      "The Disability Benefits Consortium, which represents more than 100 charities and organisations, said: \"These immoral and devastating benefits cuts will push more disabled people into poverty, and worsen people's health.\"",
      "The SNP said the measures would \"harm the most vulnerable\" and \"mark the start of a new era of austerity cuts\".",
      "Debbie Abrahams, the Labour MP who chairs the Commons work and pensions committee, argued there were \"more compassionate ways to balance the books rather than on the back of sick and disabled people\".",
      "However, other Labour MPs agree with the government that there is a moral case for reforming the welfare system to encourage people into work.",
      "The Conservatives said the changes were \"too little, too late\" and needed to be \"tougher\".",
      "Shadow work and pensions secretary Helen Whately asked why the government was only planning to save \u00a35bn annually, when the total bill for health and disability benefits is forecast to rise to more than \u00a3100bn a year by 2029/30.",
      "Liberal Democrat work and pensions spokesman Steve Darling said: \"If the government was serious about cutting welfare spending it would get serious about fixing health and social care and the broken Department of Work and Pensions.\"",
      "Some of the changes will require new legislation, raising the prospect of a rebellion by some Labour MPs during votes in Parliament.",

      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson told BBC Panorama Covid had led to a \"serious and profound shift\" in attitudes to attendance. She said lockdowns had cast \"a long shadow\" over the life chances of the youngest children.",
      "The latest statistics for persistent absence show 15% of primary children in England have missed at least one in ten days of school this school year - up from about 8% before Covid.",
      "It comes as the gap between the poorest students and other pupils had mainly narrowed before the pandemic, following years of effort by schools.",
      "However, the report suggests it is getting worse. The gap - which is measured using GCSE results - would reduce from 19 months to 15 months of learning if school attendance was the same for all pupils, it says.",

      "The government provides it with money and tells it what its priorities are for the health service - for example, that might be cutting waiting times or improving cancer survival rates.",
      "NHS England's role is to funnel the money it is given into different parts of the health service and work out how to juggle resources in order to bring about the change the government wants to see.",
      "In 2012, NHS England was given more independence by the Conservative-led government. They said doing so would prevent politicians from interfering too much in how front line services are run - but critics say that change has made it harder to carry out reform or drive improvement.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer believes that overhauling management structures will put NHS in England \"back into democratic control\" and free up money for front-line services.",
      "NHS England is also responsible for other functions like overseeing training and collecting data, as well as managing GP services.",
      "There are separate organisations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, so these changes only impact England.",
      "Did this decision come out of the blue?",
      "Within the NHS and Westminster, the writing has been on the wall for NHS England for some months.",
      "Even in the latter years of the Tory government, health ministers expressed frustration that they were not in charge of the day-to-day running of the health service.",
      "When Labour came into power, it was clear Health Secretary Wes Streeting wanted more control of the NHS and saw a lot of duplication and bureaucracy.",
      "NHS England's chief executive Amanda Pritchard recently said she would step down at the end of the March and a number of her senior leadership team have followed suit.",
      "In that respect, it was clear there was going to be significant reform - but this is as big a change as you could possibly get at the heart of the NHS management structure.",
      "What is a 'quango' - and why do ministers think 'bureaucracy' is a problem?",
      "These are two words we have heard the government use a lot when setting out why it is scrapping NHS England and bringing the health service under closer government control.",
      "In this context, bureaucracy is a stand-in word for a system that is particularly complicated, or requires excessive amounts of administration, paperwork, regulations or layers of management.",
      "Starmer made it clear he thinks this sort of admin is getting in the way of delivering health services.",
      "We also heard him describe NHS England as the \"world's largest quango\" - a term that stands for Quasi-Autonomous Non-Governmental Organisation.",
      "Could Starmer's regulation shake-up mean a 'bonfire of the quangos'?",
      "In short, quangos are bodies like regulators and advisory groups, which are funded by taxpayers but not directly controlled by central government. They do things on behalf of the government, but are not directly controlled by ministers.",
      "They range from big organisations like NHS England, Network Rail and the Environment Agency to smaller ones like the British Film Institute and Gambling Commission.",
      "Their numbers have fallen by more than half since 2010 because David Cameron's coalition government abolished nearly 300 - but there are still more than 300 across the UK.",
      "Labour has set up more than 20 since winning the election last July, including Great British Energy and Skills England.",
      "The total budget for quangos in 2022/23 - when the latest figures were published - was \u00a3353bn.",
      "Will there be more control over decision-making and budgets locally?",
      "We do not yet know all of the detail about how health services in England will be managed in the future but it is likely that some of the responsibilities NHS England currently holds will be devolved down to regional bodies.",
      "One of the arguments being made about NHS reform is that if you move decision-making down to a local level and nearer to patients, it will be health leaders who are more attuned to the needs of patients in the area making those calls.",
      "They will know what local populations need and where the weaknesses are - and that, in theory, could improve services for patients in different parts of the country.",
      "Will this mean an increase in funding to the NHS and better access to medicines?",
      "Thursday's announcement was not about funding - that is expected in the summer.",
      "We already know NHS is getting an uplift of about 3-4% next year and we do not yet know what spending will look like beyond that.",
      "But government sources believe scrapping NHS England will save the government \u00a3500m a year.",
      "On access to medicines, it is the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence - which is separate from NHS England - which sets the guidelines on what treatments are judged affordable and cost effective.",
      "When a new drug is produced by the pharmaceutical industry, the institute will decide if the NHS can afford it and whether it is better than other drugs that are used.",

      "A cancer charity has said it is \"angry and frustrated\" that ministers and health officials have not approved the provision of a life-extending prostate cancer drug through the NHS in England.",
      "The drug, abiraterone, has been available in Scotland and Wales for two years for high-risk patients whose cancer has not yet spread, but not in England and Northern Ireland.",
      "In a letter to Prostate Cancer UK, seen by the BBC, Health Minister Karin Smyth said the decision by NHS England, following a lengthy review, was \"based on overall affordability\" and that \"it would not be appropriate to intervene\".",
      "The government said urgent advice had been requested on the issue.",
      "The charity said it was a \"dire and urgent situation in England\" with \"a bureaucratic blockage denying men this treatment\".",
      "A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"We understand the frustration and upset of some patients who cannot access this potentially life-saving treatment. Ministers have requested urgent advice on the issue.\"",
      "Although not a cure, abiraterone can help stop prostate cancer spreading to other parts of the body.",
      "In England and Northern Ireland, the drug is only approved for men with very advanced prostate cancer which has spread already.",
      "In Wales and Scotland, people with the disease that has not yet spread can also get it.",
      "Research has shown that for these earlier stage patients, the survival rate after six years is improved and that the drug halved the rate of progression of the cancer.",
      "The charity says many lives could be extended by the drug, given the findings from a trial called Stampede, published in 2022.",
      "It found improved odds of survival among men given the drug alongside usual care, and concluded that abiraterone should be considered a new standard treatment.",
      "According to figures from NHS England, each year about 8,400 patients have high-risk prostate cancer that has not yet spread.",
      "Using the Stampede assumptions, 672 of those men could die prematurely without access to abiraterone.",
      "In October 2023, BBC News spoke to Giles Turner, a retired banker living in Sussex. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer earlier that year but was told that abiraterone could not be obtained on the NHS in England.",
      "He chose to pay for treatment with the drug at \u00a3250 a month. He told us then that he felt \"very fortunate\" to be able to afford it, but outraged for others who could not.",
      "At the time, NHS England said it was reviewing the drug's use for a wider range of men.",
      "However, in December 2024 it told Prostate Cancer UK that \"it has not been possible to identify the necessary recurrent headroom in revenue budgets\".",
      "Because abiraterone is a generic drug which has gone \"off patent\" and is licensed for only one group of prostate cancer patients, there is a complicated process to get it approved for wider use.",
      "Each year, NHS England can make \"discretionary\" investment decisions with a specialist advisory group, but it has chosen not to for this drug.",
      "Smyth's letter earlier this month said the process had to look at \"the overall budget impact of introducing a new treatment based on patient volumes\", and ministers would not intervene.",
      "Mr Turner said he was \"stunned\" that nearly one-and-a-half years after the BBC report, NHS England had not caught up with NHS Scotland and NHS Wales.",
      "He has spent \u00a320,000 so far on his treatment, and said he felt it was wrong that while expensive new patented drugs treatments could be funded, abiraterone - costing the NHS \u00a377 per pack per month - could not be."

    "story": [
      "The chair of NHS England has said he does not disagree with the abolishing of the organisation - although he warns that the buck will now stop with ministers.",
      "\"There will no longer be a separate vehicle that can be pointed [at] to say that's what got it wrong,\" Richard Meddings told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend, in the first interview with a senior official from the organisation since it was announced it would be abolished.",
      "Earlier this week the government confirmed the administrative body would be swallowed up by the Department of Health and Social Care. It will not affect patient care in hospitals, GP practices, and other health organisations but it will change how the NHS is run.",
      "Mr Meddings, who is due to step down at the end of this month, acknowledged that ministers wanted to be involved in the running of the NHS, but argued there had been a subtle form of micromanagement.",
      "\"At times, some weeks, almost 20 new instructions, commissions coming from government and ministers into the system,\" he said.",
      "Streeting admits 'risk of disruption' in NHS overhaul",
      "He also defended the idea of quangos \u2013 the term used to describe publicly funded organisations at arm's length from the government. \"I've worked with six secretaries of state and complete changes of ministers. So there is an argument for a construct that would separate the delivery vehicle from government.\"",
      "The advantage, he said, is that \"it brings in a steady engagement from relevant expertise on a particular topic. And the difference from the political world is.... they don't all necessarily come with relevant experience to run and oversee those areas\".",
      "And he argued that NHS organisational changes can't do much to change the underlying health of the population: \"The NHS deals with whoever or whatever comes through the gates in whatever condition. And many of the conditions of poor health are driven by factors outside the NHS.\"",

      "The organisation, said the source, had become a bureaucracy that was \"intellectually stagnant\" and that its position interacting with both the health service and ministers \"wasn't right\".",
      "Ministers have argued that cutting around 9,000 jobs with the shift of NHS England into the Department of Health would free up resources for frontline services, perhaps as much as \u00a3500 million a year. Having two organisations often duplicating work, they say, led to wasted time and needless costs.",
      "But one NHS source noted that the government claimed credit for the fall in the overall waiting list for planned treatment since the election and a two million year-on-year increase in the number of appointments and operations \u2013 performance delivered on NHS England's watch.",
      "The same source pointed out that \"with decrepit hospital buildings a new leadership structure won't make it any easier to carry out operations and care for patients\".",
      "These are huge structural changes for the leadership of the NHS and health administration in England. But they will take time to implement.",
      "Moving two large organisations into one and implementing 9,000 redundancies will take up a lot of management time and there are warnings of possible distraction from the day to day running of services. Patients won't see much difference for a while yet.",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Mar 2025 06:06:29 GMT",
    "summary": "The debate has sparked a wider dilemma about the broader purpose of welfare",
    "story": [
      "In the next 24 hours and then over the following fortnight up until the Spring Statement, the government is going to talk a lot about a broken welfare system that is failing the people who use it, the economy and taxpayers.",
      "Taking a tough call on fixing it goes against the instincts of much of the Labour Party and has already sparked an internal backlash that could rise to ministerial level, as well as protests.",
      "The government is making two key related judgements. The first is that the country cannot afford to sustain recent ballooning increases in the health-related benefit bill and caseload, in particular for mental illness.",
      "At the same time, it will argue that a job is the best medicine.",
      "Underlying this is an assumption that a health-related benefits system that was built-up to deal with industrial injuries can't apply to the post-pandemic service economy workforce.",
      "The net result is likely to be significant changes to Personal Independence Payments, aiming to reduce eligibility for the highest levels of payments, especially among those of working age with mental illness.",
      "In addition, there will be a levelling of the generosity of the health component of Universal Credit. This will save billions of pounds, and about a billion of that will be reinvested in trying to help get those capable of part-time work some help for a partial return.",
      "Mapping welfare trends",
      "The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is rolling in real-time data. \"Cluster analysis maps\" reveal to ministers exactly who is claiming out of work benefits and where they are.",
      "As the numbers continue to increase, the data is being cut by sector, postcode, age and type of illness. Every pattern is being analysed.",
      "The idea was that the data would firstly offer the government insight into how it could make billions of pounds of cuts to a rapidly growing bill in order to help the Chancellor meet her self-imposed government borrowing rules.",
      "Secondly, it was meant to point to more fundamental reforms to welfare, also designed to temper the same ballooning rise in the costs of dealing with ill health among the working population.",
      "The data has thrown up answers.",
      "That poor mental health is driving the rise in claimants is clear. To a lesser extent, so too is the role that raising the state pension age has played, with many thousands who would previously have been retired now claiming health-related benefits.",
      "But it has also thrown up a major question too: does cutting welfare to incentivise people to work more hours in fact do the opposite - nudging them out of the workforce altogether and ultimately increasing the benefit bill?",
      "If this is the case - and it is by no means a universally accepted interpretation of what has happened - then the question is whether further cuts could in fact increase the numbers claiming? And should Labour instead invest in getting people back into work?",
      "Growing sickness",
      "When I visited a job centre in Birmingham alongside the Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall in the Autumn, I was taken aback by how the work coaches were talking as much about health as about work.",
      "\"There's a lot of mental health, depression and anxiety,\" Qam told me.",
      "GPs have reported that their surgery time is dominated by trying to work out whether their patients are \"fit for work\". Roughly 11 million fit notes are issued every year in England alone, with 93% assessing the patient as \"not fit for work\". That has doubled over a decade. In the latest quarter, 44% were for 5 weeks or more absence.",
      "From that pool of growing in-work sickness, a significant proportion ends up on some form of incapacity benefits. The Treasury's bill for health and disability benefits, which was \u00a328bn in the year before the pandemic, is now \u00a352bn a year. It is forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to hit \u00a370bn by the end of the decade.",
      "The pure financial aim here is to \"bend the curve\" down to nearer \u00a360bn in that period. This means restricting both the generosity and eligibility of some - or all of such - payments. It could require a wholesale cash freeze so that benefits do not rise with inflation, for example, or the abolition of entire categories of recipients.",
      "'Deaths of despair'",
      "An Institute for Fiscal Studies report published last week showed that wider measures of mental ill health have rocketed since the pandemic. Between 2002 and 2024, the number of 16-64-year-olds claiming disability benefits for mental or behavioural health conditions increased from 360,000 to 1.28 million.",
      "Every day in 2023 there were 10 extra \"deaths of despair\" (defined as deaths from alcohol, drugs or suicide) in England and Wales than the average between 2015 and 2019. Average sickness absence rates across the whole economy remained structurally higher than pre-pandemic.",
      "Of particular concern is how this affects young people. In a recent report DWP adviser Prof Paul Gregg points to the \"incredibly low\" chances of sustained returns to the workforce once a person has been on incapacity benefits for two years.",
      "About two fifths of new incapacity benefit claimants under 25 came directly from education. The latest DWP analysis shows these trends are now closely related to broader socio-economic vulnerabilities such as limited education and also with precarious sectors such as retail and hospitality.",
      "The question that remains is whether so many people really are more sick - and what role (if any) is played by the reduction in stigma around mental health.",
      "But then there is the question of how to address it.",
      "Overly binary",
      "Another major factor is that rise in the state pension age, which the DWP calculates, resulted in 89,000 older workers instead claiming health-related benefits. However, the sharp increase in claimants of such benefits since the pandemic is not only attributable to ageing populations or increasing mental health diagnoses.",
      "Research suggests there are significant systemic and policy-driven causes. At its heart the problem is perceived to be that the current welfare structure has become overly binary, failing to accommodate a growing demographic who should be able to do at least a bit of work.",
      "This rigidity - what ministers refer to as a \"hard boundary\" - inadvertently pushes individuals towards declaring complete unfitness for work, and can lead to total dependence on welfare, particularly Universal Credit Health (UC Health), rather than facilitating a gradual transition back into employment.",
      "This has been bad for the economy, for employers, terrible for the public finances, and deeply concerning for the career prospects of individuals.",
      "History helps here. Health-related benefits are often a disguised form of unemployment. The caseload for incapacity benefits (which include not just UC Health but previous incarnations) since the 1970s shows the UK heading for a record of one in 12 adults of working age in receipt.",
      "But this is not the first such build-up. It happened in the late 1980s when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister, and it was reversed in the early 2000s under New Labour.",
      "The launch in 1986 of Restart Programme, a forerunner to JobSeekers Allowance modelled on Ronald Reagan's policies in the US, helped return many claimants to the workforce but also pushed a staggering number into incapacity claims.",
      "Over the decade and a half of this policy, there was a 1.6 million increase in people in receipt of the benefit. But at the time this migration from claimant unemployment into incapacity was apparently a deliberate strategy, as it helped deal with headlines about \"three million unemployed\".",
      "A middle ground",
      "The government has not yet published its analysis on the jobs market, but Prof Gregg's early thinking was made clear in a report for the Health Foundation. He argued that, historically, the welfare system responded effectively through a middle ground that allowed individuals to combine part-time work with partial welfare benefits. He puts this down to reforms introduced in the early 2000s, such as tax credits.",
      "This is essentially the crystallisation of Iain Duncan Smith's critique of then chancellor George Osborne's welfare cuts of 2016. He told me at the time that they were \"deeply unfair\" on working people and the vision of a proper welfare-to-work scheme \"could not be repeatedly salami-sliced\".",
      "Some argue that those reforms created a situation where individuals, unable to sustain full-time work, gravitate towards more generous health-based welfare program.",
      "Crucially, claims began to rise in 2018. At the DWP ministers have tried to research the reasons behind the increase in caseload - and found that about a third of the increase can be explained as the predictable consequence of policy or of demographics.",
      "Prevention rather than cure",
      "With an ongoing flow of new claimants arriving in the system (nearly half a million in the last financial year) the onus is now on finding a prevention rather than a cure.",
      "And this is where it becomes tricky - one suggestion involves eliminating the current welfare trap by reintroducing intermediate support for part-time work. However, that requires extra funding, as well as a way of providing more personalised job searches and better mental health support.",
      "Another option is passing responsibilities to employers. In the Netherlands, employers bear significant responsibilities and financial costs if they fail to adequately support employees facing health challenges. In the early 2000s, the Dutch also had very high levels of incapacity but they now report employment rates of 83%.",
      "The structure of the jobs market in the UK makes that challenging to replicate - for example there are more insecure zero hours contracts.",
      "And given that businesses feel under pressure from National Insurance rises and a slow economy, could they really be cajoled into helping?",
      "Faster cuts",
      "The questions arising from the data will matter for the economy, for the public finances, our health, and young people's careers and livelihoods, at a time of considerable change.",
      "Fundamentally, it is a question of what the benefit system is for, at a time when illness is being redefined, and when the trends are, frankly, scary.",
      "Then there is the question of whether the public wants to pay even higher taxes in the hope of delivering long-term gain. Welfare-to-work programs can pay for themselves eventually, but the Government feels it needs to book faster cuts.",
      "That's because all of this is in the context of what \"fiscal headroom\" the government did have against the Chancellor's self-imposed borrowing targets being wiped out since the Trump shock to the world economy, the Budget and the announcements of extra European defence spending.",
      "But government insiders are at pains to argue that the primary motivation for any cuts is not regaining the extra room for manoeuvre. \"We don't need the OBR to tell us that we need to fix welfare to get people back to work. We don't need the OBR to tell us we need to make the NHS more productive. And we don't need the OBR to tell us that the taxpayer should be getting more value for money,\" a source told me.",
      "\"Headroom or no headroom the Chancellor is determined to push through the change we need to make Britain more secure and prosperous.\"",
      "Ultimately, the economic imperative is clear - to bring a cohort of young people suffering a combination of mental ill health and joblessness back into work.",
      "And the government believes there is no way of doing this without, at least at first, hurting the incomes of ill people. There is going to be quite the backlash from disability charities, and in turn from backbench Labour MPs.",

      "The changes will make it harder for people with less severe conditions to claim disability payments. Extra benefit payments for health conditions will also be frozen for current claimants and nearly halved for new applicants.",
      "And people aged under 22 could be prevented from claiming universal credit top-up payments for health conditions.",

      "Kendall also announced work capability assessments, which are used to determine whether someone is fit to work and if they can receive additional benefits payments because of a health condition or disability, would be scrapped in 2028.",
      "She said the assessments were \"complex, time-consuming and often stressful for claimants\", as well as being based \"on a binary can-can't work divide\".",

    "story": [
      "David Lammy has said he \"could have been clearer\" in his comments about Israel blocking aid to Gaza and if the action broke international law.",
      "Answering questions in the Commons on Monday, Lammy twice stated Israel's 16-day blockade preventing humanitarian supplies into Gaza was a \"breach\" of international law.",
      "This led to the prime minister's official spokesperson reconfirming that the government's position is Israel was \"at risk\" of breaching humanitarian law.",
      "Lammy told Bloomberg it was a \"matter for the court\" to decide if international law had been broken.",
      "Why has Israel bombed Gaza and what next for ceasefire deal?",
      "Is the war starting again in Gaza?",
      "Asked if he regretted his statement, Lammy said it was \"difficult to see how denying humanitarian assistance to a civilian population can be compatible with international humanitarian law\".",
      "The row over his comments came as Israel launched its biggest wave of air strikes on Gaza since the ceasefire began.",
      "The Hamas-run health ministry said over 400 people had been killed, with Benjamin Netanyahu warning it was \"just the beginning\".",
      "Since 2 March, Israel has stopped all food, fuel and medicine entering Gaza in an attempt to force Hamas into offering new concessions.",
      "Asked about the aid blockade by Labour MP Dr Rupa Huq, Lammy said on Monday: \"This is a breach of international law. Israel quite rightly must defend its own security. But we find the lack of aid \u2013 it's now been 15 days since aid got into Gaza -unacceptable, hugely alarming and very worrying.",
      "\"We urge Israel to get back to the number of trucks we were seeing going in - way beyond 600 - so that Palestinians can get the necessary humanitarian support they need at this time.\"",
      "Lammy told MPs he was \"a little jetlagged\" having returned to the UK from a G7 meeting in the US only hours before his Commons appearance.",
      "Later in the same debate, ex-Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn pressed Lammy to call Israel's aid blockade and bombing of the Gaza Strip a breach of international law.",
      "Lammy said: \"I did say in my contribution that Israel is in breach of international humanitarian law.",
      "\"The decision that I made back in September to suspend arms sales, which was largely because of that breach.\"",
      "He was referring to the government freezing 30 arms export licenses to Israel after a review ordered by Lammy found a \"clear risk\" they could be used in violations of international humanitarian law.",
      "Asked about Monday's comments that appeared to go further, the prime minister's official spokesperson said: \"Our position remains that Israel's actions in Gaza are at clear risk of breaching international humanitarian law, and we continue to call the government of Israel to abide by its international obligations.\"",
      "They added: \"The government is not an international court, and, therefore, it is up to courts to make judgments.\"",
      "Asked whether the foreign secretary had mistakenly gone beyond official government policy, the spokesperson said: \"I'd refer to the Foreign Office on that, but there's no change in policy here.\"",
      "Asked whether Lammy should apologise, they added: \"I'll leave that to the Foreign Office.\"",
      "The BBC has approached Lammy for comment."

      "The UK is legally committed to reaching net zero by 2050 under a law passed by former Tory Prime Minister Theresa May in 2019. It means the UK must cut carbon emissions until it removes as much as it produces, in line with the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement.",

      "\"Net zero by 2050 is impossible.",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Mar 2025 06:06:29 GMT",
    "summary": "The debate has sparked a wider dilemma about the broader purpose of welfare",
    "story": [
      "In the next 24 hours and then over the following fortnight up until the Spring Statement, the government is going to talk a lot about a broken welfare system that is failing the people who use it, the economy and taxpayers.",
      "Taking a tough call on fixing it goes against the instincts of much of the Labour Party and has already sparked an internal backlash that could rise to ministerial level, as well as protests.",
      "The government is making two key related judgements. The first is that the country cannot afford to sustain recent ballooning increases in the health-related benefit bill and caseload, in particular for mental illness.",
      "At the same time, it will argue that a job is the best medicine.",
      "Underlying this is an assumption that a health-related benefits system that was built-up to deal with industrial injuries can't apply to the post-pandemic service economy workforce.",
      "The net result is likely to be significant changes to Personal Independence Payments, aiming to reduce eligibility for the highest levels of payments, especially among those of working age with mental illness.",
      "In addition, there will be a levelling of the generosity of the health component of Universal Credit. This will save billions of pounds, and about a billion of that will be reinvested in trying to help get those capable of part-time work some help for a partial return.",
      "Mapping welfare trends",
      "The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is rolling in real-time data. \"Cluster analysis maps\" reveal to ministers exactly who is claiming out of work benefits and where they are.",
      "As the numbers continue to increase, the data is being cut by sector, postcode, age and type of illness. Every pattern is being analysed.",
      "The idea was that the data would firstly offer the government insight into how it could make billions of pounds of cuts to a rapidly growing bill in order to help the Chancellor meet her self-imposed government borrowing rules.",
      "Secondly, it was meant to point to more fundamental reforms to welfare, also designed to temper the same ballooning rise in the costs of dealing with ill health among the working population.",
      "The data has thrown up answers.",
      "That poor mental health is driving the rise in claimants is clear. To a lesser extent, so too is the role that raising the state pension age has played, with many thousands who would previously have been retired now claiming health-related benefits.",
      "But it has also thrown up a major question too: does cutting welfare to incentivise people to work more hours in fact do the opposite - nudging them out of the workforce altogether and ultimately increasing the benefit bill?",
      "If this is the case - and it is by no means a universally accepted interpretation of what has happened - then the question is whether further cuts could in fact increase the numbers claiming? And should Labour instead invest in getting people back into work?",
      "Growing sickness",
      "When I visited a job centre in Birmingham alongside the Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall in the Autumn, I was taken aback by how the work coaches were talking as much about health as about work.",
      "\"There's a lot of mental health, depression and anxiety,\" Qam told me.",
      "GPs have reported that their surgery time is dominated by trying to work out whether their patients are \"fit for work\". Roughly 11 million fit notes are issued every year in England alone, with 93% assessing the patient as \"not fit for work\". That has doubled over a decade. In the latest quarter, 44% were for 5 weeks or more absence.",
      "From that pool of growing in-work sickness, a significant proportion ends up on some form of incapacity benefits. The Treasury's bill for health and disability benefits, which was \u00a328bn in the year before the pandemic, is now \u00a352bn a year. It is forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to hit \u00a370bn by the end of the decade.",
      "The pure financial aim here is to \"bend the curve\" down to nearer \u00a360bn in that period. This means restricting both the generosity and eligibility of some - or all of such - payments. It could require a wholesale cash freeze so that benefits do not rise with inflation, for example, or the abolition of entire categories of recipients.",
      "'Deaths of despair'",
      "An Institute for Fiscal Studies report published last week showed that wider measures of mental ill health have rocketed since the pandemic. Between 2002 and 2024, the number of 16-64-year-olds claiming disability benefits for mental or behavioural health conditions increased from 360,000 to 1.28 million.",
      "Every day in 2023 there were 10 extra \"deaths of despair\" (defined as deaths from alcohol, drugs or suicide) in England and Wales than the average between 2015 and 2019. Average sickness absence rates across the whole economy remained structurally higher than pre-pandemic.",
      "Of particular concern is how this affects young people. In a recent report DWP adviser Prof Paul Gregg points to the \"incredibly low\" chances of sustained returns to the workforce once a person has been on incapacity benefits for two years.",
      "About two fifths of new incapacity benefit claimants under 25 came directly from education. The latest DWP analysis shows these trends are now closely related to broader socio-economic vulnerabilities such as limited education and also with precarious sectors such as retail and hospitality.",
      "The question that remains is whether so many people really are more sick - and what role (if any) is played by the reduction in stigma around mental health.",
      "But then there is the question of how to address it.",
      "Overly binary",
      "Another major factor is that rise in the state pension age, which the DWP calculates, resulted in 89,000 older workers instead claiming health-related benefits. However, the sharp increase in claimants of such benefits since the pandemic is not only attributable to ageing populations or increasing mental health diagnoses.",
      "Research suggests there are significant systemic and policy-driven causes. At its heart the problem is perceived to be that the current welfare structure has become overly binary, failing to accommodate a growing demographic who should be able to do at least a bit of work.",
      "This rigidity - what ministers refer to as a \"hard boundary\" - inadvertently pushes individuals towards declaring complete unfitness for work, and can lead to total dependence on welfare, particularly Universal Credit Health (UC Health), rather than facilitating a gradual transition back into employment.",
      "This has been bad for the economy, for employers, terrible for the public finances, and deeply concerning for the career prospects of individuals.",
      "History helps here. Health-related benefits are often a disguised form of unemployment. The caseload for incapacity benefits (which include not just UC Health but previous incarnations) since the 1970s shows the UK heading for a record of one in 12 adults of working age in receipt.",
      "But this is not the first such build-up. It happened in the late 1980s when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister, and it was reversed in the early 2000s under New Labour.",
      "The launch in 1986 of Restart Programme, a forerunner to JobSeekers Allowance modelled on Ronald Reagan's policies in the US, helped return many claimants to the workforce but also pushed a staggering number into incapacity claims.",
      "Over the decade and a half of this policy, there was a 1.6 million increase in people in receipt of the benefit. But at the time this migration from claimant unemployment into incapacity was apparently a deliberate strategy, as it helped deal with headlines about \"three million unemployed\".",
      "A middle ground",
      "The government has not yet published its analysis on the jobs market, but Prof Gregg's early thinking was made clear in a report for the Health Foundation. He argued that, historically, the welfare system responded effectively through a middle ground that allowed individuals to combine part-time work with partial welfare benefits. He puts this down to reforms introduced in the early 2000s, such as tax credits.",
      "This is essentially the crystallisation of Iain Duncan Smith's critique of then chancellor George Osborne's welfare cuts of 2016. He told me at the time that they were \"deeply unfair\" on working people and the vision of a proper welfare-to-work scheme \"could not be repeatedly salami-sliced\".",
      "Some argue that those reforms created a situation where individuals, unable to sustain full-time work, gravitate towards more generous health-based welfare program.",
      "Crucially, claims began to rise in 2018. At the DWP ministers have tried to research the reasons behind the increase in caseload - and found that about a third of the increase can be explained as the predictable consequence of policy or of demographics.",
      "Prevention rather than cure",
      "With an ongoing flow of new claimants arriving in the system (nearly half a million in the last financial year) the onus is now on finding a prevention rather than a cure.",
      "And this is where it becomes tricky - one suggestion involves eliminating the current welfare trap by reintroducing intermediate support for part-time work. However, that requires extra funding, as well as a way of providing more personalised job searches and better mental health support.",
      "Another option is passing responsibilities to employers. In the Netherlands, employers bear significant responsibilities and financial costs if they fail to adequately support employees facing health challenges. In the early 2000s, the Dutch also had very high levels of incapacity but they now report employment rates of 83%.",
      "The structure of the jobs market in the UK makes that challenging to replicate - for example there are more insecure zero hours contracts.",
      "And given that businesses feel under pressure from National Insurance rises and a slow economy, could they really be cajoled into helping?",
      "Faster cuts",
      "The questions arising from the data will matter for the economy, for the public finances, our health, and young people's careers and livelihoods, at a time of considerable change.",
      "Fundamentally, it is a question of what the benefit system is for, at a time when illness is being redefined, and when the trends are, frankly, scary.",
      "Then there is the question of whether the public wants to pay even higher taxes in the hope of delivering long-term gain. Welfare-to-work programs can pay for themselves eventually, but the Government feels it needs to book faster cuts.",
      "That's because all of this is in the context of what \"fiscal headroom\" the government did have against the Chancellor's self-imposed borrowing targets being wiped out since the Trump shock to the world economy, the Budget and the announcements of extra European defence spending.",
      "But government insiders are at pains to argue that the primary motivation for any cuts is not regaining the extra room for manoeuvre. \"We don't need the OBR to tell us that we need to fix welfare to get people back to work. We don't need the OBR to tell us we need to make the NHS more productive. And we don't need the OBR to tell us that the taxpayer should be getting more value for money,\" a source told me.",
      "\"Headroom or no headroom the Chancellor is determined to push through the change we need to make Britain more secure and prosperous.\"",
      "Ultimately, the economic imperative is clear - to bring a cohort of young people suffering a combination of mental ill health and joblessness back into work.",
      "And the government believes there is no way of doing this without, at least at first, hurting the incomes of ill people. There is going to be quite the backlash from disability charities, and in turn from backbench Labour MPs.",

      "Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has welcomed 29 councillors who have defected to his party in recent weeks from parties including the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats.",
      "It takes the party's total number of council seats to more than 100.",
      "Speaking at a press conference in Westminster, Farage said the defections demonstrated how his party was \"broadening and deepening\".",
      "However, it comes as some Reform members are expressing concern about the party's leadership and the suspension of MP Rupert Lowe from the party.",
      "On Sunday, Maria Bowtell, a councillor on East Riding of Yorkshire Council, quit the party. She accused the leadership of \"a lack of integrity and resolve\" and said the treatment of Lowe had been \"the final straw\".",
      "Farage acknowledged that his party had experienced a \"little bit of turbulence\" over the past few weeks.",
      "He said the suspension of Lowe had caused \"consternation\" adding: \"Any argument that's seen to happen within the family does, but I can promise you that in terms of our progress and our planning, that upset is very much at the edges.\"",

      "The party also said it had received allegations of bullying in Lowe's parliamentary and constituency office.",
      "Lowe has said the party's allegations are \"untrue and false\". He argued he had been suspended for criticising Farage in a newspaper interview.",
      "Addressing the row, Farage said: \"We've been increasingly concerned about the behaviour of one of our members of Parliament, and when we found out that some serious complaints have gone in, we thought, you know what, let's just suspend the whip and let's find out what the truth is, and we will wait.\"",
      "He said the report they had commissioned into to the allegations could be completed this week.",
      "Farage also criticised \"the online abuse and frankly outright racism\" directed at Yusuf in recent weeks.",
      "He said the public spat with Lowe would not \"put a dent\" in Reform UK's electoral chances, as the party gears up for local elections on 1 May.",
      "\"We're going to be out there canvassing, campaigning, and doing our best to prove that the polls aren't virtual, actually, the real votes exist out there on the ground.\"",
      "The party has said it plans to stand in all the council seats that are due to hold elections in May.",
      "Of Reform UK's 113 councillor seats, 15 have been won through elections, including seven from Labour and four from the Conservatives.",
      "The remaining 98 seats have turned Reform UK through defections - 62 of those defections have happened since the beginning of the year.",
      "The majority of the defections (66) were originally elected as Conservative councillors. Three came from Labour and one came from the Liberal Democrats.",
      "The rest were independent councillors or came from local parties.",
      "Farage has previously spoken about his aim to \"professionalise\" Reform UK and the importance of vetting the party's candidates.",
      "Following Monday's press conference, Farage was questioned about reports that in 2022 his party's head of vetting Jack Aaron had said Adolf Hitler was \"brilliant\" at inspiring \"people into action\".",

      "\"This is an orthodox Jew who said Hitler was evil but he acknowledged he was very good at getting a crowd.\"",

      "Ms Spielman stepped down as head of Ofsted at the end of 2023.",
      "An inquiry into Ofsted was launched that year, after the death of head teacher Ruth Perry, who died by suicide following an Ofsted inspection.",
      "Ms Spielman accuses the education secretary of using \"polished verbiage and jazz hands\" when announcing policies, and claimed some policies had been \"influenced by education union leaders and activists\".",

      "But Ms Spielman claimed the changes to Ofsted were being done \"to please unions\", by making it \"much less likely that inspection will detect weaknesses or convey a negative message.\"",
      "Speaking to Radio 4's World at One programme, Ms Spielman said she thought it was \"surprising\" that education unions were approached for comments on stories about Ofsted.",
      "A government source's comment, which said Ms Spielman should \"spend less time criticising the reforms this government is bringing, and more time reflecting on her failure at Ofsted\", was also put to the ex-Ofsted boss during the interview.",
      "She responded by saying it was \"fascinating because that's a union line\", reiterating her criticism of the organisations which she says have been \"attacking accountability and attacking inspection from long before I became chief inspector\".",
      "In The Telegraph piece, the ex-Ofsted head also says the government's proposals for academies will \"cut the autonomy of schools and school groups right back\".",
      "She says she is \"astonished by the speed and thoroughness with which Bridget Phillipson has moved to dismantle every main pillar of the system\".",
      "The schools bill, due to go before MPs again on Monday, includes measures to create a register of children who are not in school and allow local authorities to intervene if a child's home environment is assessed as unsuitable or unsafe.",
      "Several issues covered by the bill, including safeguarding, have been met positively by school leaders.",
      "More controversial and debated elements have been around academy reforms, which may limit academies' powers to manage their pay and working practices differently to schools run by local authorities.",
      "After facing opposition from academy leaders, the government has since clarified that it intends the pay framework to be a \"floor not a ceiling\", meaning academy bosses will still be able to pay teachers more if they choose to.",
      "Phillipson previously called political attempts to halt the bill \"utterly sickening\", telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme the children's bill was \"the single biggest piece of children safeguarding legislation in a generation\".",
      "Responding to Ms Spielman's claims, a DfE spokesperson said the bill, alongside other reforms, \"delivers on our mission for every child to have a good, local school, will get high-quality teachers into every classroom, and ensure that all schools can innovate to attract and retain the best talent\".",

      "It comes as a leading think tank cut its UK growth forecasts for 2025 and 2026 as it downgraded prospects for the global economy over trade war concerns.",
      "The government has made boosting growth its main priority, but the Conservatives said Labour's taxes were harming growth and called on Reeves to set out a \"real plan\".",
      "Reeves told regulators at the 40-minute meeting that the current level of bureaucracy made it \"too slow to get things done\".",
      "\"There are a number of things over the last decade or so that have held back growth, and one of them - if we are honest and you know better than anyone - is the regulatory landscape,\" she said.",

      "'Global headwinds'",
      "In its latest forecast, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) cut its predictions for UK growth to 1.4% in 2025, from its previous forecast of 1.7%, and to 1.2% in 2026, down from 1.3%.",
      "However, the forecast is more optimistic than the Bank of England, which earlier this month cut its UK growth forecast for 2025 to 0.75%.",

      "The OECD said that for the world economy, growth would slow from 3.2% in 2024 to 3.1% in 2025, largely as a result of the trade tensions sparked by US President Donald Trump's introduction of tariffs on imports into the US.",
      "In response to the OECD's forecast, Reeves said: \"This report shows the world is changing, and increased global headwinds such as trade uncertainty are being felt across the board.\"",
      "The UK economy shrank unexpectedly in January, contracting by 0.1%, which was weaker than forecast, driven mainly by a decline in the manufacturing sector.",
      "Ahead of Monday's meeting with regulators, Reeves said. \"By cutting red tape and creating a more effective system, we will boost investment, create jobs and put more money into working people's pockets.\"",
      "Changes announced by the government include streamlining the environmental regulatory process for major projects including Lower Thames Crossing (subject to planning approval) and future ones such as a Heathrow expansion.",
      "Meanwhile, environmental guidance, including hundreds of pages on protection of bats, will be reviewed, while environmental permits for some low-risk and temporary projects will be removed.",
      "This plan comes alongside 60 measures agreed upon by watchdogs \"following weeks of intense negotiations\" that are designed to make it easier to do business in the UK.",
      "Those measures include:",

      "What is Pip and how are the rules changing?",
      "Pip is paid to more than 3.6 million people who have a long-term physical or mental health condition.",
      "There are two elements - a daily living component and a mobility component. Claimants may be eligible for one or both.",
      "Under the government's proposals, assessments for the daily living part will be tightened, potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of people.",
      "Pip assessments involve questions about tasks like preparing and eating food, washing and getting dressed. Each is scored on a scale from zero - for no difficulty - to 12 - for the most severe - by a health professional.",
      "From November 2026, the government says people will need to score at least four on one item, instead of qualifying for support with a score that could describe less severe difficulties (ones and twos) across a broad range of activities.",
      "For example, needing help to wash your hair, or your body below the waist, would be awarded two points, but needing help to wash between the shoulders and waist would equate to four points.",
      "The payments for daily living are:",
      "A standard rate of \u00a372.65 per weekAn enhanced rate of \u00a3108.55 per week",
      "A standard rate of \u00a372.65 per week",
      "An enhanced rate of \u00a3108.55 per week",
      "Payments for the mobility element, which are not affected, are:",
      "A standard rate of \u00a328.70 per weekAn enhanced rate of \u00a375.75 per week",
      "A standard rate of \u00a328.70 per week",
      "An enhanced rate of \u00a375.75 per week",
      "Pip is usually paid every four weeks and is tax-free. It does not change depending on your savings or income and does not count as income affecting other benefits, or the benefit cap. You can get Pip if you are working.",
      "At present, the payment is made for a fixed period of time between one and 10 years, after which it is reviewed. A reassessment could come earlier if your circumstances change.",
      "The government plans more frequent reassessments for many people claiming Pip. However, those with the highest levels of a permanent condition or disability will no longer face reassessment.",
      "Pip is paid in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.",
      "There is a similar but separate benefit in Scotland called the Adult Disability Payment.",
      "How big is the welfare budget and where might cuts fall?",
      "Labour's plan for benefits throws up a bigger dilemma",
      "Does cutting benefits actually work?",
      "How is universal credit changing?",
      "The government has also made changes to universal credit, which is paid to 7.5 million people.",
      "At present, more than three million recipients have no requirement to find work, a number that has risen sharply.",
      "The basic level of universal credit is worth \u00a3393.45 a month to a single person who is 25 or over.",
      "But if you have limited capacity to work because of a disability or long term condition, this payment more than doubles, due to a top up of \u00a3416.19.",
      "Under the proposals, claimants will not be eligible to get this incapacity top-up until they are aged 22 or over.",
      "New claimants will also see this top-up fall from \u00a397 extra per week in 2025 to \u00a350 a week by next year.",
      "The higher rate for existing health-related claimants will be frozen until 2029-2030.",
      "However, the basic payment level for universal credit will rise, reaching a \u00a3775 annual increase by the year 2029-30.",
      "What is being done to get more people into work?",
      "The government says it wants to help those who can work back into employment, while doing more to protect those with severe conditions who are unable to do so.",
      "As part of this it will invest \u00a31bn in \"high-quality, tailored and personalised support\"  to help people find jobs.",
      "A number of changes have been announced which, the government says, break the link between trying to get into work and losing benefits.",
      "The work capability assessment, which checks eligibility for the health related top-up to universal credit, will be scrapped by 2028.",
      "Instead, claimants will have to go through the Pip system to claim for a health benefit. The government says they will be assessed on how their disability affects their daily life, rather than on their capacity to work.",
      "While you can receive universal credit or Pip while in employment, universal credit is means-tested and tapers off, while Pip is not affected by how much someone works or their level of savings.",
      "Under a new \"right to try\" system people will not be penalised for trying to get back in to work, the government says.",
      "The government will also consult on merging job seekers allowance and employment seekers allowance into a single time-limited benefit that is not means-tested.",
      "\"If you have paid into the system, you'll get stronger income protection while we help you get back on track,\" Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall said.",
      "Why is the government aiming to cut welfare spending?",
      "Overall, the government currently spends \u00a365bn a year on health and disability-related benefits. This is projected to increase to \u00a3100bn by 2029.",
      "Pip is now the second-largest element of the working-age welfare bill, with spending expected to almost double to \u00a334bn by 2029-30.",
      "When Pip was introduced in 2013, the aim was to save \u00a31.4bn a year by reducing the number of people eligible for payments. However, initial savings were modest and the number of claimants has risen.",
      "About 1.3m people now claim disability benefits primarily for mental health or behavioural conditions.",
      "That is 44% of all working age claimants, according to the independent economic think-tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS)."

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c99n798ye1zo",
    "published": "Sat, 15 Mar 2025 13:05:44 GMT",
    "summary": "Labour may have ditched its factional in-fighting - but deep welfare cuts could reignite tensions.",
    "story": [
      "The prime minister has just had another moment at the lectern, urging Europe to stand up for Ukraine. He's an increasingly confident leader, but in the coming days No 10 faces what could be a defining fight at home.",
      "\"There is a collision coming,\" a Labour insider tells me. Sir Keir Starmer has long been up for fights with his party. But with controversy around every corner, who are the tribes in the party in 2025, and might they fight back?",
      "The party's history is crammed with bitter bust-ups, years when MPs seemed most comfortable to be fighting each other, rather than political rivals.",
      "With a squeeze on benefits coming, there is unease on the back, and the front benches, including in cabinet. The decision on winter fuel payments still causes resentment, and new plans for immigration coming in a white paper later in the spring are likely to be controversial too.",
      "A long-time party observer says: \"Put three Labour people in a room and you'll have a faction.\"",
      "Sir Keir's allies seem pretty confident Labour's ditched that habit of constant scrapping. But No 10 is worried enough to be inviting MPs into Downing Street to make their pitch for the changes to welfare, knowing there'll be upset from the usual suspects and hoping there won't be too much of a backlash on the soft left.",
      "It's also grappling with the massive group of MPs elected last year, with some eager backbenchers actively trying to make Sir Keir's case, unkindly branded by one source as \"toadies\" trying to suck up to the leadership.",
      "So how will the \"usual suspects\", the \"softies\", the \"newbies\" and the \"toadies\" shake down?",
      "There has always been criticism of Sir Keir from the left-hand edge of Labour, not least because he spent the first couple of years in charge squeezing out the hard left, and even kicked out some MPs after the general election for voting against him over the cap on benefits for families with more than two children.",
      "It's common for MPs like Diane Abbott or Nadia Whittome to take pot shots at the prime minister's plans. But now this group is much smaller and less influential than it once was, it can't do much damage on its own. Gone are the days when the Socialist Campaign Group held sway with Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 there are only around 30 MPs in the group these days. But unhappiness about the coming welfare cuts spreads its tentacles far further.",
      "One of those arguing against them told me the vast majority of Labour MPs were in the \"group of resistance\" \u2013 and \"privately some of the cabinet are very against it.\"",
      "There is a whiff of opportunity to force Sir Keir to back down, some believe. \"There is a chance that the old left and the soft left come together,\" another MP tells me.",
      "A source on the left of the party tells me there's \"potential to broaden this out and team up with people who don't want to see benefits cut after 15 years of austerity. The challenge for us on the left is to work with those people - then we'll have a sizeable rebellion.\" It is \"breathtaking\" to see new MPs backing undisclosed changes to benefits for disabled people, they add.",
      "They point to the rebellion against Tony Blair in 1997 when 47 Labour MPs voted against the new government over - you guessed it - cuts to benefits. One hundred MPs abstained. It didn't change the policy, just as a rebellion of that kind of size wouldn't change it this time either, given the PM's huge majority. But it shocked ministers, still in the pomp of their massive victory that year. Could this do the same?",
      "Downing Street evidently is worried - but the resistance on the soft left so far seems, well, rather soft.",
      "Another source tells me there are lots of colleagues who are expressing discomfort, and there are fault-lines, but it's not organised. Some of those who would rather like there to be a rebellion seem to also rather like the idea of someone else organising it.",
      "Rebellions do need organising, effort, energy, and an eagerness to make sparks fly. They also need leaders willing to put their head above the parapet. While the concern is strong, the appetite for a big spat when the plans eventually get to Parliament is less so, at least for now.",
      "It's symbolic of where power is held in the party right now. \"The soft left has been obliterated,\" a senior Labour figure tells me, adding: \"I'm not sure No 10 has the story right and I fear it will be handled badly, but on welfare \u2013 they have got no choice.\"",
      "Ministers are trying to make a moral argument - that sorting out welfare is a mission, that it's better for people's well-being and health to have a job. Wes Streeting, the health secretary, will almost inevitably make that case when he joins us in the studio tomorrow. That argument was made by Labour in the election and in its manifesto. But the second part of the expected plans - squeezing payments to disabled people who may already be struggling - was not.",
      "None of the hordes of Labour MPs elected for the first time in 2024 had taking cash from the worst off on their campaign leaflets or Facebook posts. But are the newbies, barely a year into the job, the kind of tribe to cause trouble? Of course, it's important to note they don't all think the same but talking to some of them, there are some characteristics you can trace.",
      "Remember more than half of Labour's MPs \u2013 243 out of 406 \u2013 are completely new, so understanding their centre of gravity is hugely important. And it seems very different to the previous generations.",
      "One of the newbies told me: \"Even more than the welfare stuff, the moment that was most revealing about how different we are to 1997 was the 3% defence target and the aid cuts.\" This wasn't met with any more resistance than the resignation of International Development Minister Annaliese Dodds and a \"few rumblings\" from inside the party - but for most of the 2024 intake it was a \"no-brainer\", given the need to spend more on defence as the world becomes less secure.",
      "It's not just that Labour's recruits are different, but they note their political upbringing is different too: \"We have come of age politically in a time when chaos is the norm and the world feels like it is continually going to hell\" \u2013 so cutting aid and other policies that are uncomfortable for moderates a generation above \"are not that troubling\".",
      "Indeed, some of the newbies have been unkindly branded \"toadies\" by others, as another source describes them - not just accepting some of the leadership's tougher plans, but even egging them on, busy writing public letters, or giving supportive interviews.",
      "Whether on welfare, defence or planning, another MP describes them as \"pop-up pressure groups\", publicly calling for No 10 to push its reforms harder, and further.",
      "\"Aren't they hilarious?\" a party veteran jokes, gently mocking the ambition of those involved, suspicious that the leadership may have gently encouraged a few aspirant MPs to make their case vigorously and loudly.",
      "A government source acknowledges there is a significant chunk of MPs who want to be helpful to the leadership, but with many in marginal seats, \"they are not swots, they are street fighters\" who are closer to their voters' concerns. They're telling the leadership they can give them space to be more radical on welfare, immigration or getting houses built.",
      "For now, whatever the motivation of the usual suspects, No 10 can enjoy a level of unity in the governing party.",
      "It's also plain that the political operation in government has improved since the summer, in part due to his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, credited by many for bringing a new discipline to the party. \"There is only one tribe,\" a senior figure told me, \"it's Morgan McSweeney's \u2013 it's his way or the high way \u2013 his people are controlling things at the moment.\" That's described differently by others, who say: \"It's Keir's party now.\" And an increasingly confident prime minister abroad has more clout at home.",
      "But the rows over welfare that will bubble up this week and the chancellor's decisions in the Spring Statement next week still certainly matter. Not every MP or activist agrees with the decisions being taken by the centre - but with a whopping majority, the risk is not about losing votes.",
      "It's about a direction of travel and the perception of the party to the public. It matters in the next few weeks on the inside of government because managing unhappiness takes up political time, energy and effort. It matters outside because rows over policy, whether welfare or immigration, create headlines, and headaches, and the danger of giving the public the impression that the party in charge is not pulling together.",
      "That's acknowledged by a government source observing the journey Sir Keir's Labour Party has been on: \"We were united against the hard left, then we were united against the Tories\" - but as the government settles in, it's less clear what the party is united on now.",

    "summary": "The government has set out plans to save billions of pounds from the welfare bill - how have previous attempts to do this fared?",
    "story": [
      "Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall has set out how the government plans to cut billions of pounds from the working-age welfare bill in the coming years.",
      "The focus will be on reducing spending on health and disability benefits.",
      "The bill is rising rapidly and many argue it needs to be curbed for the sake of the UK's public finances \u2013 as well as the economic and individual benefits of getting those who can work back into employment.",
      "The plans include cutting the level of some benefits and tightening eligibility for others, along with investment to help people into work.",
      "But this is not the first government to seek savings from the welfare budget.",
      "BBC Verify has examined the past 15 years of policies in this area to see what might be effective \u2013 and what risks being counterproductive.",
      "At-a-glance: Key changes to benefits in welfare shake-up",
      "What are the Pip and universal credit changes and who is affected?",
      "Cutting payments",
      "The working-age health and disability benefits bill has certainly been increasing in recent years, and is rising rapidly.",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the official forecaster, has projected that total state spending on these benefits for people in the UK aged between 18 and 64 will increase from \u00a348.5bn in 2023-24 to \u00a375.7bn in 2029-30.",
      "That would represent an increase from 1.7% of the size of the UK economy to 2.2%.",
      "By 2030, around half of the expenditure is projected to be on incapacity benefit, which is designed to provide additional income for people whose health limits their ability to work.",
      "The other half is projected to be on Personal Independence Payments (PIP), which are intended to help people of working age with disabilities manage the additional day-to-day costs arising from their disability.",
      "The government hopes to curb the rise in the overall bill by holding some of the benefits of existing incapacity claimants flat in cash terms - rather than allowing them to rise in line with inflation - until 2030.",
      "It also plans to reduce the benefits of many new claimants outright relative to current levels.",
      "This echoes the policies of previous governments.",
      "Between 2014 and 2020, most working-age benefits were increased below the rate of inflation to save money.",
      "This included a portion of the payments received by people on incapacity benefit.",
      "However, despite these real terms cuts in many benefits, from 2015, more and more people claimed incapacity benefit.",
      "So cutting the value of individual payments might save some money up front, but still not have a dramatic impact on the overall bill in the longer term if claimants continue to rise.",
      "Tighten eligibility",
      "The Government is also planning to keep a lid on the overall working-age benefit bill by making it harder for people to claim some disability benefits, notably PIP.",
      "This too echoes the policies of previous administrations.",
      "For instance, Rishi Sunak's government had proposed making it harder for people with mental health conditions to claim PIP arguing that the monthly payment was not proportionate to the additional financial needs created by their conditions.",
      "But it is important to note that efforts to change the eligibility criteria for these benefits over the past 15 years have not yielded the results hoped for.",
      "PIP was introduced in 2013 to replace the old Disability Living Allowance, with the intention it would lead to savings of \u00a31.4bn a year relative to the previous system by reducing the number of people eligible.",
      "PIP was initially projected to reduce the number of claimants by 606,000 (28%) in total.",
      "Yet the reform ended up saving only \u00a3100m a year by 2015, and the number of claimants rose by 100,000 (5%).",
      "Another attempt in 2017 to limit access to PIP was also reversed.",
      "The reason was that many people appealed against refusals that had been triggered by the tightened eligibility criteria.",
      "Also, the emergence of cases in the media which seemed unfair meant ministers, often under pressure from their own backbench MPs, ultimately ordered the eligibility rules to be relaxed.",
      "Official decisions not to award PIP and incapacity benefit to claimants are still often challenged and around two-thirds are ultimately decided in the challenger's favour at an independent tribunal.",
      "Encourage work",
      "The government is also seeking to make savings from the working age welfare bill by encouraging people to enter work.",
      "Around 93% of incapacity benefit claimants are not in work and the same is true of 80% of PIP claimants.",
      "One of the proposals is to have more regular reassessments of people on incapacity benefit to determine if their condition has changed and they can now be expected to work.",
      "The fall in the number of people claiming incapacity benefit in the early 2010s has been attributed by the OBR to reassessments of a large number of people in receipt of an older form of the benefit.",
      "However, an aggressive or onerous reassessment regime could risk imposing distress on people who are unable to work.",
      "The government has said that those with \"the most severe, life-long health conditions\" will face no future reassessments. But it has not specified which conditions will qualify.",
      "It has also set out plans to encourage more people on health and disability benefits into work through tailored and personalised support.",
      "There have been various schemes designed to achieve this over the past 15 years, though they have not been on a large scale.",
      "Evaluations have shown some positive employment effects from them.",
      "However, the OBR concluded last year that the evidence base was still limited and did not suggest such programmes have, so far, made a \"significant contribution\" to getting people into work.",
      "That implies the official forecaster may hesitate to assume greater state investment in these schemes will pay for itself through higher employment and tax revenues, and result in net savings in public expenditure.",
      "Nevertheless, some experts argue it would make sense for the government to re-assess more regularly whether people in receipt of health and disability benefits are still unable to work and - if their circumstances are found to have changed - to provide them with additional support to get into the workforce.",
      "\"Not doing reassessments and work-focused interviews definitely makes things worse,\" says Jonathan Portes, a former chief economist at the Department for Work & Pensions.",
      "Correction 17 March: an earlier version of this article wrongly stated the percentage of claimants' appeals upheld, based on DWP appeals. The article has been updated to reflect the full proportion, upheld at independent tribunal.",

      "They range from huge organisations like NHS England, to smaller ones like the Gambling Commission and the British Film Institute.",
      "How many quangos are there?",
      "The number of quangos has fallen by more than half since 2010 but there are still more than 300 across the UK.",
      "Under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, nearly 300 were axed - dubbed the \"bonfire of the quangos\" - in an attempt to improve accountability and cut costs.",
      "Despite Sir Keir indicating he would also like to reduce the role of quangos, the new Labour government has set up more than 20 since winning power.",

      "Asked earlier this week if the government was planning another \"bonfire of the quangos\", Downing Street said the PM wanted to see a more \"active and agile state\", rather than \"outsourcing\" decisions to other bodies.",

      "It gives the example of how absorbing JobCentre Plus into the Department for Work and Pensions helped cut the department's workforce and office space by a third.",

      "The government already had concerns about the rising number of benefit claimants and Reeves has previously pledged \"fundamental\" reform of the welfare system.",
      "The government is also seeking to reorganise the civil service to reduce bureaucracy. It has already announced that NHS England will be scrapped, and other quangos and regulators are also expected to be axed.",
      "The Treasury has blamed global economic policy and geopolitical uncertainty over the outcome of conflicts in Ukraine and Middle East, for raising government borrowing costs.",

      "Confirming details of how international aid funding will be reallocated to defence, following the prime minister's announcement that UK defence spending will rise to 2.5% of national income by 2027.",
      "Government sources have been keen to state that this event is not a major one because it will not include tax rises, only spending cuts.",
      "A debateable tax hiking policy could be announced, however, if Reeves decides to extend the freeze on the thresholds at which people start to pay different rates of income tax.",
      "The policy is known as a hidden tax rise or stealth tax, as it takes effect over time as people are dragged into paying more tax as their pay goes up, without the tax rate rising at all.",
      "Thresholds were frozen by the previous Conservative government until April 2028, but the chancellor could decide to extend the freeze beyond this to raise about \u00a37bn a year, according to consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics and investment bank Citi.",
      "Reeves decided not to extend the threshold freeze in her first Budget, arguing that doing so \"would hurt working people\" and \"take more money out of their payslips\".",
      "Whether any other spending cuts are announced in the Spring Statement or in the Spending Review in June, or even delayed until the next Budget, remains to be seen.",
      "How is the UK economy doing?",
      "Recent figures show UK economic growth has been sluggish, with the Office for National Statistics describing the situation as one of \"weak growth\".",
      "The economy grew by just 0.1% between October and December 2024, while the latest monthly figures show it contracted by 0.1% in January.",
      "When an economy grows, more businesses can employ extra workers or give pay rises. Firms making higher profits also pay more in tax to the government, which can be spent on public services.",
      "In addition to slow growth, prices are also rising faster than wanted.",
      "The current inflation rate of 3% is higher than the Bank of England's 2% target, and is forecast to go higher. Inflation could dictate whether interest rates are lowered further from their current 4.5%.",
      "Higher rates mean higher borrowing costs for loans, credit cards and mortgage deals, but it also provides better returns on savings.",
      "Costs for businesses are expected to jump further in April, when National Insurance contributions paid by employers rise. These could be passed on to consumers.",
      "Pressure has also increased on the chancellor's tax and spending plans after a surplus in government finances missed official forecasts, prompting speculation from economists that she could break her fiscal rules as things stand.",
      "Borrowing costs for the UK surged in January in part due to concerns over the UK's economic outlook, threatening Reeves's economic plans. The costs have since fallen back but remain higher than this time last year.",
      "Reeves has also warned that a potential global trade war, despite tariffs not directly targeting the UK, would lower growth and raise inflation."

    "summary": "Sir Keir's argument overlaps with the former PM's - that the proliferation of arm's length bodies slow down change.",
    "story": [
      "It is a comparison neither would likely welcome, but look closely and the arguments of Sir Keir Starmer and Liz Truss about why government doesn't work well enough are remarkably similar.",
      "Neither are the first to grumble about the machinery of government.",
      "More than 20 years ago, Sir Tony Blair gave a speech much of which Sir Keir could give today.",
      "\"Sometimes we can be so frightened of the process of accountability, we opt for inertia,\" Sir Tony said in 2004, adding that too often the civil service had acted as \"a shock absorber in order to maintain the status quo\".",
      "So claims about a lack of nimbleness and pace are not new.",
      "But a core strand of Sir Keir's argument overlaps with Liz Truss's.",
      "Perhaps the person the prime minister has to thank the most for his whopping majority has been making the case he is now making for a while.",
      "Their language and emphases may be different, but the diagnosis is the same.",
      "Starmer and Dominic Cummings now agree on one thing - the civil service is a problem",
      "Starmer pledges to tackle 'flabby' state",
      "Starmer pitches reform to 'shackled' civil servants",
      "Sir Keir Starmer says the state has become \"overcautious\" and \"flabby\" and government has become bigger, but weaker.",
      "By weaker, he means a growing inability to make stuff happen and a big reason for that, he reckons, is the proliferation of arm's length bodies \u2013 taxpayer funded organisations with independence from the government and considerable power.",
      "There has been a growing sense in Downing Street as the prime minister and his team have adjusted to life in government that organisations dreamt up as a wheeze by previous governments so they don't get blamed for this or that all too often now stand in the way of a minister being able to do what they want.",
      "The recent row about the Sentencing Council in England and Wales is seen as a case in point.",
      "And now, scrapping NHS England is, ministers will argue, the ultimate case study in scrapping unaccountable bureaucracy.",
      "Scale of challenge",
      "So what did Liz Truss argue after her time in government?",
      "She talked of the \"tyranny of the technocracy\", the \"power of the administrative state\" and argued that \"there is something rather undemocratic about this\".",
      "She said that \"Blair and Brown had imposed a web of legalistic architecture that added process and put more power in the hands of technocrats\", which granted is a point where you might think Truss and Starmer would depart and no doubt do in many instances.",
      "But strikingly, given that recent row about the Sentencing Council, when was it set up?",
      "In April 2010, when Gordon Brown was prime minister.",
      "\"For any challenge faced, for too long the answer has been more arm's length bodies, quangos and regulators which end up blocking the government,\" Sir Keir writes in the Daily Telegraph, without reference to any particular such body.",
      "It is also true that this new-ish government has itself created new arms-length bodies, such as GB Energy and Skills England.",
      "Perhaps it is human nature - that your own arm's length bodies don't feel as pernicious as ones dreamt up by a predecessor.",
      "Beyond the comparisons, the reason all this matters is the government is up against a pervasive sense that nothing works any more.",
      "Think the 8am scramble for an appointment with the doctor and the waiting lists for an operation for a start.",
      "Some senior Labour figures fret privately that their talk of \"missions\" and a \"Plan for Change\" might seem puny to many in comparison with the scale of that challenge.",
      "The prime minister said: \"Every pound that we spend, every regulation, every decision must deliver for working people. And I don't just mean efficiency...I mean something else which is allowing the state, the government, to operate what I call maximum power.\"",
      "The prime minister's speech is both a symptom of his early frustration at the capacity of government to get stuff done - and an acknowledgement of the urgency to do just that.",

      "The Nasa pair embraced their longer-than-expected stay in space.",
      "They carried out an array of experiments on board the orbiting lab and conducted spacewalks, with Suni breaking the record for the woman who spent the most hours outside of the space station. And at Christmas, the team dressed in Santa hats and reindeer antlers - sending a festive message for a Christmas that they had originally planned to spend at home.",
      "And despite the astronauts being described as \"stranded\" they never really were.",
      "Throughout their mission there have always been spacecraft attached to the space station to get them - and the rest of those onboard - home if there was an emergency.",

      "A group of scientists due to work together for months at a remote Antarctic research station has been rocked after a member of the team was accused of physical assault.",
      "A team of nine researchers were due to spend the Antarctic winter at the South African-run base, which sits about 170km (about 105 miles) from the edge of the ice shelf and is difficult to reach.",
      "But a spokesperson for the South African government told the BBC \"there was an assault\" at the station, following earlier allegations of inappropriate behaviour from inside the camp.",
      "In a further message seen by the BBC, the South African environment ministry said it was responding to the concerns with \"utmost urgency\".",
      "South Africa's Sunday Times, which was first to report the story, said members of the team had pleaded to be rescued.",
      "The ministry said that those in the team had been subject to \"a number of evaluations that include background checks, reference checks, medical assessment as well as a psychometric evaluation by qualified professionals\", which all members had cleared.",
      "In a subsequent statement, the ministry added that it was \"not uncommon\" for individuals to have an initial adjustment when they arrive at extremely remote areas even if assessments showed no areas of concern.",
      "It said when the vessel departed for Antarctica on 1 February \"all was in order\", and the incident was first reported to the ministry on 27 February.",
      "The statement added the department \"immediately activated the response plan in order to mediate and restore relations at the base\".",
      "\"This process has been ongoing on an almost daily basis in order to ensure that those on the base know that the Department is supportive and willing to do whatever is needed to restore the interpersonal relationships, but also firm in dealing with issues of discipline,\" it said.",
      "The department said allegations of sexual harassment were also being investigated, but that reports of sexual assault were incorrect.",
      "The department added that a government minister was personally handling the incident, and the alleged perpetrator had \"willingly participated in further psychological evaluation, has shown remorse and is willingly cooperative to follow any interventions that are recommended\".",
      "The alleged perpetrator has also written a formal apology to the victim, it said.",
      "The Sanae IV research base is located more than 4,000km from mainland South Africa and harsh weather conditions mean scientists can be cut off there for much of the year.",
      "The base typically houses staff who stay through the Antarctic winter for approximately 13 months.",
      "South African research expeditions have been taking place since 1959. The team to the Sanae IV base typically comprises a doctor, two mechanics, three engineers, a meteorological technician and a couple of physicists.",
      "These expeditions, with harsh weather conditions mandating a lot of time spent in a confined indoor space, normally run without incident.",
      "But on Sunday, South Africa's Sunday Times reported that one member of the team had sent an email warning of \"deeply disturbing behaviour\" by a colleague and an \"environment of fear\".",
      "A South African government spokesperson told the BBC that the alleged assault was triggered by \"a dispute over a task the team leader wanted the team to do \u2013 a weather dependant task that required a schedule change\".",

      "\"So issues about hierarchy, about workload allocation, even small things about leisure time or rations or food portions can rapidly flare up to become something much larger than they typically are,\" he told the BBC.",

    "story": [
      "Across the globe more and more Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) are being spotted on \u2013 and off \u2013 the roads.",
      "This is despite predictions from the United Nations of an inevitable pivot towards smaller and more environmentally friendly vehicles because of the urgency of the climate crisis and the rising cost of living.",
      "That pivot has not materialised: globally, 54% of the cars sold in 2024 were SUVs, including petrol, diesel, hybrids and electric makes. This is an increase of three percentage points from 2023 and five percentage points from the year before, according to GlobalData.",
      "Of the SUVs which are now on the road \u2013 both new and older models \u2013 95% are burning fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).",
      "Manufacturers, however, say their new fleets of such cars are increasingly becoming electric, and that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "SUVs are hard to miss. They are heavy and larger with spacious interiors, higher ground clearance and a high driving position with a better view of the road, although smaller versions are also on the market.",
      "Environmental campaigners such as Greenpeace see SUVs as one of the villains of the climate crisis and argue that their manufacturing consumes significant resources given their size.",
      "Experts also say they require larger batteries to power their electric versions, which then further increases the demand for critical minerals, putting even more pressure on the planet.",
      "Momentum was thought to be with smaller, energy-efficient electric vehicles. But the sales of standard-sized electric vehicles (EVs) has actually decreased in major markets such as Japan and Germany, and their sales growth has slowed in India.",
      "And in Europe, sales of SUVs have outpaced those of EVs despite indications more than half a decade ago of an opposite trend. In Europe in 2018, 3.27 million small hatchbacks \u2013 both those powered by fossil fuels and those by electricity \u2013 were sold while 2.13 million were sold in 2024, according to GlobalData.",
      "Its sales forecast manager Sammy Chan said: \"This is partly because of the SUV alternatives being offered in smaller [sizes] whose sales in Europe have now grown to nearly to 2.5 million in 2024 from 1.5 million in 2018.\"",
      "China saw the largest sales of nearly 11.6 million SUVs in 2024 followed by the US, India and Germany, according to GlobalData.",
      "What is driving this SUV growth?",
      "Industry experts say people's purchasing power has been improving in many fast-emerging economies, making SUVs the likelier choice of car.",
      "\"Manufacturers respond to consumer demand and, increasingly, drivers are attracted to dual purpose vehicles given their practicality, comfort and good view of the road,\" said Mike Hawes who is the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).",
      "Automobile industry analysts also say that manufacturers are attracted to high profit margins from SUVs: they can make more money from SUVs even though they make fewer vehicles.",
      "\"It is the industry that has driven the demand through huge marketing and advertising campaigns in recent years,\" said Dudley Curtis, the communications manager at the European Transport Safety Council.",
      "\"SUVs offered the industry a simple way of charging more for a vehicle that does the same thing [as others],\" he said.",
      "Are SUVs an issue?",
      "Because of the robust growth in SUVs sales, the IEA says oil consumption of these  vehicles has increased by 600,000 barrels per day globally between 2022 and 2023, accounting for more than a quarter of the total annual rise in global oil demand.",
      "\"If ranked among countries, the global fleet of SUVs would be the world's fifth largest emitter of CO2, exceeding the emissions of Japan and various other major economies,\" said Apostolous Petropolous, an energy modeller with the IEA.",
      "The agency says that even when compared to medium-sized cars that run on petrol and diesel, SUVs burn 20% more of such fuels as they weigh up to 300 kg more on average.",
      "In fact, road transport is responsible for more than 12% of global carbon emissions which is the main driver of global warming. Scientists say all sectors must rapidly decarbonise if we are to avoid a climate catastrophe.",
      "But industry representatives say in response that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "BMW delays electric Mini over 'uncertainty'",
      "Why don't Europeans buy more American cars?",
      "\"Around two in five of these [new] vehicle models are zero emission as their body type lends itself well to electrification with longer battery range that can reassure consumers concerned about charging accessibility,\" said Hawes, from the SMMT.",
      "\"This has led to the average CO2 emissions of new dual purpose cars more than halving since 2000, helping the segment lead the decarbonisation of UK road mobility.\"",
      "Although the vast majority of new SUVs still burn fossil fuels, IEA officials have said that over 20% of SUVs sold in 2023 were fully electric, up from 2% in 2018.",
      "As for hybrids that can run on both electricity and fossil fuels, a study in Europe by the International Council on Clean Transportation in 2022 found only around 30% of the total distance driven by plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (all types including SUVs) was in electric mode on average.",
      "Similar results were found in other major economies such as the US and China.",
      "Overall, the back-gear towards SUVs, some experts say, has caused a significant setback in the decarbonisation of the transport sector.",
      "\"The trend toward heavier and less efficient vehicles such as SUVs (in countries where it is happening) has largely nullified the improvements in energy consumption and emissions achieved elsewhere in the world's passenger car fleet,\" said the IEA.",

      "The UK is legally committed to reaching net zero by 2050 under a law passed by former Tory Prime Minister Theresa May in 2019. It means the UK must cut carbon emissions until it removes as much as it produces, in line with the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement.",
      "In a speech, Badenoch said net zero cannot be achieved by 2050 \"without a serious drop in our living standards or by bankrupting us\".",

      "But UK energy bills went up in January, and are expected to rise again in April.",

    "story": [
      "Across the globe more and more Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) are being spotted on \u2013 and off \u2013 the roads.",
      "This is despite predictions from the United Nations of an inevitable pivot towards smaller and more environmentally friendly vehicles because of the urgency of the climate crisis and the rising cost of living.",
      "That pivot has not materialised: globally, 54% of the cars sold in 2024 were SUVs, including petrol, diesel, hybrids and electric makes. This is an increase of three percentage points from 2023 and five percentage points from the year before, according to GlobalData.",
      "Of the SUVs which are now on the road \u2013 both new and older models \u2013 95% are burning fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).",
      "Manufacturers, however, say their new fleets of such cars are increasingly becoming electric, and that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "SUVs are hard to miss. They are heavy and larger with spacious interiors, higher ground clearance and a high driving position with a better view of the road, although smaller versions are also on the market.",
      "Environmental campaigners such as Greenpeace see SUVs as one of the villains of the climate crisis and argue that their manufacturing consumes significant resources given their size.",
      "Experts also say they require larger batteries to power their electric versions, which then further increases the demand for critical minerals, putting even more pressure on the planet.",
      "Momentum was thought to be with smaller, energy-efficient electric vehicles. But the sales of standard-sized electric vehicles (EVs) has actually decreased in major markets such as Japan and Germany, and their sales growth has slowed in India.",
      "And in Europe, sales of SUVs have outpaced those of EVs despite indications more than half a decade ago of an opposite trend. In Europe in 2018, 3.27 million small hatchbacks \u2013 both those powered by fossil fuels and those by electricity \u2013 were sold while 2.13 million were sold in 2024, according to GlobalData.",

      "Automobile industry analysts also say that manufacturers are attracted to high profit margins from SUVs: they can make more money from SUVs even though they make fewer vehicles.",
      "\"It is the industry that has driven the demand through huge marketing and advertising campaigns in recent years,\" said Dudley Curtis, the communications manager at the European Transport Safety Council.",
      "\"SUVs offered the industry a simple way of charging more for a vehicle that does the same thing [as others],\" he said.",
      "Are SUVs an issue?",
      "Because of the robust growth in SUVs sales, the IEA says oil consumption of these  vehicles has increased by 600,000 barrels per day globally between 2022 and 2023, accounting for more than a quarter of the total annual rise in global oil demand.",
      "\"If ranked among countries, the global fleet of SUVs would be the world's fifth largest emitter of CO2, exceeding the emissions of Japan and various other major economies,\" said Apostolous Petropolous, an energy modeller with the IEA.",
      "The agency says that even when compared to medium-sized cars that run on petrol and diesel, SUVs burn 20% more of such fuels as they weigh up to 300 kg more on average.",
      "In fact, road transport is responsible for more than 12% of global carbon emissions which is the main driver of global warming. Scientists say all sectors must rapidly decarbonise if we are to avoid a climate catastrophe.",
      "But industry representatives say in response that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "BMW delays electric Mini over 'uncertainty'",
      "Why don't Europeans buy more American cars?",
      "\"Around two in five of these [new] vehicle models are zero emission as their body type lends itself well to electrification with longer battery range that can reassure consumers concerned about charging accessibility,\" said Hawes, from the SMMT.",
      "\"This has led to the average CO2 emissions of new dual purpose cars more than halving since 2000, helping the segment lead the decarbonisation of UK road mobility.\"",
      "Although the vast majority of new SUVs still burn fossil fuels, IEA officials have said that over 20% of SUVs sold in 2023 were fully electric, up from 2% in 2018.",
      "As for hybrids that can run on both electricity and fossil fuels, a study in Europe by the International Council on Clean Transportation in 2022 found only around 30% of the total distance driven by plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (all types including SUVs) was in electric mode on average.",
      "Similar results were found in other major economies such as the US and China.",
      "Overall, the back-gear towards SUVs, some experts say, has caused a significant setback in the decarbonisation of the transport sector.",
      "\"The trend toward heavier and less efficient vehicles such as SUVs (in countries where it is happening) has largely nullified the improvements in energy consumption and emissions achieved elsewhere in the world's passenger car fleet,\" said the IEA.",

      "Elizabeth Holley, an associate professor of mining engineering at Colorado School of Mines, explains that each nation has its own list of critical minerals, but they are generally made up of rare earths and other metals like lithium.",
      "She says demand is booming - in 2023, demand for lithium grew by 30%. This is being driven mostly by the rapid growth in the clean energy and electric vehicle sectors.",
      "Within two decades, they will make up almost 90% of the demand for lithium, 70% of the demand for cobalt, and 40% for rare earths, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "Such has been Musk's concern with getting hold of some of these minerals that three years ago he tweeted: \"Price of lithium has gone to insane levels! Tesla might actually have to get into the mining & refining directly at scale, unless costs improve.\"",
      "He went on to write that there is no shortage of the element, but the pace of extraction is slow.",
      "The US position in the global race",
      "The weakness of the US position in rare earths and critical minerals (such as cobalt and nickel) was addressed in a report published by a US Government Select Committee in December 2023. It said: \"The United States must rethink its policy approach to critical mineral and rare earth element supply chains because of the risks posed by our current dependence on the People's Republic of China.\"",
      "Failure to do so, it warned, could cause \"defense production to grind to a halt and choke off manufacturing of other advanced technologies\".",
      "China's dominance in the market has come from its early recognition of the economic opportunities that green technology offers.",
      "\"China made a decision about 10 years ago about where the trend was going and has strategically pursued the development of not just renewables but also electric vehicles and now dominates the market,\" says Bob Ward, policy director at The London School of Economics (LSE) Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment.",
      "Daisy Jennings-Gray, head of prices at price reporting agency Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, explains that they are critical minerals because they are geologically restricted. \"You cannot guarantee you will have economically recoverable reserves in every country.\"",
      "Some minerals like lithium are abundant on Earth, but often they are located in difficult to reach places, so the logistics of a mining project can be very expensive. In other cases, there is dependency on one country that produces a large share of global supply \u2013 like cobalt from the the Democratic Republic of Congo. This means that if there is a natural disaster or political unrest it has an impact on the price, says Ms Jennings-Gray.",
      "China has managed to shore up supply by investing heavily in Africa and South America, but where it really has a stronghold on the market is in processing (or the separation of the mineral from other elements in the rock).",
      "\"China accounts for 60% of global rare earth production but processes nearly 90% - [it] is dominant on this stage,\" says Gracelin Baskaran, director of the critical minerals security program at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC.",
      "She says the country understands how important this is in economic trade - a few days after Trump introduced tariffs on China its government hit back by imposing export controls on more than 20 critical minerals including graphite and tungsten.",
      "What is motivating Trump is a fear of being at a disadvantage, argues Christopher Knittel, a professor of applied economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).",
      "\"I think what is driving this is because China is the dominant player on the processing side,\" he says. \"It is that processing stage, which is the high-margin stage of the business, so China is making a lot of money.\"",
      "As he puts it, it is a \"happy coincidence\" that this could end up supporting green technology.",
      "The key question, though, is whether the US is too late to fully capitalise on the sector.",
      "A stark warning for the US",
      "In the early days, the green transition was \"framed as a burden\" for countries, according to LSE's Bob Ward.",
      "The Biden administration was highly supportive of green technology industries through its introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in August 2022, which offers tax credits, loans and other incentives to technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, from battery technologies for electric vehicles to solar panels.",
      "By August 2024, it was estimated to have brought $493bn (\u00a3382bn) of investment to US green industry, according to the think tank Clean Investment Monitor.",
      "And yet little work was done to support upstream processes like obtaining critical minerals, says Ms Gray from Benchmark Intelligence. Instead, the Biden administration focused heavily on downstream manufacturing - the process of getting products from the manufacturer to the end consumer.",
      "But Trump's recent moves to procure these critical minerals suggest a focus on the upstream process may now be happening.",
      "\"The IRA put a lot of legislation in places to limit trade and supply only from friendly nations,\" explains Ms Gray.",
      "\"Trump is changing tack and looking at securing critical minerals agreements that owes something to the US.\"",
      "Whispers of another executive order",
      "There could be further moves from Trump coming down the line. Those working in the sector say whispers in the corridors of the White House suggest that he may be about to pass a \"Critical Minerals Executive Order\", which could funnel further investment into this objective.",
      "The exact details that may be included in the executive order remain unclear, but experts knowledgeable with the issue have said it may include measures to accelerate mining in the US, including fast tracking permits and investment to construct processing plants.",
      "Although work may now be under way to secure these minerals, Prof Willy Shih of Harvard Business School thinks that the US administration lacks understanding of the technical complexity of establishing mineral supply chains, and emphasises the time commitment required. \"If you want to build a new mine and processing facility, it might take you 10 years.\"",
      "As a policy of his predecessor, and one that is so obviously pro-climate action, Trump has been vocally opposed to maintaining the IRA. But its success in red states mean that many Republican senators have been trying to convince him to keep it in some form in his proposed \"big, beautiful bill\" - the plan to pile all of Trump's main policy goals into one mega-bill - due to be revealed later this month.",
      "Analysis by the Clean Investment Monitor shows in the last 18 months Republican-held states had received 77% of the investment.",
      "MIT's Dr Knittel says for states like Georgia, which has become part of what is now known as the \"battery belt\" following a boom in battery production following IRA support, these tax credits are crucial for these industries to survive.",
      "He adds that failure to do so poses a real political threat for US representatives who are up for re-election in less than two years.",
      "If Trump loses even just one seat to the Democrats in the 2026 mid-terms, then he loses the house majority - limiting his ability to pass key pieces of legislation.",
      "Carl Fleming was an advisor to former President Biden's Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Advisory Committee and is a partner at law firm McDermott, Will & Emery, advising clients in the clean tech and energy space. He says that despite the uncertainty, investors remain confident. \"In the last month, my practice has been busier than ever, and this is since quadrupling last year following the IRA.\"",
      "He also believes that there is a recognition of the need to maintain parts of the IRA \u2013 although this may be alongside expansion of some fossil fuels. \"If you are really trying to be 'America First' and energy secure, you want to pull on all your levers. Keep solar and keep battery storage going and add more natural gas to release America's energy prowess.\"",
      "But the uncertainty of the US position is little consolation for its absence on the international climate stage, says LSE's Bob Ward. \"When the Americans are on the ball it helps to move people in the right direction and that's how we got the Paris Climate Agreement.\"",
      "For those in the climate space, Trump is certainly not an environmentalist. What's clear is he is not concerned with making his legacy an environmental one but an economic one - though he could achieve the former if he can be convinced it will boost the economy.",

    "published": "Tue, 18 Mar 2025 01:27:38 GMT",
    "summary": "Ways are being developed for subsea cables to \"sense\" whether they are being disturbed or attacked.",
    "story": [
      "The diver had found the fibre optic cable lying on the seabed of the North Sea. He swam closer, until it was near enough to touch.",
      "He reached out his hand. But someone could tell he was lurking there. Someone was watching.",
      "\"He stops and just touches the cable lightly, you clearly see the signal,\" says Daniel Gerwig, global sales manager at AP Sensing, a German technology company. \"The acoustic energy which travels through the fibre is basically disturbing our signal. We can measure this disturbance.\"",
      "Multiple reports of damaged telecommunications cables in the Baltic Sea have raised alarm in recent months.",
      "So important are these cables, which carry huge volumes of internet data between countries, that Nato has launched a mission called \"Baltic Sentry\", to patrol the Baltic Sea with aircraft, warships and drones.",
      "The EU is also stepping up measures to monitor and protect cables.",
      "Despite those efforts the authorities cannot be everywhere at once.",
      "So, some companies are trying to monitor what's going on in the vicinity of any cable \u2013 by using fibre optic signals to listen out for surreptitious underwater drones, or hostile vessels dragging their anchors along the seabed.",
      "It was during tests of AP Sensing's system last year \u2013 not a real attempt at sabotage \u2013 that the diver patted his hand on the subsea cable watched over by the firm.",
      "The company also deployed ships, drones and divers with sea scooters to find out how accurately its software could pick out and identify the presence of these vehicles.",
      "And, the team tested whether their cable could \"hear\" a vessel plunging its anchor into the water.",
      "When pulses of light travel along a fibre optic strand, tiny reflections sometimes bounce back along that line. These reflections are affected by factors including temperature, vibrations or physical disturbance to the cable itself.",
      "Noticing a temperature change along part of a buried cable could reveal that part has become unburied, for example.",
      "AP Sensing shows me a video of a man walking across a lawn before lifting up a rifle and firing it during a test. A fibre optic cable buried in the ground a few metres away picked up the whole sequence.",
      "\"You see every single footstep,\" says Clemens Pohl, chief executive, as he points to a chart revealing disturbances in the fibre optic signal. The footsteps appear as brief blips or lines and the gunshot as a larger splodge.",
      "With this technology, it is even possible to work out the approximate size of a vessel passing above a subsea cable, as well as its location and, in some circumstances, its direction of travel. That could be correlated with satellite imagery, or even automatic identification system (AIS) records, which most ships broadcast at all times.",
      "It is possible to add monitoring capabilities to existing fibre optic cables if one unused, \"dark\" fibre is available, or a lit fibre with enough free channels, the firm adds.",
      "There are limitations, however. David Webb at Aston University says that fibre optic sensing technology cannot pick up disturbances from very far away, and you need to install signal listening devices, or interrogators, every 100km (62 miles) or so along a cable.",
      "AP Sensing says that it can pick up vibrations hundreds of metres away but \"usually not several kilometres away\". The company confirms that its technology is currently deployed on some cable installations in the North Sea, though declines to comment further.",
      "\"People really need an early warning in order to determine what to do,\" says Paul Heiden, chief executive of Optics11, a Dutch firm that also makes fibre optic acoustic sensing systems.",
      "Mr Heiden argues that cables installed solely for the purpose of monitoring marine activity could be especially useful \u2013 one might place such listening cables, say, 100km from a vital port, or in the vicinity of a key gas pipeline or telecommunications cable, rather than within those assets themselves.",
      "That could give operators an overview of vessel traffic in the area, and potentially advance notice of a ship heading towards a critical asset.",
      "Optics11's fibre optic listening technology can be deployed on military submarines, Mr Heiden adds, and he says the firm is soon to begin testing a monitoring cable installed somewhere on the floor of the Baltic Sea.",
      "Demand for fibre optic sensing technology is growing, says Douglas Clague at Viavi Solutions, a network testing and measurement company: \"We do see the number of requests increasing.\"",
      "Some of the cables damaged in recent incidents were made by Swedish cable company Hexatronic, says Christian Priess, head of Central Europe, Middle East, Africa and submarine cable business at the firm.",
      "Acoustic sensing is an emerging technology that Mr Priess suggests will become more common in the future. But there's relatively little one can do to protect a cable from sabotage, in terms of physical strengthening.",
      "Today's fibre optic cables already have metal casings folded and welded shut around the fibres, he says. There is also \"armoury wire\", thick metal cords, running along the outer parts of the cable and in some cases there are two layers of these cords. \"On the UK side of the Channel where you have a lot of rocks and a lot of fishing, you want to have it double-armoured,\" says Mr Priess.",
      "But should a vessel deliberately drag its heavy anchor across even a double-armoured cable, it will almost certainly still damage it, Mr Priess says \u2013 such is the force of the collision or pulling action.",
      "While it is possible to bury cables in the seabed for additional protection, this might become prohibitively expensive over long distances and at depths below a few dozen metres.",
      "\"Cables break all the time,\" says Lane Burdette, research analyst at TeleGeography, a telecoms market research firm. \"The number of cable faults per year has really held steady over the last several years,\" she adds, explaining that the 1-200 faults that typically occur annually has not risen despite ever more subsea cables being installed during that period.",
      "Ms Burdette also notes that, even when a cable is severed, telecommunications networks typically have significant redundancy built into them, meaning that end users often don't notice much disruption to their service.",
      "Still, the visible military response to cable breakages in the Baltic Sea is welcome, says Thorsten Benner, co-founder and director of the Global Public Policy Institute, a think tank: \"It's good that Nato and the European Union have woken up.\"",
      "And while cable sensing technology might be useful, its efficacy in terms of preventing damage rests on how quickly coastguard or military patrols could receive alerts about potential sabotage and react. \"The question is how quickly you could establish contact with a vessel,\" Says Benner.",

      "His order - which was followed by another from Maryland - applies to thousands of probationary workers who were fired at a range of departments, including defence, energy, treasury, and veterans affairs.",

      "\"That should not have been done in our country,\" Judge Alsup said. \"It was a sham in order to avoid statutory requirements.\"",
      "Danielle Leonard, a lawyer representing a coalition of government employee unions, said probationary employees were targeted because they lacked the right to appeal.",

      "Responding to the first ruling, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt accused Judge Alsup of singlehandedly \"attempting to unconstitutionally seize the power of hiring and firing from the executive branch\".",

      "Parents who are worried about their children being on Roblox should not let them use it, the chief executive of the gigantic gaming platform has said.",
      "The site, which is the most popular in the UK among young gamers aged eight to 12, has been dogged by claims of some children being exposed to explicit or harmful content through its games, alongside multiple reported allegations of bullying and grooming.",
      "But its co-founder and CEO Dave Baszucki insisted that the company is vigilant in protecting its users and pointed out that \"tens of millions\" of people have \"amazing experiences\" on the site.",
      "When asked what his message is to parents who don't want their children on the platform, Mr Baszucki said: \"My first message would be, if you're not comfortable, don't let your kids be on Roblox.\"",
      "\"That sounds a little counter-intuitive, but I would always trust parents to make their own decisions,\" he told BBC News in an exclusive interview.",
      "Responding to the interview, Mumsnet boss Justine Roberts said parents on the forum had spoken of how they struggled to manage their children's use of Roblox.",
      "\"There are parental controls, and our users would urge constant parental supervision,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"But we all know that with the best will in the world life sometimes gets in the way.",
      "\"If you've got multiple children you're looking after and things happen, and you probably can't 24/7 watch everything they're doing, even if you've got all your parental controls set.\"",
      "Ellie Gibson - from the Scummy Mummies podcast - said Mr Baszucki's message risked sounding \"a bit of a get out\".",
      "\"It's much easier said than done, especially when all their friends are playing it,\" she told the BBC.",
      "Gaming giant",
      "US-based Roblox is one of the world's largest games platforms, with more monthly users than Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation combined. In 2024 it averaged more than 80 million players per day \u2013 roughly 40% of them below the age of 13. Its vast empire includes some 40 million user-generated games and experiences.",
      "In the UK the Online Safety Act, which comes in to force in April, has strict laws for all tech firms specifically aimed at protecting children from online harms.",
      "But Mr Baszucki says he remains confident in Roblox's safety tools and insists the firm goes above and beyond to keep its users safe.",
      "\"We do in the company take the attitude that any bad, even one bad incident, is one too many,\" he says.",
      "\"We watch for bullying, we watch for harassment, we filter all of those kinds of things, and I would say behind the scenes, the analysis goes on all the way to, if necessary, reaching out to law enforcement.\"",
      "Players who choose not to display what he calls \"civility\" can face temporary time-outs and longer bans, and Roblox claims to analyse all communications that pass between members on the platform, increasingly using more advanced AI systems and other tech to do so \u2014 and anything flagged is sent for further investigation.",
      "In November last year, under 13s were banned from sending direct messages, and also from playing in \"hangout experiences\" which features chat between players.",
      "Safety filters bypassed",
      "However, the BBC was able to create two fake accounts, one aged 15 and one aged 27, on unlinked devices and exchange messages between the two.",
      "While the filters caught our attempts to overtly move the conversation onto a different platform, we found easy ways to re-word requests to chat elsewhere and make suggestions about playing more adult games.",
      "When we showed the Roblox boss these findings, he argued that our example highlighted the comparative safety of Roblox: that people felt they had to take content which might breach Roblox's rules to other platforms.",
      "\"We don't condone any type of image-sharing on our own platform, and you'll see us getting more and more, I think, way beyond where the law is on this type of behaviour,\" Mr Baszucki says.",
      "He admits there is a delicate balance between encouraging friendships between young people, and blocking opportunities for them come to harm, but says he is confident Roblox can manage both.",
      "We also put to him some Roblox game titles that the BBC has discovered were recommended by the platform to an 11 year-old recently, including:",
      "'Late Night Boys And Girls Club RP''Special Forces Simulator'''Squid Game''Shoot down planes\u2026because why not?'",
      "'Late Night Boys And Girls Club RP'",
      "'Special Forces Simulator''",
      "'Squid Game'",
      "'Shoot down planes\u2026because why not?'",
      "When we asked whether he thought they were appropriate, he said he puts his faith in the platform's age rating systems.",
      "\"One thing that's really important for the way we do things here, is it's not just on the title of the experience, it's literally on the content of the experience as well,\" he says.",

      "Mr Baszucki founded the platform with Eric Cassel in 2004 and released it to the public in 2006 \u2013 a year before the first Apple iPhone appeared, heralding the start of the smartphone era.",
      "Mr Baszucki describes his younger self as \"less of a gamer, and more of an engineer\", and the pair's first company was an education software provider called Knowledge Revolution. But they soon noticed that kids weren't only using the product to do their homework.",
      "\"They wanted to play and build stuff. They were making houses or ships or scenery, and they wanted to jump in, and all of that learning was the germination of Roblox,\" he says.",
      "The name Roblox was a mash-up of the words \"robot\" and blocks\" \u2013 and it stuck. The platform grew quickly in popularity \u2013 and there were also early warning signs of its future issues.",
      "Mr Cassel noticed some players \"starting to act out\" and not always behaving in a \"civilised\" way a couple of months after it launched, recalls Mr Baszucki.",
      "He says the roots of building a \"trust and safety system\" therefore began \"very, very early\" and that in those earlier days there were four people acting as safety moderators.",
      "\"It kind of is what launched this safety civility foundation,\" he adds.",
      "But despite attracting decent numbers, it was a year later, when the firm launched its digital currency Robux, that it really started to make money.",
      "Players buy Robux and use it to purchase accessories and unlock content. Content creators now get 70% of the fee, and the store operates on dynamic pricing, meaning popular items cost more.",
      "Mr Baszucki says there was some initial resistance among the leadership team about Roblox becoming more than a hobby for its players, with the introduction of a digital economy.",
      "Robux stayed, and the firm is now worth $41bn (\u00a331bn).",
      "Its share price has fluctuated since it went public in 2021, but overall Roblox shares are worth about one third more than they were six months ago, at the time of writing. Like many big tech firms its value peaked during Covid, when lockdowns meant millions of people were indoors.",
      "Mr Baszucki compares his experience of building Roblox with how Walt Disney may have felt about his creations.",
      "He describes his job as \"a little like having the opportunity he had a long time ago when he was designing the Magic Kingdom\", and is focused on Roblox's ongoing evolution into a Metaverse-style experience where people go about their daily lives in a virtual world, in avatar form.",
      "They have also been public in their ambitions to eventually attract 10% of the world's gamers.",
      "Asked to describe Roblox in three words, he replies: \"The future of communication.\"",

      "It was 2019 and her California-based firm, Austere, had just agreed to supply several big US retailers with its high-end audio and video accessories that are largely manufactured in China.",
      "Then Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on China, and overnight Deena found herself paying a 25% surcharge on every cable and component she imported \u2013 up from zero previously.",
      "She was forced to absorb the costs and for a while thought she would go bust.",

      "The firm pulled through, but like numerous other US businesses it now finds itself in a strikingly similar situation.",
      "Since returning to office in January, Mr Trump has raised tariffs on all goods imported from China by 20%, and put taxes of 25% on Canadian and Mexican products, only to delay some of them until April.",
      "The president says he wants to force these countries to do more to stop flows of illegal drugs and migrants into America, to bring more manufacturing back to the US, and to address what he sees as unfair trade imbalances.",
      "But the duties are much broader in scope than last time, when they were phased in gradually and many products were granted exemptions.",
      "Goods like smartphones, desktop computers and tablets are now incurring tariffs for the first time, while taxes on others have climbed higher.",

      "\"It's American businesses and consumers who will suffer.\"",
      "Businesses like Ms Ghazarian's are particularly exposed. China is still the number one supplier of electronic products to the US, with imports totalling $146bn (\u00a3112bn) in 2023, according to official data.",

      "At the same time, the US president is now targeting Mexico - another major electronics supplier. And while domestic manufacturing in the US has increased, partly due to tariffs, it is still limited by higher costs and stricter regulations.",
      "\"Yes, Apple now makes some iPhones in India and [the Taiwanese chipmaker] TSMC has been diversifying to Arizona,\" says Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC.",
      "\"But China is still a massive part of the supply chain. Relationships with new suppliers take time to develop, they are costly to develop.\"",
      "Research suggests that companies pass on a large proportion of the costs of tariffs by putting up prices. Earlier this month Corie Barry, boss of US electronics retailer Best Buy, said that the \"the vast majority\" of the new tariffs will \"probably be passed on to the consumer\" because vendors in the industry have such small margins.",
      "In February, Taiwanese firm Acer said the price of its laptops would likely rise by 10% based on the 10% duties in place on China at the time, while US group HP has warned its profits would be lower because of the tariffs.",
      "Ms Ghazarian says she may have to raise her prices this year, but worries it could backfire. \"There is a price point where the customer is satisfied with the value of goods provided.",
      "\"The moment I shift above that I start to lose customers. High inflation has squeezed Americans.\"",
      "During Mr Trump's first term, companies such as Apple successfully secured exemptions for products, and we may yet see carve-outs.",
      "Insiders have also suggested Mr Trump views tariffs as a negotiating tactic and could ease them if he wins concessions, as he did when China agreed to buy more American goods in a deal reached in 2020.",
      "Fears of a US economic slowdown could also make him change course.",
      "For the time being, though, tensions look likely to escalate. China, Mexico and Canada have vowed to retaliate against any US duties imposed on them, and this week Mr Trump threatened to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium only to row back at the last minute.",
      "He plans to impose \"reciprocal tariffs\" on the rest of the world soon, and threatened tariff increases of up to 60% on Chinese goods while on the campaign trail.",
      "There is a risk this could drive up the price of tech goods around the world if China is forced to relocate manufacturing to countries where labour costs are higher. Moreover, countries may hit back with tariffs on imported US technology.",

      "He later accused Putin of rejecting a ceasefire following a barrage of Russian drone attacks.",
      "Among the places targeted was a hospital in Sumy, and power supplies in Slovyansk, said Ukraine's leader.",
      "\"Unfortunately, there have been hits, specifically on civilian infrastructure,\" Zelensky said on X. \"Today, Putin effectively rejected the proposal for a full ceasefire.\"",
      "Trump posted earlier on social media that his call with the Russian leader was \"very good and productive\" and that \"many elements of a Contract for Peace were discussed\".",

      "Israel has \"resumed combat in full force\" against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday night.",
      "In a defiant video statement, he warned that \"negotiations will continue only under fire\" and that \"this is just the beginning\".",
      "His comments came after Israeli aircraft launched massive airstrikes against what the military said were Hamas targets in Gaza.",
      "More than 400 people have been killed in the attacks, the Hamas-run health ministry said, and hundreds more injured.",
      "The wave of strikes was the heaviest since a ceasefire began on 19 January.",
      "The fragile truce had mostly held until now, but this new wave of attacks suggests plans for a permanent end to the war may be off the table.",
      "The airstrikes which hit Beit Lahia, Rafah, Nuseirat and Al-Mawasi on Tuesday shattered the relative peace that Gazans had been experiencing since January, and hospitals are once again overrun with casualties.",
      "The attacks on Gaza have been condemned by Egypt, a mediator in the talks.",
      "The air strikes are \"a blatant violation\" of the ceasefire agreement and represent \"a dangerous escalation\", said Tamim Khallaf, the spokesman for the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.",
      "\"I was shocked that the war started again, but at the same time, this is what we expect from the Israelis,\" Hael a resident from Jabalia al-Balad told BBC Arabic.",

      "The deal involves three stages, and negotiations on the second stage were meant to have started six weeks ago - but this did not happen.",
      "Instead, the agreement was thrown into uncertainty when the US and Israel wanted to change the terms of the deal, to extend stage one which would see more hostages released.",
      "That would have delayed the start of phase two, which was meant to establish a permanent ceasefire and required Israeli troops to pull out of Gaza.",
      "But Hamas rejected this proposed change to the agreement brokered by US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators, calling it unacceptable.",
      "On Tuesday evening, Netanyahu said Israel would continue to fight to achieve all of its war goals - \"to return the hostages, get rid of Hamas and make sure Hamas is not a threat to Israel.\"",
      "US President Donald Trump's administration was consulted by Israel before it carried out the strikes, officials said.",
      "The US National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said: \"Hamas could have released hostages to extend the ceasefire, but instead chose refusal and war.\"",
      "Hamas warned the resumption of violence by Israel would \"impose a death sentence\" on the remaining living hostages held in Gaza, and accused Israel of trying to force it into a surrender.",
      "Speaking to the BBC about the attacks, Dr Sabrina Das, an obstetrician training Palestinian doctors in southern Gaza, said: \"It was all very sudden\u2026 everybody's mood was just shattered because we knew it was the start of the war again.\"",

      "A group representing hostages' families has accused the Israeli government of choosing \"to give up the hostages\" by launching new strikes - and has been protesting outside the Israeli parliament.",
      "The news of the strikes terrified some of the families of Israeli hostages still being held by Hamas.",
      "\"The Israeli government is not perfect, and Israel is not doing enough, because my brothers are not home\", Liran Berman, whose twin brothers are still being held in Gaza, told the BBC.",

    "summary": "Daniel Noboa is calling on international armies to fight the cartels trafficking most of the world's cocaine.",
    "story": [
      "Ecuador's President Daniel Noboa has told the BBC he wants US, European and Brazilian armies to join his \"war\" against criminal gangs.",
      "He added he wants US President Donald Trump to designate Ecuadorean gangs as terrorist groups, as he has done for some Mexican and Venezuelan cartels.",
      "He also said Ecuadorean law would be respected when asked about his recent partnership with Erik Prince, an ally of Trump and founder of controversial private military firm Blackwater.",
      "Violence has soared in Ecuador in recent years, with gangs battling to control drug trafficking routes. Most of the world's cocaine is trafficked through Ecuador's ports.",
      "President Noboa has previously indicated he would like foreign military aid to help tackle drug cartels \u2013 but this is the first time he has singled out the US, Brazil and Europe.",
      "Security \u2013 and how he is dealing with it \u2013 is a top issue for voters ahead of a run-off vote in Ecuador's presidential election on 13 April.",
      "Noboa has defined his 16 months in office through a tough crackdown on gangs and militarising the streets and prisons \u2013 however he has also come under fire from critics who see his tactics as too heavy-handed.",
      "During his term, the murder rate decreased by approximately 16% from 2023 to 2024 but it remains far higher than previous years, and in January 2025 killings hit a record 781 in one month.",
      "In an interview with BBC News, the incumbent president said: \"We need to have more soldiers to fight this war.\"",
      "\"Seventy per cent of the world's cocaine exits via Ecuador. We need the help of international forces.\"",
      "He said what started as \"criminal gangs\" are now \"international narco-terrorist\" groups of 14,000 armed individuals.",
      "Donald Trump's decision to designate some Latin American cartels as terrorist groups has given US law enforcement further powers to fight them.",
      "Noboa told the BBC he wants his US counterpart to do the same with Ecuadorean gangs: \"I would be glad if he considers Los Lobos, Los Choneros, Los Tiguerones as terrorist groups because that's what they really are.\"",
      "Noboa has already ordered the foreign ministry to seek cooperation agreements with \"allied nations\" to support Ecuador's police and army, and is also seeking parliamentary approval to change the constitution to allow foreign military bases in Ecuador again.",
      "As well as constitutional changes, it would require other nations to be willing to offer this. Deploying armies abroad can be risky and expensive but there is some precedent for it. The US had a military base for its anti-narcotic operations in Ecuador until 2009, before these were banned by former President Rafael Correa.",
      "President Noboa's challenge will be convincing figures like Donald Trump in the US, or leaders in Europe where many drugs are shipped to, that it is in their interests too to stop cartels and drug trafficking.",
      "On the alliance with Trump ally Erik Prince, which he announced a few days ago, he said: \"We're fighting an unconventional, urban guerilla war. He has the experience. He's advising our armed forces, our police.\"",
      "Mr Prince founded the private military firm Blackwater that has provided security services to US governments but has also been embroiled in controversy. He sold the company in 2010.",
      "Four Blackwater contractors were convicted and jailed for killing 14 Iraqi citizens in Baghdad's Nisour Square in 2007 and were later pardoned by Trump in 2020.",
      "Does President Noboa want Mr Prince to bring mercenaries to the country?",
      "\"Not necessarily mercenaries,\" he said. \"We are talking about armies. US, European, Brazilian special forces. This could be a great help for us.\"",
      "While some supported the move, some Ecuadoreans cited Mr Prince's past record and feared rights abuses in the country.",
      "When asked about some of Erik Prince's past controversies, Mr Noboa said Ecuador's laws must be respected and warfare conducted legally.",
      "But, he added, cartels had \"violated every single human right possible for the last five years\".",
      "\"They've mutilated people. They've raped thousands of women. They've trafficked human organs. They've traded illegal gold. And moved more than 1,000 tonnes of cocaine a year.\"",
      "Last year, his iron-fist approach came under fire after four boys were arrested by soldiers over an alleged theft and later found mutilated and burned.",
      "Noboa said those soldiers were in jail pending an investigation but that he would \"fight until the end\" to convict those responsible.",
      "He maintained the armed forces were acting proportionately in tackling crime and noted an imbalance between his 35,000-strong military and 40,000 armed gang members.",
      "With the record number of killings in January, leading critics argue his strict approach is failing.",
      "During a campaign rally, his left-wing challenger Luisa Gonz\u00e1lez said: \"The campaign promises made in 2023 were to be delivered in a year and a half. Not two. Not three. Did he deliver? No!\"",
      "Noboa said it was normal to see rising violence before elections in his country, but reiterated that Ecuador could not fight this problem alone: \"This is a transnational crime without a transnational security policy.\"",
      "While Albanian, Mexican and Colombian cartels worked together, there was not a joint security policy among countries affected by drug violence, he said.",
      "Ecuador needs help, he argued, because its economy is smaller than many in Europe or the US where most drugs are shipped to.",
      "He added drug trafficking and illegal mining generated $30bn (\u00a323bn) \u2013 around 27% of GDP \u2013 annually in Ecuador.",
      "He urged countries where consumption of cocaine is high, like the UK, to do more to tackle this arguing: \"The product they're consuming has a chain of violence and misery.\"",
      "Violence and post-pandemic unemployment have driven many Ecuadoreans to flee northward.",
      "They are now one of the top nationalities crossing the dangerous Darien Gap jungle from South to North America.",
      "President Noboa is willing to take back Ecuadorean migrants from the US, but not other nationalities, and said the country was giving returnees technical training and a minimum wage for three months.",
      "For him, the solution is improving \"opportunities\".",
      "\"We need to develop, as an export-based economy, jobs in Ecuador for these people.\"",
      "While he said he \"100%\" empathised with people fleeing violence, he blamed a past \"lack of strong security policy\".",
      "His message to Ecuadoreans now? \"Stay - and you'll see positive results. We're reducing inflation. Companies are hiring. The economy is recovering.\"",
      "Daniel Noboa will face Luisa Gonz\u00e1lez in the run-off vote next month.",
      "He received only 0.5% more votes than her in the first round, suggesting the second round could be very close and polarising.",
      "With security the top issue for voters, his success \u2013 or not \u2013 may depend on whether Ecuadoreans think progress has been good enough.",

    "summary": "The move alters the German constitution, allowing the country to increase its military spending.",
    "story": [
      "German lawmakers have voted to allow a huge increase in defence and infrastructure spending - a seismic shift for the country that could reshape European defence.",
      "A two-thirds majority of Bundestag parliamentarians, required for the change, approved the vote on Tuesday.",
      "The law will exempt spending on defence and security from Germany's strict debt rules, and create a \u20ac500bn ($547bn; \u00a3420bn) infrastructure fund.",
      "This vote is a historic move for traditionally debt-shy Germany, and could be hugely significant for Europe, as Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine grinds on, and after US President Donald Trump signalled an uncertain commitment to Nato and Europe's defence.",
      "However, state government representatives in the upper house, the Bundesrat, still need to approve the moves - also by a two-thirds majority - before they officially become law. That vote is set for Friday.",
      "Friedrich Merz, the man behind these plans and who is expected to soon be confirmed as Germany's new chancellor, told the lower house during Tuesday's debate that the country had \"felt a false sense of security\" for the past decade.",
      "\"The decision we are taking today... can be nothing less than the first major step towards a new European defence community,\" he said, adding that it includes countries that are \"not members of the European Union\".",
      "EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called the vote \"excellent news\".",
      "Speaking at a press conference with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, she said the vote \"sends a very clear message to Europe that Germany is determined to invest massively in defence\".",
      "Frederiksen meanwhile called it \"fantastic news for all Europeans\".",
      "Germany has long been cautious about defence spending, not just for historical reasons dating back to 1945, but also due to the global debt crisis of 2009.",
      "But despite fears the vote would be tight, lawmakers in the end voted in favour of the changes by 513 to 207 - comfortably over the two-thirds majority required.",
      "One leading German newspaper described this vote as \"A day of destiny for our nation\".",
      "Under the measure, any spending on defence that amounts to more than 1% of Germany's GDP would no longer be subject to a limit on borrowing. Until now, this debt brake has been fixed at 0.35% of GDP.",
      "The change could transform the country's partially neglected armed forces in an era of great uncertainty for Europe.",
      "And this vote was not just about defence. It was also about freeing up \u20ac500bn for German infrastructure - fixing things like bridges and roads, but also to pay for climate change measures, something the Green Party insisted on.",
      "Merz, whose CDU party won Germany's general election last month, proposed the measures swiftly after the win.",
      "In an interview on Sunday he specifically mentioned fears that the US could pull back from defending Europe and Trump's talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying that the \"situation has worsened in recent weeks\".",
      "\"That is why we have to act fast,\" Merz told public broadcaster ARD.",
      "It is a significant political win for Merz, who will, when he takes power as chancellor, now have access to hundreds of billions of euros to invest in the state - what some in Germany have called a \"fiscal bazooka\".",
      "It is also an important moment for Ukraine. The defence plans approved today by the Bundestag also allow spending on aid for states \"attacked in violation of international law\" to be exempt from the debt brake.",
      "That will enable outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz to release \u20ac3bn in aid to Ukraine as early as next week.",
      "Merz chose to push the changes through the old parliament, knowing the vote arithmetic was more favourable now than it would be after 25 March, when the new parliament session begins.",
      "The far-right AFD and far-left Linke, which both performed well in February's election, oppose Merz's plans.",
      "Merz has still not agreed a coalition deal to govern Germany after his election win, and has announced ambitious plans to have a government in place by Easter.",
      "Coalition negotiations in Germany, however, can drag on for months at a time."

      "Ms Smith, her boyfriend Jacquen Appollis and their friend Steveno van Rhyn have pleaded not guilty to charges of human trafficking and kidnapping.",
      "Joshlin's disappearance in February 2024 from outside her home in Saldanha Bay, near Cape Town, sent shockwaves across South Africa and despite a highly publicised search for her, she is yet to be found.",
      "Ms Smith initially said that Joshlin, who has a fair complexion and blue-green eyes, had gone missing after she had left her in Mr Appollis's care.",
      "Prosecutors later accused her of having \"sold, delivered or exchanged\" the six-year-old and lied about her disappearance.",
      "The trial, which is now in its third week, is being held at a community centre in Saldanha.",
      "During the first week of the trial, the court heard details about the day Joshlin went missing, including that Ms Smith only alerted the police more than six hours after she had first noticed that the young girl had disappeared.",
      "The court also heard that she appeared calm during the frantic search and seemed more concerned about her boyfriend's whereabouts than the missing child.",
      "More shocking details emerged in the second week.",
      "A local pastor said that as far back as 2023 he had heard Ms Smith - a mother of three - talk of selling her children for 20,000 rand ($1,100, \u00a3850) each, though she had said she was willing to accept a lower figure of $275.",
      "Joshlin's teacher then alleged in court that Ms Smith had told her during the search that her daughter was already \"on a ship, inside a container, and they were on the way to West Africa\".",
      "These revelations paled in comparison to the explosive details made by Lourentia Lombaard, a friend and neighbour of Ms Smith, who turned state witness.",
      "She took the stand last Thursday and over three days detailed the events in the lead up to Joshlin's disappearance that involved a  traditional healer, known in South Africa as a \"sangoma\".",
      "Ms Lombaard alleged that her friend confessed to her: \"I did something silly \u2026 I sold my child to a sangoma\", adding that she had been driven by a desperate need for money.",
      "Joshlin's mother promised those who knew of the plan some money in return for their silence, Ms Lombaard said.",
      "She told the court that she later witnessed Ms Smith pack some clothes for Joshlin into a black bag, which she then saw her carry as the two walked to meet a woman Ms Lombaard believes was the sangoma.",
      "Mother and daughter got into a white car and drove away with the woman, Ms Lombaard said.",

    "summary": "A spokesperson for the South African government told the BBC there had been an assault at the station.",
    "story": [
      "A group of scientists due to work together for months at a remote Antarctic research station has been rocked after a member of the team was accused of physical assault.",
      "A team of nine researchers were due to spend the Antarctic winter at the South African-run base, which sits about 170km (about 105 miles) from the edge of the ice shelf and is difficult to reach.",
      "But a spokesperson for the South African government told the BBC \"there was an assault\" at the station, following earlier allegations of inappropriate behaviour from inside the camp.",
      "In a further message seen by the BBC, the South African environment ministry said it was responding to the concerns with \"utmost urgency\".",
      "South Africa's Sunday Times, which was first to report the story, said members of the team had pleaded to be rescued.",
      "The ministry said that those in the team had been subject to \"a number of evaluations that include background checks, reference checks, medical assessment as well as a psychometric evaluation by qualified professionals\", which all members had cleared.",
      "In a subsequent statement, the ministry added that it was \"not uncommon\" for individuals to have an initial adjustment when they arrive at extremely remote areas even if assessments showed no areas of concern.",
      "It said when the vessel departed for Antarctica on 1 February \"all was in order\", and the incident was first reported to the ministry on 27 February.",
      "The statement added the department \"immediately activated the response plan in order to mediate and restore relations at the base\".",
      "\"This process has been ongoing on an almost daily basis in order to ensure that those on the base know that the Department is supportive and willing to do whatever is needed to restore the interpersonal relationships, but also firm in dealing with issues of discipline,\" it said.",
      "The department said allegations of sexual harassment were also being investigated, but that reports of sexual assault were incorrect.",
      "The department added that a government minister was personally handling the incident, and the alleged perpetrator had \"willingly participated in further psychological evaluation, has shown remorse and is willingly cooperative to follow any interventions that are recommended\".",
      "The alleged perpetrator has also written a formal apology to the victim, it said.",
      "The Sanae IV research base is located more than 4,000km from mainland South Africa and harsh weather conditions mean scientists can be cut off there for much of the year.",
      "The base typically houses staff who stay through the Antarctic winter for approximately 13 months.",
      "South African research expeditions have been taking place since 1959. The team to the Sanae IV base typically comprises a doctor, two mechanics, three engineers, a meteorological technician and a couple of physicists.",
      "These expeditions, with harsh weather conditions mandating a lot of time spent in a confined indoor space, normally run without incident.",
      "But on Sunday, South Africa's Sunday Times reported that one member of the team had sent an email warning of \"deeply disturbing behaviour\" by a colleague and an \"environment of fear\".",
      "A South African government spokesperson told the BBC that the alleged assault was triggered by \"a dispute over a task the team leader wanted the team to do \u2013 a weather dependant task that required a schedule change\".",
      "Incidents in Antarctica are rare, but not unprecedented. In 2018 there were reports of a stabbing at the Russian-operated Bellingshausen research station.",
      "Psychologists point to the effect that isolation can have on human behaviour.",
      "\"One thing we know from these rare occurrences, when something bad happens in enforced isolation or capsule working, is that it's often the small things, tiny things that can blow up into conflict,\" said Craig Jackson, professor of workplace health psychology at Birmingham City University, and a chartered member of the British Psychological Society.",
      "\"So issues about hierarchy, about workload allocation, even small things about leisure time or rations or food portions can rapidly flare up to become something much larger than they typically are,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Gabrielle Walker, a scientist and author who has been on expeditions to Antarctica, said working in such close proximity to a small group of colleagues had risks.",
      "\"You know exactly how they put their coffee cup down and what direction the handle points in; you know that they scratch their nose three times before they sit down; you know everything about them.",
      "\"And in the bad circumstances, it can start to irritate you\u2026 because there's nothing else \u2013 there's no other stimulus and you're with people 24/7,\" she said.",
      "Sources within the Antarctic research community have told the BBC that South Africa has access to an ice-capable ship and aircraft if needed.",
      "But any rescue operation would have to contend with the harsh climate, with temperatures well below freezing and the possibility of strong winds.",

      "It is \"paramount\" to give their troops \"flexibility and freedom of choice\" to defend Nato's eastern flank, they said.",
      "The Ottawa Treaty, also known as the Mine Ban Treaty, came into force in 1997. It aims to ban anti-personnel mines - those aimed at humans - worldwide, and has been signed by more than 160 countries.",
      "But some major military powers - including China, India, Russia, Pakistan, and the US - never signed up to it.",
      "All of the Baltic states had signed the convention by 2005, while Poland joined in 2012.",
      "In their joint statement on Tuesday, the nations' defence ministers said, however, that the security situation in their region since signing the treaty had \"significantly deteriorated\".",
      "\"In light of these considerations, we... unanimously recommend withdrawing from the Ottawa Convention.",
      "\"With this decision, we are sending a clear message: our countries are prepared and can use every necessary measure to defend our territory and freedom,\" the defence ministers wrote.",

      "\"Our nations will continue to uphold these principles while addressing our security needs,\" they wrote.",
      "All four countries are in the Nato alliance, and all four share borders with Russia.",
      "Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the Baltic states and Poland have hugely increased military spending, and leant a great deal of support to Ukraine.",
      "According to the Kiel Institute think tank, by percentage of GDP, the Baltic States and Poland are among the highest donors of aid to Ukraine.",
      "Ukraine is a signatory to the Ottawa Treaty, although it has received land mines from the US during Russia's full-scale invasion, and in the past has told the UN that due to Russia's invasion it cannot guarantee it is abiding by the treaty.",
      "Article 20 of the convention specifically states however that a nation cannot withdraw from the treaty if it is currently at war.",
      "The UN estimates the Ukraine is now the most mined nation in the world."

      "He remembers the bumpy drive to a hospital morgue where he was asked to identify the bodies of his pregnant girlfriend, his cousin and a fellow anti-apartheid fighter.",
      "In response, he had dropped to one knee, raised his fist in the air, and attempted to shout \"amandla!\" (\"power\" in Zulu), in an act of defiance.",
      "But the word caught in his throat as he was \"totally broken\", Mr Dyasi tells the BBC, recalling the sight of his loved ones under the cold, bright lights.",
      "Four decades on, Mr Dyasi sleeps with the lights on to ward off memories of the physical and mental torture he suffered during his four years in prison.",
      "He says that he struggled to build a life for himself in the society he fought for as an underground operative for uMkhonto we Sizwe, the armed wing of the-then banned African National Congress (ANC).",
      "The ANC led the struggle against the racist system of apartheid, which ended in 1994 with the party's rise to power in South Africa's first multi-racial election.",
      "A Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), which was co-chaired by the internationally renowned cleric Archbishop Desmond Tutu, was established to uncover the atrocities committed by the apartheid regime, and a state reparations fund was set up to assist some of the victims.",
      "But much of that money has largely gone unspent.",
      "Mr Dyasi was among about 17,000 people who received a one-off payment of  30,000 rand ($3,900; \u00a32,400 at the time) from it in 2003, but he says that has done very little to help him.",
      "He had wanted to complete his university education but has still not paid for courses he took in 1997.",
      "Now in his 60s, he suffers from chronic health issues and finds it difficult to afford medication on the special pension he receives for veterans who participated in the struggle for freedom and democracy.",
      "Professor Tshepo Madlingozi - a member of South Africa's Human Rights Commission who spoke to the BBC in his personal capacity - says the effects of apartheid continue to be devastating.",
      "\"It was not only about the killing of people, the disappearance of people, it was about locking people into intergenerational impoverishment.\"",
      "He says that despite the progress made over the past 30 years, many of the \"born-free generation\" - South Africans born after 1994 - have inherited the cycle.",
      "The reparations fund has about $110m untouched, with no clarity on why this is the case.",
      "\"What is the money being used for? Is the money still there?\" Prof Madlingozi commented.",
      "The government did not respond to a BBC request for comment.",

      "He is currently representing a group of victims' families and survivors who are suing the South African government for $1.9m over what they say is its failure to adequately handle cases of political crimes that were highlighted by the now-disbanded TRC for further investigations and prosecutions.",
      "Brian Mphahlele was polite and soft-spoken; he would pause before responding to a question, as if waiting for his thoughts to pool in his mind.",
      "He suffered from memory loss, just one aspect of the lasting impact of the physical and psychological torture he had undergone at Cape Town's notorious Pollsmoor Prison.",
      "Mr Mphahlele told the BBC that the 30,000 rand pay-out, which he had received for the violations he endured during his 10 years in prison, was an insult.",
      "\"It went through my fingers. It went through everybody's fingers, it was so little,\" the 68-year-old said on the phone last year from his nephew's home in Langa township in Cape Town, where he lived.",
      "He felt that a more substantial payment would have enabled him to buy his own home and described his frustration at his life in Langa, where he ate at a soup kitchen three times a week.",
      "Since he spoke to the BBC, Mr Mphahlele has died, his hope of a more comfortable life unfulfilled.",
      "Prof Madlingozi says that South Africa became the \"poster child\" of racial reconciliation following the end of apartheid, and inspired the world in many ways.",
      "\"But we have also unintentionally given a wrong message, which is that a crime against humanity can be committed without consequence,\" he says.",
      "Though he feels things can still be turned around.",
      "\"South Africa has an opportunity 30 years into democracy to show that you can make mistakes and fix those mistakes.\"",
      "Mr Dyasi still remembers the sense of freedom and optimism he felt when he left prison in 1990 after South Africa's last white ruler FW de Klerk unbanned the ANC and other liberation movements, paving the way for anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela to become the first black president four years later.",
      "But Mr Dyasi says he does not feel proud of who he is today, and his disappointment is felt by many who fought alongside him and their families.",
      "\"We don't want to be millionaires,\" he says. \"But if the government could just look at the healthcare of these people, if it could look after their livelihood, involve them in the economic system of the country.\"",

    "story": [
      "Chinese state media has welcomed Donald Trump's move to cut public funding for news outlets Voice of America and Radio Free Asia, which have long reported on authoritarian regimes.",
      "The decision affects thousands of employees - some 1,300 staff have been put on paid leave at Voice Of America (VOA) alone since Friday's executive order.",
      "Critics have called the move a setback for democracy but Beijing's state newspaper Global Times denounced VOA for its \"appalling track record\" in reporting on China and said it has \"now been discarded by its own government like a dirty rag\".",
      "The White House defended the move, saying it will \"ensure that taxpayers are no longer on the hook for radical propaganda\".",
      "Trump's cuts target the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which is supported by Congress and funds the affected news outlets, such as VOA, Radio Free Asia (RFA) and Radio Free Europe.",
      "They have won acclaim and international recognition for their reporting in places where press freedom is severely curtailed or non-existent, from China and Cambodia to Russia and North Korea.",
      "Although authorities in some of these countries block the broadcasts - VOA, for instance, is banned in China - people can listen to them on shortwave radio, or get around the restrictions via VPNs.",
      "RFA has often reported on the crackdown on human rights in Cambodia, whose former authoritarian ruler Hun Sen has hailed the cuts as a \"big contribution to eliminating fake news\".",
      "It was also among the first news outlets to report on China's network of detention centres in Xinjiang, where the authorities are accused of locking up hundreds of thousands of Uyghur Muslims without trial. Beijing denies the claims, saying people willingly attend \"re-education camps\" which combat \"terrorism and religious extremism\". VOA's reporting on North Korean defectors and the Chinese Communist Party's alleged cover-up of Covid fatalities has won awards.",
      "VOA, primarily a radio outlet, which also broadcasts in Mandarin, was recognised last year for its podcast on rare protests in 2022 in China against Covid lockdowns.",
      "But China's Global Times welcomed the cuts, calling VOA a \"lie factory\".",
      "\"As more Americans begin to break through their information cocoons and see a real world and a multi-dimensional China, the demonising narratives propagated by VOA will ultimately become a laughing stock,\" it said in an editorial published on Monday.",
      "Hu Xijin, who was the Global Times' former editor-in-chief, wrote: \"Voice of America has been paralysed! And so has Radio Free Asia, which has been as vicious to China. This is such great news.\"",
      "Such responses \"would have been easy to predict\", said Valdya Baraputri, a VOA journalist who lost her job over the weekend. She was previously employed by BBC World Service.",
      "\"Eliminating VOA, of course, allows channels that are the opposite of accurate and balanced reporting to thrive,\" she told the BBC.",
      "The National Press Club, a leading representative group for US journalists, said the order \"undermines America's long-standing commitment to a free and independent press\".",
      "Founded during World War Two in part to counter Nazi propaganda, VOA reaches some 360 million people a week in nearly 50 languages. Over the years it has broadcast in China, North Korea, communist Cuba and the former Soviet Union. It's also been a helpful tool for many Chinese people to learn English.",
      "VOA's director Michael Abramowitz said Trump's order has hobbled VOA while \"America's adversaries, like Iran, China, and Russia, are sinking billions of dollars into creating false narratives to discredit the United States\".",
      "Ms Baraputri, who is from Indonesia but based in Washington DC, first joined VOA in 2018, but her visa was terminated at the end of Trump's first administration.",
      "She rejoined in 2023 because she wanted to be part of an organisation that \"upholds unbiased, factual reporting that is free from government influence\".",
      "The recent cuts have left her \"feeling betrayed by the idea I had about press freedom [in the US]\".",
      "She is also concerned for colleagues who may now be forced to return to hostile home countries, where they could be persecuted for their journalism.",
      "Meanwhile, the Czech Republic has appealed to the European Union to intervene so it can keep Radio Free Europe going. It reports in 27 languages from 23 countries, reaching more than 47 million people every week.",
      "RFA chief executive Bay Fang said in a statement that the organisation plans to challenge the order. Cutting funding to these outlets is a \"reward to dictators and despots, including the Chinese Communist Party, who would like nothing better than to have their influence go unchecked in the information space\", he said.",
      "RFA started in 1996 and reaches nearly 60 million people weekly in China, Myanmar, North Korea, Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos. In China, it also broadcasts in minority languages like Tibetan and Uyghur, apart from English and Mandarin.",
      "\"[Trump's order] not only disenfranchises the nearly 60 million people who turn to RFA's reporting on a weekly basis to learn the truth, but it also benefits America's adversaries at our own expense,\" Mr Fang noted.",
      "While Chinese state media has celebrated the cuts, it's hard to know how Chinese people feel about it given their internet is heavily censored.",
      "Outside China, those who have listened to VOA and RFA over the years appear disappointed and worried.",
      "\"Looking back at history, countless exiles, rebels, intellectuals, and ordinary people have persisted in the darkness because of the voices of VOA and RFA, and have seen hope in fear because of their reports,\" Du Wen, a Chinese dissident living in Belgium, wrote on X.",

    "story": [
      "King Charles gave a warm welcome to the new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney when he visited Buckingham Palace.",
      "It was another symbolic gesture of support for Canada from a King, wearing a red tie, who has to send coded signals rather than spell things out in words, as Canada faces threats from US President Donald Trump.",
      "But the King has sought to make clear his commitment to Canada - and if it had not been for his cancer diagnosis, the BBC understands he would have travelled there for an intended visit in 2024.",
      "There are also suggestions that once Canada's election is out the way, a visit to Canada will be a priority, where he can further demonstrate his support.",
      "Canada will 'never' be part of US, says Carney in first speech as PM",
      "Canada's Carney makes statement by choosing Europe, not US, for first foreign trip",
      "King's pivotal role in Trump and Ukraine balancing act",
      "The new Canadian prime minister told the King that his Order of Canada pin had broken this morning. The King joked: \"Do you want mine?\"",
      "The King congratulated Carney on becoming the new PM, ushering him to a seat, and perhaps hoping that the broken pin was not a symbol of a Commonwealth relationship under strain.",
      "\"These things are rather important,\" said the King, ahead of a 30-minute conversation with no one else in attendance.",
      "Carney later went on to meet UK prime minister Sir Keir Starmer at Downing Street.",
      "Sir Keir hailed the relationship between the two countries and said they had \"so much in common - shared history, shared values, shared King.\"",
      "Carney said he was \"grateful for the welcomes and the constructive discussions\" with Starmer and French president Emmanuel Macron - whom he had met earlier in the day.",
      "At a news conference, he was asked if he felt let down by the lack of public support for Canada from other allies, given Trump's trade war with Canada, and his remarks about making Canada the 51st state of the US.",
      "\"We don't need another country to validate our sovereignty, we are sovereign, we don't need praise from another country, we are proud in and of ourselves,\" he said, adding that Sir Keir had made a point of referring to Canada's sovereignty and to \"our shared sovereign in King Charles III.\"",
      "Symbolic displays",
      "The meeting with Carney is the latest scene in an intricate diplomatic balancing act for a King who is head of state of both the UK and Canada.",
      "King Charles has to show solidarity with Canada without disrupting the UK's relationship with Trump.",
      "The King also has to avoid getting directly involved in politics - and has to speak on advice of ministers. Whatever he might personally believe about Trump's comments about taking over Canada, the King has to keep his thoughts to himself.",
      "Adding to this complicated choreography is that the royals are one of the strongest cards the UK can play with President Trump. He seemed delighted by his second state visit invitation from the King.",
      "So messages from the King are sent in symbolic displays. In case anyone missed the signs over Canada, there have been multiple moments. And then some more.",
      "When the King visited aircraft carrier HMS Prince of Wales, he appeared wearing a set of Canadian medals.",
      "The 60th anniversary of Canada's maple leaf flag might usually have passed without any royal intervention, but there was a fulsome message sent by the King, praising the \"proud, resilient and compassionate country\".",
      "A ceremonial sword for Canada became an event at Buckingham Palace with a formal presentation by the King.",
      "At a tree planting ceremony in Buckingham Palace, the tree chosen was a maple. And when the King sat down at the Commonwealth Service last week, it was on a Canadian chair.",
      "If any of these moments were accidental, they were not being rejected by Buckingham Palace, with royal sources emphasising the King's commitment to Canada.",
      "But there is no avoiding the tensions and contradictions in this balancing act. Emails from Canadians to the BBC's Royal Watch newsletter show that many want a much more robust defence from the King.",
      "\"What a cop out! Throw Canada to the wolves. Giving us back pats for our flag's anniversary doesn't quite cut it. Here sits a monarchist who is seriously rethinking his allegiance to the crown!\" emailed Brian, a Canadian military veteran.",
      "Carol in Vancouver was unhappy at the invitation from the UK for a second state visit by President Trump.",
      "\"I feel ashamed for the Brits feeling they have to follow through with inviting such a boor for dinner.  For the life of me I do not understand why he has this power over you,\" she wrote.",
      "\"As a Canadian, the invitation is a slap in the face to the people of Canada.  If the King is our King (as we are a Commonwealth country), and Trump is basically at war with us, how dare King Charles give him any credence?\" emailed Patricia.",
      "\"As a Canadian I am saddened, appalled, disgusted and angry that King Charles appears to be joining the conga line of supplicants,\" said Jo-Ann in Ontario.",
      "But King Charles will have to keep to the line set by ministers, and if that means maintaining good relations with Trump, he is unlikely to be saying anything more outspoken.",

There is no freedom of speech, there is no freedom of expression and anyone who dares to go against him gets cut to size,\" the 45-year-old said in the first TV interview since her suspension.",
      "In a statement to the BBC, the Senate's Deputy Chief Whip Onyekachi Nwebonyi said Senator Akpoti-Uduaghan was not being silenced and that \"her own legislative activities disprove this claim\".",

      "While rights groups and some social media users have expressed their support for Akpoti-Uduaghan, she also has her fair share of detractors.",
      "After she was suspended, two groups of protesters gathered near parliament in the capital, Abuja - one backing the senate president and the other in support of his colleague, chanting ''Akpabio must go''.",
      "Akpoti-Uduaghan had also been subjected to an onslaught of misogynist abuse on social media since making the allegations, she told the BBC.",

      "In 2023, she ran for Senate and lost the election. The poll was marred by violence and after Akpoti-Uduaghan took the matter to court, the election result was overturned.",

      "Trump did not provide evidence for his claim - which was posted on Truth Social.",
      "BBC Verify has found several instances of Biden signing pardons by hand rather than by autopen.",
      "And a sample presidential signature is used on US government documents when they are stored in the Federal Register - a digital archive. This was the case under Trump as well as under Biden.",
      "Legal experts also told us that there is nothing in US law which would invalidate pardons signed by autopen.",
      "Did Biden sign pardons using autopen?",
      "On Truth Social, Trump said that: \"The 'Pardons' that Sleepy Joe Biden gave to the Unselect Committee of Political Thugs, and many others, are hereby declared VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT, because of the fact that they were done by Autopen. In other words, Joe Biden did not sign them but, more importantly, he did not know anything about them!\".",
      "Trump didn't specify which pardons he was referring to but he has previously referred to the house select committee investigating the 6 January riots as the \"unselect committee\", and has criticised Biden for pardoning family members.",
      "BBC Verify looked through official photographs of Biden in the White House and ones posted on the official White House X account and found a number of examples of him signing pardons by hand.",
      "In October 2022, Biden was pictured signing an order pardoning those in jail for marijuana possession.",

      "Trump appears to have taken his cue from the Oversight Project - part of the Conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation - which has claimed that Biden's 19 January pardons - of some family members and political figures including Anthony Fauci - all had the same autopen signature.",
      "We have asked the Heritage Foundation for its workings. Previously, it has highlighted other Biden documents which it says had autopen signatures, along with screenshots taken from the Federal Register.",
      "The register is the official, daily publication of various presidential and other government documents - which all have a standard signature created from a single sample.",
      "A National Archives spokesperson told the fact-checking website Snopes that: \"At the beginning of each administration, the White House sends a sample of the President's signature to the Federal Register, which uses it to create the graphic image for all Presidential Documents published in the Federal Register,\"",
      "We looked through presidential documents archived by the Federal Register under both Trump administrations and found identical signatures on documents.",
      "That includes Trump's pardons for the 6 January rioters.",
      "Trump had already signed these pardons by hand, as this video showed in January.",
      "Presidential pardons are also published by the US Department of Justice. We have asked it how these documents are archived.",
      "Are documents signed with autopen legally binding?",
      "Legal experts who we spoke to told us that there is nothing in US law which says official documents signed by US presidents - including pardons - are not legally binding if they were signed with autopen.",
      "Andrew Moran, a politics professor at London Metropolitan University, says that previous presidents have used autopen before.",
      "\"On lower-level importance documents, it's not unusual for an autopen to be used.",
      "\"But I would have thought that with something as serious as a pardon Biden would have actually signed it [by hand]\", he said.",

      "\"The President may sign a bill within the meaning of Article I, Section 7 by directing a subordinate to affix the President's signature to such a bill, for example by autopen\", the memo said.",
      "Although George W. Bush did not use autopen himself, President Obama used it in 2011.",
      "Autopen has also been used by earlier presidents including JFK and Harry Truman.",
      "Can presidents declare pardons void?",
      "Professor Erin Delaney, director of the Global Centre for Democratic Constitutionalism at UCL, says that an attempt by Trump to rescind Biden's pardons would be a \"violation of unwritten constitutional norms\".",
      "Critically, he would not be able to pursue this action without prosecuting, or re-prosecuting the individuals who were given immunity, she argues.",
      "Legally challenging Biden's pardons because of autopen would also call into question other aspects of US governance that use automatic signatures, such as bills passed by Congress and signed into law by the president, she added.",
      "Professor Moran says that a president revoking his predecessor's pardon is extremely rare.",
      "\"Historically, the only example I'm aware of is towards the end of Andrew Johnson's presidency in the 1860s, when he issued some pardons which were revoked before they were accepted. But that's a very small number.",

      "Last week, President Volodymyr Zelensky said he believed the Kursk operation had \"accomplished its task\" by forcing Russia to pull troops from the east and relieve pressure on Pokrovsk.",

    "summary": "The prime minister hopes to achieve solid support as he visits the UK and France, writes Lyse Doucet.",
    "story": [
      "Two European politicians, dressed symbolically in red and white, sent a message last week to Canada on social media declaring \"we've got your back\".",
      "Also signalling support was King Charles, who planted a red maple tree on the grounds of Buckingham Palace and wore his Canadian medals during a high-profile visit to a naval warship.",
      "Canada's new Prime Minister Mark Carney has arrived in Paris before heading to London on Monday - a day after his 60th birthday - for his first foreign visit hoping to achieve more than symbolic encouragement. He wants solid support from allies.",
      "Not only is Canada being targeted, like Europe, by a raft of swingeing US tariffs, but Donald Trump is making it clear he wants to take over his northern neighbour.",
      "\"We appreciate all the symbolic gestures but we need more public backing,\" a Canadian official told me in a voice which underlined the nervous disbelief shared by most Canadians \u2013 Trump is not joking when he calls Canada the United States's \"51st state\".",
      "The official messaging from Ottawa about Carney's trip underlines his priorities - finance and fortifying security \u2013 a natural fit for the economist who headed the central banks in both Canada and the UK. A statement from his office said his visit is meant \"to strengthen two of our closest and longest-standing economic and security partnerships\".",
      "His itinerary is full of great symbolism too.",
      "Carney revealed it on Friday during his first speech as prime minister when he hearkened back - with a shiny polish -  to the origins of this former colony. He hailed \"the wonder of a country built on the bedrock of three peoples: indigenous, French and British\".",
      "So there's a third destination on this whistle-stop tour \u2013 Iqaluit, the capital of Canada's northernmost territory of Nunavut and homeland of its Inuit people. That stop, the statement emphasised, was to \"reaffirm Canada's Arctic security and sovereignty\".",
      "Spectacular Arctic and northern terrain makes up 40% of the land mass of the world's second largest country. Protecting it is a critical Canadian concern in the midst of intensifying rivalry among world powers in the Arctic region, which has drawn in the US, Russia, China and more; it's the cold war of all cold wars.",
      "And there's a personal twist. Carney was born in the small town of Fort Smith in the Northwest Territories, which lies next to Nunavut.",
      "His schedule underlines that he also needs to be a quick study in a new skill - retail politics. A federal election, which has to be held by October, is expected to be called very soon. Carney needs to prove that he can engage with voters, in English and French, as naturally as he does with bankers and finance bosses.",
      "And he needs a proper political mandate. He secured a whopping 86% of the vote when his Liberal Party chose to replace Justin Trudeau, who stepped down as prime minister amid growing calls to resign from his own party after a decade at the top.",
      "But Carney doesn't have a seat in parliament; he still doesn't have the vote of Canadians.",
      "His Liberal party has just experienced a dramatic reversal, a \"Trump bump\" as well as a Trudeau one. The party which seemed certain to lose, and lose badly, is now tied with its main Conservative rivals in the polls.",
      "Looking like a world leader, and understanding the world of tariffs and trade, is a good look when you are running for high office in the dark shadow of an external threat.",
      "\"I think part of the purpose of Mark Carney's trip to Europe is to show that he can talk internationally to other like-minded powers at this very important moment,\" reflects the eminent Canadian historian Margaret MacMillan.",
      "Back home, voters will decide if that is what counts.",
      "Carney is certain to talk Trump tactics, in private, with France's President Emmanuel Macron and Britain's Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. They've both taken great pains to flatter the US president in public, and press their case behind closed doors.",
      "Many will be watching to see how Trump addresses Mark Carney - he recently referred to Canada's former prime minister as \"Governor Trudeau\".",
      "Watch: Trump and Macron's history of intense handshakes",
      "Watch: Trump and Macron's history of intense handshakes",
      "Canada's new top talker has been talking tough.",
      "A week ago, when Carney won his party's leadership contest, he invoked Canada's national sport, ice hockey, which has long been locked in rivalry with US teams. \"Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves,\" Carney declared to rousing applause.",
      "\"Make no mistake, Canada will win.\"",
      "But everyone knows this is no game. Carney described this escalating trade war as \"the greatest crisis of our lifetime\". More than 80% of Canada's exports cross the border to the US.",
      "And while there have been a few reports of Canadians flying the US flag, a recent poll by the Angus Reid Institute underlined that a thumping 91% of Canadians reject becoming the 51st state.",
      "Canada says too little, too late as Trump flip-flops on tariffs",
      "Canada says too little, too late as Trump flip-flops on tariffs",
      "On Friday, in Ottawa's icy cold weather, Carney struck a warmer tone, highlighting how he and Trump share a background in business, including real estate.",
      "\"The president is a successful businessperson and dealmaker. We are his largest client in so many industries,\" he remarked. \"Clients expect respect and working together in a proper commercial way.\"",
      "Carney says he \"looks forward\" to speaking with President Trump. But the fact it will be a call, not a visit, is a measure of this moment. Traditionally, the first foreign visit of a Canadian leader is to the US - its closest neighbour and most trusted partner.",
      "On Monday, Carney is expected to sit down with King Charles, Canada's head of state. The British monarch recently expressed his \"deepest affection\" for Canada, and is said to have already penned a private letter to the new prime minister.",
      "In his non-political role, showing love in public may be the limits of the King's power. But even that sends a message to the American president.",
      "Sir Keir has described Canada as \"an ally, and a very important ally too\". But last week, the head of Britain's Liberal Democrats Ed Davey called on him to show more public support for Canada to oppose the \"shocking attacks\" on its sovereignty.",
      "This may be a week of that old adage in diplomacy and politics \u2013 \"to do something and be seen to be doing it\"."

      "What is Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan gang targeted by Trump?",
      "What is the act?",
      "The Alien Enemies Act grants the president of the United States sweeping powers to order the detention and deportation of natives or citizens of an \"enemy\" nation without following the usual processes.",
      "It was passed as part of a series of laws in 1798 when the US believed it would enter a war with France.",
      "The act states that \"whenever there shall be a declared war [...] or any invasion or predatory incursion shall be perpetrated, attempted, or threatened\" against the US, all \"subjects of the hostile nation or government\" could be \"apprehended, restrained, secured and removed, as alien enemies\".",
      "When else has it been used?",
      "The act has only been previously used three times - all during times of conflict involving the US.",
      "It was last invoked in World War Two, when people of Japanese descent - reportedly numbering about 120,000 - were imprisoned without trial. Thousands were sent to internment camps.",
      "People of German and Italian ancestry were also interned during that time.",
      "Before that, the act was used during the War of 1812 and World War One.",
      "What's Trump said - and what's been the reaction?",
      "Though this is the first time the act has been used by Trump, it is not the first time he has mentioned it.",
      "At his inaugural address in January, he said he would invoke the act to \"eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to US soil\".",
      "In his proclamation on Saturday, Trump invoked the wording of the act by accusing TdA of threatening an \"invasion\" against the US. He declared its members \"liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as alien enemies\".",
      "Trump's decision has been criticised by rights groups. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued to stop the removals on the grounds that the US was not at war.",
      "Speaking to BBC News on Sunday, Lee Gelernt, a lawyer with the ACLU, said: \"There's no question in our mind that the law is being violated.\"",
      "A federal judge attempted to stop the use of the law to carry out the deportations, but the White House said this had had \"no lawful basis\", and that the removals had already taken place.",
      "Reacting to a news article covering the judge's order, El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele wrote on social media: \"Oopsie... Too late.\"",
      "Venezuela criticised Trump's use of the act, saying it \"unjustly criminalises Venezuelan migration\" and \"evokes the darkest episodes in the history of humanity, from slavery to the horror of the Nazi concentration camps\".",
      "Katherine Yon Ebright, counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice, said in a statement that Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act was illegal.",
      "\"The only reason to invoke such a power is to try to enable sweeping detentions and deportations of Venezuelans based on their ancestry, not on any gang activity that could be proved in immigration proceedings\", she added."

      "Here is what we do know about Tren de Aragua.",
      "How did the gang start?",
      "Tren de Aragua was originally a prison gang that Hector Guerrero Flores turned into a \"transnational criminal organisation\", according the US state department, which is offering a reward of $5m for information that could lead to his arrest.",
      "Guerrero Flores, 41, was in and out of Tocor\u00f3n for more than a decade.",
      "He escaped in 2012 by bribing a guard and was then rearrested in 2013. Upon his return, he transformed the prison into a leisure complex.",
      "And he expanded the gang's influence far beyond the jail's gates, seizing control of gold mines in Bolivar state, drug corridors on the Caribbean coast, and clandestine border crossings between Venezuela and Colombia, according to the US state department.",
      "The gang's name translates as \"Train of Aragua\", and it may have come from a railroad workers' union. Aragua, on Venezuela's Caribbean coast, is one of the country's 23 states.",
      "Luis Izquiel, a criminology professor at the Central University of Venezuela, told the BBC that the union controlled a section of the railway that crossed Aragua and would extort contractors and sell jobs on work sites.",
      "Tren de Aragua has under Guerrero Flores's leadership expanded into Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Chile and diversified from extorting migrants into sex-trafficking, contract killing and kidnapping.",
      "How big is the gang?",
      "By most accounts, Tren de Aragua spread out of Venezuela when the country entered a humanitarian and economic emergency in 2014 that made crime less profitable, and now is believed to have nodes in eight other countries, including the US.",
      "The group, in part, operates by forming alliances and partnerships with local criminal organisations.",
      "In Ecuador, for example, the gang is believed to work with groups loosely affiliated with Mexico's Sinaloa cartel, while in Colombia some have alleged that they have worked with members of the left-wing National Liberation Army guerrilla group, or ELN.",
      "Ronna R\u00edsquez, a journalist who has written the definitive book on the group, estimated last year that the organisation has 5,000 members and annual profits of between $10m and $15m.",
      "Others have estimated its membership at roughly half that figure.",
      "A prosecutor in Chile has called Tren de Aragua a \"brutal organisation\" that uses murder and torture to achieve its aims.",
      "While it is smaller or less wealthy than other criminal groups in Latin America, Tren de Aragua is often compared to the ultra-violent MS-13 gang from El Salvador.",

      "On Saturday, Trump invoked the 18th Century Alien Enemies Act as he accused Tren de Aragua of \"perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion of predatory incursion against the territory of the United States\".",
      "He said the gang was engaged in \"irregular warfare\" against the US at the direction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.",
      "Shortly after taking office in January, Trump also declared Tren de Aragua a foreign terrorist organisation, placing the group in the same category as the Islamic State and Boko Haram, Nigeria's Islamist militants.",
      "In Texas, Florida, New York and Illinois, alleged Tren de Aragua members have been arrested in recent months and charged with crimes ranging from murder to kidnapping.",

    "summary": "Dhaka and Islamabad are growing closer after years of mistrust, but what does this mean for India?",
    "story": [
      "The dramatic political developments in Bangladesh that led to prime minister Sheikh Hasina being ousted last year have thrown up many surprises - including Dhaka's growing closeness with one-time foe Pakistan.",
      "Last month, after decades of troubled relations, the two countries began directly trading for the first time, with Dhaka importing 50,000 tonnes of rice from Pakistan. Direct flights and military contacts have also been revived, visa procedures have been simplified, and there are reports of co-operation on security matters.",
      "The countries - separated by the landmass of India - have deep, painful historical ties. The animosity between them goes back to 1971, when Bangladesh - then known as East Pakistan - launched a struggle to gain independence from Islamabad. India supported the Bengali rebels during the nine-month war which led to the formation of Bangladesh.",
      "While the scars from that period run deep, Dhaka had cordial relations with Islamabad between 2001 and 2006, when a coalition of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the Jamaat-e-Islami governed the country.",
      "This changed during Hasina's 15-year rule from 2009 - when she was strongly backed by Delhi and maintained a distance from Pakistan. But after she fled to India following mass protests against her government, ties seem to be thawing.",
      "\"For the past 15 years, the Pakistan-Bangladesh relationship was on a slightly difficult trajectory,\" says Humayun Kabir, a former senior Bangladeshi diplomat, adding that the relationship seems to now be returning to that of \"two normal neighbours\".",
      "The developments are being watched closely, particularly in India, which has a long history of hostile relations with Pakistan.",
      "Relations between Dhaka and Delhi have been frosty since Hasina's exit. India has not reacted to Bangladesh's demands to extradite her to face charges of crimes against humanity, money laundering and corruption. Hasina denies the accusations against her.",
      "Some experts think the reviving of relations between Dhaka and Islamabad is a strategic move.",
      "\"Pakistan and Bangladesh have a tactical relationship at the moment. Together, they want to represent a pushback against the dominance of India,\" says Ayesha Siddiqa, a Pakistani academic who is a senior fellow at King's College in London.",
      "There have been other developments apart from starting direct trade.",
      "Muhammad Yunus, head of the interim Bangladesh government, met Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif at multilateral forums several times in recent months.",
      "And then there is a growing military relationship.",
      "A high-level Bangladeshi military delegation made a rare visit to Pakistan in January and held talks with influential army chief General Asim Munir. The Bangladeshi navy also participated in a multinational maritime exercise organised by Pakistan off the Karachi coast in February. .",
      "Veena Sikri, who was India's high commissioner to Bangladesh between 2003 and 2006, describes the growing closeness between Dhaka and Islamabad as a \"d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\" moment.",
      "During her tenure in Dhaka, she said, India repeatedly raised the issue of \"Indian insurgents getting trained inside Bangladesh with the support of the ISI [Pakistan's intelligence agency] and a section of the Bangladeshi military\".",
      "\"We even provided evidence to Bangladeshi authorities,\" she said.",
      "Authorities in Pakistan and Bangladesh denied these allegations at the time.",
      "The long, porous border between India and Bangladesh makes it relatively easy for armed insurgent groups from India's north-eastern states to cross over from Bangladesh. But, after Hasina's Awami League came to power in 2009, it cracked down on these groups and dismantled their bases.",
      "So the revival of military ties between Bangladesh and Pakistan is \"a major security concern for India\", says Ms Sikri.",
      "\"It's not just the military relationship. The Pakistani establishment is also reviving ties with Bangladeshi Islamist parties like the Jamaat-e-Islami, which supported Islamabad during Bangladesh's independence war,\" she adds.",
      "The Yunus administration's press office has flatly rejected Indian media reports that senior ISI officials have visited Dhaka. It has also described reports that claim Pakistani operatives were working to reopen a camp of an Indian insurgent group in Bangladesh as \"baseless\".",
      "Pakistan's military did not respond to BBC questions on India's concerns over the future role of the ISI in Bangladesh.",
      "Analysts say Bangladeshi politicians are aware that, given the close economic and linguistic ties, Dhaka cannot afford to take an anti-India stance.",
      "And despite apprehensions in Delhi, Bangladeshi diplomats argue that ties with Pakistan cannot be normalised unless issues related to the 1971 war are resolved.",
      "During the war, hundreds of thousands of Bengalis were killed and tens of thousands of women were raped. The war ended with more than 90,000 Pakistani security and civilian personnel surrendering to the joint command of Indian and Bangladeshi forces in what is seen as a humiliating chapter in Islamabad.",
      "Bangladesh has demanded a formal apology from Pakistan for the atrocities committed during the war but Islamabad has shown no inclination to do so.",
      "\"Pakistan needs to own the crimes that had taken place during the independence war,\" said Mr Kabir, the former Bangladeshi diplomat. \"We had also raised the issue of the division of pre-1971 assets between the two nations in several bilateral meetings with Pakistan.\"",
      "Even former Pakistani military officers like Ikram Sehgal accept that \"the main stumbling block in bilateral ties is the requirement of the Bangladeshis that Pakistanis should apologise for what happened in 1971\".",
      "However, the retired Pakistan army major insists that Bangladesh should also address the issue of attacks by Bengalis on Urdu speakers during the struggle for independence.",
      "\"I was a witness to the atrocities that took place against the Urdu-speaking Bihari people [in East Pakistan],\" Mr Sehgal, who now lives in Karachi, told the BBC.",
      "While history casts a shadow over ties between Dhaka and Islamabad, economists point out the two countries can first focus on improving bilateral trade, which currently stands at less than $700m (\u00a3540m), mostly in favour of Pakistan.",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Mar 2025 15:27:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Gene Hackman\u200b died of heart disease and Betsy Arakawa's cause of death was hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, officials said.",
    "story": [
      "Details continue to emerge about the deaths of\u00a0Gene Hackman, his wife Betsy Arakawa and their dog after they were\u00a0found dead in their home\u00a0in New Mexico on Feb. 26.",
      "Over a week after they were found, investigators said Arakawa, 65, likely died days before Hackman, 95,\u00a0and they had different causes of death. Here's what we know from officials.",
      "What did Gene Hackman and Betsy Arakawa die from?",
      "Hackman died of heart disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a significant contributory factor, New Mexico's chief medical investigator, Dr. Heather Jarrell, said at a news conference on Friday, March 7.",
      "\"He had very extensive heart disease,\" she said.",
      "Arakawa's cause of death was hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a severe respiratory illness, Jarrell said. Hantavirus is spread mainly by rodents, and infections are rare, but Jarrell noted the strain in the Southwest has a high mortality rate of about 38-50%.",
      "It does not spread from person to person, and Hackman tested negative for hantavirus, Jarrell said.",
      "Both Hackman and Arakawa tested negative for carbon monoxide poisoning. They also tested negative for COVID-19, the flu and other common respiratory viruses, Jarrell said.",
      "How long had Hackman and Arakawa been dead?",
      "\"There is no reliable scientific method to accurately determine the exact time or date of death,\" Jarrell said.",
      "But with data from Hackman's pacemaker, which showed the last record of heart activity on Feb. 18, \"it is reasonable to conclude that Mr. Hackman probably died around Feb. 18,\" she said.",
      "Cellphone records showed Arakawa made multiple phone calls to a medical concierge service on Feb. 12, according to the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office. Sheriff Adan Mendoza initially said her last known communication and activity was on Feb. 11 when she exchanged emails with a massage therapist and was seen at a local grocery store, CVS and pet food store before returning to her home.",
      "Based on her last known activity, it is \"reasonable to conclude\" Arakawa died before Hackman, but the exact day was not known, Jarrell said.",
      "A search warrant issued on Feb. 26, the day Arakawa and Hackman's bodies were found, states the two showed signs of decomposition, bloating in the face and mummification of hands and feet.\u00a0Mummification preserves a body after death and can happen naturally when the skin dries out, according to the National Library of Medicine.",
      "It is unclear what Hackman knew during the time between Arakawa's death and his own. He showed evidence of advanced Alzheimer's disease, Jarrell said.",
      "Where were Hackman and Arakawa found?",
      "Hackman and Arakawa were found dead in their home outside of Santa Fe, New Mexico, according to deputies who responded to the house at about 1:45 p.m. local time on Feb. 26.",
      "Hackman was found in what is believed to be the home's mudroom. It appeared he had fallen suddenly, the search warrant says. He was found wearing sweatpants, a long-sleeve T-shirt and slippers.",
      "Arakawa was found in a bathroom near the front door of the home, according to the warrant. The door to the bathroom was opened.",
      "Arakawa was on the ground, wearing sweatpants and a sweatshirt. An opened orange prescription bottle and scattered pills were seen on a countertop near Arakawa, the warrant says.",
      "The pills were a thyroid medication that had been taken as prescribed, Jarrell said. They were not believed to have contributed to Arakawa's death.",
      "Hackman and Arakawa's dog also found dead",
      "One of Hackman and Arakawa's dogs was found dead in a closet of the bathroom where Arakawa's body was discovered, the warrant says. Mendoza said the dog, named Zinna, was in a kennel or crate.",
      "Arakawa had picked Zinna up from a veterinary hospital on Feb. 9 after a procedure, Mendoza said. Zinna likely died of starvation and dehydration, according to a veterinary lab report obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "Dogs do not get sick from hantavirus, New Mexico State Veterinarian Erin Phipps said at the March 7 news conference.",
      "There were two other dogs found alive on the property when deputies arrived, the warrant says.",
      "How did Arakawa get hantavirus?",
      "Hantaviruses are primarily carried by rodents. Humans can become infected after exposure to urine, droppings or saliva from an infected rodent.",
      "It was not immediately clear exactly how or when Arakawa was infected.",
      "Her and Hackman's home had a low risk of exposure, \"similar to other well-maintained houses in New Mexico,\" Phipps said, but added there were signs of rodent entry in other structures on their property.",
      "Hantavirus initially presents with flu-like symptoms and can progress to shortness of breath. \"At that point, a person can die very quickly, within 24 to 48 hours roughly speaking, without medical treatment,\" Jarrell said.",
      "No signs of a carbon monoxide leak",
      "There were no obvious signs of a gas leak at the home, deputies said.",
      "Santa Fe Fire Department personnel and the New Mexico Gas Company conducted testing at the scene and did not find evidence of a carbon monoxide leak or problems with the pipes, according to the search warrant.",
      "The gas company issued five \"red tags,\" the sheriff's office said in an update on March 4. One was for \"a minuscule leak,\" or 0.33% gas in the air, at a stove burner, which is not a lethal amount, the office said. The other tags were for violations unrelated to gas leaks or carbon monoxide.",
      "Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas that kills hundreds of people each year.",
      "No signs of foul play",
      "Deputies found the door to Hackman and Arakawa's home \"unsecured and opened,\" the warrant says. They were initially called to the home after someone who arrived to do maintenance did not receive an answer and became concerned, the sheriff's office said.",
      "There were no signs of forced entry or that the house had been rummaged through, deputies said.",
      "What movies was Gene Hackman in?",
      "Hackman's career spanned multiple decades in which he starred in dozens of films.",
      "Some of his notable roles included Detective \"Popeye\" Doyle in \"The French Connection\" (1971), a surveillance expert who suspects a murder in \"The Conversation\" (1974) and a sheriff in Clint Eastwood's \"Unforgiven\" (1992).",
      "He won Academy Awards for best actor in a leading role in 1972 for his performance in \"The French Connection\" and best actor in a supporting role in 1993 for his role in \"Unforgiven.\"",
      "Hackman retired from the screen in 2004.",

      "\"Like everyone who ever shared a scene with him, I learned he was a generous performer and a man whose gifts elevated everyone's work,\" Freeman said.",
      "Who was Betsy Arakawa?",
      "Arakawa, who was raised in Honolulu, was a concert pianist and co-founder of a home furnishing business, according to The Associated Press.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge dismissed the charges Monday against a Minnesota man accused of hiding a stolen pair of ruby slippers that Judy Garland wore in the 1939 musical \"The Wizard of Oz\" after prosecutors informed the court that he died on Sunday.",
      "Jerry Hal Saliterman, 77, of Crystal, who had been in poor health with lung disease and other ailments, had been scheduled to change his plea to guilty in January but that hearing was postponed indefinitely after he was hospitalized.",
      "Federal prosecutor Matthew Greenley notified the court in a one-page motion Monday that Saliterman died Sunday but did not say how or where. U.S. District Judge Patrick Schiltz granted the request and dropped the charges.",
      "Defense attorney John Brink confirmed Monday that his client had died but declined to give details. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Fargo, North Dakota, which is handling the case, did not immediately return a phone call seeking further information.",
      "According to court filings, Saliterman was hospitalized in early January \"for inability to walk and sepsis,\" an infection that can be life-threatening. He attended his arraignment three days later via video from what looked like a hospital room. In an update to the court late last month, Brink told the court that his client had been discharged to a hospice facility and that his prognosis was poor. An accompanying letter from his doctor listed severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring supplemental oxygen and Parkinson's disease.",
      "Saliterman was in a wheelchair and on oxygen last March when he made his first court appearance. He was charged then with theft of a major artwork and witness tampering for his role in the ruby slippers case.",
      "The sequined red slippers were stolen in 2005 from the Judy Garland Museum in her hometown of Grand Rapids. Hollywood memorabilia collector Michael Shaw had loaned his pair to the museum before Terry Jon Martin   stole them.  Their whereabouts remained a mystery for nearly 13 years until the FBI recovered them in 2018. They fetched a record for movie memorabilia of $32.5 million in December, according to Heritage Auctions.",
      "The Judy Garland Museum's efforts to buy back the slippers at auction ultimately failed, despite being bolstered by $100,000 set aside by state lawmakers.",
      "The slippers were one of several pairs Garland wore during the filming. Only three other pairs remain.",
      "Martin, now 78, of Grand Rapids, used a hammer to smash the glass of the museum's door and display case to steal them. According to his attorney, an old associate with connections to the mob told him the shoes had to be adorned with real jewels to justify their $1 million insured value. Martin's attorneys described the theft as \"one last score\" for the aging reformed mobster. But Martin got rid of the slippers when he learned they were fake, and they ended up with Saliterman. Martin pleaded guilty in 2023 and was sentenced last January to time served because of his poor health.",
      "Garland was born Frances Gumm in 1922. She lived in Grand Rapids, about 200 miles north of Minneapolis, until she was 4 years old. She died in 1969. The Judy Garland Museum says it has the world's largest collection of Garland and \"Wizard of Oz\" memorabilia.",

      "WILLIAM: When I was a boy, my father, an Air Force fighter pilot, would tell me stories before bedtime, making up characters and weaving them into exciting tales of adventure. Every story had a moral. Elmer the Elf was always honest and kind, helping those less fortunate. Freddy the Frog was courageous and heroic, saving people from aliens and bad guys.",
      "I waited every night for a new adventure, not knowing that I was also learning a lesson.",
      "When I became a father, I wanted to pass that tradition on to my own children, including my daughter, Kelly.",

      "What I didn't realize at the time was that these stories were more than just entertaining; they were carefully crafted to teach us valuable morals and lessons that he hoped we would carry into our daily lives. Much as his own father had taught him these lessons, he was now passing them along.",

      "KELLY: I've always understood the power of storytelling, but as a new mother, I'm even more aware of how crucial it is to continue our family tradition of reading to my daughter. At a time when reading levels are declining and screen time is on the rise, it's more important than ever to share stories that teach valuable lessons in fun and engaging ways.",

    "summary": "The Emmy-winning star of \"Succession\" earned an Olivier Award for portraying 26 different characters in Oscar Wilde's \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" in London. And now, she's bringing her chameleonic performance to Broadway.",
    "story": [
      "Sarah Snook set the record straight for us: Her last name is pronounced \"Snuke\" (like nuke), not \"Snook\" (as in book or took).",
      "On Broadway this spring, she's neither Snuke nor Snook, but 26 completely different people. The 37-year-old Australian is chameleonic in Oscar Wilde's \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" changing accents, wigs, and gender to tell the story of a man who makes a spiritual bargain to appear eternally young, while his portrait reflects the hideousness of his actions.",
      "The show has suspense, horror, humor, and also a lot of heart. \"People don't often credit Oscar Wilde with something heartfelt,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah, he has a lot of pathos,\" Snook said. \"I think there's a lot of empathy for the human condition \u2013 I think, you know, seeing the soul as a real thing and as a part of your body, personality, spiritual makeup that one might need to protect and look after.\"",
      "It's a performance for which Snook won an Olivier (the British theater award) during the show's run in London's West End.",
      "Oscar Wilde published the story (his only novel) in 1890. Victorian critics called it \"poisonous\" and \"morally depraved.\" Now, almost a century-and-a-half later, the tale feels resonant. Snook said today is an interesting time to come to this story, \"where we have such an image-based culture and ability to construct a visual image to sell to anyone online, on Instagram. And part of the reason of playing multiple different characters is about choosing which mask is the right mask, which is the public/private mask that we show of ourselves.\"",
      "After making her name known abroad, Snook is now beloved by American audiences as Siobhan \"Shiv\" Roy, the cutthroat billionaire she played as the scion of a family empire on the TV series \"Succession.\" The saltiness of her Shiv garnered Snook legions of fans, and several awards.",
      "But Snook initially didn't want to audition for Shiv because, she says, she couldn't relate to her being beautiful and wealthy. \"Yeah, there was nothing in myself that I could see as, like, reflective or accessible in that character,\" she said.",
      "Like Dorian Gray, Shiv is an anti-hero, and Snook's been drawn to those complicated characters for a long time: \"I watched a ton of Disney films when I was a kid, and all I wanted to be was Ursula and Scar, all the villains, all the people who had seeming more complexity to why they were that in the first place.\"",
      "Snook discovered that complexity for herself during one of her first acting gigs back home in Adelaide: \"I used to do fairy parties. It was such a good training ground, 'cause kids, man, they tell you if they're not interested.\"",
      "Was she heckled? \"Yeah. Like, 'Fly! Lemme see you fly! Come on! Why can't you fly? Show us!'\"",
      "Kip Williams, the director and adapter of \"Dorian Gray,\" arrived at the National Institute of Dramatic Art in Sydney the year that Snook had just left. \"There was this word around school that there was this incredible red-headed actress, so my radar as a director was up for Sarah from the beginning,\" he said.",
      "Williams knew that he wanted to collaborate with Snook, and felt that a single actor could embody all the facets of Wilde's legendary work. \"Oscar Wilde talks about this notion that life is one grand act of theater, and that people are always in a form of performance where they are either revealing or concealing parts of themselves,\" Williams said. \"So, the form of this piece \u2013 one performer playing all of these 26 characters \u2013 is an expression of that idea.\"",
      "It is with technology that Williams illuminates humanity. He calls it \"cine-theater\" \u2013 combining live performance with cameras, large screens, and pre-recorded videos.",
      "So, is it fair to call this a one-woman show? \"I think it is definitely a one-person show,\" Williams said, \"but it is also, paradoxically, an ensemble piece. The camera team and the crew are kind of like her co-performers. They dance with her on stage \u2013 literally, one moment.\"",
      "A dance that feels intimately familiar to Snook: \"The feeling of a camera really close to you and not having that disrupt your train of thought or your flow, I think that's something that was really useful in 'Succession,' 'cause we kind of absorbed them as extra characters in the scene,\" she said.",
      "Snook has a few extra characters in her own life, too. She got married during the pandemic and has a young daughter. But as it turns out, Sarah Snook has not bitten off more than she can chew.",
      "\"So, this is your Broadway debut. Is the pressure off since you've already had such a successful run?\" I asked.",
      "Snook replied, \"Actually, one thing that Kip said on the first day of rehearsals is, 'You can only eat an elephant one spoonful at a time.' 'Yeah, sure. Okay. I'll do it that way.'\"",
      "\"So you think you've eaten the whole thing by now?\"",
      "\"No, now I've gotta eat the Broadway part of the elephant!\" Snook laughed.",

      "Simpson maintained his own views even when they crossed Republican orthodoxy. A deficit hawk, Simpson also supported abortion rights. He served on the Immigration Subcommittee and the Veterans Affairs Committee, among others.",
      "After leaving the Senate, Simpson taught about politics and the media at Harvard University and the University of Wyoming. In speeches he urged college students to become politically involved.",
      "In 2022, President Joe Biden awarded Simpson the Presidential Medal of Freedom.",
      "One of Simpson's closest friends was a Democrat, Norman Mineta, a Congressman from California who also served as Commerce Secretary under President Bill Clinton and as Transportation Secretary under President George W. Bush.",
      "The two had met as Boy Scouts when Mineta and his family were imprisoned as Japanese-Americans in the Heart Mountain War Relocation Center near Simpson's hometown of Cody, Wyo., during World War II. Simpson and Menieta bonded over playing pranks on the other Scouts, including a bully whose tent they sabotaged: \"It was raining to beat hell and we kinda channeled the water down into this guy's tent,\" Simpson told \"Sunday Morning.\"",
      "The two friends would not see each other until decades later, when Mineta (who had become Mayor of San Jose, Calif.), won election to Congress. \"And there we were, and we started right over just like that,\" Simpson said.",
      "Mineta said, \"We'd have fights in the sub-committee, the full committee, and yet we'd slap each other on the back and say, 'Come on, let's go have dinner, let's go have a drink.' And they don't do that [today]. They just don't have that kind of personal relationship.\"",
      "In 1988 Simpson and Mineta joined forces to help pass the Civil Liberties Act, signed by President Ronald Reagan, which for the very first time formally apologized to Japanese-Americans, and granted reparations to those who had been imprisoned."

      "The GOP-led committee will next schedule a vote on whether to send Oz's nomination to the full Senate, where he is likely to be approved given the Republican majority.",
      "If confirmed, Oz would be the administrator charged with overseeing the nearly $1.5 trillion spent by the federal government on Medicare and Medicaid. The two health insurance programs for seniors and poor Americans make up\u00a0more than a third\u00a0of the budget.",
      "Medicare\u00a0covers around 65 million people, through programs run directly by the federal government or contracted out to private insurers.\u00a0Medicaid\u00a0supports around 85 million, through programs administered primarily by state governments overseen by CMS.",

He lost that Senate race to Democrat John Fetterman, in a\u00a0narrow contest\u00a0where abortion had ranked as a top issue for voters.",
      "Oz's priorities for Medicare and Medicaid",
      "Oz outlined a vision for the agency focused in large part on modernizing its systems and tools, addressing waste and fraud and incentivizing Americans to make healthier lifestyle choices.",
      "\"Some of these decisions are not difficult. Some of them need to be simplified. And some of them need to be reminded frequently,\" Oz told senators of the healthier lifestyle choices he wants to encourage, adding later that \"the idea of giving incentives to patients is an idea that I think is a worthy one, especially for Medicaid beneficiaries.\"",
      "It will be up to Oz to finalize or abandon some major changes to Medicare and Medicaid sought by the Biden administration, like\u00a0a pricey proposal\u00a0in November to expand coverage to drugs used for weight loss like Wegovy and Ozempic.",
      "Oz did not directly address the proposal during the hearing. But he did promise to continue the Medicare drug price negotiation program launched by the Biden administration, from the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "\"It's the law. I'm going to defend it and use it,\" Oz told senators.",

      "\"I don't think you need to use paperwork to prove a work requirement. And I don't think that should be used as an obstacle, a disingenuous effort to block people from getting on Medicaid,\" he said.",

      "On Monday, CMS proposed making several moves to reverse Biden administration expansions to the insurance marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act, like shortening the open enrollment period and excluding DACA recipients from coverage. In 2022, Oz said that the law \"caused havoc on our health care system\" and that he \"wouldn't have voted for it.\"",
      "During the hearing, Oz criticized health insurance companies misusing prior authorization - sometimes delaying treatment until doctors and patients can persuade insurers that it is necessary - as \"a pox on the system.\"",
      "\"We're spending money, wasting money, trying to do a process that should be automated. I would argue we could limit the number of preauthorized procedures to a thousand,\" he told senators.",
      "Republicans optimistic Oz will be confirmed",
      "In social media posts last month, Oz\u00a0has touted\u00a0\"great conversations\" with key Republicans he would need to win over for his nomination. Multiple Republicans at Friday's hearing said they were optimistic Oz would be confirmed.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, the Republican chair of the Senate's health committee, was among those to sit down with Oz last month. Cassidy is one of four medical doctors in the Senate.",
      "\"Great meeting with Dr. Mehmet Oz, President Trump's nominee to lead the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. It will be great to have a doctor in charge,\" Cassidy\u00a0posted\u00a0on Feb. 5.",

      "A majority of senators on the Senate's health committee advanced Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, the president's nominee to head the National Institutes of Health, and Dr. Marty Makary, the pick to head the Food and Drug Administration, on Thursday.",
      "Oz's potential new supervisor, Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was narrowly confirmed by the Senate a month ago.",
      "Democrats criticized Oz's past",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on committee, during the hearing accused Oz of \"dodging Medicare and Social Security taxes.\" Wyden said a tax loophole has \"benefited Dr. Oz by $440,000 in the last three years.\"",
      "During the hearing, Oz did not respond to the allegation. A memo from the committee's Democratic staff had concluded that Oz may have underpaid his taxes based on a questionairre he submitted, his tax returns and financial disclosures.",
      "\"Now, the doctor will testify about his concern for Medicare's well being, yet he is unwilling to pay the same taxes that millions of Americans pay out of every paycheck,\" Wyden said.",
      "The president's pick to head CMS has earned criticism from some Senate Democrats for months, who have cited Oz's past embrace of \"alarming pseudoscience,\" record of anti-abortion statements and worries over conflicts of interest.",
      "As part of an ethics agreement published last month, Oz said he will resign from positions at several companies, including the nutritional supplement company iHerb and the drugmaker Housey Pharma. He also pledged to divest from several healthcare companies, including insurance giant UnitedHealth Group.",

      "The committee was expected to question him about his long record of criticizing vaccines and the agency he was nominated to lead. Weldon is a physician and a former Republican member of Congress.",
      "In a statement obtained by CBS News, Weldon said that Health and Human Services Secretary\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u00a0was \"very upset\" at his nomination being pulled. Weldon said he had received a call from the White House 12 hours before the scheduled hearing, informing him that the nomination would be withdrawn.",

    "published": "Tue, 18 Mar 2025 18:13:23 -0400",
    "summary": "Here's how economists identify a recession, and where the U.S. economy currently stands amid market turmoil caused by tariff threats.",
    "story": [
      "As tariff uncertainty continues to\u00a0roil the stock market, some economists believe the U.S. could be headed toward a recession, a possibility that even the Trump administration has declined to rule out.\u00a0But how close are we to a recession, and how will we know when we're in one?",
      "While it is notoriously hard to predict a recession, there are definitive criteria that must be met in order for the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a nonprofit, nonpartisan research group, to determine a business cycle is recessionary.",
      "\"There's no one agreed-upon definition of a recession, but the most commonly used metric is two back-to-back periods of negative economic growth,\" said CBS MoneyWatch correspondent Kelly O'Grady. \"That would mean that we would see negative growth in U.S. gross domestic product or GDP, over two consecutive quarters.\"",
      "Notably, a financial quarter's growth measure only becomes clear after it's concluded, \"so we wouldn't officially know we're in a recession until we were already in it,\" O'Grady said.",
      "Recessions are generally marked by rising unemployment and a significant decline in economic activity across sectors as consumers cut back on spending and businesses put a freeze on hiring. Since 1929, there have been 14 recessionary periods in the U.S. Most recently, the U.S. economy entered a brief, two-month long recession from February to April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Although U.S. unemployment ticked up last month, to 4.1% from 4%, it remains low by historical standards. Employers added 151,000 jobs in February, a sign that businesses are still looking to hire.\u00a0Retail sales rose in February, albeit less than expected.",
      "For now, the warning signs aren't yet flashing red, economists say.",
      "\"Right now, things feel uncomfortable given the significant amount of policy uncertainty, the federal layoffs, and we've seen business, consumer and investor sentiment fray,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So to some it feels like the economy is in a recession, but we are not there yet.\"",
      "Another possibility: stagflation",
      "Still, some economists are warning of another, potentially worse outcome for the U.S. economy: stagflation. That informal term \u2014 a mashup of \"stagnation\" and \"inflation\" \u2014 refers to periods of economic distress when growth falters even as prices remain painfully high. Ordinarily, inflation eases when the economy contracts.",
      "The U.S. last experienced stagflation in the 1970s and early '80s, when oil production became more costly and inflation surged. Reduced consumer spending led to a slowdown in economic growth and increased unemployment.",
      "\"A good way to think about stagflation is an economic balancing problem,\" O'Grady said. \"Let's say you've got high inflation ... that means the economy is supercharged with a lot of demand, which drives part of that inflation. So the federal government will try raising interest rates to make it more costly to borrow money, and then slow down some of that demand.\"",
      "How close are we to entering a recession?",
      "For now, economic data suggests that the risk of the economy entering a recession is relatively low. The U.S. labor market\u00a0continues to create jobs\u00a0at a decent clip and consumer spending remains solid.",
      "\"The unemployment rate is slightly elevated compared to one year ago, and inflation is almost half a percent higher compared to last September,\" O'Grady said. \"These might seem like small signs but when you're taking them with other factors like diminishing consumer sentiment and spending \u2014 and then you've got the wild card of tariffs, there are warning lights of a weakening economy. But we don't have a red light yet.\"",

      "\"Peak U.S. exceptionalism is reflected in record rotation out of U.S. stocks,\" the analysts wrote in the monthly report. Instead, investors with a dimming view of U.S. stocks are increasingly going to cash,\u00a0buying gold and investing in other parts of the world, including the Eurozone, BofA found.",
      "After a two-day rebound, leading market indexes were back in the red on Tuesday. The S&P 500 fell 60 points, or 1.1%, to close at 5,615, the Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 260 points, or 0.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 305 points, or 1.7%.",

      "\"The size, speed and breadth of U.S. tariff hike announcements since January is staggering,\" Brian Coulton, chief economist with Fitch Ratings, said in an email.",
      "The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development on Monday downgraded its forecast for U.S. and global growth, citing the risk of escalating trade disputes.

      "That is markedly slower than the 2.3% recorded in the final quarter of last year. For all of 2024, the economy grew 2.8% on the strength of healthy corporate earnings, frisky job growth and resilient consumer spending.",
      "A stark reality is setting in for investors, according to analysts. President Trump's aggressive rhetoric on trade isn't simply a matter of posturing to gain negotiating leverage with other countries; rather, he's perfectly willing to let tariffs fly as part of a long-term strategy of shoring up key American industries and fostering domestic investment.",
      "Whether that strategy ultimately pays off remains to be seen. For now, however, investors are raising their guard.",
      "\"A lot of articles have appeared in the last couple of sessions suggesting the White House is working on improving its 'messaging' on economic/tariff policies and that's great, but investors shouldn't be fooled about what's coming: The trade/tariff agenda represents a seismic change, and even if one buys the view that this will pay off over time, the near and medium-term will see enormous disruption,\" market analyst Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, told investors in a research note.",
      "To be sure, such disruption could bolster stocks if Mr. Trump were to reverse course on his salvo of tariffs set to be deployed next month. And despite the mounting concerns that such trade measures could tip the economy into a recession, BofA's survey shows that only 11% of fund managers expect a hard landing.",
      "And despite the market turbulence, Bret Kenwell, U.S. investment analyst with eToro, notes that nine of 11 S&P sectors remain in positive territory in 2025. The two sectors that have sunk \u2014 technology and consumer discretionary \u2014 have fallen 7% and nearly 12%, respectively.",
      "\"Because investors' favorite stocks (and those with a heavy weighting in the index) have suffered so much, it's likely impacting investor sentiment disproportionately vs. an otherwise more orderly decline,\" he wrote in a research note. \"Historically, similar levels in sentiment have coincided with at least a short-term bottom in U.S. stocks, although it's not clear that we've seen a capitulatory type move that generally marks the bottom.\"",

The CPSC also said Amazon was legally responsible for the recall of more than 400,000 products, including faulty carbon monoxide detectors, hairdryers without electrocution protection and children's sleepwear that violates federal flammability standards.",
      "The CPSC ruling and order came three years after it authorized an administrative complaint against Amazon that alleged it distributed certain products that could pose a danger to consumers. Amazon said its lawsuit comes in response to a final order filed by the CPSC on January 17.",
      "During the proceedings, Amazon did not contest that the products presented a substantial hazard, but argued that it is not a distributor and is not responsible for protecting the public from products sold by third parties. The company reiterated that stance in a lawsuit filed late last week, describing itself as a logistics provider rather than a distributor.",
      "\"The commission may issue recall orders to the manufacturers, distributors and retailers of a product, but not to third-party logistics providers who store the product in their warehouses and transport it to customers,\" Amazon stated its suit, filed on March 14 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.",

    "published": "Tue, 18 Mar 2025 08:59:39 -0400",
    "summary": "Barred from catching salmon off the California coast, fishermen have been running boat tours to stay afloat.",
    "story": [
      "William Smith has long fished the California coast for salmon, taking avid anglers out on his boat in hopes they'll get to wrestle with and reel in the prized catch.",
      "But not anymore.",
      "Smith, known as \"Capt. Smitty,\" now spends time on the seas with aspiring whale watchers, or scattering the ashes of the deceased \u2014 whatever it takes to stay afloat since salmon fishing was barred in California two years ago due to dwindling stocks. Smith said a rise in the Bay Area's Hindu and Buddhist communities has made sea burials more popular, and he now does more than 200 a year \u2014 and that's helping him pay off his $250,000 boat engine.",
      "\"The bills keep going, whether I've got a fishery or not,\" said Smith, who runs Riptide Sportfishing in Half Moon Bay, California. \"There's no season on when people die.\"",
      "California's sport and commercial fishermen have been walloped by two years of salmon closures and are bracing for a potential third, which they blame on a years-earlier drought and state and federal water management policies they say have made it tough for the species to thrive. The closures have taken a toll on people's livelihoods in coastal communities where salmon, fishermen say, is a special fish.",
      "Salmon must swim upstream to lay their eggs, and young fish make their way out to the ocean through California's waterways \u2014 something done more easily when cool water flows are abundant. The fishery has long been strained and the Pacific Fishery Management Council, which manages West Coast fisheries, said there will be very limited salmon fishing this year in California, if at all. A decision is due in April.",
      "The dim outlook comes as President Donald Trump has ordered officials to find ways to put \"people over fish\" and route more water to farmers in California's crop-rich Central Valley and residents of its densely-populated cities. Trump has professed his love for farmers and contends too much heed is paid to the tiny delta smelt, a federally-threatened species seen as an indicator of the health of California's Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.",
      "But salmon depend on this same water system for their survival. And some in the fishing community are wondering if fishermen aren't people, too.",
      "\"We are people that are hardworking and it's our jobs on the line,\" said Sarah Bates, a commercial fishing captain in San Francisco. She said local markets have been devastated by the salmon closures and Bay Area restaurants aren't snapping up halibut or other catch as they did salmon.",
      "Decline in salmon population",
      "The history of commercial salmon fishing in California dates back more than a century, and in the 1970s and 1980s the fishery thrived off the state's coast. Over time, salmon fishing has declined with swings in stocks amid volatile weather patterns in a drought-prone state and water management decisions about when surface water, and how much of it, should flow to farms, burgeoning cities and the ecologically-sensitive bay delta.",
      "California's salmon fishing industry includes commercial fleets and charters that take anglers out for recreation.",
      "Jamie O'Neill, owner of Seattle-based Dock Street Brokers, said many of California's commercial salmon fishermen are getting out of the business, selling their permits or simply letting them expire. Permits now sell for a fraction of what they used to, and there are fewer than 900 permits compared to 1,200 in 2010, he said.",
      "Charter operators, meanwhile, have branched out to host boat tours and party cruises, especially since short trips require little fuel and can help offset the cost of boat maintenance.",
      "While fishermen can still catch halibut, cod and striped bass along the extensive Pacific coastline, they say without the all-popular King Salmon, anglers just aren't coming like before. Each fish requires a different bait and technique, and a fast-swimming salmon is a fighter that anglers aspire to catch.",
      "\"One is hamburger, and one is filet mignon,\" said Andy Guiliano, whose sportfishing boat the Pacific Pearl in Emeryville has expanded its historic tour offerings since the closure. \"It makes the cash register ring.\"",

U.S. tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China are driving up materials costs, while Mr. Trump's trade threats have also stoked market volatility, making housing developers and homebuyers reluctant to take on financial risks.",
      "Uncertainty around when U.S. levies could take effect and how long they could remain in place is making real estate developers reluctant to commit to new projects, impeding home construction. Prospective homebuyers, many of whom have been sidelined by rising mortgage rates, now also face higher costs due to tariffs.",
      "Greg Kraut, co-founder and CEO of KPG Funds, a New York-based property design and development firm, said such concerns are weighing heavily on the housing industry.",

      "By contrast, it's a tough-time for sellers to market so-called fixer-uppers, which could cost more than usual to renovate.",
      "\"The fixer-upper buyer is often more price-conscious to begin with, so the tariff premium is a tough pill to swallow,\" she said.",
      "Dana Schnipper, a partner at building materials supplier JC Ryan in Farmingdale, New York, obtained wooden doors and frames for an apartment complex in Nassau County from a Canadian company that cost less than the American equivalent.",
      "Half the job has already been supplied. But once the tariff goes into effect it will be applied to the remaining $75,000, adding $19,000 to the at-cost total. Once JC Ryan applies its mark up, that means the customer will owe $30,000 more than originally planned, Schnipper said.",
      "Bar Zakheim, owner of Better Place Design & Build, a contracting business in San Diego that specializes in building accessible dwelling units, said Canada remains the best source for lumber.",
      "But by sticking with imported lumber, Zakheim had to raise his prices about 15% compared with a year ago, he told the Associated Press.",
      "\"I'm not about to go out of business, but it's looking to be a slow, expensive year for us,\" he said.",
      "Still, Kraut notes there are limits to how much homebuilders can lift prices to offset their own rising costs. \"You can only pass through so much to the consumer, and if the Walmarts and Targets and homebuilders say we can't afford these prices, they'll say you have to lower lumber prices coming out of Canada or we aren't going to buy it.\"",
      "After Trump earlier this month provided a one-month reprieve from tariffs on U.S. imports from Mexico and Canada, including softwood lumber, the NAHB warned that the levies \"will make it harder for builders and their customers to move ahead with new construction projects.\"",

    "story": [
      "Watching your 401(k) plan savings recede as stocks slide can be gut-wrenching, sparking anxiety about whether you'll ever be able to retire \u2014 a particularly loaded issue for Gen Xers, given the oldest members of the generation are hitting 60 this year.",
      "But financial experts say it's important not to panic in the face of plunging markets\u00a0or rising\u00a0recession risks\u00a0because that can lead to rash decisions that cost you money. Instead, it's important to focus on some key investment questions before taking action, they say.",
      "Since his Jan. 20 inauguration, President Trump's tariff barrage has spooked investors and soured consumers on the economy, with many fearing that his trade policies will trigger inflation and slam economic growth. The S&P 500 last week briefly moved into so-called \"correction\" territory, meaning the index had tumbled 10% from its most recent high, although it regained some ground on Friday.",
      "The downdraft in stocks is causing angst among people saving for retirement, experts say.",
      "\"First of all, you aren't alone \u2014 a lot of people are panicking,\" TIAA wealth management director Doug Ornstein told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Don't overreact, but it might be appropriate to take some action.\"",
      "The market turmoil comes as many employees already feel behind the curve, with 7 in 10 workers saying they believe they could work until they retire and still not have enough money to fund their golden years, according to a new Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies report.",
      "\"Everyone is navigating difficult waters right now and trying to understand what the effects of market volatility will be on their overall retirement savings,\" noted Catherine Collinson, CEO and president of the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies. \"One thing they should be doing, but many aren't, is engaging in the basics.\"",
      "Here are some key questions that experts recommend you consider before making changes to your retirement account.",
      "What is your appetite for risk?",
      "It's easy to think you've got a high tolerance for risk when stocks are in a bull market, as they've been for the last few years. But the current market turmoil may be a sign that that you're more cautious than you thought, experts say.",
      "Risk tolerance is sometimes assessed in a quiz (such as this one from Vanguard) that asks hypothetical questions about your approach towards investing, such as whether you might sell a bond if it lost money in a short period of time.",
      "\"How do I think about risk, and how do I feel about risk emotionally and psychologically \u2014 all of that is completely valid to consider,\" TIAA's Ornstein said.",
      "But it's also important to consider your risk capacity, which involves a more complicated calculation including data such as your age and your retirement horizon. That offers a more objective way to assess risk than your emotional reaction to losing money on investment.",
      "\"Both things are really important: How you feel about risk, and what resources do you have\" to manage that risk, he noted.",
      "Is your time horizon really what you think it is?",
      "Workers often think about their investment horizon as the number of years they have left in the workforce, which might seem daunting to a Gen Xer who is getting closer to retirement.",
      "But the truth, which might not be intuitive to some workers, is that this timeframe is likely much longer than you expect, Ornstein said.",
      "\"Let's say someone is 60 and plans to retire at 67 \u2014 they don't have a lot of time for the market to recover\" before they retire, he noted. \"But if you retire at 67 and live to 95, most of your money will probably remain invested for next 20, 25, 30 years.\"",
      "He added, \"We'll see a lot of ups and downs, bull and bear markets, presidential administrations, and economic cycles over the next 20 to 30 years, so what is happening right now shouldn't dictate a massive change.\"",
      "In other words, someone whose retirement is just a few years away might have an actual investment time horizon of 30 years, which means sticking to their financial plan.",
      "More generally, trying to time the market, or trading individual stocks in an effort to capture gains and avoid losses, is almost impossible and typically leads to financial losses and lost opportunities, considerable research\u00a0has found.",
      "Is your investment portfolio sufficiently diversified?",
      "Although it's important not to overreact when markets are rocky, rebalancing your investments can be a good idea is such periods, Ornstein said.",
      "\"Buy and hold works well when the market is just going up and up,\" he said. When markets head south, \"It may be a good time to consider rebalancing into a more diversified mix of investments.\"",
      "For instance, that means not only checking your mix of equities and fixed income, but also your mix of sub-asset classes within those categories. Adding international stocks, for instance, on top of your S&P 500 index fund could help spread the risk, as well as considering different types of fixed income investments aside from Treasuries.",
      "And don't forget to tend to your emergency savings, given that having a cash buffer can help in times of financial stress and keep you from raiding your retirement account, noted Transamerica's Collinson. Her group's research found that 37% of workers have tapped their retirement accounts, suggesting that many people use their 401(k)s as an emergency fund.",
      "Workers can ask their employers to set aside a portion of their paycheck in another bank account that they earmark for emergency savings. Some employers also are starting to enroll workers in accounts specifically designed for emergencies, a change that was enabled by the Secure 2.0 retirement law.",
      "\"The research indicates many workers lack adequate emergency savings,\" she said. \"Now is the time to find out how to build that up.\"",

There's also another, less-closely watched index that is showing signs of trouble ahead.",
      "The Russell 2000, a stock index made up of small companies, is down more than 18% since its peak in November when Mr. Trump was elected. The index initially rose on optimism that the new administration would create a more business-friendly environment, but that sentiment has changed amid an escalating trade war with some of the U.S.'s closest allies. Mass federal layoffs initiated by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, have also created tremendous uncertainty for businesses.",
      "Now, the small-cap index is headed toward a bear market, defined by a decline of 20% or more from its most recent high.",
      "\"Some small caps like the Russell 2000 were outperforming the S&P 500 after the election, presumably on the theory that there was going to be substantial deal activity, because these companies are more likely to be acquired and merge than the largest of the large-caps,\" Daniel Hornung, former deputy director of the National Economic Council, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"There was a sense that there was going to be deregulation and easier environment for transactions to occur, but there's a huge amount of uncertainty hanging over the economy and markets right now that makes it really difficult for transactions to happen,\" Hornung explained.",
      "Broad-based tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China, plus 25% levies on steel and aluminum threaten to raise costs for both businesses and consumers. Smaller companies with tighter profit margins have a harder time absorbing greater input costs compared to larger ones.",
      "Canary in the coal mine",
      "The Russell 2000 comprises small companies across a variety sectors, and is widely considered to be a benchmark for small U.S. stocks. Unlike the tech-heavy S&P 500, it is not weighted toward a particular industry.",
      "Small companies are more exposed to market shocks than larger ones, given that they operate on thinner margins and typically have higher borrowing costs, making the index more sensitive to changes in the economy.",
      "\"It's more diversified at the sectoral level, so it is more representative of U.S. growth dynamics,\" Skanda Amarnath, a macroeconomist and executive director of Employ America, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Some of the Russell 2000 companies include commercial jet engine company FTAI Aviation, grocery chain Sprouts Farmers Market, plant-based food company Beyond Meat, and language learning tool Duolingo.",
      "Not pointing to a recession",
      "While the Russell 2000 is only two percentage points away from entering bear market territory, Bank of America Research economists say it's not pricing in a recession, and they still expect the economy to grow this year.",
      "\"Historically in recessions the Russell 2000 has sold off close to 40% on average,\" said Jill Carey Hall, head of U.S. small- and mid-cap strategy at Bank of America Research. \"So it's not pricing in greater than a 50% probability of a recession at this point.\"",
      "Still, small businesses could face significant profit margin erosion with tariffs in place.",
      "Based on the levies currently in place on Canada, Mexico and China, and assuming retaliatory tariffs, Bank of America estimates that the earnings hit could be three times larger for small caps than for large caps.",
      "\"These companies have much thinner margins, so a rise in input costs hurts them more,\" Carey Hall said.",

    "story": [
      "The Social Security Administration could soon lose as many as 10,000 workers, according to former agency leaders who expect a large portion of federal workers to accept a buyout offer from the agency.",
      "The SSA last month\u00a0announced a restructuring initiative that gives all employees the option to accept \"voluntary separation incentive payments\" to leave the agency, as part of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE's effort to cut costs\u00a0by culling the federal workforce. Led by billionaire Elon Musk, DOGE has\u00a0abruptly terminated thousands of federal workers\u00a0over the last three weeks, causing turmoil across multiple departments.",
      "The deadline for SSA workers to accept the \"voluntary separation incentive payments\"\u00a0is Friday, March 14. Those who opt in must leave the agency by April 19.",
      "Last month, the agency said it aims to cut the size of its workforce by 7,000 people, focusing on workers and jobs that don't \"provide mission critical services.\"",
      "Former SSA Commissioner Martin O'Malley, who led the agency under the Biden administration from December 2023 to November 2024, expects the actual number to be closer to 10,000 workers. The agency currently employs roughly 57,000 people.",
      "\"Everybody who can is going to take that early out, but I think that 7,000 number is conservative,\" O'Malley said Thursday at a panel discussion on recent changes at the agency and how they could affect customer service, held by the National Academy of Social Insurance (NASI), a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization.",
      "\"They are all going to take it,\" he said, adding that employees who choose to stay, will risk losing their jobs without a bonus.",
      "\"They are communicating to people if you don't take the cash and get out now, you are taking the chance of being fired and playing the game of Russian Roulette that follows,\" said O'Malley, who believes the changes being implemented at the agency will \"cause a total system collapse of social security.\"",
      "The amount of the SSA incentive payments being offered individual workers depends on the employee's classification, or where they stand on the federal payscale. The highest-tier worker would receive a maximum of $25,000.",
      "O'Malley is also concerned that offering to buy workers out in the name of efficiency amounts to the \"greatest amount of waste in operational history by paying people not to work.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Thursday threatened to impose tariffs on wines, Champagnes and other alcoholic products imported to the U.S. from France and other European countries in response to raised tariffs the European Union placed on American whiskey.",
      "In a post to Truth Social, the social media company the president owns, Mr. Trump said the U.S. will retaliate against the European Union after it announced Wednesday that it would be increasing tariffs on U.S.-made whiskey to 50%.",
      "\"If this tariff is not removed immediately, the U.S. will shortly place a 200% tariff on all wines, champagnes, & alcoholic products coming out of France and other E.U. represented countries,\" he wrote. \"This will be great for the wine and champagne businesses in the U.S.\"",
      "Mr. Trump accused the EU of being \"one of the most hostile and abusive taxing and tariffing authorities in the world.\"",
      "Since returning to office, the president has threatened tariffs, and imposed the levies, on a host of major U.S. trading partners. On Wednesday, he increased tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25%, prompting retaliatory action from the EU.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement Wednesday that the countermeasures from the EU are worth 26 billion euros, or $28 billion. The tariffs, set to take effect April 1, target a range of U.S. exports, including beef, poultry, bourbon, jeans and peanut butter.",
      "\"We deeply regret this measure,\" von der Leyen said. \"Tariffs are taxes. They are bad for business, and worse for consumers. They are disrupting supply chains. They bring uncertainty for the economy. Jobs are at stake. Prices will go up.\"",
      "The U.S. exported $1.2 billion in wine and related products in 2024, including more than $167 million to the EU, according to the Department of Agriculture. It is the top importer of wine, bringing in nearly $4.9 billion worth in 2023. France and Italy were the top partners for importing both wine and Champagne into the U.S.",
      "Champagne is a sparkling wine from the Champagne region in northeast France. If it is made outside of that region, it is called sparkling wine.",
      "Chris Swonger, president and CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council, a trade group representing the U.S. spirits industry, called the EU's announcement to reimpose heightened tariffs on American whiskey \"deeply disappointing\"",
      "\"Reimposing these debilitating tariffs at a time when the spirits industry continues to face a slowdown in U.S. marketplace will further curtail growth and negatively impact distillers and farmers in states across the country,\" Swonger said in a statement. \"We urge the U.S. and EU governments to come to a resolution that gets our spirits industry back to zero-for-zero tariffs.\"",
      "According to the Distilled Spirits Council, a retaliatory tariff imposed in 2018 during Mr. Trump's first term, caused exports of U.S.-made whiskey to drop 20%. But over the last three years, exports to the EU grew nearly 60% from $439 million in 2021 to $699 million in 2024, the trade group said.",
      "Since returning to the White House for a second term, Mr. Trump has made tariffs a key area of his economic agenda, though the levies have sparked concerns of a recession and roiled the stock market. The president declined to rule out the possibility of an economic downturn, telling Fox News in an interview that aired Sunday that \"there is a period of transition because what we're doing is very big.\"",
      "In an interview with CBS News, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Tuesday that Mr. Trump's economic policies are \"the most important thing America has ever had\" when asked whether they would be worth it if they lead to a recession. \"It's worth it.\"",
      "Lutnick added, \"The only reason there could possibly be a recession is because the Biden nonsense that we had to live with. These policies produce revenues. They produce growth. They produce factories being built here.\"",
      "The president's trade war escalated this month with 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional 10% tax on goods imported from China, taking effect last week. Beijing imposed retaliatory measures that went into force Monday that target U.S. farmers with levies of 15% on chicken, wheat and corn, and 10% on soybeans, pork, beef and fruit.",
      "The president, however, swiftly reversed course on the levies on imports from Mexico and Canada, pausing the tariffs covered under a 2020 trade deal negotiated during his first administration until April 2. That agreement, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, covers the majority of goods imported from Mexico. Those that are not subject to the deal, however, still face tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump has also exempted other products from his planned tariffs, including providing a one-month exemption to U.S. automakers that were bracing to be hit hard\u00a0by the levies on vehicle parts and components imported from Canada, Mexico and China.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump has made a number of inaccurate claims about Canada in the past week as he imposed new tariff hikes on the country and touted his plans for more.",
      "On Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump imposed a blanket 25% tariff on foreign steel and aluminum, significantly impacting Canada, the largest foreign supplier of these metals to the U.S. An additional 25% tariff on most Canadian goods is set to go into effect on April 2.",
      "Experts warn these hikes could lead to increases in consumer prices, but Mr. Trump has justified them in part by saying he's protecting American manufacturers and incentivizing Canada to crack down on drug crime.",
      "However, in interviews and social media posts, Mr. Trump has exaggerated the size of the U.S.trade deficit with Canada and the amount of fentanyl coming over the northern border. The president also misrepresented Canada's tariffs on U.S. dairy and lumber products.",
      "Here's a breakdown of some of these claims:",
      "Trump's misleading claim that Canada has tariffs above 200% on U.S. dairy products",
      "President Trump said March 7: \"In Canada, we find that they're charging us over 200% for dairy products\u2026 And when I left, we had that well taken care of, but under Biden they just kept raising it.\"",
      "Details: President Trump has suggested Canada unfairly put tariffs of over 200% on American dairy products during President Biden's term, but the level has been unchanged since before Biden took office.",
      "The over 200% tariffs on U.S. dairy products are only triggered if U.S. dairy exports exceed certain yearly duty-free limits, and U.S. dairy manufacturers say they have never been close to exceeding these limits.",
      "Additionally, these tariffs were negotiated during the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which Mr. Trump signed during his first term. Canada's published tariff lists for 2020 and 2025 show tariffs on U.S. dairy products have remained unchanged from the end of his first term through the end of President Biden's term. For example, both lists show the same tariff rate of 245.5% for any cheese products above the duty-free limit.",
      "Canadian Ambassador to the U.S. Kirsten Hillman told told CBS News the dairy tariffs are in place to \"protect our farmers and families.\" Canada is the second-largest importer of U.S. dairy, purchasing about $1.1 billion worth in 2024.",
      "The U.S. sold roughly double the amount of dairy to Canada as Canada sold to the U.S. last year, according to trade data from the U.S. Census Bureau.",
      "Trump's misleading claim that Canada has a \"tremendously high tariff\" on lumber while the U.S. charges \"a tiny fraction of that\"",
      "President Trump said March 7: \"They have a tremendously high tariff, give you the exact numbers in a little while coming out, on lumber. So, they sell us lumber, they have a tremendous tariff. They make it impossible for us to sell lumber or dairy products into Canada, but our numbers are a tiny fraction of that, almost non-existent.\"",
      "Details: On March 4, Canada imposed a tariff of 25% on softwood lumber from the U.S., a rate that is high compared to recent history.",
      "But Mr. Trump did not mention these tariffs are part of Canada's response to the 25% levies on most Canadian goods, including lumber, that the Trump administration initially announced in early March, which are now expected to take effect on April 2.",
      "Before this trade escalation, Canada had imposed zero tariffs on U.S. softwood lumber for years, according to Dustin Jalbert, a senior economist at Fastmarkets who covers wood products.",
      "\"It's certainly true that right now there are tariffs in place, but that was not the case before the kickoff of the trade war. These are retaliatory to what the U.S. instigated, if you will, in early March,\" Jalbert said.",
      "The U.S. had previously placed duties on imported softwood lumber, with tariffs on Canadian lumber rising from 8% to 14.5% in 2024.",
      "Trump's false claim that the U.S. has a $200 billion trade deficit with Canada",
      "President Trump\u00a0said\u00a0March 13:\u00a0\"In the case of Canada, we're spending $200 billion a year to subsidize Canada.\"\u00a0And on Feb. 26 he said: \"The tariffs will make it impossible for them to sell lumber or anything else into the United States. And all I'm asking to do is break even or lose a little bit, but not lose $200 billion.\"",
      "Details: Mr. Trump has repeatedly exaggerated the U.S.-Canada trade deficit, claiming it's as large as $200 billion.",
      "In fact, the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services with Canada in 2024 was closer to $35.7 billion, according to the latest trade data released from the U.S. Census Bureau on March 6.\u00a0 That trade deficit narrowed from $40.6 billion in 2023.",
      "For goods alone, the U.S. bought $70.6 billion more in goods from Canada than it sold in 2024, down from $72.3 billion in 2023.",
      "The overwhelming driver of the deficit with Canada is that the U.S. buys a lot of unrefined oil from the country, according to Julian Karaguesian, a lecturer at the department of economics at McGill University.",
      "\"A lot of Canadian economists say if you take out energy, Canada is running a small deficit with the United States,\" Karaguesian said.",
      "Trump's misleading claim that large amounts of fentanyl come from Canada",
      "President Trump said in his address to Congress\u00a0March 4: \"Much has been said over the last three months about Mexico and Canada, but we have very large deficits with both of them. But even more importantly, they have allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens.\"",
      "Details: Mr. Trump has cited Canada's failure to halt the flow of illicit drugs as a reason for imposing tariffs, saying that fentanyl has been coming from the country \"at levels never seen before.\" He claimed, \"The fentanyl coming through Canada is massive.\"",
      "However, Mr. Trump overstates the amount of fentanyl coming across the northern border. In 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the U.S.-Canada border, accounting for roughly 0.2% of all fentanyl seized by CBP that year. By contrast, approximately 21,100 pounds \u2014 about 96.6% of the total \u2014 was seized at the southern border.",

      "The IRS is drafting plans to cut its workforce by as much as half through a mix of layoffs, attrition and incentivized buyouts as part of President Trump's efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce. The administration is closing agencies, laying off nearly all probationary employees who have not yet gained civil service protection and offering buyouts to almost all federal employees through a \"deferred resignation program\" to quickly reduce the government workforce.",
      "Already, roughly 7,000 probationary IRS employees with roughly one year or less of service were laid off from the organization in February.",
      "But the mass layoffs of probationary workers are now in doubt after a federal judge in California on Thursday ruled that their terminations by the Office of Personnel Management were unlawful and ordered six federal agencies to reinstate\u00a0the employees.

King was replaced by Leland Dudek, who oversaw the SSA's fraud investigation office.",

      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture is cutting two federal programs that provided about $1 billion in funding to schools and food banks to buy food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers, part of what the agency said was a decision to \"return to long-term, fiscally responsible initiatives.\"",
      "The move cancels about $660 million in funding this year for the Local Food for Schools program, which is active in 40 U.S. states, as well as about $420 million for a second program called the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement, which helps food banks and other local groups provide food to their communities.",

      "The decision comes as the Trump administration and Elon Musk's\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, say they are slashing federal spending to reduce government waste.

      "While the $100,000 represents about 2% of the school district's roughly $6 million in annual spending on food, Bilbrey noted that it allowed the district to buy food ffrom small farmers and introduce produce like microgreens to their students. She added that the funding loss comes as her district, like many others, are struggling to keep school meals affordable amid rising food and labor costs.",

    "summary": "Lawyer for the Federal Trade Commission says agency needs to seek trial delay in case against Amazon due to staffing and budgetary challenges.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Trade Commission asked a federal judge on Wednesday to delay a trial in a case accusing Amazon of using deceptive practices in its Prime subscription program, citing staffing and budgetary challenges at the government agency.",
      "Jonathan Cohen, a lawyer for the FTC, made the request before U.S. District Judge John Chun, who is overseeing the legal proceedings from a 2023 lawsuit the commission filed against the e-commerce giant in Washington state.",
      "\"Our resource constraints are severe and really unique to this moment,\" Cohen said during a status hearing on Wednesday. \"We have lost employees in the agency, in our division and on the case team.\"",
      "When the judge asked if the agency's challenges were due to recent cuts in the federal government, Cohen said it was, adding that some employees chose to leave the FTC following the \"Fork in the road\" email sent by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency in January. Staff members who resigned for other reasons also have not been replaced due to a government hiring freeze, he said.",
      "The Amazon trial had been scheduled to start in September. The FTC is seeking to relax some of the deadlines in the case and a delay akin to a two-month continuance. The agency does not want to \"move the trial back more than a couple of months,\" Cohen said.",
      "Currently, the agency's legal team is \"racing at considerable cost\" to meet a late April deadline for discovery while at the same time dealing with restrictive rules on purchasing court documents and travel, Cohen explained.",
      "Other factors could hamper staffers' preparations for the trial, he said. In April, FTC employees will have to spend time packing up and vacating their office building so they can potentially move into \"an abandoned USAID facility,\" Cohen said.",
      "Chun, the judge, asked how \"things are going to be different in two months\" with the issues the agency is experiencing.",
      "Cohen responded by saying he \"cannot guarantee if things won't be even worse.\"",
      "\"But there are a lot of reasons to believe ... we have been through the brunt of it, at least for a while,\" he said.",
      "During the hearing, John Hueston, an attorney representing Amazon, pushed back on the agency's request. He said most of the FTC attorneys assigned to the Amazon case were still employed by the agency.",
      "Even in the case of staff turnover, the government still lacks the grounds to seek a delay since changes in legal teams happen often, Hueston argued. Amazon executives and trial lawyers already cleared their schedules for a September trial, and the company has wanted to clear its name for more than two years, he said.",
      "\"We really want to keep the date\" for the trial, Hueston said.",
      "Amazon Prime enrollment",
      "The lawsuit, which was brought under former FTC Chair Lina Khan, alleged Amazon had enrolled consumers in the Prime program without consent and made it difficult for them to cancel their subscriptions.",
      "The agency filed the case months before it submitted an antitrust lawsuit against the retail and technology company, accusing it of having monopolistic control over online markets. Attorneys for that case, which is scheduled to go to trial in October 2026, presented economic arguments in court last week.",
      "Like other tech companies, Amazon has been attempting to forge friendlier ties with President Donald Trump, who repeatedly criticized the company during his first term.",
      "In December, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said he was \"optimistic\" about Trump's second term. The same month, the company said it would donate $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund. Bezos, along with other tech leaders, was also a guest at the inauguration.",
      "This week, Amazon's Prime Video service began streaming \"The Apprentice,\" the long-running TV show that boosted Trump's profile before he ran for president. The company is also working on a documentary that offers an \"unprecedented behind-the-scenes look\" into the life of first lady Melania Trump.",
      "Meanwhile, Bezos has made changes to The Washington Post, which he owns, that some critics have cast as favorable to Trump.",
      "Before the election, Bezos defended the newspaper's decision not to endorse a presidential candidate as \"right\" and \"principled.\" He rejected speculation that he ordered the non-endorsement to protect his business interests.",

    "published": "Tue, 18 Mar 2025 23:15:54 -0400",
    "summary": "One professor said this JFK assassination release is \"certainly the most useful\" of any so far \"because of the redactions being removed.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Tuesday evening released tens of thousands of pages of government documents related to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy, weeks after President Trump ordered government agencies to make their JFK files public.",
      "The documents were uploaded by the National Archives and Records Administration, the agency responsible for housing the government's collection of records related to the assassination. The Archives said Tuesday that \"all records previously withheld for classification\" have been released, but not all are available online yet.",
      "Shortly after taking office in January, the president took executive action to establish a process to declassify and release any remaining documents related to Kennedy's killing, as well as the assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. The order instructed the director of national intelligence and attorney general to present the president with a plan for the \"full and complete release of records relating to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.\"",
      "Last month, the FBI said it had discovered roughly 2,400 records related to the assassination during a search stemming from Mr. Trump's executive action.",
      "What's in the newly released JFK files?",
      "Mr. Trump estimated the new files contain roughly 80,000 pages. CBS News has a team of reporters sifting through the records to identify what documents contain new information.",
      "Many of the records were expected to be unredacted versions of documents that have been released but partially obscured in the past.",
      "Researchers have estimated there are about 3,000 records related to the case that hadn't been previously released in full. There are 1,123 documents of varying lengths in Tuesday's online release.",
      "Various investigations into the JFK assassination over the years \u2014 some as recently as the 1990s \u2014 swept up classified information that dealt with intelligence gathering methods and friendly foreign governments but were not directly linked to the assassination. Portions of documents, and some entire records, had remained classified for decades to protect sources and methods.",
      "David Barrett, a professor of political science at Villanova University who studies the Kennedy presidency, was examining the documents on Tuesday evening. He told CBS News that \"non-scholars who dive into these documents are going to be baffled as to what most of them have to do with the Kennedy or other assassinations.\" For scholars like him, however, he said it is \"certainly the most useful release of documents that has occurred because of the redactions being removed.\"",
      "\"Now I know who or what is being referred to. So a memorandum on CIA relations with the Miami newspapers, for example, and details on three CIA officers doing technical collection of intelligence in Cuba \u2014 I've never really had those details before,\" he said.",
      "Before the release, Barrett said he didn't expect \"earth-shaking information, either with regard to the assassination or more broadly.\" \"But, you know, you never know,\" he added.",
      "Larry Sabato, the director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics and author of \"The Kennedy Half-Century,\" told the Associated Press that his team is going through the released files in search of a \"long, long list\" of sensitive documents that were previously heavily redacted. He believes some of those passages may concern Cuba or \"what the CIA did or didn't do relevant to Lee Harvey Oswald,\" Kennedy's assassin.",
      "Where to read the new JFK assassination files",
      "The documents have been uploaded to a portal maintained by the National Archives, which can be found here. The Archives maintains the government's trove of records known as the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection.",
      "Not all of the files are available online yet, however. Some are available \"in person, via hard copy or on analog media formats\" at the National Archives at College Park, Maryland. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said the records that are only available in person are being digitized and will be uploaded to the Archives in the coming days. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard will post updates on social media, and the records will also be on the White House website.",
      "Additional documents remain under court seal, including some for reasons of grand jury secrecy. Other IRS-related documents must be unsealed before release, and the Archives and Justice Department are working on making these available.",
      "According to the Mary Ferrell Foundation, a nonprofit that compiles historical government records about the JFK assassination and other events, roughly 3,500 documents in the official collection contained redactions before the latest release. About 75% of those records were produced by the CIA. More than 500 other records were withheld from public release entirely.",
      "The Mary Ferrell Foundation runs its own JFK documents repository on its website, which has deeper search functions for exploring the trove of records. The group typically adds new documents shortly after they are released by the Archives.",
      "Why did Trump release these JFK files?",
      "Mr. Trump campaigned on declassifying and releasing records related to the JFK assassination, in part due to his political alliance with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has long called for more transparency about the assassinations that killed his uncle and father.",
      "In 1992, Congress passed a law requiring the government to release all of its records about the assassination by October 2017, while giving the president the authority to withhold records for national security reasons. In his first term, Mr. Trump unveiled thousands of documents, but some of their contents were kept under wraps after lobbying by the CIA and FBI. Other records were withheld altogether.",
      "Over the course of 2021 and 2022, President Biden likewise released thousands of records but kept key portions redacted, frustrating researchers and observers who had called for their full release for years.",
      "When was JFK assassinated?",
      "Kennedy was shot in the head on Nov. 22, 1963, at the age of 46 while riding in a convertible in Dallas, Texas. Oswald, a former Marine and communist activist who had lived in the Soviet Union, was soon arrested for the killing. But Oswald was also shot and killed in the basement of the Dallas police headquarters two days later.",
      "An investigation led by Chief Justice Earl Warren concluded that Oswald acted alone in shooting Kennedy, but the probe has been widely criticized by academics and historians in the 62 years since the assassination.",
      "Oswald had been on the government's radar before the assassination. He defected to the Soviet Union in 1959, and returned to the U.S. in 1962. A self-described Marxist, he worked with a pro-Fidel Castro activist group and had contact with Soviet and Cuban consulates in the months leading up to Kennedy's death.",
      "In October 1963, the CIA intercepted a phone call he made to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City, though the full implications of the conversation remain unclear. Some additional documents related to that wiretap operation were released in 2022.",
      "Longtime JFK watchers have hoped that the documents that have been redacted or withheld by the government would reveal more information about Oswald's activities in Mexico City and what else federal agencies knew about him before the shooting.",
      "This is a developing story and will be updated.",
      "The Associated Press and \n                                                  \n                      Andres Triay\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "published": "Tue, 18 Mar 2025 22:21:01 -0400",
    "summary": "Gary Shapley and Joseph Ziegler were tapped by the treasury secretary to lead reform efforts at the IRS.",
    "story": [
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has promoted two agents with the Internal Revenue Service who said they faced retaliation after blowing the whistle to Congress and speaking out to CBS News about political interference into their investigation of Hunter Biden's tax crimes.",
      "IRS special agents Gary Shapley and Joseph Ziegler were assigned to Bessent's office as senior advisers for IRS reform, and Shapley was named deputy director of criminal investigations at the agency.",
      "The promotions stand in stark contrast to President Trump's decision on Monday to revoke Secret Service protections for Hunter Biden, despite an executive order signed by his father, former President Joe Biden, extending those protections through July.",
      "Shapley and Ziegler first came forward in 2023, alleging the Department of Justice \"slow-walked\" the yearslong tax probe into Hunter Biden, and that prosecutors told them not to pursue investigative leads related to his father. They were removed from the case \u2014 and temporarily sidelined with pay.",
      "The duo's disclosures came ahead of a series of court decisions that ultimately led President Biden to pardon his son for the crimes related to the agents' investigation. Hunter Biden pleaded guilty to those crimes after a Delaware judge rejected a plea deal that would have given him broad immunity.",
      "\"We have been motivated by one singular mantra: do what's right,\" Shapley said in a statement. \"It's never been easy, and there have been more pitfalls than one would hope, but we appreciate the opportunity Secretary Bessent is giving us to utilize our skills and firsthand knowledge of the agency to further the work of the administration to root out waste and fraud from the federal government and make a difference.\"",
      "In an interview with Fox News Tuesday, Bessent said he is giving Shapley and Ziegler \"a year to investigate the wrongdoing that's going on at the IRS,\" adding that they will make sure \"this Hunter Biden nonsense\" doesn't repeat itself.",
      "The new assignments come as the IRS is drafting plans to cut its workforce by as much as half through layoffs, attrition and buyouts, part of the Trump administration's effort to downsize the federal government. And the prominent postings are an abrupt departure from the tenuous relationship the two IRS whistleblowers previously had with the tax agency.",
      "In December, the federal watchdog that investigates whistleblower complaints substantiated claims by Shapley and Ziegler alleging the IRS had retaliated against them when agency leadership had removed the two agents from the Hunter Biden case at DOJ's request.",
      "The retaliation claim was part of an effort by Shapley and Ziegler to push back against what they believed was a wide-ranging effort by Hunter Biden's attorneys to discredit them. In September, the two men sued Abbe Lowell \u2013 one of Hunter Biden's attorneys \u2013 for defamation. Lowell responded by strenuously disputing the allegations and calling Shapley and Ziegler \"disgruntled.\"",
      "As for Hunter Biden, he recently was granted approval by a California judge to drop a lawsuit he filed against a former Trump White House aide he accused of illegally publishing private photos, emails, and other materials from his now-infamous laptop.",
      "In court documents, Hunter Biden cited financial reasons for dropping the lawsuit. He said his \"income has decreased significantly\" as sales of his art have dried up in the past year, and he was forced out of the house he was renting due to the fires that ravaged Los Angeles in January.",

    "published": "Tue, 18 Mar 2025 22:01:10 -0400",
    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes ruled in favor of transgender active-duty service members and transgender people in the process of enlisting.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday blocked enforcement of a new Defense Department policy barring transgender people from serving in the U.S. military.",
      "U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes granted a request for a preliminary injunction sought by transgender active-duty service members and transgender people who are in the process of enlisting. The judge's order temporarily blocks Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and the military services from implementing President Trump's executive order and additional guidance that prohibits transgender people from serving in the military.",
      "But the judge put her order on hold until March 21 to give the Justice Department time to seek emergency relief from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.",
      "Reyes, appointed by former President Joe Biden, issued her decision after holding several hours of hearings earlier this month, during which she sharply questioned Justice Department lawyers about the Defense Department's justifications for the ban.",
      "\"Indeed, the cruel irony is that thousands of transgender servicemembers have sacrificed \u2014 some risking their lives \u2014to ensure for others the very equal protection rights the Military Ban seeks to deny them,\" Reyes wrote in her 79-page decision, later adding, \"The court's opinion is long, but its premise is simple.\u00a0 In the self-evident truth that 'all people are created equal,' all means all. Nothing more. And certainly nothing less.\"",
      "Jennifer Levi, senior director of transgender and queer rights for GLAD Law, one of the lead attorneys in the case, called the ruling \"decisive\" and said it \"speaks volumes.\"",
      "\"The court's unambiguous factual findings lay bare how this ban specifically targets and undermines our courageous service members who have committed themselves to defending our nation. Given the court's clear-eyed assessment, we are confident this ruling will stand strong on appeal,\" Levi said in a statement.",
      "A spokesperson for the Justice Department called the ruling \"the latest example of an activist judge attempting to seize power at the expense of the American people, who decisively voted to elect President Trump.\"",
      "The policy arose out of an executive order Mr. Trump issued in late January that directed Hegseth to implement a policy for transgender service members based on troop readiness. The order stated that \"adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual's sex conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life. A man's assertion that he is a woman, and his requirement that others honor this falsehood, is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member.\"",
      "The executive order also\u00a0revoked a measure implemented in January 2021 by then-President Joe Biden that allowed transgender individuals to serve in the U.S. military.",
      "In response to Mr. Trump's directive, Hegseth issued a memorandum in early February that halted recruitment of new service members diagnosed with gender dysphoria and paused gender-affirming care for transgender troops. The Pentagon then said in a late February document that the U.S. would begin removing transgender troops from the military within 30 days unless they obtained a waiver.",
      "The memo said that individuals with a diagnosis or history of gender dysphoria \"are no longer eligible for military service.\" It also said that pronoun usage when referring to a service member must reflect his or her sex and barred the use of Pentagon funds for gender-affirming care.",
      "The lawsuit before Reyes was filed in late January by a group of more than a dozen transgender active-duty service members, one person enlisted in U.S. Army basic training and five transgender people who were in the process of enlisting. They argued that the ban was unconstitutional and sought a court order blocking its enforcement.",
      "In her decision, Reyes found that the challengers were likely to succeed on their claim that the ban fails the highest level of judicial scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, because it classifies based on sex and transgender status. The judge also held that the Trump administration's policy is likely driven by unconstitutional animus.",
      "\"The Military Ban is soaked in animus and dripping with pretext,\" she wrote. \"Its language is unabashedly demeaning, its policy stigmatizes transgender persons as inherently unfit, and its conclusions bear no relation to fact.\"",
      "Reyes wrote that Mr. Trump and the Defense Department \"could have crafted a policy that balances the nation's need for a prepared military and Americans' right to equal protection. They still can. The Military Ban, however, is not that policy. The court therefore must act to uphold the equal protection rights that the military defends every day.\"",
      "The judge said government's policy is \"overbroad\" and also includes \"derogatory generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of transgender persons.\" Such generalizations, Reyes wrote, \"do not suffice to show that a sweeping discriminatory ban is substantially related to military readiness and unit cohesion.\"",
      "The decision from Reyes is likely to be appealed by the Justice Department, but it is the latest legal setback for the Trump administration, since several of its policies have been temporarily blocked by federal judges. A second challenge to the Mr. Trump's military ban is currently underway in Washington state.",
      "Mr. Trump sought to bar transgender people from serving in the military during his first term, in 2017, but an initial Pentagon policy was blocked by federal courts. The plan was then revised in 2018, and it took effect the following year and remained in place until the start of the Biden administration.",

    "published": "Tue, 18 Mar 2025 21:14:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The chief justice's statement came after President Trump called for a federal judge to be impeached.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Chief Justice John Roberts issued a rare statement Tuesday defending federal judges who have issued decisions against the Trump administration, saying that \"impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement\" with a court's decision.",
      "\"For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,\" Roberts said in the statement distributed by the Supreme Court's public information office. \"The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.\"",
      "Roberts' statement comes after President Trump attacked a federal district judge on Truth Social and called for his impeachment. The judge, James Boasberg, temporarily\u00a0blocked the Trump administration on Saturday from using the wartime law called the Alien Enemies Act to detain and deport noncitizens.",
      "Boasberg had issued an oral order from the bench requiring planes carrying 261 people that were on their way to Central America to return to the U.S. The Trump administration had alleged that 137 of the people on board the planes had ties to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and were removed from the U.S. under the Alien Enemies Act. Despite Boasberg's order, two planes landed in El Salvador, sparking allegations that the Trump administration had defied a court order.",
      "\"This Radical Left Lunatic of a Judge, a troublemaker and agitator who was sadly appointed by Barack Hussein Obama, was not elected President - He didn't WIN the popular VOTE (by a lot!), he didn't WIN ALL SEVEN SWING STATES, he didn't WIN 2,750 to 525 Counties, HE DIDN'T WIN ANYTHING!\" Mr. Trump wrote in his post.",
      "The president added that Boasberg and \"many of the Crooked Judges' I am forced to appear before\" should be \"IMPEACHED!!!\"",
      "Mr. Trump's targeting of Boasberg, who was appointed to the U.S. district court in Washington, D.C., by President Barack Obama, is an escalation in the ongoing attacks on federal judges who have been overseeing the dozens of challenges to the president's policies. Some of those judges have ordered the Trump administration to put its plans on hold while legal proceedings move forward, sparking condemnations from the president's allies and threats of impeachment. The Justice Department has appealed many of those rulings and sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court\u00a0in three court fights\u00a0so far.",
      "Federal judges are appointed for life and can only be removed from the bench if they are impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate. Just 15 judges have been impeached in U.S. history, most recently in 2010. Eight of those 15 have been convicted and removed from office.",
      "Elon Musk, a senior adviser to the president, has taken to social media repeatedly to call on the judges to be impeached, claiming they are \"evil.\"",
      "In a\u00a0post last month on X, the social media company he owns, Musk claimed the country is witnessing \"an attempted coup of American democracy by radical left activists posing as judges.\" In\u00a0another post, he wrote that there \"need to be some repercussions above zero for judges who make truly terrible decisions.\"",
      "Republicans in the House have also\u00a0introduced impeachment resolutions\u00a0against at least three judges because of rulings they dislike, which were issued in the early stages of legal challenges to Mr. Trump's policies.",
      "In response to the attacks on members of the judiciary, two Republican-appointed judges warned last week that they strike at judicial independence.",
      "\"Our system of government is premised on three independent branches and a judiciary that can function independently,\" Judge Richard Sullivan, who sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit, said during a call with reporters hosted by the Judicial Conference. \"That's what makes it work, and so it's crucial that people understand that.\"",
      "Judge Jeffrey Sutton, of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, said it's a \"shame\" to see judges attacked simply for doing their jobs.",
      "\"Threats to judges are threats to judicial independence. They've been around for a long time. There's lots of different mechanisms. Threats of impeachment \u2014 this is not the first time this has happened,\" he said. \"One thing worth keeping in mind is if we dilute the standards for impeachment, that's not just a problem for judges, that's a problem for all three branches of government.\"",
      "Roberts has spoken about the importance of judicial independence before, namely in his year-end report issued to close out 2024. He highlighted four areas that he said threatened the independence of judges: violence, intimidation, disinformation and threats to defy lawfully entered judgments.",
      "Roberts is the presiding officer of the Judicial Conference, the policymaking body for the judiciary. Such statements from the chief justice are rare, but it is not the first time Roberts has pushed back against Mr. Trump's comments.",
      "In 2018, after the president complained about a federal judge who ruled against an asylum policy during his first term and referred to him as an \"Obama judge,\" Roberts said the U.S. doesn't have \"Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges.

    "summary": "Russian President Vladimir Putin told President Trump that halting foreign aid to Ukraine is key to ending the war, the Kremlin says.",
    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 President Trump said he and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to an \"immediate ceasefire on all energy and infrastructure\" in Ukraine when the two spoke Tuesday in a lengthy phone call, but Russia has not agreed to a full 30-day ceasefire like Ukraine has.",
      "Hours after the call, air raid sirens sounded and explosions rocked the Ukrainian capital city of Kyiv. The White House and the Kremlin both said they agreed to begin negotiations \"immediately\" to achieve a fuller ceasefire. A Russian readout of the call from the Kremlin said a key condition for working toward a resolution to the conflict \"should be the complete cessation of foreign military aid and the provision of intelligence information to Kyiv.\" The White House readout did not contain that information, or Mr. Trump's response.",
      "\"My phone conversation today with President Putin of Russia was a very good and productive one,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"We agreed to an immediate ceasefire on all energy and infrastructure, with an understanding that we will be working quickly to have a complete ceasefire and, ultimately, an END to this very horrible war between Russia and Ukraine. ... Many elements of a contract for peace were discussed, including the fact that thousands of soldiers are being killed, and both President Putin and President Zelenskyy would like to see it end.\"",
      "The call lasted at least 90 minutes, as indicated by the timing of White House updates, but the exact duration hasn't been disclosed yet.",
      "\"Today, President Trump and President Putin spoke about the need for peace and a ceasefire in the Ukraine war,\" a White House readout of the call said. \"Both leaders agreed this conflict needs to end with a lasting peace. They also stressed the need for improved bilateral relations between the United States and Russia.The blood and treasure that both Ukraine and Russia have been spending in this war would be better spent on the needs of their people. ... The leaders agreed that the movement to peace will begin with an energy and infrastructure ceasefire, as well as technical negotiations on implementation of a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea, full ceasefire and permanent peace. These negotiations will begin immediately in the Middle East.\"",
      "The White House also said Mr. Trump and Putin agreed that an improved relationship between the U.S. and Russia \"has a huge upside,\" including \"enormous economic deals and geopolitical stability when peace has been achieved.\"",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Mr. Trump has his number and can call him at any time.",
      "\"We are skeptical when it comes to trusting the Russians,\" he said Tuesday. \"There is no trust to Putin. That's why I am saying we need to understand how it will work technically so that it will not depend on their desire only. That is it.\"",
      "On Monday, ahead of the call, Mr. Trump said U.S. officials are having \"very serious discussions\" with Russia about \"land that would be kept and lost.\" \"You're sort of creating the edge of a country,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump also said Monday that negotiations are complicated, and added that he would love to meet with Putin at some point.",
      "Last week, delegates from the U.S. and Ukraine met in Saudi Arabia and proposed a\u00a030-day ceasefire. While Putin said he\u00a0accepted the idea\u00a0for a ceasefire in principle, he did not commit to a deal and said more discussions were needed.",

    "published": "Tue, 18 Mar 2025 20:36:03 -0400",
    "summary": "Some information demanded by a judge about flights carrying alleged Tren de Aragua gang members is likely to remain private, the Justice Department said.",
    "story": [
      "Plaintiffs suing the Trump administration over use of a war authority to deport alleged gang members warned that failing to block the president from its use would mean anyone could be treated as an enemy alien.",
      "The lawyers for Venezuelan migrants suing the government said Tuesday in an appellate court filing: \"The implications of the government's position are staggering. If the President can designate any group as enemy aliens under the Act, and that designation is unreviewable, then there is no limit on who can be sent to a Salvadoran prison, or any limit on how long they will remain there.\"",
      "Those subject to the 1798 Alien Enemies Act can be summarily arrested, detained and deported, without the due process protections outlined in U.S. immigration law, including opportunities to see a judge and request asylum. Instead, they may be treated as enemy aliens and processed under America's wartime laws. President Trump invoked the act Saturday, and used it to send two planes carrying alleged Tren de Aragua gang members to a prison in El Salvador.",
      "In a hearing Saturday, D.C. U.S. Chief District Judge James Boasberg blocked their deportation, prompting an immediate Justice Department appeal.",
      "On Tuesday, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer provided new details about the Trump administration's deportation flights of alleged gang members, but continued to argue the government had a right to reject a judge's order directing the planes to return to the U.S., even if they were already in the air.",
      "According to a sworn declaration by Robert Cerna, the acting field office director of ICE's enforcement and removal operations, the two planes \"departed U.S. territory and airspace before 7:25 p.m.\" on Saturday \u2014 40 minutes after D.C. District Chief Judge James Boasberg verbally ordered the planes to be returned to the U.S. during a hearing Saturday evening.",
      "The government reiterated Tuesday that because the planes were over international waters and airspace by the time the judge ordered them to turn around, Boasberg no longer had jurisdiction over the migrants.",
      "Attorneys for the Trump administration had also argued in a hearing on Monday that Boasberg did not have authority to redirect the planes because the judge had not put his order demanding the planes to return to the U.S. in writing. The judge responded that his order applied to the planes, regardless of where they were in the air.",
      "Cerna said the government's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to justify the removal of alleged Tren de Aragua members was signed Friday evening, a day before the flights were publicly announced on Saturday by the White House.",
      "His testimony is part of a court-mandated series of responses to Boasberg, who was frustrated by the government's lack of details on the flights and deportation operations during the hearing on Monday. The rest of the answers Boasberg requested are likely to remain private because of \"operational issues,\" a Justice Department attorney told the court, declining to provide the court with this information publicly.",
      "Those details are likely to include whether additional planes have left the U.S. with alleged Tren de Aragua gang members, a timeline showing when the flights took off from the U.S. and landed in El Salvador and a count of remaining members of the gang in U.S. custody.",
      "Cerna's sworn testimony did not provide all of this information, though he noted that 54 members of Tren de Aragua are in detention in the U.S., and approximately 172 are on the non-detained docket, which means they are not being detained by the government as their immigration proceedings continue. There are also approximately 32 are in criminal custody who have active detainers \u2014 that is, ICE has asked that they be held for up to 48 hours after they're scheduled to be released.",
      "Despite Boasberg's ruling, 261 people were deported to El Salvador Saturday, 137 of whom were removed under the Alien Enemies Act over alleged gang ties, a senior administration official said.",
      "The federal civil lawsuit against Mr. Trump and other administration officials was filed by five Venezuelan men in immigration custody in Texas and New York local jails.",
      "Boasberg's ruling prevents the deportations of the plaintiffs and migrants for 14 days.",
      "Jake Rosen is a reporter covering the Department of Justice. He was previously a campaign digital reporter covering President Trump's 2024 campaign and also served as an associate producer for \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" where he worked with Brennan for two years on the broadcast.

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0More than 24,000 workers at 18 federal agencies who were fired as part of President Trump's efforts to shrink the size of the government are now in the process of being rehired following a federal judge's order last week.",
      "The Trump administration provided a detailed accounting\u00a0of the number of probationary employees, generally considered those who were in their jobs for less than one year, who were targeted in the president's drastic plans to scale back the federal workforce in court filings Monday. The information was submitted as part of the administration's compliance with a temporary restraining order issued by U.S. District Judge James Bredar last week.",
      "Justice Department lawyers provided declarations from human resources officials at 18 different agencies who were covered by Bredar's order, which detailed the number of probationary workers who were fired last month and then had to be reinstated to their roles.",
      "Bredar, who sits on the federal district court in Maryland, temporarily blocked the mass firings of probationary workers and ordered them to be reinstated. He is the second judge to order the Trump administration to rehire fired federal workers.",
      "The Justice Department has appealed both decisions. But on Monday, a three-judge panel for the U.S. Appeals for the 9th Circuit declined to put one of the orders, from a federal district judge in California, on hold while proceedings move forward.",
      "In their declarations, the human resources officials across the federal government said they were working to comply with Bredar's order. But they all warned that reinstating removed employees would cause \"significant confusion\" and turmoil for those workers. The officers also noted that an appeals court could reverse the district court's order, subjecting affected employees to multiple changes in their employment status in just a few weeks.",
      "Most of the employees who were rehired were placed on administrative leave with full pay and benefits, the human resources officials said. In a separate filing in a case challenging the mass firings brought in California, Justice Department lawyers said that the administrative leave placement is \"a first part of a series of steps to reinstate probationary employees\" and an \"intermediate measure taken by a number of the agencies in order to return probationary employees to full duty status.\" The judge in that case last week ordered the Trump administration to reinstate fired probationary workers at six agencies.",

    "story": [
      "London - Some court documents related to a freedom of information request to access Prince Harry's U.S. immigration files were released on Tuesday, under an order issued by a Washington D.C. district court, after the conservative Heritage Foundation alleged that the British royal\u00a0may have concealed past drug use when he applied for his visa. Harry currently lives in California with his wife, Meghan, and their children.",
      "The documents released included court filings from several federal agencies responding to the Heritage Foundation's request. They did not include the prince's immigration records. Portions of the documents relating to him or his immigration status were heavily redacted.",
      "Applications for visas to live in the United States ask about current and historical drug use. Admission of drug use can lead to visa applications being rejected, but immigration officers have discretion to make their final decisions on a number of factors. Lying on visa applications can lead to lifetime bans on entering the U.S.",
      "\"There's a lot of discretion that the government has, but merely admitting to drug use very often is not disqualifying from entering the country, but lying about drug use can be more serious and potentially could be disqualifying,\" CBS News legal contributor Jessica Levinson said.",
      "The Heritage Foundation alleges that Harry may have lied about his past drug use on his application. Their allegations center around claims Harry made in his memoir, published in January 2023, where he described using various types of drugs.",
      "Cocaine \"wasn't much fun, and it didn't make me particularly happy, as it seemed to make everyone around me, but it did make me feel different, and that was the main goal,\" Harry wrote.",
      "He also wrote: \"Marijuana is different. That actually really did help me.\"",
      "The Heritage Foundation lodged a freedom of information request with the Department of Homeland Security in 2023, not long after his book was published, seeking access to Harry's immigration documents.",
      "\"Harry has publicly admitted to extensive illegal drug use. What do we submit this means? That Harry seems to have received special treatment: the DHS looked the other way if the Prince answered truthfully, or it looked the other way if the Prince lied on his visa application. Either action would be wrong,\" Nile Gardiner from the Heritage Foundation said in an online post in 2024.",
      "Harry and Meghan moved to the U.S. in 2020 after stepping down as working members of Britain's royal family.",
      "Meghan is a U.S. citizen, but it is unclear what visa Harry entered the country on. The prince has not responded publicly to the Heritage Foundation's assertions.",
      "In February, President Trump ruled out deporting Harry, saying he would \"leave him alone,\" adding, \"He's got enough problems with his wife. She's terrible.\"",
      "Meghan has been a vocal critic of Mr. Trump.",
      "\"Most Americans dislike the idea of celebrities being treated differently from anyone else, and Harry's fame and profile makes this case the ideal window into DHS conduct,\" the Heritage Foundation's Gardiner argued. \"If DHS granted Harry special treatment, the implications are obvious: it has likely granted such treatment in the past to others sufficiently famous or sufficiently politically aligned, and will likely continue to do so.\"",

    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang ruled in favor of a group of more than two dozen unnamed former and current USAID employees and contractors.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday found that Elon Musk and the White House's Department of Government Efficiency likely violated the Constitution when they unilaterally acted to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development.",
      "U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang ruled in favor of a group of more than two dozen unnamed current and former USAID employees and contractors who had challenged the efforts to shutter USAID, which were mounted by DOGE and Musk, a senior White House adviser who President Trump has said is the leader of the task force.",
      "Chuang granted in part their request for a preliminary injunction and said in a 68-page decision that DOGE and Musk likely violated the Constitution's Appointments Clause and separation of powers.",
      "He ordered Musk and task force employees to reinstate access to email, payment and other electronic systems to all current USAID employees and personal services contractors. The judge also prevented DOGE and Musk from taking any action relating to the shutdown of USAID, including placing employees on administrative leave, firing USAID workers, closing its buildings, bureaus or offices, and deleting the contents of its websites or collections.",
      "DOGE and Musk are prohibited under the judge's order from taking any other actions relating to USAID without the \"express authorization\" of an agency official with legal authority to take the action. The Trump administration is likely to appeal the decision.",
      "\"To deny plaintiffs' Appointments Clause claim solely on the basis that, on paper, Musk has no formal legal authority relating to the decisions at issue, even if he is actually exercising significant authority on governmental matters, would open the door to an end-run around the Appointments Clause,\" Chuang wrote.",
      "He continued: \"If a president could escape Appointments Clause scrutiny by having advisers go beyond the traditional role of White House advisors who communicate the president's priority to agency heads and instead exercise significant authority throughout the federal government so as to bypass duly appointed officers, the Appointments Clause would be reduced to nothing more than a technical formality.\"",
      "Norm Eisen, executive chair of the State Democracy Defenders Fund, which brought the case on behalf of the 26 USAID employees and contractors, said the ruling is an \"important victory\" against Musk and DOGE.",
      "\"They are performing surgery with a chainsaw instead of a scalpel, harming not just the people USAID serves but also the majority of Americans who count on the stability of our government,\" he said in a statement. \"This case is a milestone in pushing back on Musk and DOGE's illegality.\"",
      "USAID was one of the first agencies that came under scrutiny by DOGE as part of Mr. Trump's sweeping plan to shrink the size of the federal government. Soon after the president returned to a second term, the agency, which was established in 1961, became subject to a 90-day pause on foreign assistance funding that devastated nonprofit organizations, businesses and aid groups that received grants and other awards from USAID.",
      "DOGE team members also gained access to the agency's financial and personnel systems, and hundreds of USAID officials were placed on administrative leave. Its website was shut down last month, email accounts deactivated and USAID's Washington, D.C., headquarters were occupied by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.",
      "The unidentified USAID employees and personal services contractors filed their lawsuit against Musk and DOGE in mid-February and argued that Musk's actions violated the Constitution's Appointments Clause. The case was one of several filed after DOGE was established that have challenged Musk's actions and the task force's access to sensitive federal systems.",
      "Musk's role within DOGE has been of particular interest, including among federal judges overseeing court fights involving the task force. While Mr. Trump has claimed publicly that Musk leads DOGE, including during his joint address to Congress earlier this month, Justice Department lawyers have argued that he is a senior adviser to the president and does not have formal authority to make government decisions.",
      "Amid repeated questions about who was leading DOGE, the White House revealed last month that Amy Gleason, who worked for DOGE's predecessor, is its acting administrator.",
      "Chuang, meanwhile, said Musk and DOGE have been behind agency actions throughout the federal government, including at USAID.",
      "He noted that Musk, who is also the CEO of Tesla, appears to have been involved in the closure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau headquarters. He said evidence shows that Musk and DOGE \"have taken other unilateral actions without any apparent authorization from agency officials,\" including the firings of employees at the Department of Agriculture and National Nuclear Security Administration.",
      "\"Under these circumstances, the evidence presently favors the conclusion that contrary to defendants' sweeping claim that Musk acted only as an advisor, Musk made the decisions to shutdown USAID's headquarters and website even though he 'lacked the authority to make that decision,'\" Chuang wrote, citing arguments from the Trump administration.",
      "As to USAID, the judge said that the record before the court \"does not support the conclusion\" that decisions to dismantle the agency by permanently closing its headquarters and taking down its website were made by USAID officials.",
      "\"Thus, based on the present record, the only individuals known to be associated with decisions to initiate a shutdown of USAID by permanently closing USAID headquarters and taking down its website are Musk and DOGE team members,\" Chuang wrote.",
      "The Constitution's Appointments Clause in part lays out the methods for appointing officers of the United States, divided into two categories: principal officers, appointed by the president with Senate approval, and inferior officers, who generally do not require Senate confirmation. The challengers in the case argued that Musk was carrying out the functions of an officer without being appointed to that role, thus violating the Appointments Clause.",
      "Chuang agreed. He found that where there is evidence that Musk exercised significant authority reserved for an officer while serving in a continuing government position, the unnamed USAID employees and contractors were likely to win on their argument that he skirted the Appointments Clause.",
      "\"The public interest is specifically harmed by defendants' actions, which have usurped the authority of the public's elected representatives in Congress to make decisions on whether, when and how to eliminate a federal government agency, and of officers of the United States duly appointed under the Constitution to exercise the authority entrusted to them,\" he wrote.",
      "In addition to finding that the dismantling of USAID by Musk and DOGE was likely unconstitutional, Chuang found that they lack authorization by Congress to take steps toward abolishing the agency.",
      "\"There is no statute that authorizes the Executive Branch to shut down USAID,\" he wrote.",
      "The judge added that Congress alone has the constitutional authority to take action to eliminate agencies it has created.",
      "\"Where Congress has prescribed the existence of USAID in statute pursuant to its legislative powers under Article I, the president's Article II power to take care that the laws are faithfully executed does not provide authority for the unilateral, drastic actions taken to dismantle the agency,\" Chuang wrote.",
      "The judge's opinion warns that there are reasons to be concerned about the potential public disclosure of personal, sensitive or classified information by DOGE team members. He said they \"took extreme measures\" to gain access to classified information, including in secure facilities, \"when there was no identified need to do so,\" and when some DOGE staff lacked security clearances.",
      "Chuang cited one USAID employee on administrative leave who reported that DOGE team members who did not have security clearances granted themselves access to restricted areas that required approval.",

      "A 48-year-old woman and 29-year-old man were arrested for allegedly providing illegal abortions and operating a network of unlicensed clinics in the Houston area, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced this week.",
      "Paxton said that Maria \"Dr. Maria\" Rojas is a known midwife in Northwest Houston and was taken into custody in Waller County. She is accused of performing illegal abortions, which violates the\u00a0Texas Human Life Protection Act. The\u00a0law bans abortion after six weeks.",
      "During an investigation, the attorney general's office found that Rojas owned and operated multiple clinics under the names Clinica Waller Latinoamericana in Waller, Clinica Latinoamericana Telge in Cypress, both northwest of Houston, and Latinoamericana Medical Clinic in Spring, just north of Houston.",
      "The press release from Paxton's office alleged that Rojas' clinics employed unlicensed people who \"falsely presented themselves as licensed medical professionals.\"",
      "Jose Manuel Cendan Ley was also taken into custody on Monday and charged with an unlawful performance of an abortion and unlicensed practice of medicine. According to Paxton, Ley performed illegal medical procedures and assisted Rojas in at least one abortion procedure.",
      "\"In Texas, life is sacred. I will always do everything in my power to protect the unborn, defend our state's pro-life laws, and work to ensure that unlicensed individual endangering the lives of women by performing illegal abortions are fully prosecuted,\" Paxton said. \"Texas law protecting life is clear and we will hold those who violate it accountable.\"",
      "Holly Shearman, a friend of Rojas', told CBS News she spoke with her after the arrest. \"She was adamant she was innocent. Midwives around the state are rallying around her,\" Shearman said.",
      "Court records did not list an attorney for Rojas who could speak on her behalf, The Associated Press reported. The clinics advertise various services on their Facebook pages, including physical exams, ultrasounds and vaccines, AP noted.",
      "Following Rojas' arrest, Paxton's Healthcare Program Enforcement Division filed for a temporary restraining order to shut down all of the clinics Rojas owned and operated.",
      "Marc Hearron, interim associate director of U.S. litigation at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement: \"While details of this case remain unclear, we know that Texas officials have been trying every which way to terrify healthcare practitioners from providing care and to trap Texans. Their ultimate goal is to end abortion access for all Texans entirely\u2014and they will throw people in jail to get there.\"",
      "Paxton also announced Tuesday that Rubildo Labanino Matos, 54, had been arrested on March 8 in connection to the investigation. Paxton said Matos is a nurse practitioner whose license is currently on probation by the Board of Nursing. He was charged with conspiracy to practice medicine without a license.",
      "What is the Texas Human Life Protection Act?",
      "Under the Texas Human Life Protection Act of 2021, the Texas attorney general has the authority to seek civil penalties of at least $100,000 per violation for the unlawful performance of an abortion.",
      "The Waller County district attorney referred Rojas' case to Paxton for prosecution.",
      "Attorney Will Vaughn, who is not involved in the case, told CBS Houston affiliate KHOU it could lead to a legal challenge of the state law. \"We can all foresee this being a constitutional challenge at the U.S. Supreme Court, and that would be not so much challenging the conviction, if there were one, but challenging the constitutionally of the statute as a whole,\" Vaughn said.",

      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer argued Tuesday that he remains the \"best leader for the Senate\" despite backlash from some Democrats over his decision to allow a Republican-led measure to advance, avoiding a government shutdown.",
      "\"We have a lot of good people,\" Schumer said on \"CBS Mornings.\" \"But I am the best at winning Senate seats.\"",
      "Schumer initially signaled last week that his caucus would fight back against a partisan measure to keep the government funded. But a day later, he reluctantly pledged to advance the continuing resolution, delivering one of the Democratic votes necessary to propel the measure to passage. The move has prompted frustrations among some within his party, and questions about his leadership, but Schumer has repeatedly defended his decision.",
      "\"I knew when I took this vote there'd be a lot of protests, but I felt I had to do it for the future, not only of the Democratic Party, but the country,\" Schumer said, adding that \"as bad as that CR bill was \u2014 and it was bad \u2014 a shutdown is 10 times worse.\"",
      "Schumer said a shutdown would have given \"sole power\" to the executive branch and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency to determine what remained open and closed during a shutdown, saying \"within two weeks, everyone would have been howling.\"",
      "The New York Democrat said he and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries had a strategy to try to get a bipartisan bill to keep the government funded. But they didn't expect that House Republican leadership would be able to keep its conference together to advance the partisan continuing resolution \u2014 a heavy lift that defied the typical political dynamics, with conservatives who routinely oppose continuing resolutions joining their party to support the measure.",
      "Schumer said a \"shutdown would have been the greatest disaster,\" putting the government in the hands of \"evil, nasty, nihilistic people\" like Musk, President Trump and OMB Director Russ Vought.",
      "\"We would have had half the federal government we have now,\" Schumer said. \"So I thought I did the thing a leader should do: Even when people don't see the danger around the curve, my job was to alert people to it \u2014 and I knew I'd get some bullets.\"",
      "On the question of his leadership, Schumer said he isn't going anywhere, citing his record as leader on winning Senate seats, including in 2021, when Democrats secured a majority in the upper chamber with two surprise runoff victories in Georgia. Schumer came to Congress in 1981, representing New York in the House before being elected to the Senate in 1998. He's led Democrats as leader in the Senate since 2017.",
      "Schumer said Democrats are fighting back against the Trump administration with a message focused on how GOP leaders want to \"screw every average American so they can get tax cuts for the rich,\" saying the strategy is \"beginning to work.\"",
      "\"If we keep at it every day, relentless fighting and showing how they're hurting people so badly, Trump's numbers will get much lower, and his both popularity, but also his effectiveness will decline,\" Schumer said. \"I believe that strategy will work.\"",
      "Tuesday's interview was held one day after\u00a0Schumer postponed events to promote his book, \"Antisemitism in America: A Warning,\" this week, citing security concerns following backlash from his move to keep the government funded. Schumer had a number of events scheduled this week in Maryland, New York City, Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania and California.",
      "Schumer said he wrote the book aimed at a number of audiences \u2014 including his \"friends on the left.\" He noted that while \"we've always seen antisemitism on the right,\" more recently \"a lot of it's trickled over to the left.\"",

      "After Mr. Trump signed an executive order that seeks to make sweeping cuts at the nation's largest international broadcaster, about 1,300 employees, including Abramowitz, learned over the weekend they had been placed on administrative leave, and another 500 contractors were terminated. Mr. Trump accused the news agency, which began broadcasting during World War II, of spreading \"radical propaganda.\"",
      "In an interview with CBS News Monday, Abramowitz called VOA \"an incredibly important soft power tool\" for the U.S. and said shuttering it would be a \"self-inflicted blow\" to national security because VOA's news coverage helps to combat Chinese, Russian and Iranian disinformation.",
      "\"If America pulls off the playing field and cedes it to our adversaries, then they're going to be telling the narratives that people around the world are going to be hearing, and that can't be good for America,\" he said. \"They're going to be hearing an anti-America narrative.

      "\"We are getting through to an audience that might otherwise hear propaganda,\" Abramowitz said, adding that many VOA journalists are from countries under authoritarian control. \"The major challenge for the United States in general is this global information war in which countries like China and Russia are essentially really having our lunch. \u2026 So, I really feel that we need an organization that is accurate, unbiased, objective, and that tells the truth about America to the rest of the world in the languages that they understand.\"",

He also demanded explanations about removal flights ordered since President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act\u00a0Saturday.",
      "During a hearing on the Trump administration's compliance with his order, D.C District Chief Judge James Boasberg demanded answers by Tuesday at noon to clarify what occurred Saturday \u2014 both before and after he blocked the government's removal flights. He asked the government whether additional planes have left the U.S. with Tren de Aragua gang members, and he wants a timeline showing when the flights took off from the U.S. and landed in El Salvador and a count of remaining members of the gang in U.S. custody.",
      "Boasberg also demanded detailed timing on when President Trump's order invoking the Alien Enemies Act was signed and went into effect. The 1798 act is a wartime authority allowing the president to detain and deport noncitizens. Mr. Trump is utilizing the act to detain and deport all Venezuelan migrants 14 years of age and older who are suspected of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang.",
      "A Justice Department attorney argued that because the judge did not put his order demanding the planes to return to the U.S. in writing, the government was not bound by it, but he added that even if the order had been written, the president had the authority to keep the flights en route to their final destination.",
      "\"You're telling me your first argument is when I said those things, because I didn't say it in a minute order that the plaintiffs didn't have to turn around, you didn't have to comply?\" Boasberg said. \"You're saying that you felt you could disregard it because it wasn't in a written order?\"",
      "The attorney did not provide details about how many deportation flights left Saturday, claiming that there were \"operational issues\" prohibiting him from answering. When Judge Boesberg mentioned the two flights that departed Texas at 5:26 p.m. and 5:45 p.m. local time, the attorney said that he was \"not at liberty\" to provide information about the flights.",
      "It sparked a tense back and forth between Judge Boesberg and the government over whether or not it was asserting the flight information was classified.",
      "The Justice Department also argued that because the planes were over international waters and airspace by the time the judge ordered them to turn around, that Boasberg no longer had jurisdiction over the migrants.",
      "The judge responded that his order applied to the planes, regardless of where they were in the air.",
      "The Trump administration said the two planes had left before the judge made his decision, and a third plane left for El Salvador shortly afterwards, though details about the passengers on that plane are unclear.",

      "\"Hunter Biden has had Secret Service protection for an extended period of time, all paid for by the United States Taxpayer. There are as many as 18 people on this Detail, which is ridiculous!\" Mr. Trump wrote, noting that the former president's son was vacationing in South Africa, where his wife is from. \"Likewise, Ashley Biden who has 13 agents will be taken off the list.\"",
      "Secret Service chief of communications Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement the agency was \"aware of the President's decision to terminate protection for Hunter and Ashley Biden. The Secret Service will comply and is actively working with the protective details and the White House to ensure compliance as soon as possible.\"",

    "summary": "Among the CISA cuts were top recruits tasked with protecting the nation's critical infrastructure from foreign and domestic cyber attacks.",
    "story": [
      "For Kelly Shaw, unemployment is unfamiliar territory. \"I've never been in this situation before. I've never been fired,\" Shaw said, suddenly quiet, while seated at her kitchen table in Northern Virginia.",
      "Nearly three years ago, the longtime senior intelligence analyst left the Navy, after being recruited by the nation's top cyber defense agency and rising up through the ranks. Eventually, Shaw helped establish a congressionally mandated program designed to continuously monitor and detect cyber breaches of the nation's power grid, pipelines and water system \u2013 installing sensors across critical infrastructure designed to detect insider threats and foreign adversaries like China, Russia and Iran.",
      "\"It was all about the information we can get within networks to find the bad guys \u2013 any indicators of compromise, evidence of the adversary, moving through a network and attempting to do bad things. That's what we did,\" Shaw said, pausing. \"Well, that's what some will still do.\"",
      "The former manager for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency's \"CyberSentry\" program, Shaw was also among the 130 probationary CISA workers mass fired in the \"Valentine's Day Massacre\" during the holiday weekend last month.",
      "That weekend, the form letter termination notices arrived for over 4% of CISA's workforce, telling them they were \"not fit for continued employment because your ability, knowledge and skills do not fit the Agency's current needs.\" Among them were the nation's threat hunters, incident response team members, disabled veterans and employees who'd already signed onto the federal government's deferred resignation program.",
      "Others were former private sector workers who left lucrative jobs making seven-figure salaries to join the federal government and officials recruited into DHS' innovative hiring program \u2014 dubbed the \"Cyber Talent Management System\" \u2014 and analysts with top secret security clearances.",
      "\"I waited literally 13 months from the moment I got my offer letter to the moment I started this job,\" said former cybersecurity specialist Paula Davis, recounting her arduous security clearance process. Before her termination letter arrived in her email inbox, Davis said she was required to send agency leadership an email justifying her position, but she never received a response.",
      "Davis spent her days analyzing code for state and local municipalities, identifying risks or abnormalities across the nation's aging critical infrastructure.",
      "\"We're being targeted daily, hourly and every single minute,\" Davis said, citing suspected cybercriminals' attempts to infiltrate water systems and the power grid. She called her role fighting those intrusions her \"dream job.\"",
      "\"I didn't take an oath to the Constitution just to start getting a paycheck,\" Davis said, \"Or else I would have just gone back into the private sector. I would have stayed at a big corporation.\"",
      "Since last month, the rapid-fire firings have shaken lawmakers and high-ranking officials, leaving many current and former employees dumbfounded. CBS News has spoken with over a dozen current and former CISA employees, including several who were granted anonymity in interviews, due to fear of reprisal.",
      "\"These are the people that are the first line of defense in responding to incidents like Volt Typhoon and Salt Typhoon, and if we go even further back, SolarWinds,\" said one former CISA employee, referencing a string of foreign cyber espionage campaigns dating back to President Trump's first administration.",
      "\"These are elite hunters that look across critical infrastructure and government networks to figure out if these bad actors are active in these networks,\" the former employee continued. \"The people who find how deeply they've penetrated and 'how do we get them out of there?'\"",
      "Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee, warned at a hearing Wednesday that lawmakers are hearing that \"significant cuts are coming for the remaining workforce\" at CISA.",
      "\"That kind of talent, you just don't find it every day,\" Thompson told CBS News. \"You have to convince many of those individuals to leave lucrative private sector employment and come and accept the public mission of securing our cyber security systems and protecting our country.\"",
      "In a post on LinkedIn, last month, Former CISA Director Jen Easterly wrote that the agency had hired over 2,000 new employees during her more than three-year tenure.",
      "Since 2021, CISA's \"strategic recruitment\" program \u2013 congressionally mandated and more than seven years in the making \u2013 has competed with the private sector to attract and retain world-class talent to execute a core mission of the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees CISA. Cyber Talent Management System or \"CTMS\" hires were by law employees with \"measurable or observable\" attributes including \"knowledge, skills, abilities and behaviors.\"",
      "A former human resources employee for CISA who was among those fired told CBS News that before his termination, he was tasked with compiling a list of probationary employees, and among them were over 100 CTMS staff members.",
      "\"Everybody in CTMS is automatically in a three-year probation, so it's easier to get rid of them,\" the former HR employee told CBS News. \"Close to 99% of our CTMS employees were probationary.\"",
      "\"You are extinguishing the best and brightest in one fell swoop,\" a current CISA employee said.",
      "A CISA spokesperson told CBS News in a statement that the agency had 142 employees as part of its talent recruitment program, but did not disclose the number of employees fired.",
      "Shaw was among the first recruits to the \"CTMS\" program, entering with 12 years of government service, two master degrees in electrical engineering and cybersecurity, plus at least nine different specialized cyber certifications.",
      "\"I had such confidence,\" Shaw said. \"With all my prior experience. I just completed my doctorate in May of last year. So I thought I was well positioned to stay at CISA\u2026.But when I saw that executive order come through about probationary employees, I kind of panicked.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the Trump administration is \"making sweeping cuts and reform across the federal government to eliminate egregious waste and incompetence that has been happening for decades at the expense of the American taxpayer.\"",
      "\"To me, knowing how sleek and how well organized of an engine we had at CISA, that's a lie,\" Shaw said of the effort to slash federal spending by eliminating federal workers. \"I don't know who else is going to be cut loose from our nation's cyber defense organizations. But I'm worried about that. I'm worried about that. This should be the last place that we should be cutting this expertise.\"",
      "Along with firing scores of probationary workers, over the last month, CISA has put on leave at least a dozen employees who are tasked with stopping foreign interference in U.S. elections, part of a wider trend of dismantling U.S. efforts to fight foreign meddling in elections.",
      "But concerns stemming from cybersecurity workforce cuts extend beyond the CISA workforce.",
      "Former NSA cybersecurity director Rob Joyce raised \"grave concerns\" that aggressive threats to cuts of U.S. government probationary employees will have a \"devastating impact on the cybersecurity and our national security.\"",
      "\"At my former agency, remarkable technical talent was recruited into developmental programs that provided intensive unique training and hands-on experience to cultivate vital skills,\" Joyce said. \"Eliminating probationary employees will destroy a pipeline of top talent responsible for hunting and eradicating [Chinese] threats.\"",
      "To help assist fired employers at her former agency, Easterly has created a matching website to connect former CISA alumni and prospective employers.",
      "For his part, Thompson has started a hotline to encourage fired employees at the Department of Homeland Security and its components to share their stories.",
      "After the Trump administration tapped the Office of Personnel Management to fire federal employees en masse, a federal judge temporarily blocked it, citing OPM's lack of authority to fire employees at other agencies. This week, OPM updated its guidance to reflect that firing decisions are made by individual departments and agencies, spurring the rehiring or reinstatement of batches of fired workers in the weeks since. CISA has yet to follow suit.",
      "Asked if she'd return to the agency, Shaw paused. \"I would have to go back,\" she finally said, citing CISA's essential mission and a regular paycheck. \"I mean, they'd have to earn my trust back. But I don't know how you do that.\"",

      "The notice was sent to all \"full-time VOA employees,\" including reporters and \"all the way up to senior managers,\" a source with VOA told CBS News in a phone interview.",
      "A second source later told CBS News that VOA personal services contractors, who are also full-time, had received the same administrative email as federal employees. Contractors received termination notices on Sunday.",
      "As of Saturday, all employees could not access VOA headquarters in Washington, D.C.",
      "All VOA freelancers and stringers worldwide, and those with monthly contracts or assignments, have to stop working because there is now no way to pay them, the source added.",
      "Some VOA employees were walking to their studios when they received the notice and were told \"No, go home.\"",
      "The move comes after President Trump signed an executive order late Friday that seeks to make sweeping cuts at USAGM and several other agencies, including the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, the Institute of Museum and Library Services and the Minority Business Development Agency.",
      "\"Such entities shall reduce the performance of their statutory functions and associated personnel to the minimum presence and function required by law,\" the order states.",
      "\"I am deeply saddened that for the first time in 83 years, the storied Voice of America is being silenced,\" Michael Abramowitz, director of Voice of America, said in a statement provided to CBS News Saturday. \"I learned this morning that virtually the entire staff of Voice of America\u2014more than 1,300 journalists, producers and support staff\u2014has been placed on administrative leave today. So have I.\"",
      "Abramowitz acknowledged that the agency needs \"thoughtful reform, and we have made progress in that regard.

    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Saturday night temporarily blocked President Trump from removing immigrants under a wartime law known as the\u00a0Alien Enemies Act of 1798\u00a0after the president announced earlier in the day that he would enforce the law. Despite the ruling, 261 people were deported to El Salvador on Saturday, 137 of whom were removed under the Alien Enemies Act over alleged gang ties, a senior administration official said.",
      "The White House and Justice Department have said they had already been removed from the country when the judge made his ruling.",
      "The judge's ruling was in response to a federal civil lawsuit filed Saturday by a group of five Venezuelan men in immigration custody in Texas and New York local jails against President Trump and other administration officials.",
      "Mr. Trump invoked the 227-year-old wartime law earlier Saturday.",
      "The lawsuit filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., by attorneys with the ACLU and Democracy Forward argues the Alien Enemies Act is \"a wartime measure that has been used only three times in our Nation's history: the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.\"",
      "In a new filing late on Sunday, the plaintiffs in the case accused the Trump administration of violating the judge's order, alleging that the court had made it clear any planes in the air at the time the order was issued should return to the U.S. In the motion filed overnight, the plaintiffs requested \"that the Court immediately direct the government to submit one or more sworn declarations from individuals with direct knowledge of the facts clarifying\" the timing of the flights carrying the individuals to Ecuador in relation to the issuance of the court's order.",
      "Presidents are given the extraordinary power by the\u00a0Alien Enemies Act\u00a0to order the arrest, detention and deportation of noncitizens who are 14 years or older and come from countries staging an \"invasion or predatory incursion\" of the U.S.",
      "James E. Boasberg, chief judge of the District Court for the U.S. District of Columbia, on Saturday implemented a temporary restraining order preventing their deportations for 14 days. The Justice Department appealed that decision, arguing the D.C. court has no authority over the case because none of the five men are in the district. Four are being held in detention in Texas and one in New York. They further argued that invocation of the Alien Enemies Act is \"speculation.\"",
      "Then, following an emergency hearing Saturday evening, Boasberg expanded his order to include \"all noncitizens in U.S. custody\" who are covered by Mr. Trump's move to invoke the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "\"We are thrilled the judge recognized the severe harm our plaintiffs would face if removed,\" said Lee Gelernt, the ACLU attorney leading the lawsuit against Mr. Trump's proclamation, following Boasberg's decision. \"The President's use of the Alien Enemies Act is flat out lawless.\"",
      "Boasberg also appeared to verbally indicate that any deportation flights that were currently in the air with migrants subject to this order on board should be returned to the U.S., although that directive was not part of his written order.",
      "Social media posts from Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele indicated at least one flight carrying deported individuals had arrived in his country after the order. In one post, Bukele commented on a news story about the ruling by writing, \"Oopsie\u2026 Too late.\" That post was shared by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and White House Communications Director Steven Cheung.",
      "The Trump administration insists it did not defy the court order. The Justice Department, which has appealed the ruling, said in a court filing that several people \"had already been removed from United States territory under the Proclamation before the issuance of this Court's second order.\" It noted that the five men covered by the first temporary restraining order had not been deported.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Sunday said, \"The Administration did not 'refuse to comply' with a court order,\" also saying the order came after the deportation flight to El Salvador had left the country.",
      "The lawsuit states that Mr. Trump is \"expected to authorize immediate removal of noncitizens that the Proclamation deems to be alien enemies, without any opportunity for judicial review.\"",
      "\"It also contorts the plain language of the Act: arrivals of noncitizens from Venezuela are deemed an 'invasion' or 'predatory incursion' by a 'foreign nation or government,' where Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang, is deemed to be sufficiently akin to a foreign nation or government,\" the lawsuit alleges.",
      "As such, the government can identify any Venezuelan in the U.S. as a member of that gang, regardless of facts, and seek to deport them, the lawsuit alleges.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement responding to the ruling that, \"Tonight, a DC trial judge supported Tren de Aragua terrorists over the safety of Americans. TdA is represented by the ACLU. This order disregards well-established authority regarding President Trump's power, and it puts the public and law enforcement at risk.\"",
      "The lawsuit further argued that the Alien Enemies Act \"has only ever been a power invoked in time of war, and plainly only applies to warlike actions: it cannot be used here against nationals of a country \u2014 Venezuela \u2014 with whom the United States is not at war, which is not invading the United States, and which has not launched a predatory incursion into the United States.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that Mahmoud Khalil, an activist who is being detained by federal immigration authorities, is \"going to leave \u2014 and so are others.\"",
      "\"We're going to keep doing it,\" Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Mahmoud Khalil, a 30-year-old who was born in Syria to Palestinian parents, served as a negotiator on behalf of students during Columbia University's 2024 student encampment protests. He was arrested March 8 by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and detained in New Jersey before being transported to a federal detention facility in Louisiana. Officials were acting on a State Department order to revoke his student visa, Khalil's attorney said, but when they were informed that he was in the U.S. as a permanent resident with a green card, the agent said they were revoking that, too.",
      "Rubio said after the arrest that the administration would be revoking the visas and green cards \"of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\"",
      "On Sunday, when asked whether he could provide evidence to support a link to terrorism, or whether Khalil was simply espousing a controversial political point of view, Rubio cited news footage, saying \"these guys take over entire buildings, they vandalize colleges.\"",
      "\"Negotiating on behalf of people that took over a campus, that vandalized buildings,\" Rubio said. \"That's a crime in and of itself, that they're involved in being a negotiator, the spokesperson.\"",
      "The secretary of state explained the thought process, which he called \"very simple,\" outlining that when someone entered the U.S. with a visa \u2014 whether as a student or tourist \u2014 they do so as a \"guest.\"",
      "\"And if you tell us, when you apply for a visa, 'I'm coming to the U.S. to participate in pro-Hamas events,' that runs counter to the foreign policy interest of the United States of America,\" Rubio said. \"If you had told us that you were going to do that, we never would have given you the visa.\"",
      "Neither Rubio nor the White House have provided evidence that Khalil supported Hamas in any way other than support for the protesters at Columbia University, and Khalil's lawyers say he is being punished for exercising his right to protest. Khalil's attorneys have filed a motion to dismiss the case, and declare that his arrest and detention violate the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.",
      "A top ICE official in New York said in a court filing on Thursday that ICE charged Khalil as \"removable \u2026 in that the Secretary of State has reasonable grounds to believe that his presence or activities in the United States would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\"",
      "Rubio said that if Khalil had said he planned to enter the U.S. to become a \"spokesperson and one of the leaders of a movement that's going to turn one of your allegedly elite colleges upside down,\" preventing students from attending classes and resulting in vandalization of buildings, \"we never would have let him in.\"",
      "More broadly, Rubio said the administration \"every day now\" is approving visa revocations, suggesting that if the visa led to a green card, that has implications for the green card process as well.",
      "Asked whether people with pro-Palestinian views would be the sole target having their visas revoked, Rubio said members of the Tren de Aragua prison gang would be targeted as well, adding that \"we don't want terrorists in America.\"",
      "\"We don't want people in our country that are going to be committing crimes and undermining our national security or the public safety,\" Rubio said. \"It's that simple.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that U.S. airstrikes in Yemen on the Iran-backed Houthi rebels are targeting the group's ability to strike global shipping and attack the U.S. military, and are \"doing the world a favor.\"",
      "\"We're doing the entire world a favor by getting rid of these guys and their ability to strike global shipping. That's the mission here, and it will continue until that's carried out,\" Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "President Trump announced the strikes Saturday, saying the U.S. would use \"overwhelming lethal force\" until the Houthis cease shipping attacks. U.S. Central Command confirmed the strike in a social media post Saturday, and it's prepared to extend the campaign on the Houthis from the air and the sea for potentially weeks depending on reaction from the Houthis and Iran, a U.S. official told CBS News.",
      "U.S. fighter aircraft shot down about 11 drones the Houthis launched over the course of several hours Sunday morning local time, a U.S. official said. The Houthis also launched a ballistic missile that crashed into the water well short of the USS Harry S. Truman, the official said.",
      "Mr. Trump in January signed an executive order re-designating the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization. Mr. Trump had designated the Houthis as a terrorist organization in Jan. 2021, but former President Joe Biden removed the designation shortly afterward due to limitations it would place on delivering humanitarian aid to Yemen, although the Biden administration went on to label the group as a \"Specially Designated Global Terror Group\" in 2024.",
      "Saturday's strikes came as the Houthis out of Yemen have been disrupting transit in an important Red Sea transit point for global shipping for months, and the group said earlier this week that it would resume attacks on Israeli ships in response to Israel's blockage of aid to Gaza. The U.S., Israel and the United Kingdom have previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen, but Rubio said that while the Biden administration responded to previous attacks with retaliatory strikes, the new strikes are \"not a one-off.\"",
      "\"This is not a message,\" Rubio said. \"This is an effort to deny them the ability to continue to constrict and control shipping.\"",
      "The secretary of state said that over the last 18 months, the Houthis have \"struck or attacked 174 Naval vessels of the United States,\" along with 145 attacks on commercial shipping.",
      "\"So we basically have a band of pirates, you know, with guided precision anti-ship weaponry and exacting a toll system in one of the most important shipping lanes in the world,\" Rubio said. \"That's just not sustainable.\"",
      "Asked how long the campaign will last, Rubio said it will continue until the Houthis \"no longer have the capability to do that.\" He also acknowledged that he's heard no talk of ground raids so far and doesn't think there's \"a necessity for it right now.\"",
      "Rubio said as of Saturday night, \"some of the key people involved in those missile launches are no longer with us,\" adding that \"some of the facilities that they use are no longer existing, and that will continue.\"",
      "\"We're not going to have people sitting around with the missiles attacking the U.S. Navy,\" Rubio said. \"It's not going to happen. Not under President Trump.\"",

      "President Trump on Saturday invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to order the swift detention and deportation of all Venezuelan migrants suspected of being members of the Tren de Aragua prison gang, treating them like wartime enemies of the U.S. government.",
      "In his proclamation, the president argued the Venezuelan gang was \"perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States,\" the legal threshold for invoking the 227-year-old war authority.",
      "The president directed the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice to \"apprehend, restrain, secure, and remove every\" Venezuelan migrant, 14 or older, who is deemed to be part of Tren de Aragua and who lacks U.S. citizenship or permanent residency.",
      "Those subject to the law would be eligible to be summarily arrested, detained and deported, without any of the due process protections outlined in U.S. immigration law, which include opportunities to see a judge and request asylum. Instead, they would be treated as enemy aliens and processed under America's wartime laws.",
      "But Mr. Trump's directive was dealt an almost immediate blow on Saturday, after a federal judge agreed to block the government from deporting anyone in U.S. immigration custody subject to the president's Alien Enemies Act proclamation.",
      "At the request of a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, James Boasberg, chief judge for the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., temporarily blocked those deportations through a 14-day temporary restraining order.

      "As Mr. Trump's proclamation was litigated in Washington, the U.S. deported more than 260 migrants to El Salvador over the weekend, including Venezuelans with alleged ties to Tren de Aragua. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele posted a video showing some of the deportees being escorted by armed soldiers and police, having their heads shaved and marched into a prison.",
      "A senior administration official said 137 of the 261 deportees sent to El Salvador were alleged Venezuelan gang members expelled under the Alien Enemies Act. Another 101 Venezuelans were deported under regular immigration law, the official said. The group, the official added, also included 21 Salvadorans accused of MS13 gang membership and two \"special cases\" that Bukele described as gang leaders wanted by El Salvador's government.",
      "In a filing on Sunday, the Justice Department said the alleged Venezuelan gang members \"had already been removed from United States territory\" under the Alien Enemies Act before the court order barring the expulsions.",

      "Mr. Trump's extraordinary order is breathtaking in its scope and has little precedent in U.S. history. The law it cites, enacted 22 years after the Declaration of Independence, references invasions and incursions staged by \"any foreign nation or government.\"",

      "The idea of Palestinian resettlement in another country is one of several options the Trump team is chewing over as part of the U.S. president's larger goal of ending Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza and rebuilding the devastated Palestinian enclave.",
      "\"Nobody is expelling any Palestinians,\" President Trump said Wednesday, when the Irish Prime Minister was asked during the two leaders' Oval Office meeting by a Voice of America reporter about the president's controversial remarks in February when he suggested taking ownership of Gaza to rebuild it.",
      "Mr. Trump made the remarks during a Feb. 4 press conference alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying Gaza could be the \"Riviera of the Middle East.\"",
      "\"\u200aWe should go to other countries of interest with humanitarian hearts, and there are many of them that want to do this, and build various domains that will ultimately be occupied by the 1.8 million Palestinians living in Gaza, ending the death and destruction,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "A combination of Israeli and U.S. officials communicated to Sudan and Somalia, two diplomatic sources confirmed to CBS News. Senior far-right Israeli government officials have already been calling for Palestinians to migrate from the enclave. Mr. Trump's remarks have only emboldened Israel to reach out to other countries to explore opportunities for Palestinian resettlement, one source said.",
      "Three sources familiar with Mr. Trump's idea of resettling Gazans to another country told CBS News that his administration and Israel have also been interested in Syria. One source familiar with the Trump administration's Middle East policy said that the administration has attempted outreach to Syria's new interim government via a third-party interlocutor. Another source from the region told CBS News that Syria's government had been approached, but it was unclear whether there had been any response from Syria to the outreach.",
      "A senior Syrian official told CBS News that they are unaware of any outreach to their government by Israel or the U.S. about resettlement of Gazans.",
      "Dahir Hassan, Somalia's ambassador to the U.S., told CBS News that \"neither the U.S. administration nor Israeli authorities have approached the Somali government regarding any proposed relocation of Palestinians to Somalia.\" Hassan also cited concern that \"the dissemination of such unverified information risks fueling recruitment propaganda for extremist groups like ISIS and Al-Shabaab, potentially exacerbating security challenges in the region.\"",
      "The Sudanese government has not responded to a CBS News' request for comment.",
      "Syria's fledgling interim government is just three months old, after toppling Bashar al-Assad and his brutal regime which held an iron fist over the Syrian people for decades. The Arab northeast African nation of Sudan is currently embroiled in civil war and a refugee crisis while suffering pockets of famine. Tens of thousands of Sudanese refugees have sought asylum in Israel over the last two decades, only to be detained in the country's desert-based detention centers or left to live without any formal status. The East African country of Somalia is a fragile, formerly failed state where the militant Islamist group Al-Shabaab continues to wage a deadly insurgency.",
      "Since his Feb. 4 news conference, Mr. Trump has suggested Palestinians would have a choice on whether to leave but also indicated that their departure from Gaza could be permanent. In a Fox News interview several days later he said, \"We'll build beautiful communities, safe communities, could be five, six, could be two. But we'll build safe communities a little bit away from where they (the Palestinians) are.\" In the same interview, he said that Palestinians wouldn't have the right to return to Gaza under his plan because the enclave \"is not habitable\" and won't be for years to come.",
      "The United Nations reported in January that over 90% of housing units in Gaza are either damaged or destroyed and 1.9 million Gazan civilians have been displaced. Gaza's health ministry says more than 48,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war between Israel and Hamas, which began after the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack in which Hamas killed more than 1,000 Israelis and took roughly 100 more hostage.",
      "Multiple Arab governments, the United Nations and some Democratic lawmakers, quickly denounced Mr. Trump's idea of emptying out Gaza with some defining the idea as ethnic cleansing. Instead, Arab leaders endorsed an alternative Egyptian post-war construction plan for Gaza last week, but the Trump administration and Israel were both quick to reject it, again citing that the Gaza Strip is uninhabitable.",
      "Former President Joe Biden's administration had been sending U.S. officials on a regular basis to meet with the new Syrian government in Damascus in the lead-up to Mr. Trump's inauguration when the visits stopped.\u00a0 Syria's new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, was quick to condemn Mr. Trump's remarks in February, saying that the U.S. president's plan \"is a serious crime that will ultimately fail\". It is unclear what the Trump administration's overall policy toward the new Syrian government will be.",
      "\"The Trump administration should engage directly with the new government in Damascus, particularly after the agreement between Damascus and the SDF (the U.S.-allied Syrian Democratic Forces). And to ensure that Iran never again gains a foothold in Syria, for the true, enduring defeat of ISIS, and to conduct a full withdrawal of U.S. forces in the right way unlike what unfolded in Afghanistan,\" Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the Washington-based advocacy and humanitarian organization Syrian Emergency Task Force, told CBS News.",
      "Israel has conducted widespread airstrikes in Syria since December, on what it described as Assad regime weapons sites, and seized territory in the buffer zone between both countries. This past week, Israel struck inside a Damascus suburb, saying it was taking out the headquarters of the Islamic Jihad, an Iran-backed militant group that has a substantial foothold in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.",
      "A State Department spokesperson deferred to the Israeli government, and told CBS News that Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff \"continues to work tirelessly towards either an extension of Phase One (of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement) or an advance to Phase Two with these principles in mind\".",
      "The State Department also referred to remarks by Witkoff from a February Fox News interview in which he said, \"We need to explore new policy prescriptions that ultimately end up in a better life for Gazans and Palestinians.\"",
      "Witkoff also suggested in the same Fox interview that Gaza's entire Palestinian population could go to other Middle East-based Arab nations and other countries beyond the region: \"I think that the president's solution is: how do we address where two million people can go? And I think the obvious answers are: in some respects, Egypt, in some respects, Jordan; but in some respects other countries who have called us up and voluntarily said this is a humanitarian effort, we want to help you\".",
      "Asked by \"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan on Sunday about whether the Trump administration is talking to other countries about relocation of two million Palestinians in Gaza, Witkoff said again \"I think we're exploring, Margaret, all alternatives and options that lead to a better life for Gazans.

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on March 16, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u00a0We go now to the Democratic governor of Maryland, Wes Moore, who joins us this morning from Annapolis. Welcome back to Face the Nation.",
      "GOV. WES MOORE: Thank you. Great to be back.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you have in your state the Port of Baltimore, one of the country's largest ports. The President has put all these tariffs in place, teed them up, and on April 2, is poised to enact 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico. Do you have any idea when you will see the impact on shipping volume, what the impact on your state's economy will be?",
      "GOV. WES MOORE: We're already seeing the impacts of these- of these- of these disastrous and, frankly, not very well thought out policies when it comes to tariffs. You know, tariffs are a tool. They're not an ideology, but this administration is using it like an ideology. And so while the decisions are being made- made not with us, they're being made to us, we're already seeing how this is going to have a significant impact on the Port of Baltimore, which is really one of these country- one of the country's largest and most effective ports. It's the largest port for roll-on, roll-off vehicles. It is also seeing how the tariff policies are having disastrous impacts on our farmers over in the Eastern Shore and our chicken farmers in the eastern shore. This lack of predictability, this erratic behavior and this- and the indecisive decision making that's being made is already having very real impact on costs, it's having a very real impact on our businesses and our small businesses, it's having a very real impact on our economic engines and American competitiveness, as well as our national security, and so these are the type of things- this erratic behavior is the things that people were concerned about, and we are now seeing in real time in our states.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, your state was one of 20 that decided to legally challenge the Trump administration on the decision to dismiss 1300 workers at the Education Department. I'm wondering, as you sit there, how do you choose which issues to fight legally? And is litigation the Democrats' only tool here?",
      "GOV. WES MOORE: Well, it's not. I mean, when you look at the- at the flurry of executive actions and executive orders that have been laid out by this administration thus far, they really fall into three different categories. It's either ineffective, it is performative or it is illegal, right? Those are the three buckets that all these executive actions are falling under. And the ones that are illegal, we are going to take legal action to make sure that there are legal consequences for making these decisions that, frankly, the President of the United States does not have the authority to make unilaterally. And so when we talk about the different tools that we have- just in this past week alone, you know, I signed- I signed executive action, executive orders focusing on supporting law enforcement and our police officers and our firefighters and giving them pay raises. Because on the federal side, we've seen continued attacks on our public servants and our law enforcement and the cutting of first responders like FEMA. That just this past week, I have focused on things like lowering prescription drugs costs and actually creating partnerships with the private sector to lower prescription drug costs, that we're working on legislation right now to increase housing inventory that can bring housing prices down, and that is all in- that is all contrary to what we're seeing from the federal government. So the legal tool in working with our Attorney General closely to be able to file suit when the federal government oversteps his bounds is one tool, but we are going to use every tool at our disposal to make sure that the people of Maryland are protected, and we're making sure we're putting extra resources and money back into their pockets.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u00a0On Friday, President Trump went to the Justice Department, and while he was there, he said that the FBI headquarters will no longer be moved from Washington, DC out to the state of Maryland. He called Maryland a \"liberal state,\" and he said he's going to stop it. I know your office thought this was going to bring in 7,500 new jobs. Have you reached out to the White House to try to persuade them not to take it away?",
      "GOV. WES MOORE: \u00a0Here's- here's the ironic thing about it is, I found out about that announcement from the president via the news. That goes to show the level of partnership that this administration is- is that they- that they have and they would like from our nation's governors and from our nation's chief executives and so- so the thing that we know about this this is a direct attack and a direct assault on law enforcement, a direct attack on the FBI, because Maryland is the place and we've gone- we went through this process, not just for these past couple years, since I've been the governor, but for the past decade, where Maryland- where Maryland won this- this element, this competition, fair and square, quantitatively, where we showed that we could be the place that it was the only site-ready place to build, build-ready site. That we're the place that we could actually have national security assets that they could leverage, particularly when you're talking about the future mission of the FBI, which a lot of it is cyber. That we were the only place that had transportation assets that were close and nearby, that the workers could be able to benefit from. And the place that could get it done cheapest to the American taxpayer by talking about putting it anywhere else, you're talking about adding over a billion dollars in costs to the American taxpayer than what we have already gone through this process with the GSA, the General Service Administration for the state of Maryland. So the building is ready to go in the state of Maryland, but the President has just decided to politicize it by talking about- but he doesn't want it to go to a liberal state. We cannot continue to politicize national security when it is too important to the people who are serving us--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Have you called him? Have you called the White House?",
      "GOV. WES MOORE: We tried calling the White House before, and there's- there's- there's no response. And frankly, it just highlights the fact that, again, I found out about this announcement via news break\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you believe it?",
      "GOV. WES MOORE: I did not find out about this announcement from the White House.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you believe it?",
      "GOV. WES MOORE: The announcement?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.",
      "GOV. WES MOORE: \u00a0Well, I believe that the President thinks he has the authority to do this, but I also think that that falls into line of a collection of other things that the President does not have the authority to do. Congress is the one who actually allocates the capital towards where federal agencies are going to go. It's the GSA that made the decision that the new FBI building should be going to the state of Maryland, after going through a thorough and a very transparent process. And so I believe the President of the United States thinks that he can do this. But there's one thing that I know, and I say this on a Sunday morning, I know there is a King of Kings and a Lord of Lords, and I know he does not live in the White House.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u00a0I want to ask you about a speech you gave last night. You represented your party at the Gridiron Dinner, an annual gathering of journalists here, and you dedicated your remarks to federal workers. You said there was dignity in the work that they do. You also spoke about your party, though, and the struggles that it is having. You said Democrats used to be the cool ones. You joked about the advanced age of your party's leaders, saying their staff has to stand around with defibrillators. I know these are jokes, but- but you're acknowledging something here. Is the issue with your party age? Or a lack of vision? And is the reset underway to fix those things?",
      "GOV. MOORE: \u00a0I think we need to be very clear about who we're fighting for. And I think we need to be very clear about the vision that we are offering. You know, I think about what's happening, you know, in this moment, even the conversation around the continuing resolution where- where we all know that the consequences of a federal government shutdown would have been disastrous on the state of Maryland, that we would have not only seen our economy completely downturn into- into a recession, that we would have seen our nation's credit being downgraded, and along those lines, each and every one of us as states, our credit would have been downgraded as well because The United States decided that it's now no longer paying its bills. And we would have seen thousands of federal workers unfairly now being laid off or furloughed. So we know the consequences. But one thing we did not do was offer an alternative. One thing we did not do was articulate the terms for the American people. And so I think when the American people, when they do not have an option, or they're not seeing people fighting on their behalf, then yes, there is going to be a measurement of frustration. So we've got to do everything in our power. I know in the state of Maryland, we are mobilizing to make sure we're protecting our federal workers, that we're streamlining them into not just private sector jobs, but also state jobs that are open and available. That we're making sure we're increasing our unemployment insurance, and we are doing things like lowering the price of prescription drugs, and we're doing things like increasing housing inventory, which is going to decrease the housing price. We're doing everything in our power to fight for the people, and I think it becomes incredibly important, because people are paying attention who their fighters are and who their fighters are not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u00a0Well, there were voices within your party on Capitol Hill who awful- offered alternatives. They just weren't listened to. Do you think there is just no leader--",
      "GOV. MOORE: I don't see a difference--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --in the party?",
      "GOV. MOORE: \u00a0I don't- I don't see a difference. And frankly, I don't think the American people see a difference. If they are not hearing an alternative, if they're not hearing an alternative plan, if they're not hearing the plan to push back and fight back, if they're not seeing what we are doing in the streets and in the communities and in the neighborhoods to fight for their best interest, I think for the American people, they just look at it as theater. And that is the frustrating thing, the performative politics. People are done, and they are exhausted by it. They just want to see results, and that's exactly what we're trying to provide here in the state of Maryland.",

      "The HR 8799 system, 130 light years from Earth, is only 30 million years old \u2014 just a baby compared to our solar system's 4.6 billion years. A U.S.-led team of researchers used Webb to directly detect carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of all four of the system's known planets, according to the study.",
      "\"Webb's new images of two iconic systems, HR 8799 and 51 Eridani, and their planets have stunned researchers, and provided additional information into the chemical make-up of the young gas giants,\" NASA said in a statement.",
      "They used Webb's coronagraph instruments, which block the light from bright stars to get a better view of the planets revolving around them.",

      "So the new discovery is a \"key piece of proof\" that far-off planets can form in a similar way to those in our celestial backyard, Balmer said.",
      "But how common this is throughout the universe remains unclear.",
      "\"Our hope with this kind of research is to understand our own solar system, life, and ourselves in the comparison to other exoplanetary systems, so we can contextualize our existence,\" Balmer said. \"We want to take pictures of other solar systems and see how they're similar or different when compared to ours. From there, we can try to get a sense of how weird our solar system really is\u2014or how normal.\"",
      "Astronomers have now discovered nearly 6,000 exoplanets, many of them massive \u2014 and none of them known to be habitable.",
      "The \"huge leap forward we need to make\" is to focus on smaller Earth-sized worlds, Balmer said.",

      "That little fuel pellet is only about two millimeters in diameter. But the consequences could be huge.",
      "Fusion is a process that merges atoms together, and releases more energy than fission (which splits atoms apart). Fission is used by today's nuclear power plants and creates hazardous nuclear waste; fusion does not.",
      "Fusion would theoretically provide a nearly-limitless source of clean and safe energy, powering our world without the fossil fuels that are warming the planet and contributing to climate change. It would make energy-intensive technologies like vertical farming and water desalination much cheaper, potentially solving the world's food and water problems. Ma said, \"It is completely clean. There's no carbon anywhere in the equation. There's no high-level nuclear waste. You can place fusion power plants nearly anywhere. It could help meet all of the energy needs for the U.S. now and into the future, even as our energy needs rise.\"",

      "Instead of lasers, Commonwealth uses a cloud of super-heated plasma that burns at around 180 million degrees Fahrenheit, held in place by massive magnets that the company manufactures on site. \"The magnets in this machine will be the strongest magnets in the world,\" Mumgaard said. \"[They] could lift up an aircraft carrier.\"",
      "Commonwealth expects to complete its demonstration reactor next year. It just announced plans to build its first full-scale power plant in Virginia, but that won't deliver energy to the grid until sometime next decade. The demonstration reactor, Mumgaard said, \"is the penultimate step to that.\"",
      "Critics point out that fusion power has been an ever-elusive holy grail, always 20 to 30 years away. But startups like Commonwealth say this time is different. The technology is advancing as fast as the need for clean energy is rising \u2013 stars aligning in the quest to create stars here on Earth.",

      "Why is March's full moon called the worm moon?",
      "The Worm Moon nickname may have come from the earthworms typically found as spring nears, according to the\u00a0Old Farmer's Almanac. Other research suggests the name may date back to writings from the 1760s about worms, or beetle larvae, coming out from bark as trees thaw from the winter.",

    "summary": "Starliner astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams joined Crew 9 commander Nick Hague and cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov for their long-awaited return to Earth.",
    "story": [
      "Two long-delayed Starliner astronauts, Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita Williams, returned to Earth aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule Tuesday, finally closing out a repeatedly extended 286-day odyssey in space. They shared the ride home with two outgoing space station crewmates, Crew-9 commander Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov.",
      "Seventeen hours after undocking from the International Space Station, the Crew Dragon settled to a gentle, on-target splashdown off Florida's Gulf Coast near Tallahassee at 5:57 p.m. EDT.",
      "\"Splashdown! Good mains release,\" Hague radioed SpaceX flight controllers in Hawthorne, California, after the four main parachutes were released from the Crew Dragon.",
      "\"Copy, splashdown,\" a SpaceX engineer replied. \"We see main chutes cut. Nick, Alex, Butch, Suni, on behalf of SpaceX, welcome home.\"",
      "\"What a ride,\" Hague said. \"I see a capsule full of grins, ear to ear.\"\ufeff",
      "A SpaceX recovery ship was stationed nearby to haul the spacecraft on board so the crew could be helped out of the Crew Dragon's cabin and onto stretchers for initial medical checks. The side hatch was opened at 6:38 p.m. EDT and the crew began to emerge into the fresh air and sunshine about 10 minutes later. Williams and Wilmore were the last ones out.",
      "For the two Starliner astronauts, it closed out a marathon mission that was originally supposed to last about eight days but stretched to nine-and-a-half months, covering 4,576 orbits and 121 million miles since launch last June 5 aboard a problem-plagued Boeing capsule. Their flight ranks sixth on the list of longest single NASA missions.",
      "Hague and Gorbunov spent 171 days in orbit since their launch last September aboard the Crew 9 ferry ship.",
      "All station astronauts spend two hours a day in orbit exercising to minimize bone and muscle loss in the weightlessness of space. Even so, Wilmore and Williams will face extensive rehabilitation over the next several weeks and months as their bodies re-adapt to the unfamiliar tug of gravity.",
      "How did the astronauts return to Earth?",
      "After bidding their ISS crewmates farewell, the returning astronauts floated into their Crew Dragon and undocked from the Harmony module's space-facing port early Tuesday, at 1:05 a.m. EDT.",
      "Starting at 5:11 p.m., the flight plan called for an automated seven-and-a-half-minute de-orbit thruster firing to slow the ship down for re-entry.",
      "Twenty-seven minutes later, approaching the Florida Gulf Coast on a southwest-to-northeast trajectory, the Crew Dragon reached the discernible atmosphere, enduring heat shield temperatures of more than 2,500 degrees as the spacecraft rapidly slowed in the thickening air.",
      "Nine minutes after entry, the Crew Dragon's three main parachutes unfurled for the capsule's final descent to splashdown in the Gulf.",
      "From the recovery ship, all four Crew-9 fliers were to be flown to shore by helicopter, where a NASA jet was waiting to ferry them back to Houston and the Johnson Space Center for reunions with family members and more extensive medical checks.",
      "\"Butch and Suni, enjoyed their time on station, they got to do spacewalks and they got to do lots of cool science and things like that,\" said Steve Stich, manager of NASA's commercial crew program. \"Their families, kudos to them for being resilient. ... The families, a huge thank you to them. I'm sure the reunion is going to be wonderful with the families.\"",
      "Why were the astronauts stuck longer at the ISS?",
      "Wilmore and Williams launched to the International Space Station last June 5 on the first piloted test flight of Boeing's Starliner. The spacecraft suffered multiple propulsion system helium leaks and thruster problems during rendezvous with the space station, and NASA eventually decided to keep them on the station and to bring the Starliner down, without its crew, by remote control.",
      "NASA launched the next crew rotation mission \u2014 Crew-9 \u2014 in September carrying just two crew members, Hague and Gorbunov, instead of four. Wilmore and Williams then joined the Crew-9 fliers aboard the ISS for a normal-duration six-month mission.",
      "By keeping them in space as part of Crew-9, NASA was able to minimize the disruption to the ISS crew rotation sequence while maintaining a full slate of experiments and research.",
      "NASA cleared the way for Crew-9's return to Earth by launching four replacements \u2014 Crew-10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, cosmonaut Kirill Peskov and Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi \u2014 last Friday.",
      "Normal practice calls for a five-day \"handover\" between crews so the new arrivals can be fully briefed on the ins and outs of station operations and maintenance. But in this case, handover was shortened to just one day to take advantage of predicted favorable splashdown weather in the Gulf.",
      "The plight of the Starliner astronauts generated unprecedented interest during their extended stay in space, making headlines around the world and even prompting claims by President Trump that the crew had been \"abandoned\" in space by the Biden administration.",
      "\"This began when I asked Elon Musk to go up and get the abandoned astronauts, because the Biden administration was incapable of doing so,\" he posted Monday on Truth Social. \"They shamefully forgot about the astronauts, because they considered it to be a very embarrassing event for them.\"",
      "\"Elon and I have taken on the project, sending up the SpaceX Dragon, which has successfully docked and, hopefully, while there is always danger involved in such a mission, they will soon be on their way home,\" his post continued.",
      "After splashdown, the White House tweeted: \"Promise made, promise kept: President Trump pledged to rescue the astronauts stranded in space for nine months. Today, they safely splashed down in the Gulf of America, tanks to @ElonMusk, @SpaceX and @NASA!\"",
      "Mr. Trump did not mention that NASA originally planned to bring the crew home in February. But their mission was extended to March because SpaceX ran into problems with the Crew Dragon spacecraft being processed to carry the replacement Crew 10 into space.",
      "NASA decided last month to swap out the original Crew-10 Dragon for one that was earmarked for a commercial flight later this spring.",
      "That replacement spacecraft, the Crew Dragon \"Freedom,\" blasted off last Friday, carrying Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, cosmonaut Kirill Peskov and Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi to the space station early Sunday.",
      "The Crew-10 flight is what cleared the way for Crew-9 and the Starliner astronauts to come home this week \u2014 about two weeks earlier than the original Crew Dragon could have managed.",
      "For his part, Musk backed up the president's claims about the Biden administration \"abandoning\" the crew. Without offering any evidence, he said NASA turned down an offer to send up a mission specifically to get Wilmore and Williams and bring them back to Earth. No one at NASA has yet confirmed any such offer.",
      "NASA managers have gone out of their way to avoid contradicting the president. At a post-landing news conference, Joel Montalbano, deputy associate administrate for space operations, was repeatedly asked about the president's comments. But he chose not address any specifics.",
      "\"NASA, as an agency, we work for the president,\" he said. \"Whoever's there, we work for them. We had an input from that office, we took a look at it and, you know, our job is to take all the inputs we get and operate as safe and successfully as we can.",
      "\"And that's what we did for this administration, and that's what we would do for any administration.\"",
      "Was this the longest any U.S. astronaut has stayed in space?",
      "While 286 days is a long flight by normal NASA standards, it's well short of the U.S. record for a single flight \u2014 371 days, set by astronaut Frank Rubio in 2022-23.",
      "Ironically, Rubio's record was the result of another extended mission, this one the result of a major coolant leak in the Russian Soyuz he launched aboard. The Russians decided not to bring the crew down aboard their original spacecraft and instead launched a replacement.",
      "As a result, Rubio ended up spending a little more than a full year in space, twice as long as he originally expected.",
      "Given Williams' two previous stays aboard the space station, she will move up to No. 2 on the list of most experienced U.S. astronauts with 608 days in space overall. Only former astronaut Peggy Whitson has more time aloft, 675 days over four flights. Wilmore's total across three flights will stand at 464 days aloft.",

    "summary": "The gas giants outside our solar system are not capable of hosting extraterrestrial life, but do offer clues in a lingering mystery about how distant planets form, researchers said.",
    "story": [
      "The James Webb Space Telescope has directly observed the key chemical of carbon dioxide in planets outside of our solar system for the first time, scientists announced Monday.",
      "The gas giants are not capable of hosting extraterrestrial life, but do offer clues in a lingering mystery about how distant planets form, according to a study in The Astrophysical Journal.",
      "The HR 8799 system, 130 light years from Earth, is only 30 million years old \u2014 just a baby compared to our solar system's 4.6 billion years. A U.S.-led team of researchers used Webb to directly detect carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of all four of the system's known planets, according to the study.",
      "\"Webb's new images of two iconic systems, HR 8799 and 51 Eridani, and their planets have stunned researchers, and provided additional information into the chemical make-up of the young gas giants,\" NASA said in a statement.",
      "They used Webb's coronagraph instruments, which block the light from bright stars to get a better view of the planets revolving around them.",
      "\"It's like putting your thumb up in front of the sun when you're looking up at the sky,\" lead study author William Balmer, an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University, told AFP.",
      "Normally, the Webb telescope only detects exoplanets by glimpsing them when they cross in front of their host star.",
      "This \"transiting method\" was how Webb indirectly detected CO2 in the atmosphere of the gas giant WASP-39 in 2022.",
      "But for this latest discovery, \"we're actually seeing the light that is emitted from the planet itself, as opposed to the fingerprint of that light from the host star,\" Balmer said.",
      "This is not easy \u2014 Balmer compared the process to using a torch to spot fireflies next to a lighthouse.",
      "While these gas giants may not be able to host life, it is possible that they had moons that could, he added.",
      "There are missions currently under way to find out if there could be life in the vast oceans underneath the icy shells of several of Jupiter's moons.",
      "\"Key piece of proof\"",
      "Carbon dioxide (CO2) is essential for life on Earth, making it a key target in the search for life elsewhere.",
      "Because CO2 condenses into little ice particles in the deep cold of space, its presence can shed light on planetary formation.",
      "Jupiter and Saturn are believed to have first formed from a \"bottom up\" process in which a bunch of tiny, icy particles came together into a solid core which then sucked in gas to grow into giants, Balmer said.",
      "So the new discovery is a \"key piece of proof\" that far-off planets can form in a similar way to those in our celestial backyard, Balmer said.",
      "But how common this is throughout the universe remains unclear.",
      "\"Our hope with this kind of research is to understand our own solar system, life, and ourselves in the comparison to other exoplanetary systems, so we can contextualize our existence,\" Balmer said. \"We want to take pictures of other solar systems and see how they're similar or different when compared to ours. From there, we can try to get a sense of how weird our solar system really is\u2014or how normal.\"",
      "Astronomers have now discovered nearly 6,000 exoplanets, many of them massive \u2014 and none of them known to be habitable.",
      "The \"huge leap forward we need to make\" is to focus on smaller Earth-sized worlds, Balmer said.",
      "NASA's Nancy Grace Roman space telescope will use a coronagraph to do that just after its planned launch in 2027.",
      "Last year, the Webb telescope discovered carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide on the surface of Charon, Pluto's largest moon.",
      "Balmer hopes to use Webb to observe more four-planet systems, but added that future funding was now in question.",
      "Last week the Trump administration announced that NASA's chief scientist has been dismissed, indicating that more cuts were to come for the U.S. space agency.",

From there, it glided straight in for docking at the Harmony module's forward port at 12:04 a.m. EDT.",
      "Motorized latches then engaged to pull the capsule into the docking mechanism for an airtight structural seal. After standard leak checks and umbilical connections, the crew opened the Dragon's forward hatch at 1:35 a.m. and floated into the space station.",
      "Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, an Army colonel and former combat helicopter pilot, told flight controllers she and her fellow fliers had a \"great trip\" from the launch pad to the space station, adding \"I cannot tell you the immense joy of our crew when we looked out the window and we saw the space station for the first time.\"",
      "\"Let me tell you, that is such an amazing journey, you can hardly even put it into words,\" she said. \"The ride up on the Falcon 9, orbiting the Earth for the last couple of days, it's been absolutely incredible ... Thank you very, very much.\"",
      "\"Thank you to SpaceX for the awesome ride up here,\" said co-pilot Nichole Ayers, an Air Force major and F-22 Raptor pilot. \"As a (space) rookie, that was one of the coolest things I've ever done. I can't wait to get to work up here.\"",

By that point, Wilmore and Williams will have logged about 290 days \u2014 9.7 months \u2014 in space on a flight originally expected to last a little longer than one week. Hague and Gorbunov's time in space will come to around 174 days, depending on the landing date.",
      "\"This is a huge mission for us on Crew 10,\" said Steve Stich, manager of the commercial crew program that oversees SpaceX Crew Dragons and Boeing's Starliner. \"They're all big, but this started all the way back to Crew 9 when we launched that mission with two empty seats, and we had those seats reserved for Butch and Suni.\"",
      "The Starliner astronauts have \"just done a phenomenal job,\" Stich said, \"and so we're excited to bring them back.\"",
      "Wilmore and Williams were launched aboard a Boeing Starliner capsule on June 5 for the spacecraft's first piloted test flight. They successfully docked with the International Space Station the next day, but the Starliner experienced multiple helium propulsion system leaks and several maneuvering jets did not produce the expected thrust.",
      "The astronauts originally planned to spend about eight days in space, but NASA and Boeing, the Starliner's builder, carried out weeks of tests and analysis to determine whether the Starliner could be trusted to safely bring its crew back to Earth.",
      "By August, Boeing managers were convinced engineers understood the problems and the crew could safely come home in the Starliner. But NASA managers ruled that option out. Instead, they decided to keep the astronauts aboard the station until early this year when they could hitch a ride back aboard the Crew 9 Dragon.",
      "The Starliner, meanwhile, successfully returned to Earth in September, kicking off hands-on troubleshooting and ongoing work to prepare for the eventual resumption of flights.",
      "The Starliner astronauts took the news of their mission extension in stride.",
      "\"Butch, and I knew this was a test flight, we knew that we would probably find some things (that did not work as expected), and we found some stuff,\" Williams told CBS News in an in-flight interview. \"And so that was not a surprise. The discussion went over the summer, and as things started unrolling, unraveling, we sort of understood that, hey, we might be up here a little bit longer.",
      "\"And that's what our job is. We have both been in the military, both Navy guys, our deployments have been extended. You do what's right for the team, and what was right for the team is to stay up here and be expedition crew members for the International Space Station.\"",
      "President Trump blamed the extended mission on the Biden administration, which he said had \"abandoned\" the Starliner crew.",
      "\"Biden left them up there,\" Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on March 6. \"We have two astronauts that are stuck in space. I have asked Elon (Musk), I said, 'Do me a favor, can you get 'em out?' He said 'Yes.' He is preparing to go up I think in two weeks.\"",
      "But the Crew Dragon that Mr. Trump was referring to will not be bringing Wilmore and Williams back to Earth. It it is assigned to the Crew 10 fliers and will remain docked at the outpost for the next five months. Their arrival does, however, clear the way for Crew 9, including Wilmore and Williams, to finally return to Earth along with Hague and Gorbunov.",
      "Musk said earlier he offered to launch a mission to bring Wilmore and Williams back to Earth earlier, but the offer, he said, was turned down for political reasons. NASA managers say they never heard of such an offer and that the current plan causes the least disruption to station operations and downstream crew rotation flights.",
      "While NASA could have brought Crew 9 down earlier aboard the Crew 9 Dragon, but that would have left a single astronaut \u2014 Pettit \u2014 aboard the lab to operate and maintain the U.S. segment of the space station. Research would have ground to a halt and he would have had difficulty in a variety of emergency scenarios.",
      "\"Sure, it could have taken us home, but that leaves only three people on the space station from the Soyuz crew, two Russians and one American,\" Williams told CBS News. \"And, you know, the space station is big. It's a building, you know, it's the size of a football field. Things happen.",
      "\"So things can go wrong, and you need to be able to fix it, either inside and outside. And so having additional people to be able to do that is really important.\"",
      "Both Wilmore and Williams have repeatedly said they are not \"stranded\" and have not been \"abandoned\" in space.",
      "\"That's been the narrative from day one, stranded, abandoned, stuck, and I get it, we both get it,\" Wilmore told a reporter during a recent interview. \"But that is, again, not what our human space flight program is about. We don't feel abandoned, we don't feel stuck, we don't feel stranded.",

      "Those who glanced up at the sky Thursday night had an opportunity to catch the March 2025 \"Blood Moon,\" a phenomenon that colors the full moon in shades of red, orange and yellow during a total lunar eclipse.",
      "This month's full moon\u00a0was due to pass through the shadow of Earth either late Thursday night or very early Friday morning, depending on the viewer's time zone. It was visible to people in the Americas and elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere.",
      "Dubbed the \"Worm Moon\" by the Farmer's Almanac, which has been assigning names to full moons for almost a century, this one is expected to last through Saturday morning, according to NASA. The full moon technically rose in its totality early Friday.",
      "Here's what to know about the event \u2014 and why the moon showed a new hue when it happened.",
      "Why was the moon red, orange and yellow?",
      "The moon appeared to turn red as Earth passed directly between it and the sun in what's known as a total lunar eclipse. Their perfect alignment darkens the moon, from the perspective of folks looking up, because our planet's position blocks most sunlight from reaching it.",
      "Some light still makes its way to the moon's surface, but only certain shades of it. The colors that wind up there are longer wavelengths of light \u2014 red, orange, yellow \u2014 which withstood the journey through \"a thick slice of Earth's atmosphere,\" NASA said.",
      "Shorter wavelengths of the color spectrum, like blue, scatter easily when they hit the atmosphere. That's why a vast sky can look blue in the middle of the day, when sunlight can shine straight down from overhead. Longer wavelengths materialize on Earth when sunlight hits from more of a perpendicular angle, so its route through our atmosphere can be more extensive. Short wavelengths are essentially filtered out by the atmosphere over such a protracted distance, and only the longer reds, oranges and yellows remain.",
      "What is a \"Blood Moon\"?",
      "\"Blood Moon\" is a nickname that refers to the moon's reddish appearance during a total lunar eclipse.",
      "The full moon takes on several shades of red, orange and yellow when it's nearer the outer edges of Earth's shadow \u2014 when it first intersects with the path of Earth's shadow, for example, and as it's on its way out. But shades of deep red become more pronounced as the moon enters the darkest part of the shadow.",
      "What exactly causes a \"Blood Moon\"?",
      "A \"Blood Moon\" happens during a total lunar eclipse, when the sun, Earth and the moon align in that order. Long wavelengths of sunlight are refracted through Earth's atmosphere before reaching the moon, which reflects them in reddish hues that may resemble the color of blood.",
      "When was the \"Blood Moon\" lunar eclipse?",
      "This week's \"Blood Moon\" began late Thursday night. The moon moved through Earth's shadow overnight, with the best opportunity to see the reddish moon around 3 a.m. ET Friday.",

      "How can I observe the eclipse?",
      "The moon will still be visible during the eclipse, even though it will be in full shadow of the Earth, according to NASA.",

      "There are also partial and penumbral eclipses, which are when the sun, Earth and moon are not perfectly aligned.",
      "Why does the moon look red during the lunar eclipse?",
      "With the moon in the shadow of the Earth, it will appear red-orange, according to NASA. Lunar eclipses are sometimes called blood moons because of the phenomenon.",
      "During a lunar eclipse, the moon gets its red coloration because any sunlight that's not blocked by the Earth is filtered through a \"thick slice of Earth's atmosphere\" as it heads toward the moon's surface, according to NASA. The more dust or clouds in Earth's atmosphere during the total lunar eclipse, the redder the moon will appear.",
      "\"It's as if all the world's sunrises and sunsets are projected onto the Moon,\" NASA explains in a blog post.",
      "This is the same phenomenon that makes the sky appear blue during the day.",
      "Why is March's full moon called the worm moon?",
      "The Worm Moon nickname may have come from the earthworms typically found as spring nears, according to the\u00a0Old Farmer's Almanac. Other research suggests the name may date back to writings from the 1760s about worms, or beetle larvae, coming out from bark as trees thaw from the winter.",
      "There are also other names for March's full moon related to the transition from winter to spring. The first day of spring will be on March 20, just days after the Worm Moon.",

      "What else can you see during the full Blood Worm Moon?",
      "If there's a bit of rain during the full moon, there may be a rare moonbow, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac. It's like a rainbow, but created by moonlight, rather than sunlight. Moonbows only happen when the full Moon is fairly low in the sky, so the phenomenon would be most apparent in the hours after sunset when the sky is dark.",
      "Viewers can also look to the western sky on the night of the total lunar eclipse to catch a glimpse of Jupiter and Mars, according to NASA. Constellations may also be easier to spot than usual as Earth's shadow dims the Moon's glow.",

    "story": [
      "With the countdown within 45 minutes of launch, NASA called off an attempt to send the next crew to the International Space Station Thursday evening to allow more time to troubleshoot a ground system hydraulics issue. If the problem can be resolved in time, NASA and SpaceX will make another attempt to launch the crew Friday evening.",
      "The scrub will add at least two more days to the eventual return to Earth of Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and pilot Sunita Williams, along with two other outgoing space station crew members.",
      "Crew-10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov were strapped in and ready for blastoff from historic pad 39 at the Kennedy Space Center at 7:48 p.m. EDT Wednesday.",
      "But throughout the final few hours of the countdown, SpaceX engineers were troubleshooting an apparent problem with one of two clamp arms that hold the Falcon 9 rocket to its launch support gantry. Hydraulics are used to retract the two clamps prior to launch, and while the system appeared to be working normally, it wasn't clear whether one of the arms would retract fully.",
      "A launch opportunity Thursday was ruled out due to expected high winds and to give engineers more time to assess data and determine what, if any, repairs are needed. If the hydraulics problem can be resolved in time, NASA and SpaceX could be ready to press ahead with a launch attempt at 7:03 p.m. Friday.",
      "Whenever Crew-10 takes off, rendezvous and docking with the space station is expected the following day.",
      "Standing by to welcome them aboard will be Crew-9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams, along with cosmonauts Alexsey Ovchinin, Ivan Vagner and NASA astronaut Don Pettit, who were launched last September aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.",
      "McClain and her crewmates will spend two days getting briefed by Crew-9 on the intricacies of space station operations before Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams undock on March 19\u00a0for their return to Earth. The normal \"handover\" period is five days or so, but mission managers shortened it this time around to maintain the lab's food reserves.",
      "While the ongoing saga of the \"stranded\" Starliner astronauts has overshadowed the Crew-10 mission, McClain said she and her crewmates began training for their mission in 2023 and they were all eager to finally get into space. McClain and Onishi are space station veterans while Ayers and Peskov are making their first flight.",
      "All four are veteran military or commercial pilots. Before joining NASA, McClain, an active-duty Army colonel, served as a combat helicopter pilot while Ayers, an Air Force major, is a veteran F-22 Raptor pilot. Onishi served as a commercial pilot in Japan, flying Boeing 767 jetliners, and Peskov is an experienced commercial 757 pilot.",
      "\"We're going to have planned and unplanned maintenance to keep the space station running,\" McClain said. \"We have a plethora of science experiments, both inside and outside of the space station. We have spacewalks. We have visiting vehicles (and) the potential of (hosting) private astronaut missions.\"",
      "\"They're ready to come home\"",
      "As for Wilmore and Williams, McClain said, \"honestly, I'm kind of most looking forward to breaking bread with those guys, talking to them, giving them big hugs. We go way back. ... We're ready to go up there. They're ready to come home.\"",
      "\"This is a huge mission for us on Crew 10,\" said Steve Stich, manager of the commercial crew program that oversees SpaceX Crew Dragons and Boeing's Starliner. \"They're all big, but this started all the way back to Crew 9 when we launched that mission with two empty seats, and we had those seats reserved for Butch and Suni.\"",
      "The Starliner astronauts have \"just done a phenomenal job,\" Stich said, \"and so we're excited to bring them back.\"",
      "Given an on-time launch for Crew 10 Friday, Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams could undock on March 19 and land as early as March 20 or 21. If so, the Starliner astronauts will have logged 288 days or so \u2014  9.5 months \u2014  \u00a0in space on a flight originally expected to last a little longer than one week. Hague and Gorbunov's time in space will come to about 173 days.",
      "The U.S. record for longest single spaceflight is held by astronaut Frank Rubio, who spent 371 days in space because of problems with the Soyuz spacecraft that carried him to orbit. Like the Starliner crew, he was forced to extend his mission and come home on a different Soyuz.",
      "In any case, what would normally be a relatively routine crew rotation, sending up four crew members to replace four others wrapping up a five- to six-month station visit, has turned into political theater, fueled by repeated criticism from President Trump and Elon Musk blaming the Biden administration for the Starliner crew's predicament.",
      "Musk said in a post on his social media platform X that he offered to \"go get\" Wilmore and Williams earlier, but the offer was turned down. He did not say who turned the proposal down or even whether it was someone at NASA or the White House.",
      "\"Biden left them up there,\" Mr. Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on March 6. \"We have two astronauts that are stuck in space. I have asked Elon, I said, do me a favor, can you get 'em out? He said yes. He is preparing to go up I think in two weeks.\"",
      "But the Crew Dragon he was referring to will not be bringing Wilmore and Williams back to Earth. It will be carrying the Crew-10 fliers and will remain docked at the outpost for the next five months. Their arrival does, however, clear the way for Crew-9, including Wilmore and Williams, to finally return to Earth aboard their own Crew Dragon.",
      "That Crew Dragon, which carried Hague and Gorbunov to the station last September for a normal tour of duty, has been docked at the lab ever since. It was launched with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams so their ride home has been at the station for the past five-and-a-half months.",
      "NASA could have brought Crew-9 down earlier, but that would have left a single astronaut, Pettit, aboard the lab to operate and maintain the U.S. segment of the space station. Research would have ground to a halt and he would have had difficulty in a variety of emergency scenarios.",
      "\"Sure, it could have taken us home, but that leaves only three people on the space station from the Soyuz crew, two Russians and one American,\" Williams told CBS News in an in-flight interview. \"And, you know, the space station is big. It's a building, you know, it's the size of a football field. Things happen.",
      "\"So things can go wrong, and you need to be able to fix it, either inside and outside. And so having additional people to be able to do that is really important.\"",
      "\"We don't feel stranded\"",
      "Both Wilmore and Williams have repeatedly said they are not \"stranded\" and have not been \"abandoned\" in space.",
      "\"That's been the narrative from day one, stranded, abandoned, stuck, and I get it, we both get it,\" Wilmore told a reporter during a recent interview. \"But that is, again, not what our human space flight program is about. We don't feel abandoned, we don't feel stuck, we don't feel stranded.",
      "\"We come prepared. We come committed. That is what your human space flight program is. It prepares for any and all contingencies that we can conceive of, and we prepare for those. ... Let's change (the narrative) to 'prepared' and 'committed.'\"",
      "And so, NASA's plan to bring the Starliner astronauts home, a plan managers said minimized disruption to the space station crew rotation schedule, has been in place since last August. Even so, the president has repeatedly blamed the Biden administration for the extended mission.",
      "NASA managers have not openly challenged the president's comments and have generally downplayed their responses to questions about Musk's claim to have offered to launch another Crew Dragon to bring Wilmore and Williams home.",
      "Last August, Stich was asked about the possibility of launching a mission specifically to bring the Starliner crew back to Earth. He told reporters during a news conference that the agency \"really never considered that option.\"",
      "\"From the very beginning, we liked the option of modifying Crew-9 or Crew-8,\" he said, referring to the option of adding Williams and Wilmore to Hague's crew or whether to shoehorn them into a Crew Dragon that brought four other station fliers back to Earth last October.",
      "\"We looked at both of those and bringing them back on either one of those vehicles,\" Stich said at the time. \"We're trying to lay out the rest of our manifest to make sure we have vehicles available for all the flights. It just didn't make sense to go ahead and accelerate a flight to return Butch and Suni earlier.\"",
      "What went wrong with Boeing's Starliner?",
      "Wilmore and Williams were launched aboard a Boeing Starliner capsule last June 5 for the spacecraft's first piloted test flight. They successfully docked with the International Space Station the next day, but the Starliner experienced multiple helium propulsion system leaks and several maneuvering jets that did not produce the expected thrust.",
      "NASA carried out weeks of tests and analysis to determine whether the Starliner could be trusted to safely bring its crew back to Earth.",
      "By August, Boeing managers were convinced engineers understood the problems and the crew could safely come home in the Starliner. But NASA managers disagreed and ruled that option out. Instead, as Stich described, they decided to keep the astronauts aboard the station until early this year\u00a0when they could hitch a ride back aboard the Crew-9 Dragon.",
      "The Starliner astronauts took the news of a lengthy mission extension in stride.",
      "\"Butch, and I knew this was a test flight, we knew that we would probably find some things (that did not work as expected), and we found some stuff,\" Williams told CBS News. \"And so that was not a surprise. The discussion went over the summer, and as things started unrolling, unraveling, we sort of understood that, hey, we might be up here a little bit longer.",
      "\"And that's what our job is. We have both been in the military, both Navy guys, our deployments have been extended. You do what's right for the team, and what was right for the team is to stay up here and be expedition crew members for the International Space Station.\"",
      "Last September, Boeing successfully brought the Starliner down by remote control and NASA launched the Crew-9 mission aboard a Crew Dragon carrying just two crew members, Hague and Gorbunov, along with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "The Starliner astronauts joined the Crew-9 expedition and originally expected to return to Earth in February after arrival of the next Crew Dragon in the crew rotation sequence. But the Crew-10 Dragon, a new vehicle making its first flight, ran into problems that delayed launch, and Crew-9's return, to the end of March.",
      "NASA eventually decided to switch Crew-10 to a different Dragon, enabling a launch on March 12, a few weeks earlier than the previous late March target. Stich said the capsule swap and slightly earlier launch date were not the result of any outside pressure.",
      "The decision \"really was driven by a lot of other factors,\" Stich said. \"We were looking at this before some of those statements were made by the President and Mr. Musk.\"",
      "Said Ken Bowersox, NASA's chief of spaceflight operations at agency Headquarters: \"I can verify that Steve had been talking about how we might need to juggle the flights and switch capsules a good month before there was any discussion outside of NASA.\"",
      "\"But the president's interest sure added energy to the conversation, and it's great to have a president who's interested in what we're doing.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 18 Mar 2025 23:15:54 -0400",
    "summary": "One professor said this JFK assassination release is \"certainly the most useful\" of any so far \"because of the redactions being removed.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Tuesday evening released tens of thousands of pages of government documents related to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy, weeks after President Trump ordered government agencies to make their JFK files public.",
      "The documents were uploaded by the National Archives and Records Administration, the agency responsible for housing the government's collection of records related to the assassination. The Archives said Tuesday that \"all records previously withheld for classification\" have been released, but not all are available online yet.",
      "Shortly after taking office in January, the president took executive action to establish a process to declassify and release any remaining documents related to Kennedy's killing, as well as the assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. The order instructed the director of national intelligence and attorney general to present the president with a plan for the \"full and complete release of records relating to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.\"",
      "Last month, the FBI said it had discovered roughly 2,400 records related to the assassination during a search stemming from Mr. Trump's executive action.",
      "What's in the newly released JFK files?",
      "Mr. Trump estimated the new files contain roughly 80,000 pages. CBS News has a team of reporters sifting through the records to identify what documents contain new information.",
      "Many of the records were expected to be unredacted versions of documents that have been released but partially obscured in the past.",
      "Researchers have estimated there are about 3,000 records related to the case that hadn't been previously released in full. There are 1,123 documents of varying lengths in Tuesday's online release.",
      "Various investigations into the JFK assassination over the years \u2014 some as recently as the 1990s \u2014 swept up classified information that dealt with intelligence gathering methods and friendly foreign governments but were not directly linked to the assassination. Portions of documents, and some entire records, had remained classified for decades to protect sources and methods.",
      "David Barrett, a professor of political science at Villanova University who studies the Kennedy presidency, was examining the documents on Tuesday evening. He told CBS News that \"non-scholars who dive into these documents are going to be baffled as to what most of them have to do with the Kennedy or other assassinations.\" For scholars like him, however, he said it is \"certainly the most useful release of documents that has occurred because of the redactions being removed.\"",
      "\"Now I know who or what is being referred to. So a memorandum on CIA relations with the Miami newspapers, for example, and details on three CIA officers doing technical collection of intelligence in Cuba \u2014 I've never really had those details before,\" he said.",
      "Before the release, Barrett said he didn't expect \"earth-shaking information, either with regard to the assassination or more broadly.\" \"But, you know, you never know,\" he added.",
      "Larry Sabato, the director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics and author of \"The Kennedy Half-Century,\" told the Associated Press that his team is going through the released files in search of a \"long, long list\" of sensitive documents that were previously heavily redacted. He believes some of those passages may concern Cuba or \"what the CIA did or didn't do relevant to Lee Harvey Oswald,\" Kennedy's assassin.",
      "Where to read the new JFK assassination files",
      "The documents have been uploaded to a portal maintained by the National Archives, which can be found here. The Archives maintains the government's trove of records known as the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection.",
      "Not all of the files are available online yet, however. Some are available \"in person, via hard copy or on analog media formats\" at the National Archives at College Park, Maryland. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said the records that are only available in person are being digitized and will be uploaded to the Archives in the coming days. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard will post updates on social media, and the records will also be on the White House website.",
      "Additional documents remain under court seal, including some for reasons of grand jury secrecy. Other IRS-related documents must be unsealed before release, and the Archives and Justice Department are working on making these available.",
      "According to the Mary Ferrell Foundation, a nonprofit that compiles historical government records about the JFK assassination and other events, roughly 3,500 documents in the official collection contained redactions before the latest release. About 75% of those records were produced by the CIA. More than 500 other records were withheld from public release entirely.",
      "The Mary Ferrell Foundation runs its own JFK documents repository on its website, which has deeper search functions for exploring the trove of records. The group typically adds new documents shortly after they are released by the Archives.",
      "Why did Trump release these JFK files?",
      "Mr. Trump campaigned on declassifying and releasing records related to the JFK assassination, in part due to his political alliance with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has long called for more transparency about the assassinations that killed his uncle and father.",
      "In 1992, Congress passed a law requiring the government to release all of its records about the assassination by October 2017, while giving the president the authority to withhold records for national security reasons. In his first term, Mr. Trump unveiled thousands of documents, but some of their contents were kept under wraps after lobbying by the CIA and FBI. Other records were withheld altogether.",
      "Over the course of 2021 and 2022, President Biden likewise released thousands of records but kept key portions redacted, frustrating researchers and observers who had called for their full release for years.",
      "When was JFK assassinated?",
      "Kennedy was shot in the head on Nov. 22, 1963, at the age of 46 while riding in a convertible in Dallas, Texas. Oswald, a former Marine and communist activist who had lived in the Soviet Union, was soon arrested for the killing. But Oswald was also shot and killed in the basement of the Dallas police headquarters two days later.",
      "An investigation led by Chief Justice Earl Warren concluded that Oswald acted alone in shooting Kennedy, but the probe has been widely criticized by academics and historians in the 62 years since the assassination.",
      "Oswald had been on the government's radar before the assassination. He defected to the Soviet Union in 1959, and returned to the U.S. in 1962. A self-described Marxist, he worked with a pro-Fidel Castro activist group and had contact with Soviet and Cuban consulates in the months leading up to Kennedy's death.",
      "In October 1963, the CIA intercepted a phone call he made to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City, though the full implications of the conversation remain unclear. Some additional documents related to that wiretap operation were released in 2022.",
      "Longtime JFK watchers have hoped that the documents that have been redacted or withheld by the government would reveal more information about Oswald's activities in Mexico City and what else federal agencies knew about him before the shooting.",
      "This is a developing story and will be updated.",
      "The Associated Press and \n                                                  \n                      Andres Triay\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "published": "Tue, 18 Mar 2025 22:21:01 -0400",
    "summary": "Gary Shapley and Joseph Ziegler were tapped by the treasury secretary to lead reform efforts at the IRS.",
    "story": [
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has promoted two agents with the Internal Revenue Service who said they faced retaliation after blowing the whistle to Congress and speaking out to CBS News about political interference into their investigation of Hunter Biden's tax crimes.",
      "IRS special agents Gary Shapley and Joseph Ziegler were assigned to Bessent's office as senior advisers for IRS reform, and Shapley was named deputy director of criminal investigations at the agency.",
      "The promotions stand in stark contrast to President Trump's decision on Monday to revoke Secret Service protections for Hunter Biden, despite an executive order signed by his father, former President Joe Biden, extending those protections through July.",
      "Shapley and Ziegler first came forward in 2023, alleging the Department of Justice \"slow-walked\" the yearslong tax probe into Hunter Biden, and that prosecutors told them not to pursue investigative leads related to his father. They were removed from the case \u2014 and temporarily sidelined with pay.",
      "The duo's disclosures came ahead of a series of court decisions that ultimately led President Biden to pardon his son for the crimes related to the agents' investigation. Hunter Biden pleaded guilty to those crimes after a Delaware judge rejected a plea deal that would have given him broad immunity.",
      "\"We have been motivated by one singular mantra: do what's right,\" Shapley said in a statement. \"It's never been easy, and there have been more pitfalls than one would hope, but we appreciate the opportunity Secretary Bessent is giving us to utilize our skills and firsthand knowledge of the agency to further the work of the administration to root out waste and fraud from the federal government and make a difference.\"",
      "In an interview with Fox News Tuesday, Bessent said he is giving Shapley and Ziegler \"a year to investigate the wrongdoing that's going on at the IRS,\" adding that they will make sure \"this Hunter Biden nonsense\" doesn't repeat itself.",
      "The new assignments come as the IRS is drafting plans to cut its workforce by as much as half through layoffs, attrition and buyouts, part of the Trump administration's effort to downsize the federal government. And the prominent postings are an abrupt departure from the tenuous relationship the two IRS whistleblowers previously had with the tax agency.",
      "In December, the federal watchdog that investigates whistleblower complaints substantiated claims by Shapley and Ziegler alleging the IRS had retaliated against them when agency leadership had removed the two agents from the Hunter Biden case at DOJ's request.",
      "The retaliation claim was part of an effort by Shapley and Ziegler to push back against what they believed was a wide-ranging effort by Hunter Biden's attorneys to discredit them. In September, the two men sued Abbe Lowell \u2013 one of Hunter Biden's attorneys \u2013 for defamation. Lowell responded by strenuously disputing the allegations and calling Shapley and Ziegler \"disgruntled.\"",
      "As for Hunter Biden, he recently was granted approval by a California judge to drop a lawsuit he filed against a former Trump White House aide he accused of illegally publishing private photos, emails, and other materials from his now-infamous laptop.",
      "In court documents, Hunter Biden cited financial reasons for dropping the lawsuit. He said his \"income has decreased significantly\" as sales of his art have dried up in the past year, and he was forced out of the house he was renting due to the fires that ravaged Los Angeles in January.",

    "published": "Tue, 18 Mar 2025 22:01:10 -0400",
    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes ruled in favor of transgender active-duty service members and transgender people in the process of enlisting.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday blocked enforcement of a new Defense Department policy barring transgender people from serving in the U.S. military.",
      "U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes granted a request for a preliminary injunction sought by transgender active-duty service members and transgender people who are in the process of enlisting. The judge's order temporarily blocks Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and the military services from implementing President Trump's executive order and additional guidance that prohibits transgender people from serving in the military.",
      "But the judge put her order on hold until March 21 to give the Justice Department time to seek emergency relief from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.",
      "Reyes, appointed by former President Joe Biden, issued her decision after holding several hours of hearings earlier this month, during which she sharply questioned Justice Department lawyers about the Defense Department's justifications for the ban.",
      "\"Indeed, the cruel irony is that thousands of transgender servicemembers have sacrificed \u2014 some risking their lives \u2014to ensure for others the very equal protection rights the Military Ban seeks to deny them,\" Reyes wrote in her 79-page decision, later adding, \"The court's opinion is long, but its premise is simple.\u00a0 In the self-evident truth that 'all people are created equal,' all means all. Nothing more. And certainly nothing less.\"",
      "Jennifer Levi, senior director of transgender and queer rights for GLAD Law, one of the lead attorneys in the case, called the ruling \"decisive\" and said it \"speaks volumes.\"",
      "\"The court's unambiguous factual findings lay bare how this ban specifically targets and undermines our courageous service members who have committed themselves to defending our nation. Given the court's clear-eyed assessment, we are confident this ruling will stand strong on appeal,\" Levi said in a statement.",
      "A spokesperson for the Justice Department called the ruling \"the latest example of an activist judge attempting to seize power at the expense of the American people, who decisively voted to elect President Trump.\"",
      "The policy arose out of an executive order Mr. Trump issued in late January that directed Hegseth to implement a policy for transgender service members based on troop readiness. The order stated that \"adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual's sex conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life. A man's assertion that he is a woman, and his requirement that others honor this falsehood, is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member.\"",
      "The executive order also\u00a0revoked a measure implemented in January 2021 by then-President Joe Biden that allowed transgender individuals to serve in the U.S. military.",
      "In response to Mr. Trump's directive, Hegseth issued a memorandum in early February that halted recruitment of new service members diagnosed with gender dysphoria and paused gender-affirming care for transgender troops. The Pentagon then said in a late February document that the U.S. would begin removing transgender troops from the military within 30 days unless they obtained a waiver.",
      "The memo said that individuals with a diagnosis or history of gender dysphoria \"are no longer eligible for military service.\" It also said that pronoun usage when referring to a service member must reflect his or her sex and barred the use of Pentagon funds for gender-affirming care.",
      "The lawsuit before Reyes was filed in late January by a group of more than a dozen transgender active-duty service members, one person enlisted in U.S. Army basic training and five transgender people who were in the process of enlisting. They argued that the ban was unconstitutional and sought a court order blocking its enforcement.",
      "In her decision, Reyes found that the challengers were likely to succeed on their claim that the ban fails the highest level of judicial scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, because it classifies based on sex and transgender status. The judge also held that the Trump administration's policy is likely driven by unconstitutional animus.",
      "\"The Military Ban is soaked in animus and dripping with pretext,\" she wrote. \"Its language is unabashedly demeaning, its policy stigmatizes transgender persons as inherently unfit, and its conclusions bear no relation to fact.\"",
      "Reyes wrote that Mr. Trump and the Defense Department \"could have crafted a policy that balances the nation's need for a prepared military and Americans' right to equal protection. They still can. The Military Ban, however, is not that policy. The court therefore must act to uphold the equal protection rights that the military defends every day.\"",
      "The judge said government's policy is \"overbroad\" and also includes \"derogatory generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of transgender persons.\" Such generalizations, Reyes wrote, \"do not suffice to show that a sweeping discriminatory ban is substantially related to military readiness and unit cohesion.\"",
      "The decision from Reyes is likely to be appealed by the Justice Department, but it is the latest legal setback for the Trump administration, since several of its policies have been temporarily blocked by federal judges. A second challenge to the Mr. Trump's military ban is currently underway in Washington state.",
      "Mr. Trump sought to bar transgender people from serving in the military during his first term, in 2017, but an initial Pentagon policy was blocked by federal courts. The plan was then revised in 2018, and it took effect the following year and remained in place until the start of the Biden administration.",

    "story": [
      "Louisiana used\u00a0nitrogen gas to put Jessie Hoffman Jr., 46, to death Tuesday evening in the state's first execution in 15 years. Nitrogen gas has been used just four other times to execute a person in the United States \u2014 all in Alabama, the only other state with a protocol for the method.",
      "\"It is unfortunate that bad people exist, and they do real bad things. When these acts of violence happen, society must not tolerate it,\" Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said in a statement following the execution, adding, \"If you commit heinous acts of violence in this State, it will cost you your life. Plain and simple.",
      "Hoffman declined to give a final statement before the gas began flowing and he subsequently was pronounced dead at 6:50 p.m. at the Louisiana State Penitentiary. Authorities said the nitrogen gas flowed for 19 minutes during what one official called a \"flawless\" execution, although one witness spoke of the inmate convulsing during the process.",
      "Hoffman's attorneys had sought to halt the execution, saying in a series of court filings leading up to his death the method is unconstitutional, violating the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. They also said it infringes on Hoffman's freedom to practice religion, specifically his Buddhist breathing and meditation in the moments leading up to his death.",
      "Louisiana officials maintain that the method is painless and say it is past time for the state to deliver justice promised to victims' families after a decade-and-a-half hiatus. Attorney General Liz Murrill says that she expects at least four people on Louisiana's death row to be executed this year.",
      "On Monday, Hoffman's attorneys filed a slew of additional challenges in state and federal courts as a last-ditch effort to stop the execution. The 19th Judicial District Court Judge Richard \"Chip\" Moore considered one of the challenges at a hearing Tuesday morning, which involved the question of whether the execution as planned violated Hoffman's religious freedom under the Preservation of Religious Freedom Act. But the state judge in Baton Rouge ultimately declined to the halt the impending procedure, CBS News affiliate\u00a0WAFB reported.",
      "The judge on Monday had issued a temporary restraining order \u2014 preventing the state from executing Hoffman \u2014 pending the Tuesday morning hearing. The restraining order was to expire at 9:30 a.m., with the execution scheduled to take place hours later on Tuesday evening.",
      "After court battles earlier this month, a federal judge temporarily halted Hoffman's execution by nitrogen gas last week, issuing a preliminary injunction to stop the state from immediately carrying out his death sentence. An appeals court quickly reversed that injunction, and in the wake of Tuesday's hearing, Hoffman's attorneys had just one final appeal out to the United States Supreme Court to halt the execution. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected that effort on Tuesday, declining to intervene by a 5-4 vote, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Hoffman was convicted of the 1996 murder of Mary \"Molly\" Elliott, a 28-year-old advertising executive, in New Orleans.",
      "Under the Louisiana protocol, which is nearly identical to Alabama's, officials had earlier said Hoffman would be strapped to a gurney before a full-face respirator mask fitted tightly on him. Pure nitrogen gas was then pumped into the mask, forcing him to breathe it in and depriving him of the oxygen needed to maintain bodily functions.",
      "The protocol called for the gas to be administered for at least 15 minutes or five minutes after the inmate's heart rate reaches a flatline indication on the EKG, whichever is longer.",
      "Each inmate put to death using nitrogen in Alabama had appeared to shake and gasp to varying degrees during their executions, according to media witnesses, including an Associated Press reporter. Alabama state officials said the reactions were involuntary movements associated with oxygen deprivation.The reactions are involuntary movements associated with oxygen deprivation, state officials have said.",
      "Currently, four states \u2014 Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Oklahoma \u2014 specifically authorize execution by nitrogen hypoxia, according to records compiled by the Death Penalty Information Center.",
      "Alabama first used the lethal gas to put Kenneth Eugene Smith to death last year, marking the first time a new method had been used in the U.S. since lethal injection was introduced in 1982.",
      "In an effort to resume executions, Louisiana's GOP-dominated Legislature expanded the state's approved death penalty methods last year to include nitrogen hypoxia and electrocution. Lethal injection was already in place.",
      "On Tuesday afternoon, a small group of execution opponents held a vigil outside the rural southeast Louisiana prison at Angola, where the state's executions are carried out. Some passed out prayer cards with photos of a smiling Hoffman and planned a Buddhist reading and \"Meditation for Peace.",
      "Over recent decades, the number of executions nationally has declined sharply amid legal battles, a shortage of lethal injection drugs and waning public support for capital punishment. That has led a majority of states to either abolish or pause carrying out the death penalty.",

      "\"Butch and Suni, enjoyed their time on station, they got to do spacewalks and they got to do lots of cool science and things like that,\" said Steve Stich, manager of NASA's commercial crew program. \"Their families, kudos to them for being resilient. ... The families, a huge thank you to them. I'm sure the reunion is going to be wonderful with the families.\"",
      "Why were the astronauts stuck longer at the ISS?",
      "Wilmore and Williams launched to the International Space Station last June 5 on the first piloted test flight of Boeing's Starliner. The spacecraft suffered multiple propulsion system helium leaks and thruster problems during rendezvous with the space station, and NASA eventually decided to keep them on the station and to bring the Starliner down, without its crew, by remote control.",
      "NASA launched the next crew rotation mission \u2014 Crew-9 \u2014 in September carrying just two crew members, Hague and Gorbunov, instead of four. Wilmore and Williams then joined the Crew-9 fliers aboard the ISS for a normal-duration six-month mission.",
      "By keeping them in space as part of Crew-9, NASA was able to minimize the disruption to the ISS crew rotation sequence while maintaining a full slate of experiments and research.",
      "NASA cleared the way for Crew-9's return to Earth by launching four replacements \u2014 Crew-10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, cosmonaut Kirill Peskov and Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi \u2014 last Friday.",
      "Normal practice calls for a five-day \"handover\" between crews so the new arrivals can be fully briefed on the ins and outs of station operations and maintenance. But in this case, handover was shortened to just one day to take advantage of predicted favorable splashdown weather in the Gulf.",
      "The plight of the Starliner astronauts generated unprecedented interest during their extended stay in space, making headlines around the world and even prompting claims by President Trump that the crew had been \"abandoned\" in space by the Biden administration.",
      "\"This began when I asked Elon Musk to go up and get the abandoned astronauts, because the Biden administration was incapable of doing so,\" he posted Monday on Truth Social. \"They shamefully forgot about the astronauts, because they considered it to be a very embarrassing event for them.\"",
      "\"Elon and I have taken on the project, sending up the SpaceX Dragon, which has successfully docked and, hopefully, while there is always danger involved in such a mission, they will soon be on their way home,\" his post continued.",
      "After splashdown, the White House tweeted: \"Promise made, promise kept: President Trump pledged to rescue the astronauts stranded in space for nine months. Today, they safely splashed down in the Gulf of America, tanks to @ElonMusk, @SpaceX and @NASA!\"",
      "Mr. Trump did not mention that NASA originally planned to bring the crew home in February. But their mission was extended to March because SpaceX ran into problems with the Crew Dragon spacecraft being processed to carry the replacement Crew 10 into space.",
      "NASA decided last month to swap out the original Crew-10 Dragon for one that was earmarked for a commercial flight later this spring.",
      "That replacement spacecraft, the Crew Dragon \"Freedom,\" blasted off last Friday, carrying Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, cosmonaut Kirill Peskov and Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi to the space station early Sunday.",
      "The Crew-10 flight is what cleared the way for Crew-9 and the Starliner astronauts to come home this week \u2014 about two weeks earlier than the original Crew Dragon could have managed.",
      "For his part, Musk backed up the president's claims about the Biden administration \"abandoning\" the crew. Without offering any evidence, he said NASA turned down an offer to send up a mission specifically to get Wilmore and Williams and bring them back to Earth. No one at NASA has yet confirmed any such offer.",
      "NASA managers have gone out of their way to avoid contradicting the president. At a post-landing news conference, Joel Montalbano, deputy associate administrate for space operations, was repeatedly asked about the president's comments. But he chose not address any specifics.",
      "\"NASA, as an agency, we work for the president,\" he said. \"Whoever's there, we work for them. We had an input from that office, we took a look at it and, you know, our job is to take all the inputs we get and operate as safe and successfully as we can.",
      "\"And that's what we did for this administration, and that's what we would do for any administration.\"",
      "Was this the longest any U.S. astronaut has stayed in space?",
      "While 286 days is a long flight by normal NASA standards, it's well short of the U.S. record for a single flight \u2014 371 days, set by astronaut Frank Rubio in 2022-23.",
      "Ironically, Rubio's record was the result of another extended mission, this one the result of a major coolant leak in the Russian Soyuz he launched aboard. The Russians decided not to bring the crew down aboard their original spacecraft and instead launched a replacement.",
      "As a result, Rubio ended up spending a little more than a full year in space, twice as long as he originally expected.",
      "Given Williams' two previous stays aboard the space station, she will move up to No. 2 on the list of most experienced U.S. astronauts with 608 days in space overall. Only former astronaut Peggy Whitson has more time aloft, 675 days over four flights. Wilmore's total across three flights will stand at 464 days aloft.",

    "published": "Tue, 18 Mar 2025 21:14:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The chief justice's statement came after President Trump called for a federal judge to be impeached.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Chief Justice John Roberts issued a rare statement Tuesday defending federal judges who have issued decisions against the Trump administration, saying that \"impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement\" with a court's decision.",
      "\"For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,\" Roberts said in the statement distributed by the Supreme Court's public information office. \"The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.\"",
      "Roberts' statement comes after President Trump attacked a federal district judge on Truth Social and called for his impeachment. The judge, James Boasberg, temporarily\u00a0blocked the Trump administration on Saturday from using the wartime law called the Alien Enemies Act to detain and deport noncitizens.",
      "Boasberg had issued an oral order from the bench requiring planes carrying 261 people that were on their way to Central America to return to the U.S. The Trump administration had alleged that 137 of the people on board the planes had ties to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and were removed from the U.S. under the Alien Enemies Act. Despite Boasberg's order, two planes landed in El Salvador, sparking allegations that the Trump administration had defied a court order.",
      "\"This Radical Left Lunatic of a Judge, a troublemaker and agitator who was sadly appointed by Barack Hussein Obama, was not elected President - He didn't WIN the popular VOTE (by a lot!), he didn't WIN ALL SEVEN SWING STATES, he didn't WIN 2,750 to 525 Counties, HE DIDN'T WIN ANYTHING!\" Mr. Trump wrote in his post.",
      "The president added that Boasberg and \"many of the Crooked Judges' I am forced to appear before\" should be \"IMPEACHED!!!\"",
      "Mr. Trump's targeting of Boasberg, who was appointed to the U.S. district court in Washington, D.C., by President Barack Obama, is an escalation in the ongoing attacks on federal judges who have been overseeing the dozens of challenges to the president's policies. Some of those judges have ordered the Trump administration to put its plans on hold while legal proceedings move forward, sparking condemnations from the president's allies and threats of impeachment. The Justice Department has appealed many of those rulings and sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court\u00a0in three court fights\u00a0so far.",
      "Federal judges are appointed for life and can only be removed from the bench if they are impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate. Just 15 judges have been impeached in U.S. history, most recently in 2010. Eight of those 15 have been convicted and removed from office.",
      "Elon Musk, a senior adviser to the president, has taken to social media repeatedly to call on the judges to be impeached, claiming they are \"evil.\"",
      "In a\u00a0post last month on X, the social media company he owns, Musk claimed the country is witnessing \"an attempted coup of American democracy by radical left activists posing as judges.\" In\u00a0another post, he wrote that there \"need to be some repercussions above zero for judges who make truly terrible decisions.\"",
      "Republicans in the House have also\u00a0introduced impeachment resolutions\u00a0against at least three judges because of rulings they dislike, which were issued in the early stages of legal challenges to Mr. Trump's policies.",
      "In response to the attacks on members of the judiciary, two Republican-appointed judges warned last week that they strike at judicial independence.",
      "\"Our system of government is premised on three independent branches and a judiciary that can function independently,\" Judge Richard Sullivan, who sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit, said during a call with reporters hosted by the Judicial Conference. \"That's what makes it work, and so it's crucial that people understand that.\"",
      "Judge Jeffrey Sutton, of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, said it's a \"shame\" to see judges attacked simply for doing their jobs.",
      "\"Threats to judges are threats to judicial independence. They've been around for a long time. There's lots of different mechanisms. Threats of impeachment \u2014 this is not the first time this has happened,\" he said. \"One thing worth keeping in mind is if we dilute the standards for impeachment, that's not just a problem for judges, that's a problem for all three branches of government.\"",
      "Roberts has spoken about the importance of judicial independence before, namely in his year-end report issued to close out 2024. He highlighted four areas that he said threatened the independence of judges: violence, intimidation, disinformation and threats to defy lawfully entered judgments.",
      "Roberts is the presiding officer of the Judicial Conference, the policymaking body for the judiciary. Such statements from the chief justice are rare, but it is not the first time Roberts has pushed back against Mr. Trump's comments.",
      "In 2018, after the president complained about a federal judge who ruled against an asylum policy during his first term and referred to him as an \"Obama judge,\" Roberts said the U.S. doesn't have \"Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\"",

    "summary": "Some information demanded by a judge about flights carrying alleged Tren de Aragua gang members is likely to remain private, the Justice Department said.",
    "story": [
      "Plaintiffs suing the Trump administration over use of a war authority to deport alleged gang members warned that failing to block the president from its use would mean anyone could be treated as an enemy alien.",
      "The lawyers for Venezuelan migrants suing the government said Tuesday in an appellate court filing: \"The implications of the government's position are staggering. If the President can designate any group as enemy aliens under the Act, and that designation is unreviewable, then there is no limit on who can be sent to a Salvadoran prison, or any limit on how long they will remain there.\"",
      "Those subject to the 1798 Alien Enemies Act can be summarily arrested, detained and deported, without the due process protections outlined in U.S. immigration law, including opportunities to see a judge and request asylum. Instead, they may be treated as enemy aliens and processed under America's wartime laws. President Trump invoked the act Saturday, and used it to send two planes carrying alleged Tren de Aragua gang members to a prison in El Salvador.",
      "In a hearing Saturday, D.C. U.S. Chief District Judge James Boasberg blocked their deportation, prompting an immediate Justice Department appeal.",
      "On Tuesday, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer provided new details about the Trump administration's deportation flights of alleged gang members, but continued to argue the government had a right to reject a judge's order directing the planes to return to the U.S., even if they were already in the air.",
      "According to a sworn declaration by Robert Cerna, the acting field office director of ICE's enforcement and removal operations, the two planes \"departed U.S. territory and airspace before 7:25 p.m.\" on Saturday \u2014 40 minutes after D.C. District Chief Judge James Boasberg verbally ordered the planes to be returned to the U.S. during a hearing Saturday evening.",
      "The government reiterated Tuesday that because the planes were over international waters and airspace by the time the judge ordered them to turn around, Boasberg no longer had jurisdiction over the migrants.",
      "Attorneys for the Trump administration had also argued in a hearing on Monday that Boasberg did not have authority to redirect the planes because the judge had not put his order demanding the planes to return to the U.S. in writing. The judge responded that his order applied to the planes, regardless of where they were in the air.",
      "Cerna said the government's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to justify the removal of alleged Tren de Aragua members was signed Friday evening, a day before the flights were publicly announced on Saturday by the White House.",
      "His testimony is part of a court-mandated series of responses to Boasberg, who was frustrated by the government's lack of details on the flights and deportation operations during the hearing on Monday. The rest of the answers Boasberg requested are likely to remain private because of \"operational issues,\" a Justice Department attorney told the court, declining to provide the court with this information publicly.",
      "Those details are likely to include whether additional planes have left the U.S. with alleged Tren de Aragua gang members, a timeline showing when the flights took off from the U.S. and landed in El Salvador and a count of remaining members of the gang in U.S. custody.",
      "Cerna's sworn testimony did not provide all of this information, though he noted that 54 members of Tren de Aragua are in detention in the U.S., and approximately 172 are on the non-detained docket, which means they are not being detained by the government as their immigration proceedings continue. There are also approximately 32 are in criminal custody who have active detainers \u2014 that is, ICE has asked that they be held for up to 48 hours after they're scheduled to be released.",
      "Despite Boasberg's ruling, 261 people were deported to El Salvador Saturday, 137 of whom were removed under the Alien Enemies Act over alleged gang ties, a senior administration official said.",
      "The federal civil lawsuit against Mr. Trump and other administration officials was filed by five Venezuelan men in immigration custody in Texas and New York local jails.",
      "Boasberg's ruling prevents the deportations of the plaintiffs and migrants for 14 days.",

    "summary": "Here's how economists identify a recession, and where the U.S. economy currently stands amid market turmoil caused by tariff threats.",
    "story": [
      "As tariff uncertainty continues to\u00a0roil the stock market, some economists believe the U.S. could be headed toward a recession, a possibility that even the Trump administration has declined to rule out.\u00a0But how close are we to a recession, and how will we know when we're in one?",
      "While it is notoriously hard to predict a recession, there are definitive criteria that must be met in order for the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a nonprofit, nonpartisan research group, to determine a business cycle is recessionary.",
      "\"There's no one agreed-upon definition of a recession, but the most commonly used metric is two back-to-back periods of negative economic growth,\" said CBS MoneyWatch correspondent Kelly O'Grady. \"That would mean that we would see negative growth in U.S. gross domestic product or GDP, over two consecutive quarters.\"",
      "Notably, a financial quarter's growth measure only becomes clear after it's concluded, \"so we wouldn't officially know we're in a recession until we were already in it,\" O'Grady said.",
      "Recessions are generally marked by rising unemployment and a significant decline in economic activity across sectors as consumers cut back on spending and businesses put a freeze on hiring. Since 1929, there have been 14 recessionary periods in the U.S. Most recently, the U.S. economy entered a brief, two-month long recession from February to April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Although U.S. unemployment ticked up last month, to 4.1% from 4%, it remains low by historical standards. Employers added 151,000 jobs in February, a sign that businesses are still looking to hire.\u00a0Retail sales rose in February, albeit less than expected.",
      "For now, the warning signs aren't yet flashing red, economists say.",
      "\"Right now, things feel uncomfortable given the significant amount of policy uncertainty, the federal layoffs, and we've seen business, consumer and investor sentiment fray,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So to some it feels like the economy is in a recession, but we are not there yet.\"",
      "Another possibility: stagflation",
      "Still, some economists are warning of another, potentially worse outcome for the U.S. economy: stagflation. That informal term \u2014 a mashup of \"stagnation\" and \"inflation\" \u2014 refers to periods of economic distress when growth falters even as prices remain painfully high. Ordinarily, inflation eases when the economy contracts.",
      "The U.S. last experienced stagflation in the 1970s and early '80s, when oil production became more costly and inflation surged. Reduced consumer spending led to a slowdown in economic growth and increased unemployment.",
      "\"A good way to think about stagflation is an economic balancing problem,\" O'Grady said. \"Let's say you've got high inflation ... that means the economy is supercharged with a lot of demand, which drives part of that inflation. So the federal government will try raising interest rates to make it more costly to borrow money, and then slow down some of that demand.\"",
      "How close are we to entering a recession?",
      "For now, economic data suggests that the risk of the economy entering a recession is relatively low. The U.S. labor market\u00a0continues to create jobs\u00a0at a decent clip and consumer spending remains solid.",
      "\"The unemployment rate is slightly elevated compared to one year ago, and inflation is almost half a percent higher compared to last September,\" O'Grady said. \"These might seem like small signs but when you're taking them with other factors like diminishing consumer sentiment and spending \u2014 and then you've got the wild card of tariffs, there are warning lights of a weakening economy. But we don't have a red light yet.\"",

      "A new survey from Bank of America shows that global fund managers are moving out of domestic companies in what analysts at the financial giant describe as the \"biggest drop in U.S. equity allocation ever.\" The reason: growing pessimism about the country's economic outlook as the Trump administration beats the drum for a trade war with Canada, Mexico, China and other countries.",
      "\"Peak U.S. exceptionalism is reflected in record rotation out of U.S. stocks,\" the analysts wrote in the monthly report. Instead, investors with a dimming view of U.S. stocks are increasingly going to cash,\u00a0buying gold and investing in other parts of the world, including the Eurozone, BofA found.",
      "After a two-day rebound, leading market indexes were back in the red on Tuesday. The S&P 500 fell 60 points, or 1.1%, to close at 5,615, the Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 260 points, or 0.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 305 points, or 1.7%.",
      "A major shadow over financial markets is the prospect of steep new U.S. tariffs on key trading partners scheduled to take effect on April 2. Those include 25% duties on U.S. imports from Mexico and Canada, as well as even more sweeping matching levies on a number of other countries.",
      "\"The size, speed and breadth of U.S. tariff hike announcements since January is staggering,\" Brian Coulton, chief economist with Fitch Ratings, said in an email.",
      "The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development on Monday downgraded its forecast for U.S. and global growth, citing the risk of escalating trade disputes. Over the first three months of 2025, the country's gross domestic product is growing at a rate of 1.2%, S&P Global Market Intelligence estimates.",
      "That is markedly slower than the 2.3% recorded in the final quarter of last year. For all of 2024, the economy grew 2.8% on the strength of healthy corporate earnings, frisky job growth and resilient consumer spending.",
      "A stark reality is setting in for investors, according to analysts. President Trump's aggressive rhetoric on trade isn't simply a matter of posturing to gain negotiating leverage with other countries; rather, he's perfectly willing to let tariffs fly as part of a long-term strategy of shoring up key American industries and fostering domestic investment.",
      "Whether that strategy ultimately pays off remains to be seen. For now, however, investors are raising their guard.",
      "\"A lot of articles have appeared in the last couple of sessions suggesting the White House is working on improving its 'messaging' on economic/tariff policies and that's great, but investors shouldn't be fooled about what's coming: The trade/tariff agenda represents a seismic change, and even if one buys the view that this will pay off over time, the near and medium-term will see enormous disruption,\" market analyst Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, told investors in a research note.",
      "To be sure, such disruption could bolster stocks if Mr. Trump were to reverse course on his salvo of tariffs set to be deployed next month.

      "The Trump administration provided a detailed accounting\u00a0of the number of probationary employees, generally considered those who were in their jobs for less than one year, who were targeted in the president's drastic plans to scale back the federal workforce in court filings Monday. The information was submitted as part of the administration's compliance with a temporary restraining order issued by U.S. District Judge James Bredar last week.",
      "Justice Department lawyers provided declarations from human resources officials at 18 different agencies who were covered by Bredar's order, which detailed the number of probationary workers who were fired last month and then had to be reinstated to their roles.",
      "Bredar, who sits on the federal district court in Maryland, temporarily blocked the mass firings of probationary workers and ordered them to be reinstated. He is the second judge to order the Trump administration to rehire fired federal workers.",
      "The Justice Department has appealed both decisions. But on Monday, a three-judge panel for the U.S. Appeals for the 9th Circuit declined to put one of the orders, from a federal district judge in California, on hold while proceedings move forward.",
      "In their declarations, the human resources officials across the federal government said they were working to comply with Bredar's order. But they all warned that reinstating removed employees would cause \"significant confusion\" and turmoil for those workers. The officers also noted that an appeals court could reverse the district court's order, subjecting affected employees to multiple changes in their employment status in just a few weeks.",
      "Most of the employees who were rehired were placed on administrative leave with full pay and benefits, the human resources officials said. In a separate filing in a case challenging the mass firings brought in California, Justice Department lawyers said that the administrative leave placement is \"a first part of a series of steps to reinstate probationary employees\" and an \"intermediate measure taken by a number of the agencies in order to return probationary employees to full duty status.\" The judge in that case last week ordered the Trump administration to reinstate fired probationary workers at six agencies.",
      "Here is the breakdown of how many employees were fired and then reinstated at 18 agencies:",
      "Environmental Protection Agency: 419 probationary workers were terminated and all received notices informing them that the removals were rescinded.

    "published": "Tue, 18 Mar 2025 16:29:26 -0400",
    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang ruled in favor of a group of more than two dozen unnamed former and current USAID employees and contractors.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday found that Elon Musk and the White House's Department of Government Efficiency likely violated the Constitution when they unilaterally acted to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development.",
      "U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang ruled in favor of a group of more than two dozen unnamed current and former USAID employees and contractors who had challenged the efforts to shutter USAID, which were mounted by DOGE and Musk, a senior White House adviser who President Trump has said is the leader of the task force.",
      "Chuang granted in part their request for a preliminary injunction and said in a 68-page decision that DOGE and Musk likely violated the Constitution's Appointments Clause and separation of powers.",
      "He ordered Musk and task force employees to reinstate access to email, payment and other electronic systems to all current USAID employees and personal services contractors. The judge also prevented DOGE and Musk from taking any action relating to the shutdown of USAID, including placing employees on administrative leave, firing USAID workers, closing its buildings, bureaus or offices, and deleting the contents of its websites or collections.",
      "DOGE and Musk are prohibited under the judge's order from taking any other actions relating to USAID without the \"express authorization\" of an agency official with legal authority to take the action. The Trump administration is likely to appeal the decision.",
      "\"To deny plaintiffs' Appointments Clause claim solely on the basis that, on paper, Musk has no formal legal authority relating to the decisions at issue, even if he is actually exercising significant authority on governmental matters, would open the door to an end-run around the Appointments Clause,\" Chuang wrote.",
      "He continued: \"If a president could escape Appointments Clause scrutiny by having advisers go beyond the traditional role of White House advisors who communicate the president's priority to agency heads and instead exercise significant authority throughout the federal government so as to bypass duly appointed officers, the Appointments Clause would be reduced to nothing more than a technical formality.\"",
      "Norm Eisen, executive chair of the State Democracy Defenders Fund, which brought the case on behalf of the 26 USAID employees and contractors, said the ruling is an \"important victory\" against Musk and DOGE.",
      "\"They are performing surgery with a chainsaw instead of a scalpel, harming not just the people USAID serves but also the majority of Americans who count on the stability of our government,\" he said in a statement. \"This case is a milestone in pushing back on Musk and DOGE's illegality.\"",
      "USAID was one of the first agencies that came under scrutiny by DOGE as part of Mr. Trump's sweeping plan to shrink the size of the federal government. Soon after the president returned to a second term, the agency, which was established in 1961, became subject to a 90-day pause on foreign assistance funding that devastated nonprofit organizations, businesses and aid groups that received grants and other awards from USAID.",
      "DOGE team members also gained access to the agency's financial and personnel systems, and hundreds of USAID officials were placed on administrative leave. Its website was shut down last month, email accounts deactivated and USAID's Washington, D.C., headquarters were occupied by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.",
      "The unidentified USAID employees and personal services contractors filed their lawsuit against Musk and DOGE in mid-February and argued that Musk's actions violated the Constitution's Appointments Clause. The case was one of several filed after DOGE was established that have challenged Musk's actions and the task force's access to sensitive federal systems.",
      "Musk's role within DOGE has been of particular interest, including among federal judges overseeing court fights involving the task force. While Mr. Trump has claimed publicly that Musk leads DOGE, including during his joint address to Congress earlier this month, Justice Department lawyers have argued that he is a senior adviser to the president and does not have formal authority to make government decisions.",
      "Amid repeated questions about who was leading DOGE, the White House revealed last month that Amy Gleason, who worked for DOGE's predecessor, is its acting administrator.",
      "Chuang, meanwhile, said Musk and DOGE have been behind agency actions throughout the federal government, including at USAID.",
      "He noted that Musk, who is also the CEO of Tesla, appears to have been involved in the closure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau headquarters. He said evidence shows that Musk and DOGE \"have taken other unilateral actions without any apparent authorization from agency officials,\" including the firings of employees at the Department of Agriculture and National Nuclear Security Administration.",
      "\"Under these circumstances, the evidence presently favors the conclusion that contrary to defendants' sweeping claim that Musk acted only as an advisor, Musk made the decisions to shutdown USAID's headquarters and website even though he 'lacked the authority to make that decision,'\" Chuang wrote, citing arguments from the Trump administration.",
      "As to USAID, the judge said that the record before the court \"does not support the conclusion\" that decisions to dismantle the agency by permanently closing its headquarters and taking down its website were made by USAID officials.",
      "\"Thus, based on the present record, the only individuals known to be associated with decisions to initiate a shutdown of USAID by permanently closing USAID headquarters and taking down its website are Musk and DOGE team members,\" Chuang wrote.",
      "The Constitution's Appointments Clause in part lays out the methods for appointing officers of the United States, divided into two categories: principal officers, appointed by the president with Senate approval, and inferior officers, who generally do not require Senate confirmation. The challengers in the case argued that Musk was carrying out the functions of an officer without being appointed to that role, thus violating the Appointments Clause.",
      "Chuang agreed. He found that where there is evidence that Musk exercised significant authority reserved for an officer while serving in a continuing government position, the unnamed USAID employees and contractors were likely to win on their argument that he skirted the Appointments Clause.",
      "\"The public interest is specifically harmed by defendants' actions, which have usurped the authority of the public's elected representatives in Congress to make decisions on whether, when and how to eliminate a federal government agency, and of officers of the United States duly appointed under the Constitution to exercise the authority entrusted to them,\" he wrote.",
      "In addition to finding that the dismantling of USAID by Musk and DOGE was likely unconstitutional, Chuang found that they lack authorization by Congress to take steps toward abolishing the agency.",
      "\"There is no statute that authorizes the Executive Branch to shut down USAID,\" he wrote.",
      "The judge added that Congress alone has the constitutional authority to take action to eliminate agencies it has created.",
      "\"Where Congress has prescribed the existence of USAID in statute pursuant to its legislative powers under Article I, the president's Article II power to take care that the laws are faithfully executed does not provide authority for the unilateral, drastic actions taken to dismantle the agency,\" Chuang wrote.",
      "The judge's opinion warns that there are reasons to be concerned about the potential public disclosure of personal, sensitive or classified information by DOGE team members. He said they \"took extreme measures\" to gain access to classified information, including in secure facilities, \"when there was no identified need to do so,\" and when some DOGE staff lacked security clearances.",
      "Chuang cited one USAID employee on administrative leave who reported that DOGE team members who did not have security clearances granted themselves access to restricted areas that required approval.",

      "The commission in July 2024 ruled that Amazon was distributing products that are defective or fail to meet federal safety standards. The CPSC also said Amazon was legally responsible for the recall of more than 400,000 products, including faulty carbon monoxide detectors, hairdryers without electrocution protection and children's sleepwear that violates federal flammability standards.",
      "The CPSC ruling and order came three years after it authorized an administrative complaint against Amazon that alleged it distributed certain products that could pose a danger to consumers. Amazon said its lawsuit comes in response to a final order filed by the CPSC on January 17.",
      "During the proceedings, Amazon did not contest that the products presented a substantial hazard, but argued that it is not a distributor and is not responsible for protecting the public from products sold by third parties. The company reiterated that stance in a lawsuit filed late last week, describing itself as a logistics provider rather than a distributor.",
      "\"The commission may issue recall orders to the manufacturers, distributors and retailers of a product, but not to third-party logistics providers who store the product in their warehouses and transport it to customers,\" Amazon stated its suit, filed on March 14 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.",
      "Amazon also alleges that the CPSC's structure is unconstitutional because it lets commissioners \"act as judge, jury and prosecutor in the same proceeding.\"",

    "story": [
      "Search efforts pressed on into their second week for Sudiksha Konanki, a college student at the University of Pittsburgh who went missing earlier this month during a trip to the Dominican Republic resort town Punta Cana.",
      "Details surrounding Konanki's disappearance have begun to emerge as the international investigation continues. Here's what we know so far about her case.",
      "Konanki seen on video walking to beach",
      "Konanki, 20, is from Chantilly, Virginia, a Washington, D.C., suburb, and attends college in Pittsburgh. She has permanent residency in the United States as well as citizenship in India. She arrived in the Dominican Republic for spring break on March 3 and was vacationing with a group of friends, five other women, according to investigators and her parents.",
      "She\u00a0has been missing\u00a0since Thursday, March 6, after surveillance video showed her, three of her friends and two other American men walk toward the beach area outside the Riu Rep\u00fablica hotel. The video was from around 4:15 a.m., investigators in the Dominican Republic said.",
      "Power outages at the hotel may have prompted guests to move outdoors around that time, the hotel said in a statement. An earlier surveillance video showed Konanki and one of her friends hugging at the hotel bar.",
      "One of the men in the group walking to the beach has been identified as 22-year-old Joshua Riibe, an American college student. In the footage, Konanki and Riibe are seen walking with their arms around each other.",
      "Video shows the other four individuals later returning to the hotel, but Konanki and Riibe stayed behind on the beach, a police source said. The last sighting of Konanki and Riibe in the water happened around 4:50 a.m., according to Loudon County Sheriff Mike Chapman, whose office in Virginia is involved in the investigation.",
      "Riibe told police he and Konanki were swept into the ocean by a large wave and both struggled against rough seas. He said he believed Konanki got out of the water but was not certain, according to a person with direct knowledge of Riibe's statements to U.S. investigators.",
      "He is presumed to be the last person who saw Konanki alive.",
      "Konanki's disappearance is so far being investigated as a missing persons case, not a criminal investigation.",
      "The Dominican Republic's attorney general said investigators were exploring whether Konanki drowned, but not ruling out the possibility of foul play.",
      "Chapman said \"it's hard to say\" whether there are indications Konanki's disappearance was anything other than an accident.",
      "\"We know that at about 4:50 a.m. was the last sighting that we had of them in the water. We don't know what happened after that,\" Chapman said in a \"CBS Mornings\" interview. \"And we also don't know what happened between the time that [Riibe] claimed to have come out of the water and the time that he actually left the beach, so it's really hard to say. It'd be speculative on my part to assume or presume anything at this point.\"",
      "Konanki's family seeking closure",
      "The Loudoun County Sheriff's Office told CBS News that Konanki's family has requested that she be declared deceased, expressed gratitude to investigators for their work, and expressed a desire for closure following her disappearance in the Dominican Republic.",
      "The family provided the request in writing to the sheriff's office, according to spokesperson Thomas Julia. Julia said the family made a similar request to Dominican authorities.",
      "Konanki's family did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CBS News has learned that their written request referenced Riibe's cooperation with investigators and a lack of evidence collected to date that would suggest foul play was involved in Konanki's disappearance.",
      "Chapman said the family has expressed their belief that she drowned.",
      "\"While a final decision to make such a declaration rests with authorities in the Dominican Republic, we will support the Konanki family in every way possible as we continue to review the evidence and information made available to us in the course of this investigation,\" he said.",
      "Riibe faces questioning, says he is cooperating",
      "Riibe has been in Punta Cana for questioning since the investigation got underway.",
      "Authorities confiscated Riibe's passport and he has been confined to a hotel with police escorts anywhere he goes, according to the law firm representing him, Guzm\u00e1n Ariza. Yeni Berenice Reynoso, the Dominican attorney general, was interrogating Riibe directly, attorneys with Guzm\u00e1n Ariza said. A hearing for Riibe's release was set to take place Tuesday, after his attorneys pushed in legal documents for his freedom given the absence of any criminal charge.",
      "Riibe and his parents, Tina and Albert Riibe, extended \"deep sorrow and solidarity\" with Konanski's family in a statement released through his attorney.",
      "\"Above all, we wish to contribute to the search efforts and understand the anguish and uncertainty they are going through and we share the hope that Sudiksha will be found as soon as possible,\" the statement said. \"Joshua Riibe is deeply dismayed by her disappearance and has fully cooperated in the search and clarification of the facts from the very beginning.\"",
      "Chapman told \"CBS Mornings\" that Riibe was \"very forthcoming\" with sheriff's detectives who traveled to the Dominican Republic to speak to him, and did not \"seem to hesitate on answering any of the questions that we threw his way.\"",
      "Chapman noted there was \"nothing that would really make us feel as though there was anything untrue coming from Joshua.\"",

    "story": [
      "The family of missing college student\u00a0Sudiksha Konanki\u00a0has asked authorities that she be declared deceased, the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office in Virginia told CBS News, almost two weeks after she disappeared while visiting Punta Cana for spring break.",
      "The family provided the request in writing to the sheriff's office, according to spokesperson Thomas Julia. Julia said the family made a similar request to Dominican authorities. According to the sheriff's office, the family has expressed a desire for closure.",
      "In a statement later on Tuesday, Loudoun County Sheriff Michael Chapman said the family also expressed their belief that she drowned.",
      "\"While a final decision to make such a declaration rests with authorities in the Dominican Republic, we will support the Konanki family in every way possible as we continue to review the evidence and information made available to us in the course of this investigation,\" Chapman said.",
      "Konanki's family did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The student, 20, was last seen in the early morning hours of March 6\u00a0on a beach near the resort town's Riu Rep\u00fablica hotel where she and her friends and had been staying. Surveillance video from the night she disappeared showed Konanki walking toward the beach with a group of three women and two men, one of whom authorities identified as 22-year-old Joshua Riibe, who is presumed to be the last person to see her alive. She and Riibe stayed behind on the beach after the four others left, a police source told CBS News, citing video footage.",
      "Riibe told police he and Konanki were swept into the ocean by a large wave and struggled in rough waters. He said he believed Konanki made it out of the water but was not certain, according to a person with direct knowledge of Riibe's statements to U.S. investigators.",
      "Konanki lives in the D.C. suburb Loudon, Virginia, and attends the University of Pittsburgh. Her disappearance sparked a missing persons investigation and massive search effort by authorities in the Dominican Republic and the United States, with agencies probing land, sea and air in hopes of locating her. The Dominican Republic National Police said they created a new \"high-level commission\" to oversee the case, while Interpol issued a missing person alert to police around the world.",
      "Authorities in the U.S. and the Dominican Republic have repeatedly emphasized that this is so far not a criminal investigation. Dominican Attorney General Yeni Berenice Reynoso said investigators are exploring whether Konanki may have drowned but have not ruled out the possibility of foul play. In their request that law enforcement declare her dead, Konanki's family referenced the lack of evidence suggesting foul play so far.",
      "Since Konanki vanished, Reynoso has directly interrogated Riibe, a student at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota who is originally from Iowa, the law firm representing Riibe, Guzm\u00e1n Ariza, told CBS News. Authorities confiscated Riibe's passport while holding him for questioning in Punta Cana and assigning him \"permanent\" police escorts, Guzm\u00e1n Ariza said.",
      "Riibe's attorney has been pushing for his release, noting in legal filings that his client has not been charged with a crime, local media reported. A hearing on that issue was set for later Tuesday.",
      "Chapman described Riibe as \"very forthcoming\" in interviews with two of the sheriff's detectives who traveled to Punta Cana last week to discuss the case with him. In a \"CBS Mornings\" interview, Chapman said Riibe \"didn't seem to hesitate on answering any of the questions that we threw his way,\" echoing previous comments from Riibe's attorneys and parents, who said in a statement that their son \"is deeply dismayed\" by Konanki's disappearance \"and has fully cooperated in the search and clarification of the facts from the very beginning.\"",
      "Chapman said any inconsistencies in Riibe's statements \"were really quite minor and nothing that would really make us feel as though there was anything untrue coming from Joshua.\"",
      "Asked if there's anything that indicates Konanki's disappearance is more than an accident, Chapman said, \"It's hard to say\" and acknowledged that some questions remain unanswered, including what happened after Konanki and Riibe were allegedly in the water.",
      "\"We also don't know what happened between the time that [Riibe] claimed to have come out of the water and the time that he actually left the beach, so it's really hard to say,\" he said. \"It'd be speculative on my part to assume or presume anything at this point.\"",

      "The FBI recommends that travelers \"be vigilant of their surroundings and use caution\" while traveling. Their advice includes establishing points of contact for family members to reference in case of an emergency, using only authorized taxis or shuttles, and being on the lookout for suspicious activity, including someone following you or \"new acquaintances who probe for information about you or who attempt to get you involved in what could become a compromising situation.\"",

      "Anyone traveling abroad should check the travel advisories for their intended destination, the FBI says. Travel advisories range from Level 1 to Level 4 and are regularly reviewed and updated for each country. The levels are based off several factors, including crime levels, threats of terrorism, civil unrest, health concerns and the possibility of a natural disaster, according to the State Department. A country may have multiple advisories, if certain regions are known to be more of a risk than others.",
      "In Level 1 countries, travelers should exercise normal precautions and be aware that all international travel includes some level of risk. Level 2 recommends increased caution due to \"heightened risks to safety and security.\" Level 3 suggests Americans reconsider travel to that destination, and Level 4 advises against any travel to that location.",

Overseas, the deaths of American tourists in\u00a0Mexico\u00a0and the\u00a0Bahamas\u00a0have been linked to carbon monoxide poisoning.",

      "\"We have a lot of good people,\" Schumer said on \"CBS Mornings.\" \"But I am the best at winning Senate seats.\"",
      "Schumer initially signaled last week that his caucus would fight back against a partisan measure to keep the government funded. But a day later, he reluctantly pledged to advance the continuing resolution, delivering one of the Democratic votes necessary to propel the measure to passage. The move has prompted frustrations among some within his party, and questions about his leadership, but Schumer has repeatedly defended his decision.",
      "\"I knew when I took this vote there'd be a lot of protests, but I felt I had to do it for the future, not only of the Democratic Party, but the country,\" Schumer said, adding that \"as bad as that CR bill was \u2014 and it was bad \u2014 a shutdown is 10 times worse.\"",
      "Schumer said a shutdown would have given \"sole power\" to the executive branch and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency to determine what remained open and closed during a shutdown, saying \"within two weeks, everyone would have been howling.\"",
      "The New York Democrat said he and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries had a strategy to try to get a bipartisan bill to keep the government funded. But they didn't expect that House Republican leadership would be able to keep its conference together to advance the partisan continuing resolution \u2014 a heavy lift that defied the typical political dynamics, with conservatives who routinely oppose continuing resolutions joining their party to support the measure.",
      "Schumer said a \"shutdown would have been the greatest disaster,\" putting the government in the hands of \"evil, nasty, nihilistic people\" like Musk, President Trump and OMB Director Russ Vought.",
      "\"We would have had half the federal government we have now,\" Schumer said. \"So I thought I did the thing a leader should do: Even when people don't see the danger around the curve, my job was to alert people to it \u2014 and I knew I'd get some bullets.\"",
      "On the question of his leadership, Schumer said he isn't going anywhere, citing his record as leader on winning Senate seats, including in 2021, when Democrats secured a majority in the upper chamber with two surprise runoff victories in Georgia. Schumer came to Congress in 1981, representing New York in the House before being elected to the Senate in 1998. He's led Democrats as leader in the Senate since 2017.",
      "Schumer said Democrats are fighting back against the Trump administration with a message focused on how GOP leaders want to \"screw every average American so they can get tax cuts for the rich,\" saying the strategy is \"beginning to work.\"",
      "\"If we keep at it every day, relentless fighting and showing how they're hurting people so badly, Trump's numbers will get much lower, and his both popularity, but also his effectiveness will decline,\" Schumer said. \"I believe that strategy will work.\"",
      "Tuesday's interview was held one day after\u00a0Schumer postponed events to promote his book, \"Antisemitism in America: A Warning,\" this week, citing security concerns following backlash from his move to keep the government funded. Schumer had a number of events scheduled this week in Maryland, New York City, Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania and California.",
      "Schumer said he wrote the book aimed at a number of audiences \u2014 including his \"friends on the left.\" He noted that while \"we've always seen antisemitism on the right,\" more recently \"a lot of it's trickled over to the left.\"",

    "summary": "Barred from catching salmon off the California coast, fishermen have been running boat tours to stay afloat.",
    "story": [
      "William Smith has long fished the California coast for salmon, taking avid anglers out on his boat in hopes they'll get to wrestle with and reel in the prized catch.",
      "But not anymore.",
      "Smith, known as \"Capt. Smitty,\" now spends time on the seas with aspiring whale watchers, or scattering the ashes of the deceased \u2014 whatever it takes to stay afloat since salmon fishing was barred in California two years ago due to dwindling stocks. Smith said a rise in the Bay Area's Hindu and Buddhist communities has made sea burials more popular, and he now does more than 200 a year \u2014 and that's helping him pay off his $250,000 boat engine.",
      "\"The bills keep going, whether I've got a fishery or not,\" said Smith, who runs Riptide Sportfishing in Half Moon Bay, California. \"There's no season on when people die.\"",
      "California's sport and commercial fishermen have been walloped by two years of salmon closures and are bracing for a potential third, which they blame on a years-earlier drought and state and federal water management policies they say have made it tough for the species to thrive. The closures have taken a toll on people's livelihoods in coastal communities where salmon, fishermen say, is a special fish.",
      "Salmon must swim upstream to lay their eggs, and young fish make their way out to the ocean through California's waterways \u2014 something done more easily when cool water flows are abundant. The fishery has long been strained and the Pacific Fishery Management Council, which manages West Coast fisheries, said there will be very limited salmon fishing this year in California, if at all. A decision is due in April.",
      "The dim outlook comes as President Donald Trump has ordered officials to find ways to put \"people over fish\" and route more water to farmers in California's crop-rich Central Valley and residents of its densely-populated cities. Trump has professed his love for farmers and contends too much heed is paid to the tiny delta smelt, a federally-threatened species seen as an indicator of the health of California's Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.",
      "But salmon depend on this same water system for their survival. And some in the fishing community are wondering if fishermen aren't people, too.",
      "\"We are people that are hardworking and it's our jobs on the line,\" said Sarah Bates, a commercial fishing captain in San Francisco. She said local markets have been devastated by the salmon closures and Bay Area restaurants aren't snapping up halibut or other catch as they did salmon.",
      "Decline in salmon population",
      "The history of commercial salmon fishing in California dates back more than a century, and in the 1970s and 1980s the fishery thrived off the state's coast. Over time, salmon fishing has declined with swings in stocks amid volatile weather patterns in a drought-prone state and water management decisions about when surface water, and how much of it, should flow to farms, burgeoning cities and the ecologically-sensitive bay delta.",
      "California's salmon fishing industry includes commercial fleets and charters that take anglers out for recreation.",
      "Jamie O'Neill, owner of Seattle-based Dock Street Brokers, said many of California's commercial salmon fishermen are getting out of the business, selling their permits or simply letting them expire. Permits now sell for a fraction of what they used to, and there are fewer than 900 permits compared to 1,200 in 2010, he said.",
      "Charter operators, meanwhile, have branched out to host boat tours and party cruises, especially since short trips require little fuel and can help offset the cost of boat maintenance.",
      "While fishermen can still catch halibut, cod and striped bass along the extensive Pacific coastline, they say without the all-popular King Salmon, anglers just aren't coming like before. Each fish requires a different bait and technique, and a fast-swimming salmon is a fighter that anglers aspire to catch.",
      "\"One is hamburger, and one is filet mignon,\" said Andy Guiliano, whose sportfishing boat the Pacific Pearl in Emeryville has expanded its historic tour offerings since the closure. \"It makes the cash register ring.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump announced that tens of thousands of pages of the JFK assassination files would be released to the public Tuesday.",
      "\"People have been waiting decades for this,\" the president said of the release of files related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Mr. Trump, who was speaking at the Kennedy Center Monday, added that he didn't believe the material, \"approximately 80,000 pages,\" would be redacted.",
      "\"I said during the campaign that I'd do it, and I'm a man of my word,\" the president said of the impending release.",
      "Last month, the FBI said it had discovered roughly 2,400 records related to the assassination during a search stemming from Mr. Trump's executive action ordering files related to the 1963 killing to be declassified.",
      "The bureau said that the documents, which have been inventoried and digitized, \"were previously unrecognized as related to the JFK assassination case file.\" The FBI in February was transferring the records to the National Archives and Records Administration to be included in the ongoing declassification process that has been ongoing. The bureau did not say what the records contain.",
      "In his first week in office, Mr. Trump signed an executive order that called for the declassification of these files and also those related to the assassinations of his brother Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr.",
      "The order gave the director of national intelligence and attorney general 15 days to present a plan to the president for the \"full and complete release of records\" related to Kennedy's assassination.",
      "Congress in 1992 enacted the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act, which required all assassination-related material be kept in a single collection within the National Archives and be publicly released. The law gave federal agencies 25 years to process and disclose the documents, with exceptions. The collection at the National Archives consists of more than 5 million pages of records.",
      "The National Archives has over the last three decades made material related to Kennedy's assassination available to the public, with the latest batch disclosed in August 2023. The agency said in December 2022 that more than 97% of records in its Kennedy collection are available to the American people.",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Mar 2025 20:44:05 -0400",
    "summary": "The government claimed it was not bound by the judge's order to block flights carrying gang members to El Salvador because it wasn't in writing.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge admonished the Justice Department Monday for disobeying his order to turn around two planes en route to El Salvador that were carrying alleged Tren de Aragua gang members. He also demanded explanations about removal flights ordered since President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act\u00a0Saturday.",
      "During a hearing on the Trump administration's compliance with his order, D.C District Chief Judge James Boasberg demanded answers by Tuesday at noon to clarify what occurred Saturday \u2014 both before and after he blocked the government's removal flights. He asked the government whether additional planes have left the U.S. with Tren de Aragua gang members, and he wants a timeline showing when the flights took off from the U.S. and landed in El Salvador and a count of remaining members of the gang in U.S. custody.",
      "Boasberg also demanded detailed timing on when President Trump's order invoking the Alien Enemies Act was signed and went into effect. The 1798 act is a wartime authority allowing the president to detain and deport noncitizens. Mr. Trump is utilizing the act to detain and deport all Venezuelan migrants 14 years of age and older who are suspected of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang.",
      "A Justice Department attorney argued that because the judge did not put his order demanding the planes to return to the U.S. in writing, the government was not bound by it, but he added that even if the order had been written, the president had the authority to keep the flights en route to their final destination.",
      "\"You're telling me your first argument is when I said those things, because I didn't say it in a minute order that the plaintiffs didn't have to turn around, you didn't have to comply?\" Boasberg said. \"You're saying that you felt you could disregard it because it wasn't in a written order?\"",
      "The attorney did not provide details about how many deportation flights left Saturday, claiming that there were \"operational issues\" prohibiting him from answering. When Judge Boesberg mentioned the two flights that departed Texas at 5:26 p.m. and 5:45 p.m. local time, the attorney said that he was \"not at liberty\" to provide information about the flights.",
      "It sparked a tense back and forth between Judge Boesberg and the government over whether or not it was asserting the flight information was classified.",
      "The Justice Department also argued that because the planes were over international waters and airspace by the time the judge ordered them to turn around, that Boasberg no longer had jurisdiction over the migrants.",
      "The judge responded that his order applied to the planes, regardless of where they were in the air.",
      "The Trump administration said the two planes had left before the judge made his decision, and a third plane left for El Salvador shortly afterwards, though details about the passengers on that plane are unclear.",
      "Despite Boasberg's ruling, 261 people were deported to El Salvador Saturday,137 of whom were removed under the Alien Enemies Act over alleged gang ties, a senior administration official said.",
      "The judge's ruling responded to a federal civil lawsuit against Mr. Trump and other administration officials filed Saturday by five Venezuelan men in immigration custody in Texas and New York local jails.",
      "Boasberg's ruling prevents the deportations of the plaintiffs and migrants for 14 days. The Justice Department appealed that decision, arguing the D.C. federal court has no authority over the case because none of the five men are being held in the District of Columbia.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote on X Saturday night that the \"written order and the Administration's actions do not conflict,\" and said a \"single judge in a single city cannot direct the movements of an aircraft carrying foreign alien terrorists who were physically expelled from U.S. soil.\"",
      "Wrapping up the hearing, Boasberg said he'd issue a written order quickly because \"apparently my oral orders don't seem to carry much weight\" with the Justice Department.",
      "Before the hearing, the Justice Department filed an appeal to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals requesting Boasberg's removal from the case, arguing that his actions in the case have been an \"inappropriate exercise of jurisdiction\" and claiming he had followed \"highly unusual and improper procedures,\" in his hearing on Saturday evening.",
      "Jake Rosen is a reporter covering the Department of Justice. He was previously a campaign digital reporter covering President Trump's 2024 campaign and also served as an associate producer for \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" where he worked with Brennan for two years on the broadcast. Rosen has been a producer for several CBS News podcasts, including \"The Takeout,\" \"The Debrief\" and \"Agent of Betrayal: The Double Life of Robert Hanssen.\""

    "summary": "Officials in Hamas-ruled Gaza say the new Israeli assault has killed more than 400 people, as Israel accuses Hamas of refusing to extend the ceasefire.",
    "story": [
      "Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip \u2014 Israel has launched new strikes in the Gaza Strip, killing more than 400 people, according to the Palestinian territory's Hamas-run Health Ministry, and promising to wield \"increasing military force\" after talks on further hostage releases stalled, according to officials on both sides of the war. The resumption of Israel's war against Hamas on Monday came after almost two months of relative calm in Gaza under a ceasefire the U.S. helped to broker, but which Israel and Hamas could not agree on how to continue.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement its military is \"currently attacking targets of the Hamas terrorist organization throughout the Gaza Strip, with the aim of achieving the war goals as determined by the political echelon, including the release of all our hostages \u2014 living and dead.\"",
      "\"From now on, Israel will act against Hamas with increasing military force,\" the prime minister's office said.",
      "The health ministry in Gaza, a densely populated coastal enclave that has been run by the U.S.- and Israeli-designated terrorist organization Hamas for almost two decades, said at least 404 people had been killed in Israel's fresh strikes by midday on Tuesday. Video from the territory showed bodies lined up on the floors of hospitals as more casualties streamed in.",
      "The statement from Netanyahu's office said Israel was resuming strikes because of Hamas' repeated refusals to release its hostages and its rejection of all offers it received from the U.S. presidential envoy Steve Witkoff and mediators.",
      "\"If Hamas does not release all the kidnapped, the gates of hell will open in Gaza and Hamas' murderers and rapists will meet the IDF with forces they have never known before,\" Defense Minister Israel Katz said. \"We will not stop fighting until all the kidnapped return home and all the war's goals are achieved.\"",
      "Over the weekend, Witkoff warned that Hamas must release living hostages immediately \"or pay a severe price.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday evening that the Trump administration was consulted by the Israelis on their attacks in Gaza.",
      "\"Hamas could have released hostages to extend the ceasefire but instead chose refusal and war,\" National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes told CBS News on Monday.",
      "Hostages families, U.N. and Egypt condemn resumption of war",
      "The group representing the Israeli hostages' families condemned Netanyahu's decision to resume the fighting, accusing him of a \"complete deception,\" arguing that it would endanger the remaining captives, and quickly organizing a new protest against the move.",
      "\"The families' greatest fear has come true \u2014 the Israeli government has chosen to give up on the abductees. We are shocked, angry and anxious about the deliberate disruption of the process to return our loved ones from Hamas captivity,\" the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement.",
      "\"Returning to fighting before the last abductee is returned will come at the cost of the 59 abductees who are still in Gaza and could be saved and returned,\" the group said, accusing Netanyahu's government of having \"refused to declare an end to the war in order to implement the next steps in the [ceasefire] deal and return all the abductees.\"",
      "The forum dismissed Netanyahu's claim that the resumption of fighting was intended to secure the remaining hostages' release as \"a complete deception.\"",
      "The forum said \"families are now making their way to Jerusalem and calling on the people of Israel to stand with them\" in a protest on Tuesday. \"There is nothing more urgent than this! With each passing day, the danger to the hostages grows. Military pressure could further endanger their lives and complicate efforts to bring them home safely.\"",
      "United Nations human rights chief Volker Turk said he was \"horrified by last night's Israeli airstrikes and shelling in Gaza, which killed hundreds, according to the Ministry of Health in the strip,\" adding that it would \"add tragedy onto tragedy.\"",
      "Farhan Haq, deputy spokesperson for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said the U.N. chief was \"shocked by the Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, in which a meaningful number of civilians have been killed. He strongly appeals for the ceasefire to be respected, for unimpeded humanitarian assistance to be reestablished and for the remaining hostages to be released unconditionally.\"",
      "Egypt, which helped negotiate the ceasefire along with the U.S. and Qatar, issued a statement condemning Israel's actions, which it called \"a flagrant violation of the ceasefire agreement and a dangerous escalation that threatens to have dire consequences for the stability of the region.\"",
      "\"Egypt reiterates its complete rejection of all Israeli attacks aimed at re-igniting tension in the region and thwarting efforts aimed at calming the situation and restoring stability. It calls on the international community to intervene immediately to halt the Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip and prevent the region from re-entering a new cycle of violence and counter-violence,\" Egypt's foreign ministry said.",
      "Hamas says Israel \"fully responsible for violating and overturning\" ceasefire",
      "Hamas also condemned the attacks, accusing Israel of breaching the ceasefire and putting the fate of the remaining hostages in jeopardy.",
      "In a statement, Hamas said it would hold Netanyahu's government \"fully responsible for the repercussions of the treacherous aggression on Gaza, and for the defenseless civilians and our besieged Palestinian people, who are subjected to a brutal war and a systematic policy of starvation.\"",
      "\"Netanyahu and his extremist government have decided to overturn the ceasefire agreement, exposing the prisoners in Gaza to an unknown fate,\" said Hamas, adding a demand for the U.S. and its negotiating partners Egypt and Qatar to \"hold Netanyahu and the Zionist occupation fully responsible for violating and overturning the agreement.\"",
      "In a separate statement, Hamas spokesperson Abdul Latif al-Qanou said Israel's \"coordination with the U.S. administration prior to the attacks confirms the U.S. partnership in the genocide perpetrated against our people and its role in covering up Israeli war crimes.\"",
      "What happened during the ceasefire?",
      "The new strikes come amid the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and after nearly two months of a ceasefire to pause the 17-month-long war that saw dozens of hostages released in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The first phase of the ceasefire ended on March 1 but the pause in major fighting held until Monday.",
      "Since the first phase of the ceasefire ended, the sides have not been able to agree on a way forward to a second phase aimed at releasing the nearly 60 remaining hostages and ending the war altogether. Netanyahu had repeatedly threatened to resume the war, and President Trump had also issued several warnings and ultimatums to Hamas \u2014 some contradicting the agreed-upon terms of the ceasefire \u2014  as negotiations on a second phase of the ceasefire struggled to materialize.",
      "Egypt, Qatar and the United States had been trying to mediate the next steps in the ceasefire.",
      "Earlier in the month, Israel cut off aid into Gaza, stopping the entry of all goods and supplies into the Palestinian territory. Israel said the aid blockade was aimed at pressuring Hamas to accept a\u00a0proposal drafted by the Trump administration to extend the first phase\u00a0of the ceasefire. Under the proposal, Israel had demanded Hamas immediately hand over half of the remaining hostages held in Gaza, which would have been a significant change in the terms initially agreed to under the deal brokered by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt.",
      "On Friday, Hamas said it had accepted a proposal from mediators to release one living American-Israeli hostage and the bodies of four dual-nationals who had died in captivity. Netanyahu's office cast doubt on the offer last week, accusing the U.S. and Israeli-designated terrorist group of trying to manipulate talks underway in Qatar on the next stage of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire.",
      "In a separate Friday statement, Hamas official Husam Badran reaffirmed what he said was Hamas' commitment to fully implementing the ceasefire agreement in all its phases, warning that any Israeli deviation from the terms would return negotiations to square one.",
      "The agreement had called for negotiations to begin on the ceasefire's more difficult second phase, in which the remaining hostages would be released and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza. Hamas is believed to have 24 living hostages and the bodies of 35 others.",
      "The war erupted with Hamas' Oct 7, 2023, cross-border terrorist attack, which killed some 1,200 people and took 250 others hostage. Israel responded with a military offensive that killed over 48,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and displaced an estimated 90% of Gaza's population. The territory's Health Ministry doesn't differentiate between civilians and militants, but says over half of the dead have been women and children.",
      "While the ceasefire largely halted the fighting, Israel has left troops in Gaza throughout the past two months and continued to strike targets, claiming that Palestinians were trying to carry out attacks or approaching troops in no-go zones.   A number of strikes earlier Monday killed a total of 10 people, according to Palestinian officials.",

    "summary": "The conservative Heritage Foundation has been seeking access to Prince Harry's immigration files.",
    "story": [
      "London - Some court documents related to a freedom of information request to access Prince Harry's U.S. immigration files were released on Tuesday, under an order issued by a Washington D.C. district court, after the conservative Heritage Foundation alleged that the British royal\u00a0may have concealed past drug use when he applied for his visa. Harry currently lives in California with his wife, Meghan, and their children.",
      "The documents released included court filings from several federal agencies responding to the Heritage Foundation's request. They did not include the prince's immigration records. Portions of the documents relating to him or his immigration status were heavily redacted.",
      "Applications for visas to live in the United States ask about current and historical drug use. Admission of drug use can lead to visa applications being rejected, but immigration officers have discretion to make their final decisions on a number of factors. Lying on visa applications can lead to lifetime bans on entering the U.S.",
      "\"There's a lot of discretion that the government has, but merely admitting to drug use very often is not disqualifying from entering the country, but lying about drug use can be more serious and potentially could be disqualifying,\" CBS News legal contributor Jessica Levinson said.",
      "The Heritage Foundation alleges that Harry may have lied about his past drug use on his application. Their allegations center around claims Harry made in his memoir, published in January 2023, where he described using various types of drugs.",
      "Cocaine \"wasn't much fun, and it didn't make me particularly happy, as it seemed to make everyone around me, but it did make me feel different, and that was the main goal,\" Harry wrote.",
      "He also wrote: \"Marijuana is different. That actually really did help me.\"",
      "The Heritage Foundation lodged a freedom of information request with the Department of Homeland Security in 2023, not long after his book was published, seeking access to Harry's immigration documents.",
      "\"Harry has publicly admitted to extensive illegal drug use. What do we submit this means? That Harry seems to have received special treatment: the DHS looked the other way if the Prince answered truthfully, or it looked the other way if the Prince lied on his visa application. Either action would be wrong,\" Nile Gardiner from the Heritage Foundation said in an online post in 2024.",
      "Harry and Meghan moved to the U.S. in 2020 after stepping down as working members of Britain's royal family.",
      "Meghan is a U.S. citizen, but it is unclear what visa Harry entered the country on. The prince has not responded publicly to the Heritage Foundation's assertions.",
      "In February, President Trump ruled out deporting Harry, saying he would \"leave him alone,\" adding, \"He's got enough problems with his wife. She's terrible.\"",
      "Meghan has been a vocal critic of Mr. Trump.",
      "\"Most Americans dislike the idea of celebrities being treated differently from anyone else, and Harry's fame and profile makes this case the ideal window into DHS conduct,\" the Heritage Foundation's Gardiner argued. \"If DHS granted Harry special treatment, the implications are obvious: it has likely granted such treatment in the past to others sufficiently famous or sufficiently politically aligned, and will likely continue to do so.\"",
      "Editor's note:\u00a0This story has been updated to reflect that court documents related to Prince Harry's immigration status have been released. An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the release would include immigration records.",

      "Search efforts pressed on into their second week for Sudiksha Konanki, a college student at the University of Pittsburgh who went missing earlier this month during a trip to the Dominican Republic resort town Punta Cana.",
      "Details surrounding Konanki's disappearance have begun to emerge as the international investigation continues. Here's what we know so far about her case.",
      "Konanki seen on video walking to beach",
      "Konanki, 20, is from Chantilly, Virginia, a Washington, D.C., suburb, and attends college in Pittsburgh. She has permanent residency in the United States as well as citizenship in India. She arrived in the Dominican Republic for spring break on March 3 and was vacationing with a group of friends, five other women, according to investigators and her parents.",
      "She\u00a0has been missing\u00a0since Thursday, March 6, after surveillance video showed her, three of her friends and two other American men walk toward the beach area outside the Riu Rep\u00fablica hotel. The video was from around 4:15 a.m., investigators in the Dominican Republic said.",
      "Power outages at the hotel may have prompted guests to move outdoors around that time, the hotel said in a statement. An earlier surveillance video showed Konanki and one of her friends hugging at the hotel bar.",
      "One of the men in the group walking to the beach has been identified as 22-year-old Joshua Riibe, an American college student. In the footage, Konanki and Riibe are seen walking with their arms around each other.",
      "Video shows the other four individuals later returning to the hotel, but Konanki and Riibe stayed behind on the beach, a police source said. The last sighting of Konanki and Riibe in the water happened around 4:50 a.m., according to Loudon County Sheriff Mike Chapman, whose office in Virginia is involved in the investigation.",
      "Riibe told police he and Konanki were swept into the ocean by a large wave and both struggled against rough seas. He said he believed Konanki got out of the water but was not certain, according to a person with direct knowledge of Riibe's statements to U.S. investigators.",
      "He is presumed to be the last person who saw Konanki alive.",
      "Konanki's disappearance is so far being investigated as a missing persons case, not a criminal investigation.",
      "The Dominican Republic's attorney general said investigators were exploring whether Konanki drowned, but not ruling out the possibility of foul play.",
      "Chapman said \"it's hard to say\" whether there are indications Konanki's disappearance was anything other than an accident.",
      "\"We know that at about 4:50 a.m. was the last sighting that we had of them in the water. We don't know what happened after that,\" Chapman said in a \"CBS Mornings\" interview. \"And we also don't know what happened between the time that [Riibe] claimed to have come out of the water and the time that he actually left the beach, so it's really hard to say. It'd be speculative on my part to assume or presume anything at this point.\"",
      "Konanki's family seeking closure",
      "The Loudoun County Sheriff's Office told CBS News that Konanki's family has requested that she be declared deceased, expressed gratitude to investigators for their work, and expressed a desire for closure following her disappearance in the Dominican Republic.",
      "The family provided the request in writing to the sheriff's office, according to spokesperson Thomas Julia. Julia said the family made a similar request to Dominican authorities.",
      "Konanki's family did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CBS News has learned that their written request referenced Riibe's cooperation with investigators and a lack of evidence collected to date that would suggest foul play was involved in Konanki's disappearance.",
      "Chapman said the family has expressed their belief that she drowned.",
      "\"While a final decision to make such a declaration rests with authorities in the Dominican Republic, we will support the Konanki family in every way possible as we continue to review the evidence and information made available to us in the course of this investigation,\" he said.",
      "Riibe faces questioning, says he is cooperating",
      "Riibe has been in Punta Cana for questioning since the investigation got underway.",
      "Authorities confiscated Riibe's passport and he has been confined to a hotel with police escorts anywhere he goes, according to the law firm representing him, Guzm\u00e1n Ariza. Yeni Berenice Reynoso, the Dominican attorney general, was interrogating Riibe directly, attorneys with Guzm\u00e1n Ariza said. A hearing for Riibe's release was set to take place Tuesday, after his attorneys pushed in legal documents for his freedom given the absence of any criminal charge.",
      "Riibe and his parents, Tina and Albert Riibe, extended \"deep sorrow and solidarity\" with Konanski's family in a statement released through his attorney.",
      "\"Above all, we wish to contribute to the search efforts and understand the anguish and uncertainty they are going through and we share the hope that Sudiksha will be found as soon as possible,\" the statement said. \"Joshua Riibe is deeply dismayed by her disappearance and has fully cooperated in the search and clarification of the facts from the very beginning.\"",
      "Chapman told \"CBS Mornings\" that Riibe was \"very forthcoming\" with sheriff's detectives who traveled to the Dominican Republic to speak to him, and did not \"seem to hesitate on answering any of the questions that we threw his way.\"",
      "Chapman noted there was \"nothing that would really make us feel as though there was anything untrue coming from Joshua.\"",
      "Originally from Iowa, Riibe is a college senior at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota, where he is pursuing a degree in land surveying.",
      "His family in their statement described him as \"a beloved son, brother, and friend, known for his kind nature, sense of humor, and commitment to his community.\"",
      "They also shared concerns about the \"irregular conditions\" of his detainment in Punta Cana, where, they said, he had been \"subjected to extensive questioning without the presence of official translators or legal counsel until Wednesday, March 12.\" The family retained a lawyer \"to initiate legal actions ensuring his safety and the protection of his rights throughout this process,\" according to the statement.",
      "Intensifying search efforts",
      "More than 300 police and other officials, with support from the FBI, are searching the air, sea and land to locate her, Dominican President Luis Abinader said. The Dominican Republic National Police said they have assembled a new \"high-level commission\" to oversee the case, and Interpol has\u00a0issued a global police alert at the request of investigators.",
      "\"We are concerned,\" Abinader said at a news conference on March 10. \"All government agencies are searching \u2026 because the latest information we have from one of them, from the last person who was with the young woman, what he says according to the reports is that a wave, while on the beach, crashed into them.\"",
      "Dominican Republic National Police said in a statement March 11 that they were \"re-interviewing targeted individuals who were in the victim's proximity at the time of her disappearance.\" Investigators said the individuals included \"hotel employees where Konanki and her companions were staying, with the goal of gathering information to corroborate her movements, interactions, and any relevant details for the investigation.\"",

      "But this was real. An urgent email was sent by a researcher at South Africa's isolated Sanae IV base in Antarctica accusing a man, one of the nine team members, of becoming violent and mentally unstable. In the email sent to a journalist at South Africa's Sunday Times newspaper, the researcher, who has not been identified publicly, requests immediate action to ensure the team's safety.",
      "According to the Times, the researcher alleged that the male team member had physically assaulted a colleague, threatened to kill a different colleague and sexually assaulted another. However, South African officials later said the report of a sexual assault was not correct.",
      "\"His behavior has become increasingly egregious, and I am experiencing significant difficulty in feeling secure in his presence,\" the newspaper quoted the researcher as writing, adding: \"It is imperative that immediate action is taken to ensure my safety and the safety of all employees.\"",
      "South Africa's Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment released a statement saying the alleged assault at the base was reported on Feb. 27, triggering a response plan that saw the government agency use \"trained professionals\" to mediate. The department said those mediators continued to engage with the team at the base on \"an almost daily basis.\"",
      "According to the agency, the alleged perpetrator had \"willingly participated in further psychological evaluation, has shown remorse and is willingly cooperative to follow any interventions that are recommended.\"",
      "The statement went on to say the male perpetrator had written an apology to the victim and was willing \"to verbally apologize to other team members.\"",

      "\"I will be keeping close contact with the base to ensure it remains that way,\" said George, adding that a \"team of psychologists and other experts\" were also in \"direct and constant\" contact with the team.",
      "When pressed on what else he could do to ensure the safety of the team, George said he was \"considering available options.\"",
      "Those options may be few, as severe weather conditions have completely cut the base off from the sea. The base sits on stilts near a cliff edge \u2014 a row of buildings that the team will remain in until December, the heart of the Antarctic summer, when a ship is set to depart from South Africa to make the near-15-day journey to retrieve them.",
      "An emergency evacuation, at significant cost, would be required to get the team out before then.",
      "The environment department said it also activated a legal \"labor relations process to investigate the [claim of] physical assault and alleged sexual harassment.\"",
      "There have been several incidents in the past with team members at the remote base threatening violence, and at least two other team members have been evacuated during previous expeditions.",
      "The latest incident has fueled discussions about the reliability of the psychometric tests given to team members before they're deployed to the isolated station. Scientists sent previously to the base and others like it have spoken of how lonely it is, surrounded by white and silence and cut off from the rest of the world, and of the toll that can take on someone's mental health.",

The levels are based off several factors, including crime levels, threats of terrorism, civil unrest, health concerns and the possibility of a natural disaster, according to the State Department. A country may have multiple advisories, if certain regions are known to be more of a risk than others.",
      "In Level 1 countries, travelers should exercise normal precautions and be aware that all international travel includes some level of risk. Level 2 recommends increased caution due to \"heightened risks to safety and security.\" Level 3 suggests Americans reconsider travel to that destination, and Level 4 advises against any travel to that location.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's dismantling of the government-funded Voice of America will pave the way for America's adversaries to have greater influence abroad, predicted the agency's director Michael Abramowitz.",
      "After Mr. Trump signed an executive order that seeks to make sweeping cuts at the nation's largest international broadcaster, about 1,300 employees, including Abramowitz, learned over the weekend they had been placed on administrative leave, and another 500 contractors were terminated. Mr. Trump accused the news agency, which began broadcasting during World War II, of spreading \"radical propaganda.\"",
      "In an interview with CBS News Monday, Abramowitz called VOA \"an incredibly important soft power tool\" for the U.S. and said shuttering it would be a \"self-inflicted blow\" to national security because VOA's news coverage helps to combat Chinese, Russian and Iranian disinformation.",
      "\"If America pulls off the playing field and cedes it to our adversaries, then they're going to be telling the narratives that people around the world are going to be hearing, and that can't be good for America,\" he said. \"They're going to be hearing an anti-America narrative. We need to fight that with truth.\"",
      "VOA reports news about the U.S. in nearly 50 languages \u2014 with much of its focus trained on countries that lack a free press. By law, the broadcasts do not air inside the U.S., but news programming is viewed widely \u2014 with an audience of about 360 million people per week worldwide.",
      "\"We are getting through to an audience that might otherwise hear propaganda,\" Abramowitz said, adding that many VOA journalists are from countries under authoritarian control. \"The major challenge for the United States in general is this global information war in which countries like China and Russia are essentially really having our lunch. \u2026 So, I really feel that we need an organization that is accurate, unbiased, objective, and that tells the truth about America to the rest of the world in the languages that they understand.\"",
      "\"That has never been more important with a sea of lies and disinformation that are going on around the world,\" he added.",
      "Still, Abramowitz acknowledged\tthat VOA, which has a $270 million annual budget, could be reformed and that it should \"not be resistant to change.\"",
      "\"I'm not saying it has to be the way it's always been,\" Abramowitz said. \"Change is great. Change is needed. Change is required.\"",
      "\"I don't personally think it's a waste of taxpayer money,\" he argued. \"Does that mean that it has to be a $270 million budget? Maybe it could be [$240 million], maybe it could be [$200 million]. Look, we are in an era where the taxpayer expects a smaller, more modernized, more streamlined government.\"",
      "He defended VOA's journalists as non-partisan and said if they harbored any bias, it is against totalitarianism, tyranny and authoritarianism.",
      "\"If you care about a free Iran, if you care about more openness in China, if you care about freedom in Russia, if you care about freedom in Venezuela and Nicaragua, then you have an incredibly important tool in VOA to help push back and to get accurate and objective information into these places that don't have it,\" he said. \"That is incredibly important.\"",

      "Syria's fledgling interim government is just three months old, after toppling Bashar al-Assad and his brutal regime which held an iron fist over the Syrian people for decades. The Arab northeast African nation of Sudan is currently embroiled in civil war and a refugee crisis while suffering pockets of famine. Tens of thousands of Sudanese refugees have sought asylum in Israel over the last two decades, only to be detained in the country's desert-based detention centers or left to live without any formal status. The East African country of Somalia is a fragile, formerly failed state where the militant Islamist group Al-Shabaab continues to wage a deadly insurgency.",
      "Since his Feb. 4 news conference, Mr. Trump has suggested Palestinians would have a choice on whether to leave but also indicated that their departure from Gaza could be permanent. In a Fox News interview several days later he said, \"We'll build beautiful communities, safe communities, could be five, six, could be two. But we'll build safe communities a little bit away from where they (the Palestinians) are.\" In the same interview, he said that Palestinians wouldn't have the right to return to Gaza under his plan because the enclave \"is not habitable\" and won't be for years to come.",
      "The United Nations reported in January that over 90% of housing units in Gaza are either damaged or destroyed and 1.9 million Gazan civilians have been displaced. Gaza's health ministry says more than 48,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war between Israel and Hamas, which began after the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack in which Hamas killed more than 1,000 Israelis and took roughly 100 more hostage.",
      "Multiple Arab governments, the United Nations and some Democratic lawmakers, quickly denounced Mr. Trump's idea of emptying out Gaza with some defining the idea as ethnic cleansing. Instead, Arab leaders endorsed an alternative Egyptian post-war construction plan for Gaza last week, but the Trump administration and Israel were both quick to reject it, again citing that the Gaza Strip is uninhabitable.",
      "Former President Joe Biden's administration had been sending U.S. officials on a regular basis to meet with the new Syrian government in Damascus in the lead-up to Mr. Trump's inauguration when the visits stopped.\u00a0 Syria's new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, was quick to condemn Mr. Trump's remarks in February, saying that the U.S. president's plan \"is a serious crime that will ultimately fail\". It is unclear what the Trump administration's overall policy toward the new Syrian government will be.",
      "\"The Trump administration should engage directly with the new government in Damascus, particularly after the agreement between Damascus and the SDF (the U.S.-allied Syrian Democratic Forces). And to ensure that Iran never again gains a foothold in Syria, for the true, enduring defeat of ISIS, and to conduct a full withdrawal of U.S. forces in the right way unlike what unfolded in Afghanistan,\" Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the Washington-based advocacy and humanitarian organization Syrian Emergency Task Force, told CBS News.",
      "Israel has conducted widespread airstrikes in Syria since December, on what it described as Assad regime weapons sites, and seized territory in the buffer zone between both countries. This past week, Israel struck inside a Damascus suburb, saying it was taking out the headquarters of the Islamic Jihad, an Iran-backed militant group that has a substantial foothold in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.",
      "A State Department spokesperson deferred to the Israeli government, and told CBS News that Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff \"continues to work tirelessly towards either an extension of Phase One (of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement) or an advance to Phase Two with these principles in mind\".",
      "The State Department also referred to remarks by Witkoff from a February Fox News interview in which he said, \"We need to explore new policy prescriptions that ultimately end up in a better life for Gazans and Palestinians.\"",
      "Witkoff also suggested in the same Fox interview that Gaza's entire Palestinian population could go to other Middle East-based Arab nations and other countries beyond the region: \"I think that the president's solution is: how do we address where two million people can go? And I think the obvious answers are: in some respects, Egypt, in some respects, Jordan; but in some respects other countries who have called us up and voluntarily said this is a humanitarian effort, we want to help you\".",
      "Asked by \"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan on Sunday about whether the Trump administration is talking to other countries about relocation of two million Palestinians in Gaza, Witkoff said again \"I think we're exploring, Margaret, all alternatives and options that lead to a better life for Gazans. And, by the way, for the people of Israel. So we're exploring all of those things.\"",
      "Millions of displaced Palestinians already live in surrounding Arab countries as refugees, including in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Egypt. Far-right Israeli ministers have increasingly called for moving Palestinians in Gaza and also in the West Bank off their land as part of the extreme view it would fulfill a Biblical claim by Jews to the land, and increase Israel's security.",

      "President Trump is planning to invoke a wartime law known as the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 as soon as Friday to authorize the summary deportation of some migrants, including to Guantanamo Bay, escalating his government-wide immigration crackdown, multiple U.S. officials familiar with the plan told CBS News.",
      "The 227-year-old law gives presidents the extraordinary power to order the arrest, detention and deportation of noncitizens who are 14 years or older and come from countries staging an \"invasion or predatory incursion\" of the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to cite the 18th-century statute to order the swift detention and deportation of suspected members of the Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang with prison origins that his administration has designated a foreign terrorist organization, said the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.",
      "A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order on Saturday after the ACLU and Democracy Forward filed a lawsuit challenging Mr. Trump's invocation of the act. The temporary restraining order protects five Venezuelan men detained in Texas and New York. A remote hearing has been set for Saturday afternoon. The ACLU said in a statement that it plans to ask the \"temporary restraining order be broadened to everyone in danger of removal under the act.\"",
      "Officials have made preparations to send suspected gang members to the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, soon after Mr. Trump invokes the Alien Enemies Act, two of the U.S. officials said. At Mr. Trump's direction, officials have been detaining some migrants awaiting deportation at the naval base, though the holding facilities were left empty earlier this week.",
      "Those subject to the Alien Enemies Act would not be allowed to have a court hearing or an asylum interview since they would be processed under an emergency, wartime authority \u2014 not immigration law. Instead, they would be eligible to be detained and deported, with little to no due process, under Title 50, the section of the U.S. code housing America's war and defense laws.",
      "CNN first reported Mr. Trump's plans to invoke the law as early as Friday.",
      "The Alien Enemies Act has been invoked only a few times in U.S. history, including during World War II, when the government used it to surveil and detain Italian, German and Japanese immigrants in the U.S.",
      "Its invocation to target migrants from countries with which the U.S. is not actively at war is almost certain to face legal challenges.",
      "Mr. Trump previewed his invocation of the Alien Enemies Act in an executive order issued on his first day back at the White House. It directed the secretaries of state and homeland security to plan for the potential invocation of the law and prepare facilities \"necessary to expedite the removal\" of those subject to it.",
      "\"By invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil, including our cities and inner cities,\" Mr. Trump said in his inaugural address.",

Al-Sudani came to power with the support of a coalition of Iran-backed factions, and Tehran was a major backer of Assad.

      "\"In America, we tend to pursue health. We try to identify the right diet or exercise program or supplement regimen \u2014 but our brains are hardwired for novelty.\"",
      "Studies have shown that people who wake up and have a sense of purpose, whether it\u2019s a duty, a passion or an outlet, have greater health outcomes.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "\"We're constantly bombarded and bamboozled by new health news and people \u2014 and in blue zones, they never tried to live a long time.\"",
      "The reason for this longevity, according to Buettner, is that they live in environments where the healthy choice is easy.",
      "Nutrition and exercise",
      "One of the characteristics most blue zones share is their walkability, as people walk to work, school, friends\u2019 homes or gardens.",
      "\"They're getting 8,000 to 10,000 steps a day without thinking about it,\" Buettner said.",
      "Also, the cheapest and most convenient foods in blue zones are unprocessed.",
      "\"The big insight we learned from blue zones is that in places where people are actually living longer, it's not because they try.\"",
      "\"People in blue zones also eat healthier, as they consume primarily whole, unprocessed, plant-based foods,\" Buettner noted.",
      "The average American eats about 220 pounds of meat a year, which he believes is \"too much.\"",
      "\"I'm not advocating a no-meat diet, but I will tell you, people in blue zones eat about 20 pounds of meat a year, so about once a week as a celebratory food \u2014 and they are getting all the nutrients they need.\"",

      "FRESH FOOD CONSUMPTION COULD HELP SOLVE DIET-RELATED ILLNESS: EXPERTS",
      "Fiber is often neglected in the American diet, Buettner said, with only about 5% to 10% of Americans getting enough.",
      "\"If you don't get enough fiber, it often goes to work at the mucous membrane and creates a certain permeability or leaky gut, and that causes all kinds of problems,\" he warned.",

      "Power of community",
      "\"In blue zones, we see very clearly that people are connecting face to face, probably five to six hours a day,\" Buettner said.",
      "People in these areas often live in extended families.",
      "\"People in blue zones eat healthier, as they consume primarily whole, unprocessed, plant-based foods.\" (iStock)",
      "\"Grandma never gets lonely, because she lives upstairs and helps with the garden,\" Buettner shared as an example. \"She helps cook food and she helps with childcare. And the kids do better because they're getting better attention. And it's this virtuous circle.\"",
      "In blue zones, people typically live in communities where they care about each other, he added.",
      "\"They're not spending nearly as many stress hormones arguing about things \u2014 and there's more time for laughter when you're not angry.\"",
      "Faith factor",
      "Data shows that people who regularly go to church live anywhere from four to 14 years longer than people who don't, Buettner noted.",
      "\"You can't measure faith, but you can measure religiosity,\" he said. \"Scientists simply ask people how often they show up at church, temple or mosque, and then they compare the longevity of the people who show up to those who don't show up at all.\"",
      "WARDING OFF DEMENTIA MEANS MORE READING, PRAYING AND LISTENING TO MUSIC: STUDY",
      "Part of this likely stems from the fact that churchgoers have a built-in community, he said, as loneliness has proven to be \"toxic.\"",

      "Those who worship on Sunday may also benefit from having one day a week where they \"stop everything.\"",
      "\"Being human is inherently stressful, and church gives us an hour or maybe a couple of hours where we fully take the focus off of our everyday life and troubles, and we get to sort of elevate to a higher plane and focus on a greater good,\" Buettner said.",

      "The act of prayer itself could also \"stack the deck\" in favor of longevity and health, he added.",
      "\"By the way, people who sing in the choir actually even live longer,\" Beuttner said. \"So if you want a little extra bump, join the church and sing in the choir.\"",
      "Sleep's role in health",
      "In his visits to blue zones, Buettner found that the residents are usually early to bed, early to rise.",
      "\"They have kind of two sleeps, where they'll go to bed shortly after sunset, and then get up at 3 or 4 a.m. and do some chores, and then go back to sleep until sunrise,\" he told Fox News Digital.",
      "Napping is also very common throughout all blue zones.",

      "\"And some good research shows that people who take a 20-minute nap five days a week have significantly lower rates of cardiovascular disease and about 30% lower rates of cardiovascular mortality,\" Buettner said. \"So napping is definitely part of the blue zone approach to longevity.\"",
      "\"Blue zones give us a very clear set of choices and environmental factors that would help us mindlessly get the years we deserve.\"",
      "Overall, he concluded, anyone can benefit from the lessons learned from the blue zones \u2014 primarily the importance of keeping people healthy in the first place.",
      "\"It\u2019s about shaping their environment so that healthier choices are easier or unavoidable and setting them up for success, so they're subconsciously making better decisions on a day-to-day basis for years or decades,\" Buettner said.",

      "BOOST YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM WITH THESE 8 SIMPLE STEPS",
      "\"So many people have seasonal affective disorder, and that's a manifestation of the lack of sunlight during winter,\" he said.",
      "Children with tuberculosis were put in an outdoor solarium for periods of rest in 1946. This sanitarium accommodated 200 patients ranging from infants to 20-year-olds. (Alamy)",
      "Sunlight's healing properties",
      "As far back as the 1920s, medical professionals leveraged light exposure to promote healing.",
      "Hospitals made use of sundecks, where patients could be transported for periods of time to take in the sunlight and fresh air, according to Seheult.",
      "JUST ONE NIGHT OF POOR SLEEP COULD HAVE THESE SURPRISING HEALTH EFFECTS",
      "But with the development of penicillin and other advancements in modern medicine, doctors relied less on holistic methods, he said.",

      "Sunlight can boost the body's ability to regulate sleep, circadian rhythm and mood. (iStock)",
      "Vitamin D is a known anti-inflammatory and antioxidant that supports immune health, muscle and brain function, according to Mayo Clinic.",

      "Just 15 to 20 minutes of sunlight exposure can help boost the immune system and potentially even ward off chronic disease, according to Seheult.",
      "Balancing risks and benefits",
      "The warnings from medical professionals of sunlight leading to skin cancer may have caused decreased exposure, the doctor suggested.",
      "\"Certainly, if we go outside in the sun for too long for a period of time without protection, we can get those types of skin damage,\" he said.",

      "Sunlight is also still present on cloudy and rainy days and in urban areas, Seheult noted.",
      "WHY HIGHER UV INDEX NUMBERS ARE MORE DANGEROUS DURING SUN EXPOSURE",
      "\"The amount of light inside a building [is] usually no more than 100 lux,\" he said. \"When you go outside on a bright, sunny day, that's 100,000 lux. That's 1,000 times brighter.\"",
      "Although that exposure will be reduced on cloudy days or in the winter, it won't be \"nearly as low\" as indoor lighting, Sehuelt added.",
      "\"Kids are spending so much more time inside,\" Seheult said. \"Any sort of movement that we make toward going outside will be very beneficial.\" (iStock)",
      "To reap the benefits of infrared light without the risk, Seheult recommended going outside and covering up for about 30 minutes, even in the morning or evening while the sun is setting.",
      "\"These are times when there is an abundance of infrared light, far more than you would get inside your home,\" he said.",
      "\"All it takes is about 15 to 20 minutes of infrared light exposure \u2026 and we're seeing effects that last for days.\"",

      "FIRST ON FOX: A group of Republican state attorneys general is filing an amicus brief in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia on Tuesday afternoon, urging the circuit court to reverse a judge\u2019s order blocking Trump from deporting alleged Tren de Aragua gang members, with one AG saying \"the judges are basically supporting foreign terrorist organizations over the public safety of the American citizen.\"",

      "Miyares said Trump acted \"fully within his constitutional and statutory authority\" when he did not ground airplanes deporting alleged migrant gang members to El Salvador as Boasberg requested. Trump's Department of Justice cited the Alien Enemies Act, which gives him the ability to deport any illegal immigrant without a court process, and filed an emergency petition in the D.C. appellate court, urging it to \"halt this massive, unauthorized imposition\" on the president's \"authority to remove people that Defendants had determined to be members of TdA.\"",

Scammers often use your local area code or even parts of your phone number to make you think the call is legitimate. That's why it's crucial to carefully check the number before picking up. If you don\u2019t recognize the number, it\u2019s safest to ignore the call or text in case it's spam.",

However, removing your number from these sites can help lower the chances of spammers getting a hold of it and reaching out to you. With a data removal service, your personal information is removed from the web so data brokers and scammers never get their hands on your personal phone number, home address or email address. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Change-of-address scams involve some of the most seemingly harmless personal information getting into the wrong hands. This can lead to a whole host of problems, including financial losses and identity theft, although change-of-address fraud is technically a form of identity theft.",
      "This kind of fraud involves a scammer impersonating you to request a change of address with the United States Postal Service (USPS).",
      "Once they have your mail redirected to an address they control, they can go through it at their leisure, looking for mail they can steal and information they can use to perpetrate further scams, like taking out loans or credit cards in your name or using your identity to defraud others.",

      "Here\u2019s how it works, step by step",
      "This detailed breakdown explains the process of a change-of-address scam, from initial targeting to the potential consequences and warning signs to watch for.",
      "A person with criminal intent gets your postal address and full name, something that\u2019s most easily done using a so-called people search site. People search sites, also known as people finder sites, are a kind of data broker that specializes in collecting, organizing and selling access to personal information.",
      "The scammer then mails a change-of-address request to the USPS, providing your name and a new address he has access to. The\u00a0online change-of-address form is generally more secure, requiring confirmation via a bank account. That\u2019s why scammers will almost always mail in the request.",
      "The form requires a signature, but this is unlikely to be verified when processing the request. So, the scammer will either find an image of your signature somewhere, steal a document that includes your signature or simply sign your name any which way.",
      "Now that they\u2019ve redirected your mail straight into their hands, the scammer just has to patiently wait for sensitive mail to arrive. They\u2019re on the lookout for anything they can use to steal from you or defraud you. Bank statements, tax documents, checks and even your household bills can be used to commit further acts of fraud and identity theft.",
      "One of the scariest things a scammer can do once he has enough of your personal information is to commit deed fraud, otherwise known as\u00a0home title theft. You\u2019re far from helpless, though. There are telltale signs that you can watch for to catch change-of-address scams early.",
      "The most obvious sign to watch for is a sudden and persistent drop in the amount of mail entering your mailbox. This only applies to mail addressed to you by name. Mail delivered to your address without an addressee, including mail addressed to \"homeowner\" or \"occupant,\" won\u2019t be affected by a change-of-address scam.",
      "The other major things to keep an eye on are your credit report, credit card statements and bank statements. You can request a free credit report from one of the three credit bureaus once per year.",

They\u2019re the first port of call for many scammers. Without these companies in the mix, scammers aren\u2019t likely to come across your address in the first place.",

      "2. Reduce the amount of sensitive mail in your mailbox: Start by switching to paperless options wherever available. This will dramatically reduce the amount of sensitive mail heading to your mailbox, leaving criminals with little value to steal. Check your mail daily, as soon as possible after it\u2019s delivered. Get someone to do this for you if you\u2019re away. Some redirection scams start with mail being stolen from your mailbox. Definitely avoid allowing your mailbox to overflow.",

      "There are concerns about how the technology might affect personal space and data security.",
      "The trucking industry is in the midst of a technological revolution, thanks to the arrival of artificial intelligence-powered dashcams.",
      "These innovative devices promise to make roads safer and operations more efficient, but they also raise some important questions about privacy.",

      "The promise of AI dashcams",
      "AI dashcams are transforming road safety and fleet management through advanced computer vision technology. These smart devices, equipped with both inward- and outward-facing cameras, can detect a wide range of unsafe driving behaviors.",
      "The outward-facing cameras are capable of detecting rolling stops, unsafe lane changes and potential collisions, while the inward-facing cameras monitor driver drowsiness, distraction, seatbelt violations and smoking. The accuracy of these systems is impressive, with detection rates ranging from 88% to 99.5% and false positives as low as 0.5% to 12%.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "FusionSite Services, a waste management provider, installed\u00a0Motive's AI dashcam system across their 800-unit fleet, resulting in a significant reduction in accidents and unsafe behaviors. Specifically, it saw an 89% decrease in accidents and a 92% decrease in unsafe behaviors, highlighting the tangible impact of this technology on safety.",

      "BIG RIGS DELIVER CARGO WITH NO HUMANS AT THE WHEEL",
      "Privacy concerns",
      "Despite the safety benefits, the installation of AI dashcams raises significant privacy issues. Many truck drivers view their vehicles as second homes, especially long-haul drivers who spend extended periods on the road. The constant presence of cameras in their workspace raises concerns about perceived invasion of privacy in personal space, fear of constant surveillance and micromanagement and worries about data security and potential misuse of collected information.",
      "The use of outward-facing cameras also affects the privacy of other road users because they may record private citizens without consent. There is a risk of data breaches exposing personal information or location data and concerns about how footage might be used or shared. These concerns underscore the need for careful consideration of privacy rights when deploying such technology.",
      "To address some of these privacy concerns, Motive has implemented features such as Driver Privacy Mode, which allows drivers to disable the driver-facing camera while off duty. Additionally, Motive's AI dashcam system includes privacy controls and the option to activate Driver Privacy Mode for individual drivers, groups or entire fleets. Motive's AI dash cam also incorporates blurring technology to protect the privacy of individuals captured in the footage, further addressing concerns about recording private citizens without consent.",

In some jurisdictions, like California, the use of such cameras is not considered a violation of state laws. However, in Illinois, a lawsuit has been filed against Samsara, alleging violations of the Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) for capturing and storing drivers' facial scans without proper consent.

      "To address privacy concerns while maintaining safety benefits, companies should develop clear policies on camera usage and data access. Cameras should only record during specific events rather than continuously, and robust data security measures must be established to prevent breaches and misuse.",
      "Providing comprehensive training to drivers on the purpose and benefits of the technology is also crucial. Open communication and trust between management and drivers are essential for fostering a positive environment where both safety and privacy are respected.",
      "As reported by\u00a0The Trucker, an authority on all things in the trucking and freight industry, \"Truck drivers are not much different than the rest of us in our desire to adapt to technological advances. At first, they don't want to, and some may go as far as getting out of the business. Eventually, like many of us, once we do adapt to the changing landscape, it soon becomes second nature.\u00a0However, a driver-facing camera may be too much of an invasion of personal privacy.\"",

However, the implementation of these systems must be carefully balanced against privacy concerns. As the technology continues to evolve, it is crucial for companies, policymakers and drivers to work together to establish guidelines that protect individual privacy while harnessing the safety potential of AI dashcams.

      "IOS 18.3.2 software update on iPhone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is CVE-2025-24201?",
      "This vulnerability resides in WebKit, the open-source browser engine that powers Safari, Mail, App Store and other apps on Apple devices.

These attacks are believed to involve well-funded threat actors, such as state-sponsored hackers or advanced cybercriminal groups.",
      "Why does this matter?",
      "Zero-day vulnerabilities like CVE-2025-24201 are particularly dangerous because they are exploited before developers can patch them.

      "Kurt the CyberGuy explains how to increase your security and privacy through Google Chrome on your devices when browsing the web.",
      "Chrome extensions are incredibly useful, whether you want to block ads, track the best deals or\u00a0enhance your browsing experience. They can be downloaded from the Chrome Web Store, which functions like the Play Store but for extensions. However, extensions are easier to mimic and turn into malicious software compared to apps.",
      "As we just reported, over 3.2 million users were victimized by a security breach tied to\u00a016 malicious browser extensions, highlighting how attackers exploit tools that seem legitimate to spread malware or steal sensitive data.",
      "Now, security researchers have discovered a polymorphic attack that allows malicious Chrome extensions to transform into other browser extensions, including password managers, crypto wallets and banking apps, to steal sensitive information.",
      "Keep reading to learn how this attack works and how to protect yourself from it.",

      "How the malicious polymorphic attack works",
      "Security researchers at\u00a0SquareX Labs have found a new attack that lets malicious Chrome extensions disguise themselves as legitimate ones, like password managers, crypto wallets and banking apps, to steal sensitive information. This \"polymorphic\" attack takes advantage of Chrome\u2019s extension system to trick users while staying under the radar.",
      "The attack starts with hackers uploading what looks like a harmless extension to the Chrome Web Store. It might even have real features, like an AI-powered marketing tool, to convince users to install and pin it to their browser.",
      "Once installed, the malicious extension scans the victim\u2019s browser for other extensions. It can do this in two ways. If it has permission to use the \"chrome.management\" API, it grabs a list of installed extensions directly. If not, it injects code into web pages to check for unique files or resources tied to certain extensions.",
      "If it finds a targeted extension, like 1Password, the malicious extension reports back to an attacker-controlled server. The attacker then tells it to impersonate the real extension by disabling it if permissions allow, changing its name and icon and displaying a fake login popup that looks just like the real thing.",
      "Fake extension page (SquareX)",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Social engineering makes things worse",
      "To steal user credentials, the malicious extension triggers a fake \"Session Expired\" prompt when the victim tries to log in to a website. This tricks them into thinking they need to reenter their credentials for their password manager or banking app. When they do, the stolen data is sent straight to the attackers.",
      "After collecting the credentials, the extension switches back to its original form. It restores the legitimate extension, making everything look normal so the victim doesn\u2019t suspect anything. This shows just how dangerous malicious Chrome extensions can be and why stronger security measures are needed to protect users.",
      "We reached out to Google, and a spokesperson told CyberGuy,\u00a0\"We appreciate the work of the research community and we've received the report. We are constantly investing in ways to improve the security of the Chrome Web Store, and we take appropriate action when we learn of emerging threats.\"",

      "5 ways you can protect your personal data",
      "Here are five ways to safeguard your sensitive information and maintain your online privacy.",
      "1.\u00a0Keep your browser and extensions up to date: Outdated software is a goldmine for cybercriminals. Bugs or security gaps in old versions of your browser or extensions can be exploited to inject malicious code, steal data or take control of your system. Updates patch these vulnerabilities, making them a critical line of defense. Turn on automatic updates for your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) so you\u2019re always running the latest version without thinking about it. See my guide on\u00a0keeping your devices and apps updated for more information.",
      "2. Install extensions only from trusted sources:\u00a0Official browser stores like the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons have rules and scans to catch bad actors, but they\u2019re not perfect. Extensions from random websites or third-party downloads are far more likely to hide malware or spyware. Stick to the official store for your browser; don\u2019t download extensions from sketchy links.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Update your passwords: Change passwords for any accounts that may have been affected by the extension and use unique, strong passwords for each account. Consider using a password manager. This can help you generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5.\u00a0Invest in personal data removal services: If your personal data gets stolen by the extension, it\u2019s crucial to act quickly to reduce your risk of identity theft and scams. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "The malicious extension highlights that Google isn\u2019t doing enough to keep malware off its platform. Security researchers pointed out that the Chrome Web Store lacks protections against these types of attacks, such as blocking sudden changes to an extension\u2019s icon or HTML, or at least alerting users when such changes occur. The problem isn\u2019t limited to the Chrome Web Store. The Play Store also hosts malicious apps from time to time, affecting millions of users.

The Houthis, an Iranian proxy, have dragged Yemen into chaos, destabilized the region, and attacked global shipping.

The Houthis have disrupted global trade, attacked U.S. forces and fueled instability. That said, it\u2019s unclear how far the U.S. is willing to go in its campaign against them. The Red Sea and the Strait of Mandab are among the most strategic trade routes in the world, carrying over 20% of oil shipments and 13% of global trade.\"",

The good news is that Saudi Arabia and Yemen\u2019s legitimate government have already done the heavy lifting, liberating around 80% of Yemeni territory.

      "\"These U.S. strikes have multiple benefits for the U.S.,\" Schanzer added. \"It\u2019s a sign to the Saudis that we are committed to their regional security. It\u2019s a sign to Europe that we are committed to freedom of navigation in the Red Sea, which will reduce shipping costs for their companies.

      "The escalation follows accusations from Syria\u2019s interim government that Hezbollah terrorists crossed into Syrian territory, kidnapped three soldiers and executed them on Lebanese soil. In response, the Syrian army launched artillery strikes on Hezbollah positions, targeting what it called \"gatherings\" of fighters responsible for the killings. Hezbollah has denied involvement.",
      "The Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar, which is affiliated with Hezbollah, reported that the Syrian army successfully captured the village of Hawsh al-Sayyid Ali on the Syria-Lebanon border during the confrontations. Currently, most of the fighting is near the village of Al-Qasr.",

      "According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, at least five additional Syrian soldiers were killed during the clashes. Civilians, including families with young children, were seen fleeing toward the Syrian village of Hermel as violence spread across the border region.",
      "The newly established Syrian government, led by Ahmad al-Sharaa of the U.S.-sanctioned terrorist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, issued a rare statement vowing retaliation against Hezbollah.",
      "\"They took them to Lebanese territory and killed them. The Ministry of Defense will take all necessary measures in response to this escalation by Hezbollah,\" the statement reads.",
      "The conflict reflects deeper sectarian and ideological divisions. HTS, a Sunni terrorist group with roots in Syria\u2019s jihadist insurgency and former ties to al Qaeda, and Hezbollah, a Shiite terrorist force backed by Iran, represent opposing factions in the ongoing struggle for regional dominance.",

      "The collapse of President Bashar Assad\u2019s government in December marked a major turning point, as Hezbollah had spent 14 years backing him alongside Russia and Iran\u2019s pro-Shiite militias. However, in late November, Syrian rebels launched a surprise offensive against Assad\u2019s forces, just as a ceasefire was announced in northern Gaza, leading to the final collapse of his rule.",

      "Now in power, HTS has pledged to crack down on weapons and drug smuggling along the border, a move that directly threatens Hezbollah\u2019s operations. The new Syrian government has already begun military deployments to secure its borders, further restricting Hezbollah\u2019s ability to maneuver.",
      "\"Hezbollah is facing a confluence of threats unlike any time in its history,\" said Ali. \"With HTS consolidating control in Syria, Hezbollah\u2019s overland weapons supply route from Iran has been severely compromised. This disruption could significantly degrade its operational capabilities.\"",
      "The rise of HTS as a governing force in Syria has also drawn U.S. attention. While Washington has designated HTS as a terrorist organization, analysts suggest that al-Sharaa's pragmatic approach should be assessed cautiously.",
      "\"The U.S. is navigating a complex landscape in Syria, and while it does not officially recognize HTS, there are strategic interests in seeing Hezbollah and Iranian influence further weakened,\" Ali noted.",
      "HTS has attempted to rebrand itself from its extremist origins, portraying itself as a nationalist Islamist movement opposed to Iranian influence and Hezbollah\u2019s expansion in Syria. While skepticism remains, the group\u2019s control over key Syrian territory disrupts Iran\u2019s ability to maintain a direct supply corridor to Hezbollah in Lebanon.",

      "Beyond Syria, Hezbollah is also facing growing challenges in Lebanon. The group\u2019s losses in recent confrontations with Israel have emboldened its domestic opponents, who now see an opportunity to weaken its grip on Lebanese politics.",
      "Former Lebanese President Michel Aoun echoed these concerns, highlighting three major threats to Lebanon\u2019s stability: ongoing Israeli attacks, Hezbollah\u2019s involvement in cross-border violence, and the unresolved Syrian refugee crisis.",
      "\"Officials must take immediate action to protect the safety of the nation and its citizens,\" he said.",

      "The trial of the two suspects and the disclosures of a former founder of the U.S.-sanctioned terrorist organization IRGC that the ayatollahs ordered the murders of Iranians in exile add greater urgency to the need to address Iran\u2019s threats to murder President Donald Trump, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Iranian-American critics of the regime, according to experts.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge Tuesday blocked President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order banning transgender people from enlisting or serving in the military.",
      "U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes of Washington, D.C., ruled that the ban violates the equal protection clause because it discriminates based on transgender status and sex.",
      "Reyes said the ban \u201cis soaked in animus.\u201d",
      "\u201cIts language is unabashedly demeaning, its policy stigmatizes transgender persons as inherently unfit, and its conclusions bear no relation to fact,\u201d she wrote.",
      "She added, \u201cIndeed, the cruel irony is that thousands of transgender servicemembers have sacrificed \u2014 some risking their lives \u2014 to ensure for others the very equal protection rights the Military Ban seeks to deny them.\u201d",
      "Reyes delayed the effect of her preliminary injunction until Friday to give the administration time to appeal it. She added in her order that the government \u201ccould have crafted a policy that balances the Nation\u2019s need for a prepared military and Americans\u2019 right to equal protection.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey still can,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Military Ban, however, is not that policy. The Court therefore must act to uphold the equal protection rights that the military defends every day.\u201d",
      "The White House and the Justice Department did not immediately reply to requests for comment.",
      "Shannon Minter, legal director for the National Center for Lesbian Rights, which is representing several trans service members and trans people who want to enlist in a lawsuit, said Reyes acted quickly \u201cto shield our troops from the harmful effects of this irrational ban.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe ban\u2019s harmful impact and rushed implementation show that it was motivated by prejudice,\u201d Minter said in a statement. \u201cOur plaintiffs include lifelong military personnel who served in combat in Afghanistan, come from multi-generation military families, and have received honors like the Bronze Star. This ban is unjustifiable and attacks brave servicemembers, recruits, and families who sacrifice so much for our country.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s order goes much further than a similar policy he issued during his first term, which prohibited trans people from enlisting and allowed those already serving to continue doing so in a manner consistent with their gender identities and continue receiving transition-related medical care if they came out before the ban. Service members who came out after it were not allowed to receive such medical care and had to continue serving in a manner consistent with their assigned sexes at birth.",
      "The new policy prohibits trans people from enlisting and requires the military to identify all trans service members who have \u201ca current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria,\u201d which is the medical term for the severe emotional distress caused by the misalignment between one\u2019s gender identity and birth sex, according to a memo the Defense Department filed in the lawsuit last week.",
      "Those identified by the Pentagon will be disqualified from service and must be removed from their jobs. They will receive honorable separations unless their records reflect otherwise, according to the memo.",
      "In January, two national LGBTQ legal organizations, GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders and the the National Center for Lesbian Rights, filed suit against Trump\u2019s executive order on behalf of six active-duty trans service members and two trans people seeking to enlist. They argued that the ban discriminates against trans people and \u201creflects animosity toward transgender people because of their transgender status.\u201d",
      "The order, the lawsuit said, declared that being trans fundamentally \u201cconflicts with a soldier\u2019s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one\u2019s personal life.\u201d",
      "The order said, \u201cA man\u2019s assertion that he is a woman, and his requirement that others honor this falsehood, is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member.\u201d",
      "Reyes pushed Justice Department attorney Jason C. Lynch on that language during preliminary hearings last month, asking repeatedly whether he believed it showed animus against the trans community.",
      "\u201cWould it be fair to say that excluding a group of people from military service based on unsupported assertions that they are liars, immodest, lack integrity, are undisciplined and are dishonorable, would you agree with me that \u2014 particularly where there\u2019s no support for any of those assertions \u2014 that that is animated by animus?\u201d Reyes asked Lynch, who declined to answer.",
      "Multiple Defense Department memos also say enlisted service members will be required to use pronouns and salutations, such as \u201csir\u201d and \u201cma\u2019am,\u201d that align with their birth sexes. Reyes pressed Lynch about how pronoun usage affects military readiness.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t \u2014\u201d Lynch said, before the judge interrupted him.",
      "\u201cBecause it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Reyes said. \u201cBecause any commonsense rational human being understands that it doesn\u2019t.\u201d"

      "It is the record sixth college that has made the tournament under Pitino, who had already made history as the first to win a national championship at two schools and advance to a Final Four with three.",
      "Five decades into his career, at a time when many of Pitino\u2019s coaching contemporaries have long since retired, Pitino did the opposite. He not only wanted to get back to the college game, he was willing to take a circuitous route to get there. And despite returning to a college system that has undergone seismic changes \u2014 from allowing players to profit off their name, image and likeness, to hopping between schools without penalty via the transfer portal \u2014 Pitino has thrived.",
      "\u201cI really don\u2019t believe in the word \u2018redemption\u2019 because those who judge you really don\u2019t know the facts,\u201d Pitino\u00a0said Monday\u00a0on ESPN\u2019s Pat McAfee Show. \u201cThey really don\u2019t know either way, innocent or guilty.

      "\u201cCoach P is the mastermind behind all of this,\u201d Luis said. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s truly special.\u201d",
      "The scene would have been difficult to imagine in 2017, when Pitino was\u00a0fired\u00a0by the University of Louisville following an FBI investigation that alleged the school had arranged payments for the family of a recruit. It stained his job prospects. Pitino, in 2020, told a radio show in Louisville that he had been \"sort of been blackballed out of the business for two and a half years,\"\u00a0and while he maintained\u00a0that he was innocent of wrongdoing, \u201cI was the leader and I deserved to be fired.\u201d (In 2022, an independent review process ended the case by giving only light penalties to Louisville and none to Pitino.)",
      "In 2018, Louisville was\u00a0forced to vacate\u00a0the 2013 national championship it won under Pitino following an NCAA investigation into allegations a school staffer arranged for sex and strippers with recruits.",
      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t exiled away, but nobody really wanted to deal with hiring me at that point,\u201d Pitino said in 2023. He could have retired. He had been college basketball\u2019s highest-paid coach, and was already enshrined in the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame. Yet Pitino, a self-described \u201cbasketball junkie,\u201d could not stay away from the sideline, even if it meant taking jobs far outside his usual spotlight.",
      "In 2018 he trekked to Athens, where he coached in Europe\u2019s top professional league. Two years later, he returned to his native New York to coach Iona, a college so small its entire enrollment would fill less than a fifth of Pitino\u2019s former Louisville arena.",
      "He declared, upon his hiring at Iona, that the job would be his last.",
      "\"The reason I said that is, who is going to hire a 70-year-old?\u201d he said in 2023. It turned out that leading Iona to two NCAA tournaments and winning more games (27) in 2022-23, his last season there, than the program had in any of the 25 seasons before made Pitino an attractive candidate for St. John\u2019s. The school, like Pitino, was a former power that had lost its shine. It had qualified for the NCAA tournament 20 times in 26 years before 2002, but just three since.",
      "Pitino, with a career .713 winning percentage, has won everywhere since he first became an interim head coach at Hawaii in 1976. Among active Division I coaches, Pitino\u2019s 37 seasons as a head coach rank third and his 761 career victories rank sixth. Those totals would be even larger if not for Pitino\u2019s six seasons coaching the NBA\u2019s Knicks and Celtics, and the 123 victories vacated from 2010 through 2015 due to NCAA penalties."

      "Holding out for a bargain on your next car purchase or a major repair? Don\u2019t, experts say.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum took hold last week, and the monthlong reprieve he offered U.S. automakers from his 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada ends April 2, threatening to drive up costs for vehicles and auto parts in coming weeks.",
      "\u201cThere is no way you\u2019re going to see a better discount if you wait three months,\u201d said Ivan Drury, director of insights at Edmunds. \u201cThat\u2019s guaranteed.\u201d",
      "Concerns about imminent price hikes come just as the auto market shows signs of stabilizing. The latest consumer price index showed new vehicle costs down 0.3% last month from the year before and those for used cars and trucks 0.8% higher over the same period \u2014 both far lower than the 2.8% annual inflation rate overall.",
      "Those trends aren\u2019t likely to last, analysts warn. Tariffs are expected to drive up auto costs by $4,000 to as much as $12,500 depending on vehicle, engine type and country of origin, according to the Anderson Economic Group, a consultancy that represents automakers and dealers.",
      "It isn\u2019t just U.S. car brands like those made by Ford, General Motors or Jeep producer Stellantis that are set to be affected, the group said. Honda, Toyota, Audi and BMW are among the foreign automakers with extensive production in North America that could raise prices, too.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re potentially undermining one of the most important elements of the U.S. economy, which is our ability to manufacture products in the United States using parts from Canada [and] Mexico,\u201d Patrick Anderson, the firm\u2019s CEO and founder, said of White House trade policies. It remains to be seen whether tariffs \u201cend up causing more damage than benefit,\u201d he said, but already, \u201cwe\u2019ve rattled consumers.\u201d",
      "A White House spokesperson didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Many drivers are already stressed about potential car purchases. The share of consumers who expect to be rejected for auto loans hit 33.5% in the latest New York Federal Reserve survey, the highest in its 12-year history. People in the market for new North American-built vehicles could also face an availability crunch, experts say. A recent forecast from S&P Global Mobility predicted regional production could drop by as much as 20,000 units per day within a week of the Canada and Mexico tariffs\u2019 taking effect.",
      "\u201cIf you have a tariff situation that changes your inputs in the vehicle, you\u2019re naturally going to want to find that mix \u2014 between the vehicle content that is most appealing to consumers and knowing that it\u2019s going to cost them more,\u201d said Stephanie Brinley, an automotive analyst at S&P Global Mobility. For automakers, she said, the question is: \u201cHow do you protect margins, and how do you work through that?\u201d",
      "Many of the perks available to prospective buyers could dry up soon, experts said, as manufacturers and dealerships start trimming rebates, financing promotions and other offers as they look to offset higher costs.",
      "\u201cYou could even see incentives being pulled back, like a $3,000 cash back offer that could go away immediately, overnight,\u201d Drury said.",
      "He and Anderson both said they expect used vehicles\u2019 price to rise, as well, in part because auto lessees wary of purchasing tariff-inflated vehicles will hold on to their leased wheels for longer. While that would boost the values of well-maintained vehicles already on the road, it would also tighten up used vehicle inventories, Drury said, potentially re-creating the lopsided pandemic-era market.",
      "There\u2019s not much U.S. consumers can do to mitigate the ripple effects, industry analysts said, given the broad-based nature of the tariffs and the chill they threaten to create among automakers. But it will help to know where your vehicle is made and which components are imported versus manufactured stateside, Drury said. He suggested consumers keep on hand the American Automobile Labeling Act report, a document the Transportation Department publishes annually that lists every vehicle model along with the origins of its composition.",
      "\u201cIt should give somewhat of a guidance, because you cannot assume the badge on the hood matches your expectation [of] where it\u2019s made,\u201d Drury said. \u201cThere\u2019s no vehicle where every single component is manufactured from the ground up in the United States.\u201d",
      "Brinley cautioned consumers against trying to \u201cgame\u201d tariffs by compromising on what they actually need. While trade duties are widely expected to fuel price hikes throughout the auto market, completely rewriting your goals for such an important purchase could end up costing more, she said.",
      "\u201cBuying something that doesn\u2019t fit your life, is the wrong size and doesn\u2019t work for you because you perceive the tariff impacts to be lower may not actually improve your life,\u201d Brinley said.",
      "You may need to adjust your budget, but \u201cin some ways,\u201d she said, \u201cshop as you always have.\u201d"

      "The execution of Jessie Hoffman Jr., convicted in the 1996 murder of a woman abducted from a New Orleans parking garage, was completed Tuesday. He was pronounced dead at 6:50 p.m. at the Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola, authorities said.",
      "They said the nitrogen gas had flowed for 19 minutes during what an official characterized as a \u201cflawless\u201d execution.",
      "Hours before the planned execution, a state district court judge rejected an attempt by Hoffman's lawyers to obtain a temporary pause. Gov. Jeff Landry, who signed a bill last year making nitrogen hypoxia a legal alternative to lethal injection, did not intervene.",
      "Tuesday evening, the U.S. Supreme Court denied a last-ditch effort to intervene in a 5-4 vote. Hoffman's lawyers argued Monday that the method violated his constitutional rights, including his ability to practice his Buddhist religion in his final moments.",
      "Hoffman\u2019s attorney, Cecelia Kappel, said in a statement Tuesday night that the execution was \u201csenseless,\u201d particularly because, Hoffman \u201cshowed extraordinary capacity for redemption\u201d and \u201cno lo longer bore any resemblance to the 18-year-old who killed Molly Elliott.\u201d",
      "Kappel, director of the Center for Social Justice at Loyola University College of Law, continued, \u201cHis execution will cause lasting harm to many. Jessie\u2019s son was a newborn at the time of his trial and has been raised by his father from death row. The prison staff who were forced to kill someone they have grown to care for and protect. And the citizens of Louisiana who have said not in my name. We are better than this.\u201d",
      "Hoffman, 46, said he began practicing Buddhism in 2002 and used meditative breathing practices to calm his anxiety in prison. But by putting him to death using nitrogen hypoxia, which involved placing a mask over his face and having him breathe only nitrogen while depriving him of oxygen, an anticipated \"sense of suffocation\" would be \"incompatible\" with his right to religious exercise, according to his lawyers.",
      "\"The record evidence unrebutted by the State establishes that, in Buddhist tradition, meditative breathing at the time of death carries profound spiritual significance, founded in the core belief that meditation and unfettered breath at the time of transition from life to death determines the quality of rebirth,\" his lawyers wrote in a filing asking the Supreme Court to temporarily halt his execution.",
      "Louisiana Corrections Secretary Gary Westcott selected nitrogen hypoxia as Hoffman's method of execution after officials have had trouble procuring the necessary lethal injection drugs following the state's last execution in 2010. More than 50 people are on Louisiana's death row.",
      "Last week, U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick in Louisiana temporarily stopped Hoffman's execution after she found it deserves more scrutiny and said she was troubled that the state waited to release only a redacted nitrogen hypoxia protocol to the public.",
      "Hoffman's lawyers had offered alternatives to nitrogen hypoxia at a hearing before the judge, including the method of firing squad or a drug cocktail typically associated with physician-assisted death, although neither option is legal in Louisiana.",
      "A federal appeals court reversed the lower court's temporary injunction Friday, in part, it said, because allowing Louisiana to choose a \"more painful\" execution method such as firing squad would be at odds with the Eighth Amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.",
      "In the nitrogen hypoxia executions in Alabama, media witnesses have\u00a0described inmates\u00a0appearing to remain conscious longer than expected, gasping for breath and thrashing and shaking on the gurney.",
      "Alabama officials have argued in court filings that the method is \"swift, painless and humane\" and that one of the inmates chose to hold his breath, which hindered his becoming unconscious faster.",
      "Louisiana corrections officials said they traveled to Alabama to study how its nitrogen system functions. Louisiana subsequently built a nitrogen hypoxia facility at the Louisiana State Penitentiary consisting of an execution chamber, a valve and storage room, and an observation area.",
      "Medical experts have warned that if the procedure is not carried out properly, even a small amount of oxygen's getting into the mask could lead to slow asphyxiation and prolong the time it would take to die.",
      "Attorney General Liz Murrill\u00a0said Friday on X that Hoffman's execution would be \"justice for Mary 'Molly' Elliot, her friends, her family, and for Louisiana.\"",
      "After the execution, Murrill said in a statement that the punishment fulfilled part of a promise to constituents to prioritize crime victims, survivors, and a stricter reading of the law.",
      "Noting the state's last execution, that of convicted murderer and sex offender Gerald Bordelon, took place in 2010, she suggested a faster pace for capital punishment was dawning.",
      "\"Justice has been delayed for far too long,\" she said. \"I, along with the Louisiana Department of Justice, remain committed to ensuring justice is carried out in all death penalty cases in Louisiana.\"",
      "Hoffman was 18 in 1996 when he abducted Elliott, a 28-year-old advertising executive, at gunpoint from a New Orleans parking garage on the night before Thanksgiving Day. Prosecutors said he forced her to withdraw $200 from an ATM, then raped and shot her to death.",
      "At Hoffman's trial in 1998, prosecutors told the jury that he confessed and said Elliott begged him not to kill her.",
      "\"When she asked for mercy, his response was to put a bullet through her head,\"\u00a0said the prosecutor, Kim McElwee.\u00a0\"Jesse\u00a0Hoffman\u00a0has earned the death penalty.\"",
      "Andy Elliott, the victim's husband, said in a statement that he has become \"indifferent\" to the use of the death penalty in the three decades since his wife's murder.",
      "\"However, I'm not indifferent to the uncertainty that has accompanied these many years. If putting him to death is the easiest way to end the uncertainty, then on balance I favor that solution. But, his death will not provide closure,\" Elliott said of Hoffman, adding, \"That pain cannot be decreased by another death, nor by commuting the sentence of Molly's assailant to life in prison.\"",
      "\"Molly was a cherished person who missed out on motherhood, a promising and successful career, and a life in the country on the property we bought together,\" Elliott said.",
      "\"From my standpoint, hearing why he did this crime is the only hole that could be filled by Jesse himself, yet, he's never offered any explanation or remorse, not even to his own family,\" he continued.",
      "Critics of nitrogen hypoxia have included the Louisiana coalition Jews Against Gassing, whose members have said the\u00a0method \"echoes\" the Holocaust.",
      "Hoffman's is one of four executions planned in the United States this week, including one in Arizona, which is scheduled to put an inmate to death by lethal injection for the first time since 2022."

      "Video released Tuesday shows the moments leading up to when, New Mexico police say, a stolen vehicle full of youths intentionally struck and killed a bicycle commuter.",
      "The cellphone video was released a day after the teenager who police said was driving was arrested on a charge of murder, Albuquerque police said Tuesday.",
      "The 13-year-old accused of driving and the two others in the car when the cyclist was killed last year are \u201crunaways\u201d and \u201cdropouts,\u201d Mayor Tim Keller said at a news conference.",
      "\u201cThese children are murderers,\u201d he said.",
      "The passengers were 15 and 11 at the time. The youngest is too young for criminal prosecution, police said.",
      "The police department announced Tuesday night that the 11-year-old had been taken into custody but that they were still looking for the 15-year-old.",
      "The state Children, Youth & Families Department will take custody of the 11-year-old and evaluate him, police said. That agency took him into custody in June, police said.",
      "Police Chief Harold Medina said at Tuesday's news conference with Keller that the boy at the time could not be prosecuted or confined effectively because of his age.",
      "The older boys have been charged with murder, conspiracy to commit murder, leaving the scene of a collision involving injury or death and unlawful possession of a firearm, police said in the statement.",
      "The state public defender's juvenile unit for the Albuquerque area did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Juveniles in children's court are automatically assigned public defenders, according to the New Mexico Law Offices of the Public Defender.",
      "Scott Dwight Habermehl, 63, a Ph.D. physicist from Corrales, a community 16 miles north of Albuquerque, was killed May 29.  He was bicycling to his job as a military contractor at Sandia National Laboratories when he was struck, police said.",
      "\"Scott was riding his bike with his helmet in a bike lane with a safety light on when he was struck by a car, and the car left,\" Police Cmdr. Kyle Hartsock said at the news conference.",
      "According to a detailed obituary published by Daniels Family Funerals & Cremation, Habermehl's contributions at Sandia, where he was also remembered as a mentor and scholar, led to six patents and included work on keeping computer microchips resistant to radiation.",
      "\"These are techniques that are still used to this day for national security and space applications,\" the obituary said.",
      "He and his partner, Dr. Jamie Philpott, an Albuquerque-area veterinarian, have two grown sons, it said, adding that Habermehl recently completed construction of a home in Leadville, Colorado, a historic town surrounded by some of the Rocky Mountains' highest peaks, as a family retreat.",
      "The case was initially considered a hit-and-run, officials said.",
      "\"The case was actually closed pending further leads,\" Hartsock, who oversees the police department's Criminal Investigation Division and any homicide probes, said at the news conference.",
      "In February, two youths reported the existence of the video to a parent and a school administrator, police said. It was allegedly taken from inside the stolen vehicle that struck Habermehl and later posted to Instagram, Hartsock said.",
      "The video helped investigators identify the three youths and obtain arrest warrants last week for two of them, according to police. The youths had had previous run-ins with law enforcement and were relatively easy to find, the commander said.",
      "Police Chief Harold Medina described the three youths as friends who were on officers' radar about this time last year.",
      "Police said the recording includes audio in which the 15-year-old can be heard encouraging the 13-year-old, who they say was driving, to \"just bump him, brah.\" The video indicates the vehicle accelerated before it hit Habermehl, police said in Tuesday's statement.",
      "\"The front passenger, believed to be the 11-year-old who was waving a handgun, ducked and laughed as the front, passenger side of the vehicle struck Habermehl,\" police said in the statement.",
      "The statement continued, \"There were loud sounds, including metal flexing, as the momentum of the crash carried Habermehl and his bicycle on top, and off, the passenger side of the vehicle.\"",
      "The 13-year-old was taken into custody Monday. He was on juvenile probation, and probation officials were able to help police locate him, Medina said.",
      "The 15-year-old whom police are looking last year was suspected in doorbell thefts, participating in a $15,000 burglary of beer, alcohol and cigarettes, and a minor-injury shooting, police said."

They say their family members have been falsely accused and targeted because of their tattoos.",
      "The families also said they never expected their loved ones to be sent to a massive prison in El Salvador instead of their home country, Venezuela.",
      "The White House said in a statement Tuesday that it was \u201cconfident in DHS intelligence assessments on these gang affiliations and criminality,\u201d adding that the Venezuelan immigrants who were removed from the United States had final orders of deportation.",
      "\u201cThis administration is not going to ignore the rule of law,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Relatives of Mervin Yamarte, 29, said they were horrified to see him in a social media video showing men shackled as authorities dragged them from planes and shaved their heads in preparation to take them to prison.",
      "The men were sent to the Terrorism Confinement Center, a lockup known for allegations of human rights abuses. Human rights organizations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have documented issues including extreme overcrowding and torture at the prison.",

      "The official said that \u201cthe lack of specific information about each individual actually highlights the risk they pose\u201d and that the government does not have a \u201ccomplete profile\u201d of alleged gang members who were deported to El Salvador.",
      "Yamarte\u2019s family said that he had an open asylum case with a hearing set for July and that he does not have a criminal record and was not connected to Tren de Aragua.",
      "A check of criminal records in the city of Irving, Dallas County and the state of Texas, as well as federal court records, by NBC News did not find any charges or convictions for Yamarte.

      "Juan Yamarte said his brother has the same tattoo as a soccer player he admires and the number 99 \u2014 the number he has used as a member of a recreational soccer team. He also has tattoos of his mother\u2019s and daughter\u2019s names, as well as the date he and his partner began dating, another brother told Telemundo. None of his tattoos are gang-related, the family said.",
      "Juan Yamarte said his brother had been in the United States for more than a year before immigration officials took him last week at a home he shared with several other people.",
      "\u201cThey grabbed him. They cuffed him all at once when he said, \u2018Why are you taking me, too, if I haven\u2019t done anything?\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "On Monday, Yamarte\u2019s family and others in his hometown, Maracaibo, Venezuela, held a protest and a prayer vigil.",

      "She grew increasingly worried when she did not hear from him, and she began to scour the internet hoping to find a clue to where he could be. She said she spotted him in Bukele\u2019s video, which had gone viral on social media.",
      "De Jesus, 25, entered the United States through the CBP One app in June, along with three other relatives, his sister said. The three family members were released into the United States right away, but De Jesus was sent to an immigration detention center in New Orleans, where he remained until he was deported, she said. It is unclear why De Jesus was detained; his family believes it may have been because of his tattoos.",
      "\u201cThey detained him just because he has tattoos,\u201d De Jesus\u2019 sister said. \u201cFrom the beginning, they asked constantly about his tattoos. They would ask him if he was a member of the criminal gang, Tren de Aragua, and he always said no.\u201d",
      "She said none of her brother's tattoos are gang-affiliated. Some of the more prominent ones include rose art on his neck and arm, an angel on his chest and a tattoo that says \u201cmom\u201d on his chest.",

      "\u201cWith a pending asylum application and a trial, that would make absolutely no sense,\u201d Giardina said. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for years. That\u2019s not how it works.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe has been in proceedings for months. The government has never filed an I-213, which would indicate any criminal background. They have never filed any evidence of any kind of criminal history,\u201d Giardina said.",
      "Mirelys Casique told Telemundo her family recognized her son, Francisco Garc\u00eda Casique, in a photo released by the government of El Salvador. She said that while the man in the image was looking down, the family was able to identify him because of his tattoos.",

    "story": [
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2014 Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 political operation is making calls urging state lobbyists not to support Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., whose 2026 bid for governor has already socked away more than $3 million \u2014 much of which has come from President Donald Trump\u2019s donors.",
      "The calls, according to seven people familiar with the effort who requested anonymity to speak freely, are attempts to curb any potential contributions from mostly Tallahassee-based lobbyists to Donalds\u2019 campaign.",
      "Donalds, who represents a southwest Florida district, announced his Trump-backed bid for governor last month, but there remains the prospect that DeSantis\u2019 wife, Casey, could also jump in the race, which would set up a heavyweight GOP primary and continue the long-running political proxy war between Trump and DeSantis.",
      "\u201cThey are becoming a lot more aggressive as this thing progresses,\u201d a veteran Republican lobbyist who received one of the calls said. \u201cThere are no threats or anything direct like that, but come on. When you get a call from the governor, or anyone around them, in this sort of context, it\u2019s a message-sender.\u201d",
      "Florida is three weeks into its state legislative session, when the same lobbyists DeSantis is urging not to support Donalds need DeSantis to sign bills into law for their clients.",
      "\u201cThere is a tension among many as they try to toe the line \u2014 signaling they are with Donalds, as many will, without incurring DeSantis\u2019 wrath,\u201d another longtime Republican Florida lobbyist said.",
      "\u201cA term we keep hearing is \u2018keep your powder dry,\u2019\u201d the person said of how the request not to donate to Donalds is being framed.",
      "Both DeSantis and Taryn Fenske, one of his top political staffers, have made some of the calls, according to one of the sources familiar with them. Fenske did not reply to a request seeking comment.",
      "Casey DeSantis has not yet said whether she plans to formally run for governor in 2026, but her husband has increasingly hyped her as a key part of his administration\u2019s success, and she has done nothing to publicly swat down the idea of a campaign when reporters have asked her about it.",
      "\u201cWhen you come to a fork in the road, take it,\u201d she said last month, borrowing a cryptic turn of phrase from baseball legend Yogi Berra.",
      "NBC News reported last month that Casey DeSantis was seriously considering running to replace her husband. A spokeswoman for the governor\u2019s political operation did not reply to a request for comment.",
      "DeSantis in the past has relied on a pressure campaign of Tallahassee lobbyists to help fund his political ambitions. During the 2024 presidential contest, his former chief of staff James Uthmeier \u2014 who is now the state's attorney general \u2014\u00a0organized government staffers to solicit contributions for DeSantis\u2019 campaign from lobbyists, a highly unusual arrangement.",
      "This time, no taxpayer-funded staff members are involved in the efforts.",
      "Though supporters of both sides of the potential GOP primary have aggressively attacked the other candidate on social media, outside of some early tension, neither side has really addressed the other. When he has been asked, Donalds has praised the job DeSantis has done as governor.",
      "Donalds has quickly amassed a $3.1 million state-level war chest, bolstered by $1.2 million in transfers from his federal congressional account and some notable donors from Trump\u2019s fundraising network, according to public records. Illinois billionaire Richard Uihlein has contributed $1 million; Clive Fields, a Texas-based health care executive who was a DeSantis donor in the 2024 presidential primaries before he supported Trump, donated $500,000; and Deborah Magowan, the widow of former San Francisco Giants owner Peter Magowan, kicked in $150,000.",
      "In addition, Donalds continues to have a separate federal super PAC called Sunshine State Future Fund. It has been relatively dormant, according to campaign finance records, but it has not had to disclose any contributions yet this year.",
      "Florida election law generally allows federal super PACs to transfer money to benefit state candidate-aligned political committees, meaning it can offer a more covert way for donors to give to Donalds without the contributions\u2019 immediately becoming public. The next quarterly super PAC filing deadline is not until April 15.",
      "Meanwhile, a state-level political committee associated with DeSantis\u2019 political operation has $2.1 million cash on hand, according to state campaign finance records.",
      "Donalds and DeSantis were once close political allies, but they had a falling-out when Donalds endorsed Trump in the presidential primaries last year.",
      "DeSantis has so far publicly framed his wife\u2019s potential bid to replace him as a way to maintain and build on their family legacy in the Governor\u2019s Mansion.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s somebody that has, I think, the intestinal fortitude and the dedication to conservative principles,\u201d DeSantis told reporters last month of his wife. \u201cAnything we have accomplished, she\u2019d be able to take to the next level.\u201d"

      "U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes of Washington, D.C., ruled that the ban violates the equal protection clause because it discriminates based on transgender status and sex.",
      "Reyes said the ban \u201cis soaked in animus.\u201d",
      "\u201cIts language is unabashedly demeaning, its policy stigmatizes transgender persons as inherently unfit, and its conclusions bear no relation to fact,\u201d she wrote.",
      "She added, \u201cIndeed, the cruel irony is that thousands of transgender servicemembers have sacrificed \u2014 some risking their lives \u2014 to ensure for others the very equal protection rights the Military Ban seeks to deny them.\u201d",
      "Reyes delayed the effect of her preliminary injunction until Friday to give the administration time to appeal it. She added in her order that the government \u201ccould have crafted a policy that balances the Nation\u2019s need for a prepared military and Americans\u2019 right to equal protection.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey still can,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Military Ban, however, is not that policy. The Court therefore must act to uphold the equal protection rights that the military defends every day.\u201d",

      "Shannon Minter, legal director for the National Center for Lesbian Rights, which is representing several trans service members and trans people who want to enlist in a lawsuit, said Reyes acted quickly \u201cto shield our troops from the harmful effects of this irrational ban.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe ban\u2019s harmful impact and rushed implementation show that it was motivated by prejudice,\u201d Minter said in a statement. \u201cOur plaintiffs include lifelong military personnel who served in combat in Afghanistan, come from multi-generation military families, and have received honors like the Bronze Star. This ban is unjustifiable and attacks brave servicemembers, recruits, and families who sacrifice so much for our country.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s order goes much further than a similar policy he issued during his first term, which prohibited trans people from enlisting and allowed those already serving to continue doing so in a manner consistent with their gender identities and continue receiving transition-related medical care if they came out before the ban. Service members who came out after it were not allowed to receive such medical care and had to continue serving in a manner consistent with their assigned sexes at birth.",
      "The new policy prohibits trans people from enlisting and requires the military to identify all trans service members who have \u201ca current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria,\u201d which is the medical term for the severe emotional distress caused by the misalignment between one\u2019s gender identity and birth sex, according to a memo the Defense Department filed in the lawsuit last week.",
      "Those identified by the Pentagon will be disqualified from service and must be removed from their jobs. They will receive honorable separations unless their records reflect otherwise, according to the memo.",
      "In January, two national LGBTQ legal organizations, GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders and the the National Center for Lesbian Rights, filed suit against Trump\u2019s executive order on behalf of six active-duty trans service members and two trans people seeking to enlist. They argued that the ban discriminates against trans people and \u201creflects animosity toward transgender people because of their transgender status.\u201d",
      "The order, the lawsuit said, declared that being trans fundamentally \u201cconflicts with a soldier\u2019s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one\u2019s personal life.\u201d",
      "The order said, \u201cA man\u2019s assertion that he is a woman, and his requirement that others honor this falsehood, is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member.\u201d",
      "Reyes pushed Justice Department attorney Jason C. Lynch on that language during preliminary hearings last month, asking repeatedly whether he believed it showed animus against the trans community.",
      "\u201cWould it be fair to say that excluding a group of people from military service based on unsupported assertions that they are liars, immodest, lack integrity, are undisciplined and are dishonorable, would you agree with me that \u2014 particularly where there\u2019s no support for any of those assertions \u2014 that that is animated by animus?\u201d Reyes asked Lynch, who declined to answer.",
      "Multiple Defense Department memos also say enlisted service members will be required to use pronouns and salutations, such as \u201csir\u201d and \u201cma\u2019am,\u201d that align with their birth sexes. Reyes pressed Lynch about how pronoun usage affects military readiness.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t \u2014\u201d Lynch said, before the judge interrupted him.",
      "\u201cBecause it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Reyes said. \u201cBecause any commonsense rational human being understands that it doesn\u2019t.\u201d"

      "More than 60 years after President John F. Kennedy was gunned down in Dallas, the federal government on Tuesday began releasing what could be the final trove of documents delving into the assassination that shocked the nation and spawned countless conspiracy theories.",
      "The National Archives and Records Administration started posting the long-awaited files just before 7 p.m. \u2014 a day after President Donald Trump announced that 80,000 pages related to the fatal shooting on Nov. 22, 1963, were about to be released.",
      "\u201cIn accordance with President\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s directive of March 17, 2025, all records previously withheld for classification\u00a0that are part of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection are released,\" the administration's statement read.",
      "Within minutes, thousands of documents that had been hidden from the public for decades appeared on the site.",
      "It wasn\u2019t immediately clear whether the trove of documents contains any bombshells or evidence to counter the conclusion the Warren Commission reached in 1964 that a lone gunman named Lee Harvey Oswald fired the fatal shots from the Texas Schoolbook Depository.",
      "\u201cYou got a lot of reading,\u201d Trump said Monday as he visited the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington. \u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019re going to redact anything.\u201d",
      "Trump was cagey about what would be in those files. Historians contend that around 4,700 documents haven't yet been released.",
      "\"The origins of the 80,000 pages of material are unknown,\" Jefferson Morley, an expert on the JFK assassination and the CIA, wrote on his \u201cJFK Facts\u201d blog before the new batch of documents was released.",
      "Justice Department lawyers worked all night to review hundreds of pages of classified documents before they were released, a person familiar with the matter told NBC News.",
      "It also remained to be seen whether the document drop would finally put to rest the widespread public skepticism of the government's official explanation that Oswald acted alone.",
      "\u201cPeople have so many doubts,\u201d presidential historian Michael Beschloss said. \u201cThere are so many theories that are conflicting. It\u2019s very hard for me to imagine that there will be one piece of evidence that will make everyone agree on what happened here. What most people do agree is that the killing of John Kennedy changed history, and mainly in a bad way.\u201d",
      "When Trump was campaigning last year and trying to win the endorsement of JFK's nephew Robert F. Kennedy Jr., he renewed his promise to release the files.",
      "Hours after he snagged RFK Jr.'s endorsement in August, Trump vowed that if elected, he would establish a commission on assassination attempts in honor of RFK Jr., who is now his secretary of health and human services.",
      "Shortly after he began his second term, Trump signed an executive order mandating the release of all records related to President Kennedy's assassination, as well as the 1968 assassinations of RFK Jr.\u2019s father, Sen. Robert F. Kennedy Sr., and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.",
      "Under the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, all the documents related to the assassination were supposed to have been released by 2017, when Trump was president the first time.",
      "Trump released some JFK-related documents then, but he also gave the intelligence agencies more time to assess the remaining files.",
      "It wasn't until December 2022 that President Joe Biden released more than 13,000\u00a0records after the\u00a0Mary Ferrell Foundation, the country\u2019s largest nonprofit repository of JFK assassination records,\u00a0sued the administration to make all the documents public.",
      "But Biden released only about 98% of all the documents related to the killing that remained in the National Archives, which controls the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s high time that the government got its act together and obeyed the spirit and the letter of the law,\u201d Morley, who is also the vice president of the nonpartisan Mary Ferrell Foundation, said at the time.",
      "\u201cThis is about our history and our right to know it,\u201d he said.",
      "The 4,700 or so records that were kept under wraps\u00a0were believed to have included more information about accused Oswald's sojourn in Mexico City before the assassination.",
      "Among those documents were 44 related to CIA agent George Joannides and a covert Cuba-related program he ran that came into contact with Oswald less than four months before Kennedy was shot, according to calculations made by JFK researchers with the\u00a0Mary Ferrell Foundation.",
      "In a memorandum\u00a0explaining why some documents weren\u2019t being released, Biden noted that the records act \u201cpermits the continued postponement of disclosure of information ... only when postponement remains necessary to protect against an identifiable harm to the military defense, intelligence operations, law enforcement, or the conduct of foreign relations that is of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest in disclosure.\u201d",
      "Prominent historians didn't buy that explanation.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re 59 years after President John Kennedy was killed, and there\u2019s just no justification for this,\u201d U.S. District Judge John Tunheim, who chaired the Assassination Records Review Board from 1994 to 1998, said when Biden released the records."

      "SAN ANTONIO \u2014 Two smugglers charged after 53 immigrants died in the back of a sweltering tractor-trailer with no air conditioning were found guilty Tuesday after a two-week trial. The 2022 tragedy in San Antonio was the nation\u2019s deadliest smuggling attempt across the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "Jurors in federal court in San Antonio took only about an hour to convict Felipe Orduna-Torres and Armando Gonzales-Ortega, finding that they were part of a human smuggling conspiracy that resulted in death and injury. They face up to life in prison and have a June 27 sentencing date.",
      "The immigrants had come from Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico and had paid between $12,000 and $15,000 each to be smuggled into the United States, according to an indictment in the case. They had made it as far as the Texas border city of Laredo when they were placed into a tractor-trailer with broken air conditioning for a three-hour drive to San Antonio.",
      "As the temperature inside the trailer rose, those inside screamed and banged the walls of the trailer for help or tried to claw their way out, investigators said. Most eventually passed out. When the trailer was opened in San Antonio, 48 people were already dead. Another 16 were taken to hospitals, where five more died. The dead included six children and a pregnant woman.",
      "\u201cThese defendants knew the air conditioning did not work. Nevertheless they disregarded the danger,\u201d Acting U.S. Attorney Margaret Leachman for the Western District of Texas said in a news conference after the verdict Tuesday. Orduna-Torres was the leader of the smuggling group inside the U.S., and Gonzales-Ortega was his \u201cright-hand man\u201d she said.",
      "Five men previously pleaded guilty to felony charges in the smuggling case, including the truck driver Homero Zamorano Jr., who was found hiding near the trailer in some bushes. He faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.",
      "Also pleading guilty are Christian Martinez, Luis Alberto Rivera-Leal, Riley Covarrubias-Ponce and Juan Francisco D\u2019Luna Bilbao. All five will be sentenced later this year. Another person charged in the U.S. remains a fugitive, Leachman said. Several others have been charged in Mexico and Guatemala.",
      "The incident is the deadliest among tragedies that have claimed thousands of lives in recent decades as people attempt to cross the U.S. border from Mexico. Ten immigrants died in 2017 after they were trapped inside a truck parked at a Walmart in San Antonio. In 2003, the bodies of 19 immigrants were found in a sweltering truck southeast of San Antonio."

      "Holding out for a bargain on your next car purchase or a major repair? Don\u2019t, experts say.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum took hold last week, and the monthlong reprieve he offered U.S. automakers from his 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada ends April 2, threatening to drive up costs for vehicles and auto parts in coming weeks.",
      "\u201cThere is no way you\u2019re going to see a better discount if you wait three months,\u201d said Ivan Drury, director of insights at Edmunds. \u201cThat\u2019s guaranteed.\u201d",
      "Concerns about imminent price hikes come just as the auto market shows signs of stabilizing. The latest consumer price index showed new vehicle costs down 0.3% last month from the year before and those for used cars and trucks 0.8% higher over the same period \u2014 both far lower than the 2.8% annual inflation rate overall.",
      "Those trends aren\u2019t likely to last, analysts warn. Tariffs are expected to drive up auto costs by $4,000 to as much as $12,500 depending on vehicle, engine type and country of origin, according to the Anderson Economic Group, a consultancy that represents automakers and dealers.",
      "It isn\u2019t just U.S. car brands like those made by Ford, General Motors or Jeep producer Stellantis that are set to be affected, the group said. Honda, Toyota, Audi and BMW are among the foreign automakers with extensive production in North America that could raise prices, too.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re potentially undermining one of the most important elements of the U.S. economy, which is our ability to manufacture products in the United States using parts from Canada [and] Mexico,\u201d Patrick Anderson, the firm\u2019s CEO and founder, said of White House trade policies. It remains to be seen whether tariffs \u201cend up causing more damage than benefit,\u201d he said, but already, \u201cwe\u2019ve rattled consumers.\u201d",
      "A White House spokesperson didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Many drivers are already stressed about potential car purchases. The share of consumers who expect to be rejected for auto loans hit 33.5% in the latest New York Federal Reserve survey, the highest in its 12-year history. People in the market for new North American-built vehicles could also face an availability crunch, experts say. A recent forecast from S&P Global Mobility predicted regional production could drop by as much as 20,000 units per day within a week of the Canada and Mexico tariffs\u2019 taking effect.",
      "\u201cIf you have a tariff situation that changes your inputs in the vehicle, you\u2019re naturally going to want to find that mix \u2014 between the vehicle content that is most appealing to consumers and knowing that it\u2019s going to cost them more,\u201d said Stephanie Brinley, an automotive analyst at S&P Global Mobility. For automakers, she said, the question is: \u201cHow do you protect margins, and how do you work through that?\u201d",
      "Many of the perks available to prospective buyers could dry up soon, experts said, as manufacturers and dealerships start trimming rebates, financing promotions and other offers as they look to offset higher costs.",
      "\u201cYou could even see incentives being pulled back, like a $3,000 cash back offer that could go away immediately, overnight,\u201d Drury said.",
      "He and Anderson both said they expect used vehicles\u2019 price to rise, as well, in part because auto lessees wary of purchasing tariff-inflated vehicles will hold on to their leased wheels for longer. While that would boost the values of well-maintained vehicles already on the road, it would also tighten up used vehicle inventories, Drury said, potentially re-creating the lopsided pandemic-era market.",
      "There\u2019s not much U.S. consumers can do to mitigate the ripple effects, industry analysts said, given the broad-based nature of the tariffs and the chill they threaten to create among automakers. But it will help to know where your vehicle is made and which components are imported versus manufactured stateside, Drury said. He suggested consumers keep on hand the American Automobile Labeling Act report, a document the Transportation Department publishes annually that lists every vehicle model along with the origins of its composition.",
      "\u201cIt should give somewhat of a guidance, because you cannot assume the badge on the hood matches your expectation [of] where it\u2019s made,\u201d Drury said. \u201cThere\u2019s no vehicle where every single component is manufactured from the ground up in the United States.\u201d",
      "Brinley cautioned consumers against trying to \u201cgame\u201d tariffs by compromising on what they actually need. While trade duties are widely expected to fuel price hikes throughout the auto market, completely rewriting your goals for such an important purchase could end up costing more, she said.",
      "\u201cBuying something that doesn\u2019t fit your life, is the wrong size and doesn\u2019t work for you because you perceive the tariff impacts to be lower may not actually improve your life,\u201d Brinley said.",
      "You may need to adjust your budget, but \u201cin some ways,\u201d she said, \u201cshop as you always have.\u201d"

      "House leaders have yet to appoint board members to an independent office designed to investigate ethics complaints against lawmakers and their staff members, leaving the entity powerless for the time being and sparking concerns among outside watchdogs.",
      "The House rules package for the new Congress, which was approved in January along party lines, re-authorized the nonpartisan Office of Congressional Ethics and gave it a new name: the Office of Congressional Conduct.",
      "But more than two months later, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., who have the authority to fill the board seats, have yet to do so.",
      "Without a board in place, professional staff members are not authorized to launch investigations. If the seats remain unfilled by Saturday, it will mark the longest the office has had a vacant board since it was formed in 2008.",
      "A spokesman said Johnson will be \u201cworking through the appointments process.\u201d A spokeswoman for Jeffries declined to comment.",
      "Four of the six board members from last year are willing to be re-appointed, according to two sources familiar with the situation, while the most recent chair and co-chair do not intend to return.",
      "Kedric Payne, the former deputy chief counsel for the congressional ethics office, said he feared the vacancies at the board could lead to its eventual demise.",
      "\u201cWhen you see that the board isn\u2019t approved and then you add that to the fact that the Trump administration has dismantled all of the independent ethics bodies across the executive branch, it does cause concern that that may be the game plan that\u2019s going on in Congress,\u201d said Payne, who is now senior director of ethics for the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center.",
      "The Office of Congressional Ethics was established 15 years ago as an independent, nonpartisan entity charged with investigating allegations of ethical violations by members of the House, officers and employees. It investigates complaints, which could come from the public, the board or staff members, and when warranted it refers its findings to the House Ethics Committee, which can determine penalties or enforcement based on its review.",
      "The office also has the ability to publish its reports to provide the public insight into the evidence it has collected.",
      "The Office of Congressional Ethics has been a target of Republicans in the past. In January 2023, the GOP-authored House rules package included term limits and a number of changes to the office\u2019s staffing that some Democrats warned would weaken it.",
      "Payne argued the nonpartisan nature of the office separates it from the House Ethics Committee, which is bipartisan and has the power to conduct its own investigations but is made up of sitting members of the House. (It also took Johnson some time to appoint members to the Ethics Committee this year, as he finalized the committee roster only last week.)",
      "Each stage of any Office of Congressional Ethics investigation must be approved by the nonpartisan board, made up of six voting members and two alternates. Members of the board are private citizens and cannot be lobbyists or federal employees. They must also agree not to run for office.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t have the fox guarding the henhouse,\u201d Payne said.\u00a0 \u201cEverybody understands that. So the members of the House Ethics Committee are under political pressure from the speaker of the House to other members of the House, so they are not going to aggressively investigate one another.\u201d",
      "Payne pointed to the investigation of former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., which the Office of Congressional Ethics was not involved with. There was intense pressure from political leaders to prevent the House Ethics Committee report from being released, but the committee ultimately relented after intense scrutiny from the public.",
      "The episode caused a serious strain on the Ethics Committee, sparking concerns about its ability to properly function in the future.",
      "\u201cMatt Gaetz was not universally liked. You can imagine a situation where a more charismatic member of Congress was the subject of an investigation,\u201d Payne said. \u201cThey could hide any wrongdoing or an embarrassing report.\u201d"

      "Federal authorities said filmmaker Carl Erik Rinsch was arrested Tuesday over charges he defrauded streaming giant Netflix out of $11 million in connection with a science fiction series he never completed.",
      "Prosecutors didn\u2019t name Netflix in the indictment or the news release. But the dispute between Rinsch, 47, and Netflix has been well publicized since The New York Times first reported on the allegations against the filmmaker in a November 2023 article.",
      "In 2018 and 2019, Netflix, which is referred to only as \u201ca subscription video on-demand streaming service\u201d by prosecutors, paid $44 million to Rinsch\u2019s company for the filmmaker\u2019s unproduced show, \u201cWhite Horse,\u201d according to the indictment.",
      "Though Rinsch is a relatively unknown filmmaker \u2014 having helmed only one movie, titled \u201c47 Ronin\u201d \u2014\u00a0there was a competitive auction for the project, according to the Times. Rinsch\u2019s pitch was for a science-fiction series about artificial humans.",
      "In March 2020, Netflix sent Rinsch\u2019s company an additional $11 million after he claimed the initial amount was \u201cnot sufficient\u201d to complete the series, according to the indictment.",
      "However, Rinsch did not use those funds to complete \"White Horse,\" prosecutors said. He never delivered any episodes of the show, which Netflix had renamed \u201cConquest.\u201d",
      "Instead, Rinsch transferred \u201cthe funds he received through a number of different bank accounts before consolidating them in a personal brokerage account,\u201d prosecutors said in a news release. He then \u201cused those funds to make a number of personal and speculative purchases of securities,\u201d they said.",
      "\u201cHis trading was unsuccessful,\u201d prosecutors said, noting that in \u201cless than two months\u201d he lost half of the $11 million Netflix had given him. He then used the remaining money \u201cto speculate on cryptocurrency, and on personal expenses and luxury items,\u201d including legal fees related to his case against Netflix and his divorce; $3.787 million on \u201cfurniture and antiques\u201d; $2.417 million for \u201cfive Rolls-Royces and one Ferrari\u201d; and \u201capproximately $652,000 on watches and clothing,\u201d prosecutors said.",
      "Rinsch \u201cnever returned the fraudulently obtained funds,\u201d according to the indictment. The streaming giant reportedly canceled the show in early 2021.",
      "\u201cAs alleged, Carl Erik Rinsch orchestrated a scheme to steal millions by soliciting a large investment from a video streaming service, claiming that money would be used to finance a television show that he was creating,\u201d acting U.S. Attorney Matthew Podolsky said in a statement. \u201cBut that was fiction.\u201d",
      "Podolsky continued, \u201cRinsch\u2019s arrest is a reminder that this Office and our partners at the FBI remain vigilant in the fight against fraud and will bring those who cheat and steal to justice.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for Netflix declined to comment.",
      "It is unclear if Rinsch has legal representation. A talent agent for Rinsch did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Rinsch, who was arrested in West Hollywood, California, is being charged with one count of wire fraud, one count of money laundering and five counts of engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity, according to the news release. The Complex Frauds and Cybercrime is prosecuting the case.",
      "The arrest comes less than a year after an arbitrator awarded Netflix $8.8 million in damages over arbitration initiated by Rinsch, who alleged the streaming giant had breached their contract and owed him at least $14 million.",
      "But Rita Miller, a former Los Angeles Superior Court judge, ruled that none of the purchases were necessary for the production, according to The New York Times. NBC News has not reviewed a copy of Miller\u2019s ruling, which was reported in May."

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/trump-admin-considers-giving-nato-command-exclusively-american-eisenho-rcna196503",
    "published": "Tue, 18 Mar 2025 21:18:57 GMT",
    "summary": "The command has been an exclusively American honor and responsibility since Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower became the first person in the job.",
    "story": [
      "For nearly 75 years, it has been a distinctly American responsibility to have a four-star U.S. general oversee all NATO military operations in Europe \u2014 a command that began with then-World War II hero and future president Dwight D. Eisenhower.",
      "But the Trump administration, according to two defense officials familiar with the planning and a Pentagon briefing reviewed by NBC News, is considering changing that.",
      "The Pentagon is undertaking a significant restructuring of the U.S. military\u2019s combatant commands and headquarters. And one of the plans under consideration, the two defense officials said, would involve the U.S. giving up the role of NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe \u2014 known within military parlance as the SACEUR. The general now in this role, who also serves as the head of U.S. European Command,\u00a0has been the primary commander overseeing support to\u00a0Ukraine in its war against Russia. It is not clear how long such a reorganization could take, and it could by modified by the time it is complete. Congress could also weigh in, using the power of the purse should members oppose any aspect of the initiative.",
      "Giving up SACEUR would, if nothing else, be a major symbolic shift in the balance of power in NATO, the alliance that has defined European security and peace since World War II.",
      "\u201cFor the United States to give up the role of supreme allied commander of NATO would be seen in Europe as a significant signal of walking away from the alliance,\u201d retired Adm. James Stavridis, who served as SACEUR and head of European Command from 2009 to 2013, said in an email.",
      "\u201cIt would be a political mistake of epic proportion, and once we give it up, they are not going to give it back,\" he wrote. \"We would lose an enormous amount of influence within NATO, and this would be seen, correctly, as probably the first step toward leaving the Alliance altogether.\u201d",
      "Since Eisenhower inaugurated the position, it has been held by some of the country\u2019s most prominent military leaders. In addition to Stavridis, they include Alexander Haig, who was also chief of staff to two presidents and secretary of state for a third; John Shalikashvili, who became chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and Wesley Clark, who was a candidate for the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination.",
      "The proposed restructuring comes as the Trump administration has cut spending and staff across the federal government. And President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have made clear that the new administration wants European partners to take more responsibility for Europe\u2019s defense. If the U.S. does give up SACEUR, the other NATO nations would likely have to choose among themselves which country would put forward the commander.",
      "Trump has repeatedly criticized NATO members for not meeting a goal the alliance has set for the percentage of GDP each country should spend on defense. As NBC News previously reported, he is also considering a major policy shift under which the U.S. might not defend a fellow NATO member if it is attacked \u2014 a core tenet of the alliance \u2014 if the country doesn\u2019t meet the defense spending threshold.",
      "The timeline for the SACEUR move, if it does happen, is as yet undetermined. Army Gen. Chris Cavoli, the current SACEUR, is on a three-year tour due to end this summer.",
      "Five\u00a0of the military\u2019s 11 combatant commands could be\u00a0consolidated\u00a0under the plan being discussed,\u00a0the two defense officials familiar with the planning\u00a0said.",
      "The Defense Department did not reply to a request for comment.",
      "The massive restructuring plan\u00a0under consideration could also include two potential changes previously reported by NBC News: the consolidation of\u00a0U.S. European Command and U.S. Africa Command into one command based in Stuttgart,\u00a0Germany,\u00a0as well as\u00a0the\u00a0shuttering\u00a0of\u00a0U.S. Southern Command headquarters in Florida\u00a0in order to combine\u00a0it with U.S. Northern Command.",
      "Combining the commands\u00a0would\u00a0allow the military to save money by reducing staff with overlapping responsibilities, according to officials familiar with the planning. If all of the changes being considered are implemented, up to $270 million could be saved in the first year, according to a Pentagon briefing reviewed by NBC News. That savings would amount to roughly 0.03% of the Defense Department\u2019s $850 billion annual budget.",
      "A potential reorganization of this nature, being considered\u00a0two months\u00a0into the administration, appears to be motivated by cost-cutting, not a comprehensive new military strategy, said Ben Hodges, a retired Army three-star general who last served as the Army\u2019s senior commander in Europe.",
      "The contemplated moves in Europe\u00a0may\u00a0reduce American influence there, as the U.S.\u00a0could lose\u00a0some access to key naval and air bases in Italy, Germany, Poland and Spain \u2014 bases that benefit the U.S. by putting them closer to potential missions and giving them more influence with and access to regional military officials, not only\u00a0its\u00a0allies, Hodges said.",
      "\u201cWhen you start reducing capabilities of headquarters that do planning and intelligence \u2014 that only hurts us,\u201d Hodges told NBC News. \u201cWhat strategic analysis led them to want to do this? This has happened so early that this clearly smells like a cost-cutting thing than a strategic analysis.\u201d",
      "Combining the commands in Europe and Africa could be problematic because the regions are too massive and present myriad issues, Stavridis said in an email. They had been combined until Africa Command was created in 2007 under President George W. Bush for those reasons.",
      "\u201cCombining US European command and US Africa command into a single unit, creates a mega combatant command that really is too large for any single person to manage realistically,\u201d he wrote. \u201cToo many countries, too many people, too many disparate issues. When they were combined, before I was US European Command, there were two four-stars assigned to the command because of this. We are better off having these two commands separated and having high-quality individual four-star officers focused on leading each of them individually.\u201d",
      "But Stavridis, who is also the former commander of Southern Command, added\u00a0that he believes combining Southern Command and Northern Command \u201cmakes a great deal of sense.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe span of control is smaller and the efficiencies gained are greater,\u201d he said.",
      "If the Pentagon does decide to combine AFRICOM and EUCOM into one command, it will be part of the justification for eliminating the SACEUR role, the two defense officials said, because overseeing an area that large is already a big enough job for one person without that person also overseeing NATO military operations.",
      "Closing geographic commands introduces political risk, as some nations could feel the U.S. has deprioritized them. It also leaves combatant commanders with\u00a0large geographic areas\u00a0of responsibility that could make them more vulnerable, according to\u00a0the\u00a0Pentagon briefing\u00a0that NBC News reviewed.",
      "The\u00a0cost-saving plans\u00a0also include potentially moving hundreds of Pentagon-based Joint Staff employees to a military installation in Suffolk, Virginia. The Joint Staff is\u00a0currently\u00a0made up of eight\u00a0directorates,\u00a0or divisions, each with a different focus area.",
      "J7, a Joint Staff Directorate that oversees Joint Force Development, training and education, could be eliminated entirely. While the military services\u00a0\u2014 the Army, the Navy, the Marines, the Air Force, the Space Force and the Coast Guard \u2014\u00a0are\u00a0each\u00a0responsible for their own training, that directorate is in charge of bringing the services together to train so they will be ready to integrate in a combat\u00a0situation.",
      "Roughly 375 civilians could be fired, primarily those working in plans, cyber and joint force development, according to\u00a0the Pentagon briefing. The 350 military personnel\u00a0working in J-7 would be reassigned.",
      "Roughly half of the staff from five other directorates \u2014 manpower and personnel (J1), logistics (J4), strategy, plans and policy (J5), cyber (J6), and force structure, resources and assessment (J8) \u2014 would then move\u00a0from the Pentagon to Suffolk.",
      "The plan acknowledges some potential costs for moving people to\u00a0a\u00a0new location but assesses\u00a0overall long-term savings\u00a0of about $470 million over the next five years.",
      "U.S. Space Command could\u00a0also see\u00a0its\u00a0missile defense component command eliminated\u00a0in the restructuring.",
      "The Defense Department\u00a0briefing\u00a0argues that the\u00a0missile defense\u00a0mission is already\u00a0fulfilled by the services and other combatant commands, and as a result can be eliminated without affecting operations. But the closures will likely involve a loss of expertise, the\u00a0briefing\u00a0warns.",
      "Separate from the $270 million in cost-cutting, the U.S. is\u00a0also likely to halt\u00a0a\u00a0planned expansion of U.S. Forces Japan, which would save about $1.18 billion.",
      "The\u00a0briefing\u00a0reviewed by NBC News acknowledges that there is political risk with Japan in reversing\u00a0that expansion\u00a0and\u00a0that\u00a0it could result in reduced command and control west of the international dateline."

    "story": [
      "Denver Mayor Mike Johnston blasted the Trump administration for conducting what he said is \"Soviet-style political persecution of political dissidents\" by arresting a high-profile Colorado immigration advocate.",
      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested Jeanette Vizguerra, who is undocumented, outside her job at a Target in Aurora on Monday. Vizguerra, a mother of four and a grandmother, gained prominence in 2017 when she took refuge in churches during the last Trump administration, when places of worship were off-limits for arrests by immigration enforcement officers.",
      "In his second term in the White House, President Donald Trump has revoked that policy and now allows arrests at schools, houses of worship or hospital facilities.",
      "Johnston compared Vizguerra's arrest to Soviet political persecutions \"under the guise of immigration enforcement\" at a morning news conference. He made similar remarks on social media, calling it \"Putin-style\" political persecution.",
      "\"This is a mom of American citizens, who works at Target and has started a community nonprofit. This is not something that makes our community safer, in my mind. I think it makes our community more lawless,\" Johnston said.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security and ICE did not respond to emailed questions about Vizguerra's arrest.",
      "Vizguerra has been an activist against detention and deportation for years after having taken refuge in the churches in 2017. Her activities have included protesting outside the Aurora detention center. She was named one of Time magazine's most influential people in 2017 for her immigration advocacy in an article written by actor America Ferrera.",
      "\"She shed blood, sweat and tears to become a business owner, striving to give her children more opportunities than she had. This is not a crime. This is the American Dream,\" Ferrera wrote.",
      "Vizguerra, a resident of Colorado for more than 30 years, also had worked as a labor organizer with the Service Employees International Union and volunteered with several groups, including the Aurora Neighborhood Watch Program and the Metro Denver Sanctuary Coalition, according to a news release issued by several community groups. She also founded community groups such as Dreamer's Mothers in Action-Colorado and Abolish ICE Denver, the release said.",
      "\"It is clear she is being targeted for her community organizing and critiques of the deportation system as well as her outspoken defense of human rights,\" it said.",
      "More recently, she had slowed her protesting and become more active in assisting in workshops teaching immigrants their rights, helping them make family plans in case of deportation and other activities, said Jordan Garcia, a spokesman for the American Friends Service Committee, for which she also volunteered. Three of her children are U.S. citizens, and one is a legal permanent resident.",
      "John Fabbricatore, a former ICE field director, celebrated Vizguerra\u2019s arrest. \"Finally!\" he wrote on X. \"The Biden administration kept me from deporting Jeanette Vizguerra 4 years ago. She should have been deported in 2009 as well. She hid in a church the first time Trump was President. She is a criminal, hates Trump, and is an open-borders, abolish-ICE advocate. Bye!!!!\"",
      "Vizguerra was convicted in 2009 of using fake documents. A judge issued a deportation order for her in 2011 but allowed her to remain as long as she checked in with ICE periodically. Nervous about what might happen under the first Trump administration, she took refuge in the Denver churches.",
      "Her arrest follows that of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University student and a legal resident who engaged in pro-Palestinian protests last summer. Khalil has said in court documents that he was targeted because of his constitutionally protected speech."

      "Have a question for the NBC News Politics Desk on the flurry of Trump administration moves, Elon Musk and DOGE\u2019s activity, what comes next on Capitol Hill, or our new poll?",

      "The gap within the gender gap",
      "In last year\u2019s presidential election, white voters made up an estimated 71% of the national electorate. That\u2019s a number that for decades has trended downward as the country\u2019s population has diversified, but it\u2019s still more than six times larger than the share of Black and Hispanic voters (11% each) and nearly 25 times that of Asian voters (3%).",
      "Typically, the white vote is understood as being Republican-friendly, with pronounced gender and education gaps.",
      "But there is a more useful \u2014 and revealing \u2014 way to understand the politics of white voters, something that is evident in the new NBC News poll. Call this the gap within the gap.",
      "It represents a layering of the education gap (which has exploded during the Trump era) on top of the more established gender gap. When these are combined, a gaping chasm emerges \u2014 and two specific groups come into focus.",
      "On one end are white men without four-year college degrees. This is a generally blue-collar demographic that is now deeply aligned with Trump and opposed to progressive politics. On the other end are white women with at least a four-year college degree. This is a more affluent demographic that has been racing leftward, particularly on cultural issues, and is squarely opposed to President Donald Trump.",
      "Both groups pack a formidable punch. Eighteen percent of all voters last year were non-college white men and 17% were college-educated white women. And they have come to exist in polar opposite political and cultural universes, each one unrelatable and probably unrecognizable to the other.",
      "This is captured vividly in the NBC News poll. Take a basic question: Do voters have a positive or negative view of Trump? Among all voters \u2014 regardless of race, gender or class \u2014 46% have a positive view and 49% a negative one. Among white voters only, Trump is a bit more popular: 52% have a positive opinion compared with 45% who have a negative opinion.",
      "Meanwhile, 69% of white men without a degree view Trump positively and just 28% see him negatively \u2014 a 41-point net-positive rating. And among white women with a degree, it\u2019s 29% positive and 67% negative \u2014 for a net-negative of 38 points. That adds up to a whopping 79-point net rating gap between these two groups when it comes to their perception of Trump.",

      "\u201cFor more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose,\u201d Roberts said in a statement.",

One of the greatest singers, songwriters and artists of all time, the 2025 iHeartRadio Icon: Mariah Carey.\u201d",
      "Carey thanked Cool J for his kind words in her speech, as well as Long and Kelly for their performances."

      "Only three episodes remain in the third season of \u201cThe White Lotus,\u201d and fans are amping up their quest for clues into which character will wind up dead in the water at the Thai resort.",
      "For avid watchers, everything on the show could be another tip \u2014 from the opening credits to the books the characters are reading.",
      "Jack Edwards, a British YouTuber with nearly 1.5 million subscribers watching his content about books, posted a TikTok earlier this month about the books in \u201cThe White Lotus\u201d and what they could signify for the characters who are reading them.",
      "More than 600,000 views on that TikTok later, Edwards tells TODAY.com he\u2019s continued to look for books in Season 3 so he can present his findings to his followers and other \u201cWhite Lotus\u201d fans.",
      "\u201cWhile it\u2019s not necessary to know what the books are or what they represent, it is added texture,\u201d Edwards says. \u201cThey\u2019re fun Easter eggs that give us an added insight into the characters that if you\u2019re eagl-eyed enough to spot \u2014 it\u2019s quite a thrilling experience to be able to hunt them down.\u201d",
      "Edwards has made other videos about the seeming intentionality of the books characters are reading in \"White Lotus\" Seasons 1 and 2.",
      "After spotting a few books throughout the first few episodes of Season 3, it was Episode 4 that many of the novels came into view \u2014 but some detective work on Edwards' part was required to find out which, he says.",
      "\u201cLet me just say Mike White doesn\u2019t make it easy for us, because these books are so obscure,\u201d Edwards says with a laugh, referring to the show\u2019s creator.",
      "The 26-year-old put his degree in English literature and his internet detective skills to the test to identify the books the characters in \u201cThe White Lotus\u201d have been reading.",
      "\u201cI always said that I thought my my English degree was just a long-term investment into being good at pub quizzes, but it turns out it\u2019s also good identifying books in \u2018The White Lotus,\u2019\u201d he says with a grin.",
      "Edwards says he appreciates the detail behind the props and wardrobe design on the show, because it allows viewers to think about what they are seeing each week, as opposed to binging the full season in one watch.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s something quite pleasant and satisfactory about having to linger on a show like this, where it\u2019s being rolled out weekly,\u201d Edwards says. \u201cI think maybe that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing so many theories and so much debate around what could possibly happen.\u201d",
      "Here are the books featured on Season 3 of \u201cThe White Lotus \u2014 and what could be in store for the characters based on what they\u2019re reading.",
      "'Hunger' by Knut Hamsun",
      "Lochlan (Sam Nivola) is reading one of the first books seen in Season 3. During Episode 4, Lochlan\u2019s older brother Saxon (Patrick Schwarzenegger) asks him what he\u2019s doing, and he replies that he\u2019s reading. Saxon responds, \u201cWhy?\u201d",
      "Edwards says the scene represents the difference between the two brothers. Even though they are siblings and had almost identical educations, one values reading and the other does not.",
      "\u201cOne of those characters wants to learn, is inquisitive, and the other one is the sort of nepo baby figure who has had everything handed to him on a plate,\u201d he says. \u201cSo even there, I think we can see a different dynamic in who is reading and who isn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "In the scene, Lochlan holds up the book, which Edwards says he watched frame by frame, trying to get a clear shot of the book. He  ultimately identified the cover as an Oxford World's Classics edition.",
      "\u201cSo I Googled, \u2018How many Oxford World\u2019s Classics are there?\u2019 and it was, like, a horror movie sound effect when I realized there were 929. But I am nothing if not committed to the bit, and I scrolled through them,\u201d he says, noting there is a full Oxford archive online.",
      "On the penultimate page, Edwards finally spotted one that looked familiar: \u201cHunger\u201d by Knut Hamsun.",
      "According to the book\u2019s description, \u201cHunger\u201d follows an aspiring writer as he tries to make ends meet in the city. The narrative becomes blurred as the voice of the narrator shifts between a level assessment of his situation and wild outbursts of anger and despair.",
      "\u201cWhen I was looking into it, it\u2019s about a young man who was trying to establish himself, but he does so with unease and sensitivity,\u201d Edwards says. \u201cAnd when I then thought about Lochlan\u2019s character, I was like, well, that completely adds up for who he is.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo it\u2019s actually quite intentional, I think who reads and who doesn\u2019t,\u201d he continues.",
      "'Surrounded by Narcissists' by Thomas Erikson",
      "Viewers first see Belinda (Natasha Rothwell) reading a book alone by the pool. But almost as soon as she picks it up, she puts it back down to go inside to research Greg (Jon Gries).",
      "When she puts the book down on her desk, Edwards was able to see part of the cover and the words \u201cSurrounded By,\u201d which he says was more than enough for him to narrow it down to \u201cSurrounded by Narcissists\u201d by Thomas Erikson.",
      "Erikson\u2019s book describes what qualities make up a narcissist, and teaches readers how to manage other people\u2019s narcissistic behaviors so they can pursue a happier life, the book\u2019s description reads.",
      "\u201cSo again, that feels like a very deliberate choice,\u201d he says. \u201cShe seems to be the person who is able to contextualize this hotel. As we\u2019re seeing it, it\u2019s the Full Moon Party in Thailand right now \u2014 it\u2019s a festival \u2014 and no one seems to be engaging with it at all, whereas Belinda is much more aware of her surroundings and the social hierarchies of the space she\u2019s in.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe can see that Belinda is much more self-aware than the rest of the characters about their kind of social status and where they exist within the hierarchy,\u201d he adds. \u201cSo I thought that was interesting, that she\u2019s reading \u2018Surrounded by Narcissists,\u2019 and it feels like a fun commentary for the people who notice.\u201d",
      "Belinda is seen reading the book again in Episode 5, as she\u2019s trying to relax in her room when she starts hearing a noise (which ends up being the lizard Pornchai chases out of her room).",
      "'The Beautiful and the Damned' by F. Scott Fitzgerald",
      "Parker Posey\u2019s character Victoria Ratliff reads F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s \u201cThe Beautiful and the Damned\u201d throughout Season 3 of the show.",
      "The meaning of the title can be taken literally in her character\u2019s case, Edwards says.",
      "\u201cThis family is beautiful, like those genes are strong,\u201d he says. \u201cBut from this episode, we can see this family was doomed.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Beautiful and the Damned\u201d is widely believed to have been based on Fitzgerald\u2019s relationship with his wife Zelda Fitzgerald. The book follows a 25-year-old Harvard graduate who falls deeply in love and enters into a reckless marriage. The pair live a life of decadence, thinking they will receive inheritance money, but their lifestyle ultimately leads to their ruin and the end of their marriage.",
      "\u201cThat book is about success and money and wealth and how relationships survive in times of difficulty,\u201d he says.",
      "The book is also about substance abuse \u2014 specifically alcoholism. \"I think we\u2019re seeing substance abuse being referenced a little bit more in the show. But again, it feels very deliberate,\" Edwards says.",
      "Chelsea's book",
      "Aimee Lou Wood's character Chelsea reads a book throughout the season, though Edwards says he hasn't been able to get a good enough view of the book to identify it.",
      "\u201cI need a few more clips of her reading. Every time I\u2019m like, \u2018Come on Mike. Give us another shot on the other side this time, please!\u2019 But I feel like they drip feed them throughout the series, so hopefully, next episode,\u201d he says. \u201cI just want you to know if they show a clip of her reading that book from the front, just know I\u2019m jumping for joy at home.\u201d",
      "Some Reddit users have hypothesized the book could be \u201cStart Where You Are: How to Accept Yourself and Others\u201d by Pema Chodron due to its light purple cover, but it is unclear if it\u2019s the exact book Chelsea is reading at this point in the season.",
      "According to the book's description, readers work with slogans and meditation practices to work on their inner pain and discover joy.",
      "Piper's book",
      "Piper (Sarah Catherine Hook) can be seen reading a book called \"The Loving Kindness\" in the third season as well, though Edwards thinks it may be a book created specifically for her character.",
      "In Episode 5, Piper reveals to her parents that she didn't actually want to go to Thailand to write her thesis \u2014 it's because she wants to move to the country to study under a monk.",
      "\u201cI think that it\u2019s a fake book, and that it\u2019s that it\u2019s meant to be the monk that she\u2019s studying,\u201d Edwards says. \u201cI think it's interesting that she\u2019s more willing to engage in text. It\u2019s more palatable when it\u2019s a book rather than the actual person who could challenge her.\u201d"

To the fans, you made these songs for the last couple decades into what they became so that we could do a three-and-a-half-hour set list.\u201d",

    "summary": "What happened to Haymitch Abernathy in \"The Hunger Games\"? Here's what to remember about the character before \"Sunrise on the Reaping.\"",
    "story": [
      "We know the story of Katniss Everdeen's time in the arena. Now, Suzanne Collins is telling the tale of how Katniss' mentor, Haymitch Abernathy, survived the Hunger Games \u2014 more than 20 years before Katniss' story begins.",
      "In \"Sunrise on the Reaping,\" the fifth book in the \"Hunger Games\" franchise, Collins chronicles the events of the 50th Hunger Games. The annual event sees children from the districts in the dystopian country of Panem fight to the death as entertainment for its Capitol \u2014\u00a0a punishment for a decades-old rebellion.",
      "The first \"Hunger Games\" book, which was published in 2008, follows the events of the 74th Hunger Games, when 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen from District 12 famously volunteered as tribute in her sister's place. The next two books in the series see her become a reluctant leader of a districtwide rebellion against the Capitol and face off against Panem's dictatorial president, Coriolanus Snow.",
      "Collins returned to Panem in 2020 with the book \"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes,\" which tells Snow's villain origin story against the backdrop of the 10th annual Hunger Games. It details how he turned the Games into a spectacle while mentoring District 12 tribute Lucy Gray Baird.",
      "\"Sunrise on the Reaping,\" out March 18, is Collins' second spinoff book of the \"Hunger Games\" trilogy.",
      "Here's what to remember before returning to the world of Panem.",
      "Who is Haymitch Abernathy?",
      "Haymitch Abernathy is introduced in the first \"Hunger Games\" book as the drunken mentor of Katniss and her male tribute counterpart, Peeta Mellark. As the only surviving victor from District 12, Haymitch is tasked with preparing Katniss and Peeta for the Games.",
      "In the first book, he travels with them to the Capitol, but he spends most of his time drinking. After Katniss fights back against his perceived indifference, he realizes her potential to succeed in the Games, and he helps Katniss and Peeta strategize.",
      "During the Games, he's also responsible for sending resources, including water and medicine, bought by sponsors to his tributes in the arena.",
      "While mentoring Katniss and Peeta, he gradually reveals things about his own traumatic experience in the 50th Games, also known as the Second Quarter Quell.",
      "What is a Quarter Quell?",
      "A Quarter Quell is a special version of the Hunger Games that comes around every 25 years. Each Quarter Quell brings a different twist. For Haymitch's Games, there were double the amount of tributes, making him one of four tributes reaped from District 12.",
      "The second \"Hunger Games\" book, \"Catching Fire,\" follows the third Quarter Quell, or the 75th Hunger Games. This time around, tributes were reaped from the pool of surviving victors. For District 12, that pool consists of Katniss, Peeta and Haymitch, guaranteeing the trilogy's heroine would go back into the arena. While Haymitch was named the male tribute by the luck of the draw, Peeta immediately volunteers to take his place.",
      "During \"Catching Fire,\" Haymitch again serves as Katniss and Peeta's mentor. But in the background, he also coordinates with District 13's underground resistance effort and undercover rebel Gamemaker Plutarch Heavensbee to rescue tributes from the arena.",
      "At the end of the book, Katniss finally learns of the conspiracy to start a second rebellion from Haymitch. In \"Mockingjay,\" he serves as one of the rebellion's leaders, providing unconditional support to Katniss as conflict between her and District 13's President Coin emerges.",
      "What happened during the 50th Hunger Games?",
      "Well, we're about to find out.",
      "The book's synopsis teases what's ahead for Haymitch.",
      "\"Haymitch Abernathy is trying not to think too hard about his chances,\" it reads. \"All he cares about is making it through the day and being with the girl he loves. When Haymitch\u2019s name is called, he can feel all his dreams break. He\u2019s torn from his family and his love, shuttled to the Capitol with the three other District 12 tributes: a young friend who\u2019s nearly a sister to him, a compulsive oddsmaker, and the most stuck-up girl in town. As the Games begin, Haymitch understands he\u2019s been set up to fail. But there\u2019s something in him that wants to fight ... and have that fight reverberate far beyond the deadly arena.\"",
      "Notably, the first three books allude to significant moments from Haymitch\u2019s time in the arena. In \"Catching Fire,\" Katniss and Peeta even watch tape from the 50th Hunger Games to prepare for the Third Quarter Quell.",
      "We learn that one of the female tributes from District 12 was a girl named Maysilee Donner, and she and Haymitch form an alliance at some point in the Games.",
      "Haymitch spends much of the Games exploring the edge of the arena, trying to see what lies at the end of it. When he finally reaches the edge, he finds a force field. That force field becomes his saving grace. He ultimately wins the Games after the only other remaining tribute throws an ax toward him and the edge of the arena \u2014 only for the weapon to rebound and kill her.",
      "After his time in the arena, we know his family and girlfriend are murdered by President Snow for his perceived defiance. He turns to alcohol to cope with the trauma and the consistent loss of the tributes he mentors in the Games until Katniss and Peeta's turn.",
      "At the end of \"Mockingjay,\" he returns to District 12 with Katniss and Peeta and takes up raising geese as the country of Panem rebuilds."

      "Critics are saying \"Adolescence\" is \"complete perfection\" and a harrowing, hard-to-watch that looks at the challenges and pitfalls young people face on the internet.",
      "The action kicks off straight away. Three minutes into Episode 1, the police barge into a seemingly normal home in England, guns at the ready.",
      "After passing by Jamie's parents \u2014 Manda Miller (Christine Tremarco), who drops to the ground in her bathrobe, and Eddie Miller (creator Stephen Graham) \u2014 the police arrest Jamie, still underneath the bed covers.",

      "What is Jamie accused of? And what could have pushed him toward it? Below, find out the inspiration behind this intense story.",
      "Is 'Adolescence' based on a true story?",
      "Stephen Graham, the show's co-creator who also played Eddie Miller, told Netflix's press site Tudum that a series of recent stabbings by boys inspired the tale.",
      "\u201cThere was an incident where a young boy (allegedly) stabbed a girl,\u201d Graham said. \u201cIt shocked me. I was thinking, \u2018What\u2019s going on? What\u2019s happening in society where a boy stabs a girl to death? What\u2019s the inciting incident here?\u2019 And then it happened again, and it happened again, and it happened again. I really just wanted to shine a light on it, and ask, \u2018Why is this happening today? What\u2019s going on? How have we come to this?\u2019\"",
      "Fifteen-year-old Elianne Andam, for example, was stabbed to death in London in September by Hassan Sentamu, then 17. Sentamu was sentenced to a minimum of 23 years in prison per a March court sentencing.",
      "Graham said that with the show, one of his goals was to answer the question, \"What is happening to our young men these days and what are the pressures they face from their peers, from the internet and from social media?\"",
      "\"And the pressures that come from all of those things are as difficult for kids here as they are the world over,\" he continued to tell Tudum.",
      "Graham told Rolling Stone that when he sees these stories of kids committing violent acts on the news, he knows he's \"not alone in blaming the parents sometimes.\"",
      "Because of this, he wanted to create a narrative where the crime decidedly isn't the parents' fault.",
      "\u201cI thought to myself, \u2018What if it\u2019s not the parents?\u2019 I wanted the dad to be a hardworking man, the kind of man that I was brought up with, like my uncles and my dad, who used to go to work at, like, 6 in the morning and not get home till 8 o\u2019clock at night, Monday to Friday,\" he told the publication.",
      "\"I didn\u2019t want him to be a violent dad who would raise his hand to his children. It\u2019s the same for the mum too; we imagined her as a manager for John Lewis. Let\u2019s take all of those normal common denominators away from the table, and let\u2019s just concentrate on something that\u2019s happened with the boy here.\u201d",
      "Instead of his parents, it's the internet, and certain radical groups, that have an impact on Jamie. He was inspired by looking at his own son's interactions with friends and social media use.",
      "\"It was just about looking at the influence that certain people can have upon our children without our knowledge,\" he said.",

      "Released on March 13, \"Adolescence\" is the No. 1. English-language show on Netflix in the U.S, as of the publication of this article.",
      "Part of what makes this show gripping is how the mystery unfolds. Filmed in one continuous shot, the characters try to understand the truth of what really happened in real time. Broader themes of toxic masculinity and the importance of teaching boys to rely on community, not just themselves, emerge.",

      "\u201cFrom now on, Israel will act against Hamas with increasing military force,\u201d it said, with the Israeli military later issuing evacuation orders to several neighborhoods across the enclave.",
      "At a news briefing Tuesday evening, Netanyahu warned that the strikes were \"just the beginning\" and that his aim is to \"destroy Hamas and make sure Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel.\u201d",
      "The health ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza, whose figures the World Health Organization has previously said it considers to be reliable, said hospitals across the enclave had received the bodies of at least 404 people killed, with more than 560 injured. It added that people were still buried under rubble, with recovery efforts underway.",
      "Dr. Muneer Al-Boursh, the ministry's director-general said \"most of the victims\" were women and children as he called on Gaza's residents to donate blood.",
      "While Tuesday's strikes are not the first to happen during the ceasefire, their scale puts the two-month-old ceasefire on shaky ground, although neither Israel or Hamas have explicitly said they considered the current ceasefire to be over.",
      "Follow along for live coverage",
      "Still, Hamas accused Israeli officials of having violated the terms of the truce.",
      "\u201cNetanyahu and his extremist government have decided to overturn the ceasefire agreement and are exposing the prisoners in Gaza to an unknown fate,\u201d Hamas said in a statement.",
      "Video captured by NBC News' crew on the ground in southern Gaza's Khan Younis showed scenes of people being rushed to Nasser Hospital, while bloodied bodies could be seen being laid down on the floor and on metal stretchers, including those of young children.",
      "Dr. Tanya Haj-Hassan, a volunteer with Medical Aid for Palestinians' emergency medical team at Nasser Hospital described the \"frenzy\" Tuesday morning as having \"felt like Armageddon.\"",
      "\u201cThe windows were shaking, the doors flew open, it was non-stop and then within about ten minutes we started hearing the sirens,\" she said in a statement shared by MAP with NBC News.",
      "Gaza Civil Defense spokesman Mahmoud Basal said early Tuesday that dozens of people had been killed and wounded, following attacks on homes.",
      "\u201cOur crews are unable to deal with the attacks due to limited resources and the dangerous situation,\u201d Basal said. \u201cWe call on the world to stop this aggression.\u201d",
      "The Israeli military issued evacuation orders Tuesday morning to Palestinians in neighborhoods across the enclave in Beit Hanoun, Khirbet Khuza\u2019a, Abasan al-Kabira, and al-Jadidah, saying they were \"dangerous combat zones.\" Residents were told to evacuate to known shelters in western Gaza City and Khan Younis.",
      "The strikes were the heaviest Israeli military bombardment in Gaza since the ceasefire deal was reached in January and brought a pause to fighting that followed the Hamas-led Oct. 7 terrorist attacks, when more than 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage."

      "The government of China, where media is tightly controlled by the ruling Chinese Communist Party, has long criticized coverage by VOA and other U.S. government-funded news outlets.

      "The dismantling of VOA, whose award-winning journalism reached nearly 360 million people every week in almost 50 languages including Mandarin and Cantonese, comes as China is aggressively expanding the global reach of its own state-funded media.",

      "Juan Yamarte said his brother has the same tattoo as a soccer player he admires and the number 99 \u2014 the number he has used as a member of a recreational soccer team. He also has tattoos of his mother\u2019s and daughter\u2019s names, as well as the date he and his partner began dating, another brother told Telemundo. None of his tattoos are gang-related, the family said.",
      "Juan Yamarte said his brother had been in the United States for more than a year before immigration officials took him last week at a home he shared with several other people.",
      "\u201cThey grabbed him. They cuffed him all at once when he said, \u2018Why are you taking me, too, if I haven\u2019t done anything?\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "On Monday, Yamarte\u2019s family and others in his hometown, Maracaibo, Venezuela, held a protest and a prayer vigil.",
      "Several other families told NBC News they believe they saw their relatives in the video released by El Salvador. They claim their loved ones have been falsely accused of having gang connections.",
      "\u201cHe is a good kid. He has never committed a crime; he doesn\u2019t have a criminal record,\u201d the sister of Fritzgeralth De Jesus, one of the Venezuelans she says was deported to El Salvador, said as she cried uncontrollably. \u201cHe is young, hard-working and an athlete.\u201d",
      "De Jesus\u2019 sister, who asked not to be identified because of fear of deportation, said she received a call from her brother, who had been detained by ICE officials, on Saturday \u201cto say goodbye\u201d because he was going to be deported to Venezuela.",
      "She grew increasingly worried when she did not hear from him, and she began to scour the internet hoping to find a clue to where he could be. She said she spotted him in Bukele\u2019s video, which had gone viral on social media.",
      "De Jesus, 25, entered the United States through the CBP One app in June, along with three other relatives, his sister said. The three family members were released into the United States right away, but De Jesus was sent to an immigration detention center in New Orleans, where he remained until he was deported, she said. It is unclear why De Jesus was detained; his family believes it may have been because of his tattoos.",
      "\u201cThey detained him just because he has tattoos,\u201d De Jesus\u2019 sister said. \u201cFrom the beginning, they asked constantly about his tattoos. They would ask him if he was a member of the criminal gang, Tren de Aragua, and he always said no.\u201d",
      "She said none of her brother's tattoos are gang-affiliated. Some of the more prominent ones include rose art on his neck and arm, an angel on his chest and a tattoo that says \u201cmom\u201d on his chest.",
      "De Jesus had left Venezuela because \u201ccolectivos,\u201d armed paramilitary groups that support President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, were harassing and extorting him, his sister said.",
      "Joseph Giardina, an attorney based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, who is representing De Jesus in his asylum case, was stunned to learn his client had been deported to El Salvador. The final hearing in his asylum case was scheduled for April 10.",
      "When Giardina heard De Jesus had been deported, he checked online and saw that his asylum hearing was still pending. He thought there must have been a mix-up.",
      "\u201cWith a pending asylum application and a trial, that would make absolutely no sense,\u201d Giardina said. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for years. That\u2019s not how it works.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe has been in proceedings for months. The government has never filed an I-213, which would indicate any criminal background. They have never filed any evidence of any kind of criminal history,\u201d Giardina said.",
      "Mirelys Casique told Telemundo her family recognized her son, Francisco Garc\u00eda Casique, in a photo released by the government of El Salvador. She said that while the man in the image was looking down, the family was able to identify him because of his tattoos.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not a criminal. He has no criminal record,\u201d she said, adding that if the government was going to deport her son, \u201cthey should send him back to his country of origin.\u201d",
      "Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act this weekend, and on Saturday, a federal judge issued a restraining order blocking him from using it to justify the deportations and ordered any planes that were already in the air to turn around.",
      "In court documents, officials said three planes left the United States after Trump issued his proclamation, raising questions about the timing of the flights and the custody handover.",
      "A federal judge reviewing the case Tuesday asked the administration for further details about the flights and which immigrants were deported solely based on the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "The Venezuelan government has since publicly condemned the detention of its citizens in El Salvador and issued a travel warning to those in the United States and those planning to travel abroad.",
      "\u201cWe are calling on the international community to stay alert against these practices that serve against human dignity and the principles of international rights,\u201d Venezuela\u2019s Foreign Affairs Ministry said in a statement Monday."

      "The ruling is a partial victory for Joshua Riibe, 22, a senior at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota, who has said he has been kept in a hotel room and not allowed to leave without supervision since Konanki vanished.",
      "\"He\u2019s a witness. He\u2019s cooperated and keeps cooperating,\" Magistrate Edwis Rijo Delgado said in Spanish while granting a habeas corpus petition Tuesday.",
      "Riibe is believed to be the last person seen with Konanki, 20, on a beach in the Dominican Republic early March 6.",
      "Her parents said Tuesday that authorities have told them they believe she drowned and that there were high ocean waves when she disappeared. She was on a spring break trip with five female friends when she disappeared. Her body has not been found.",
      "The judge said he could rule only on whether Riibe should be allowed to move freely, adding that his courtroom was not the appropriate venue to sort out the matter of Riibe's passport.",
      "Prosecutors did not answer when NBC News asked them outside the courtroom where Riibe\u2019s passport was or which agency had it.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know about the passport,\"\u00a0said Eduardo Vel\u00e1zquez, a prosecutor with the Dominican Republic attorney general\u2019s office. Pushed for an answer, he added \u2014\u00a0in English \u2014\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t speak English.\u201d",
      "It is unclear where Riibe's passport is and how and where the matter plays out.",
      "The judge scheduled a meeting in his courtroom for March 28.",
      "Riibe has not been accused of any crime, and Dominican National Police have said there is no suspect in Konanki\u2019s disappearance. Riibe said he wants to return to the United States.",
      "\u201cI can't go anywhere, and I really just want to be able to go home,\u201d Riibe said earlier.",
      "Attorneys for Riibe have said that since the investigation began, he had been confined to the resort where Konanki was staying before she disappeared.",
      "The National Police did not confirm or deny that Riibe's passport was confiscated or that he had been unable to leave the hotel. On Tuesday, prosecutors denied that Riibe was being detained at the hotel.",
      "Upon entering the courthouse Tuesday, Riibe was immediately swarmed by international media but declined to answer questions.",
      "At times, the hearing, which stretched for hours, was contentious. Riibe appeared to remain calm and focused.",
      "In an interview with local authorities last week, Riibe said\u00a0he was on the beach with Konanki\u00a0shortly before she disappeared, according to a transcript of an interview obtained by NBC News.",
      "According to the transcript, which NBC News translated from Spanish, he said he and Konanki were \"in waist-deep water, talking and kissing a little,\" before a wave crashed, taking them both \u201cout to sea.\"",
      "\"I kept trying to get her to breathe, but that didn\u2019t allow me to breathe all the time, and I swallowed a lot of water,\" Riibe said.",
      "Despite the struggle, Riibe told investigators, he managed to help Konanki get to shore before she vanished.",
      "\"The last time I saw her, I asked if she was OK. I didn\u2019t hear her answer,\" he said. \"I looked around and didn\u2019t see anyone. I thought she\u2019d grabbed her things and left.\"",
      "Riibe added that he was surprised to learn about her disappearance later.",
      "He said Konanki\u2019s family met him at the hotel in recent days and described their interactions as positive, saying the family hugged him goodbye when they left the resort.",
      "\u201c\u2018Thank you very much for helping save my daughter the first time,\u2019\u201d he recalled Konanki\u2019s mother telling him.",
      "Speaking with reporters outside their home in Loudoun County, Virginia, on Tuesday, Konanki's parents said authorities told them they believed their daughter drowned.",
      "\"It is with deep sadness, sadness and heavy, heavy heart,\u00a0we are coming to the terms with the fact that our daughter has drowned,\" Subbarayudu Konanki said. \"This is incredibly difficult\u00a0for us to process.\"",
      "Konanki's father added that both U.S. and Dominican authorities showed the family how high ocean waves were when Konanki vanished. They did not comment on Riibe's hearing or name him specifically but said authorities \"clarified that the person of interest is not a suspect from the beginning.\"",

      "Dominican authorities said Thursday that no one is considered a suspect and that they do not use the term \"person of interest,\" as the sheriff\u2019s office in Loudoun County has described Riibe.

      "BUDAPEST, Hungary \u2014 Hungarian lawmakers on Tuesday passed a law banning Pride events and allowing authorities to use facial recognition software to identify attendees, continuing a crackdown by Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s right-wing populist party on the country\u2019s LGBTQ community.",
      "The measure passed in a 136-27 vote. The law, supported by Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party and their minority coalition partner the Christian Democrats, was pushed through parliament in an accelerated procedure after being submitted only a day earlier.",
      "It amends Hungary\u2019s law on assembly to make it an offense to hold or attend events that violate Hungary\u2019s contentious \u201cchild protection\u201d legislation, which prohibits the \u201cdepiction or promotion\u201d of homosexuality to minors under 18.",
      "Attending a prohibited event will carry fines up to 200,000 Hungarian forints ($546), which the state must forward to \u201cchild protection,\u201d according to the text of the law. Authorities may use facial recognition tools to identify individuals attending a prohibited event.",
      "As the vote was held in Hungary\u2019s parliament in Budapest, opposition lawmakers ignited smoke bombs in the chamber, filling it with thick plumes of colorful smoke.",
      "In a statement on Monday after lawmakers first submitted the bill, Budapest Pride organizers said the aim of the law was to \u201cscapegoat\u201d the LGBTQ community in order to silence voices critical of Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government.",
      "\u201cThis is not child protection, this is fascism,\u201d organizers wrote. \u201cThe government is trying to restrict peaceful protests with a critical voice by targeting a minority. Therefore, as a movement, we will fight for the freedom of all Hungarians to demonstrate!\u201d",
      "The new legislation is the latest step against LGBTQ people taken by Orb\u00e1n, whose government has passed other laws that rights groups and other European politicians have decried as repressive against sexual minorities.",
      "In 2022, the European Union\u2019s executive commission filed a case with the EU\u2019s highest court against Hungary\u2019s 2021 child protection law. The European Commission argued that the law \u201cdiscriminates against people on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity.\u201d",

      "Hungary\u2019s \u201cchild protection\u201d law \u2014 aside from banning the \u201cdepiction or promotion\u201d of homosexuality in content available to minors, including in television, films, advertisements and literature \u2014 also prohibits the mention of LGBTQ issues in school education programs, and forbids the public depiction of \u201cgender deviating from sex at birth.\u201d",

      "Dr. Rasha Alawieh, a 34-year-old Lebanese citizen with a valid H-1B visa, returned to the U.S. after visiting her family, according to the court petition filed by her cousin. She was detained Thursday at Boston Logan International Airport, where she was allegedly held for 36 hours \u201cwithout any justification,\u201d during which time she was unable to speak to legal counsel or contact others, the petition states.",

      "Hezbollah formed in the 1980s after Israel occupied southern Lebanon to oppose Israel's presence in the country and is a U.S.-designated terror group. Nasrallah and Hezbollah's close ties to Iran divided Lebanon, and some critics say its support for Hamas in Gaza helped plunge the country into a war with Israel that it could not afford last year.",
