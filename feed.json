      "Underwood, who launched her career on \u201cAmerican Idol,\" is to perform shortly before Trump takes the oath of office at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 20, according to a copy of the inaugural program provided to The Associated Press on Monday.",
      "\u201cI love our country and am honored to have been asked to sing at the Inauguration and to be a small part of this historic event,\u201d Underwood said in a statement Monday. \u201cI am humbled to answer the call at a time when we must all come together in the spirit of unity and looking to the future.\u201d",
      "The pomp and spectacle that comes with the inauguration of a new president kicks off this weekend in Washington with a fireworks show at Trump\u2019s golf club in Sterling, Virginia, a campaign-style rally in D.C., a visit to Arlington National Cemetery and glitzy dinners before the former president takes the oath to become the next president.",
      "Trump\u2019s second inauguration is expected to be a much different affair than the last time America got a new president. Trump, who refused to accept his 2020 loss, did not attend Democratic President Joe Biden\u2019s swearing-in ceremony at the Capitol, where there were still visible reminders of the violent Jan. 6, 2021 siege on the building by Trump\u2019s supporters.",
      "The committee planning Trump\u2019s inaugural ceremonies released a schedule Monday of four days of events centered around the Jan. 20th swearing-in ceremony, which Biden is planning to attend.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is dedicated to uniting the country through the strength, security, and opportunity of his America First agenda,\u201d Steve Witkoff and Kelly Loeffler, the co-chairs of the inaugural committee, said in a statement.",
      "Witkoff is Trump\u2019s incoming Middle East envoy and Loeffler is a former Georgia senator who is Trump\u2019s pick to run the Small Business Administration.",
      "\u201cThe 2025 inaugural celebrations will reflect President-elect Trump\u2019s historic return to the White House and the American people\u2019s decisive vote to Make America Great Again,\" Witkoff and Loeffler said.",
      "On Saturday, Trump is scheduled to attend a reception and fireworks display at his Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia. Separately, Vice President-elect JD Vance will attend a reception for the incoming Cabinet members and host a dinner.",
      "On Sunday, the president-elect is to participate in a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery and then hold a campaign-style \"MAGA Victory\u201d rally at Capital One Arena in downtown Washington.",
      "Th Republican's Inauguration Day plans include tea at the White House, the swearing-in ceremony at the Capitol, a congressional luncheon, a parade on Pennsylvania Avenue and a trio of balls.",
      "The inaugural balls include a Commander in Chief Ball focused on military service members, a Liberty Inaugural Ball geared toward Trump supporters, and the Starlight Ball, focused on high-dollar donors. Trump is scheduled to speak at all three balls.",
      "Incoming first lady Melania Trump will join tea with the Bidens. In 2021, the Trumps did not invite the Bidens for a tea before Biden's inauguration, instead leaving town before the next president was sworn in. In November, when Joe Biden invited President-elect Trump to the White House, Melania Trump chose to skip the visit.",
      "Tuesday, Trump's first full day as the 47th president, will include a National Prayer Service in the morning.",
      "Greenwood will perform as Trump walks out to take the oath, according to Trump's inaugural committee. Macchio is Trump's choice to perform the National Anthem at the end of the program.",
      "Macchio performed at the Republican National Convention in July, at Trump's return rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in October after his first rally there was marred by an assassination attempt, and during his Madison Square Garden rally that drew blowback for crude and racist jokes from some speakers.",
      "The invocation is scheduled to be delivered by Franklin Graham, son of the late pastor Billy Graham, and New York Cardinal Timothy Dolan.",
      "Trump's first inauguration in 2017 featured performances from the Rockettes, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and 16-year-old \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent\u201d singer Jackie Evancho.",

      "Oliviero Toscani, the photographer behind Benetton\u2019s provocative ad campaigns of the 1980s and 1990s who later broke with the Italian knitwear brand under controversy, has died at age 82",
      "MILAN -- Oliviero Toscani, the photographer behind Benetton\u2019s provocative ad campaigns of the 1980s and 1990s who later broke with the Italian knitwear brand amid controversy, died Monday at age 82.",
      "Toscani disclosed last year he had a rare disease. \"It is with immense pain that we announce that our beloved Oliviero has undertaken his next journey,\" his wife, Kirsti, and their three children said in a statement. He died at a hospital in Livorno, Tuscany, the news agency ANSA reported.",
      "Toscani had amyloidosis, a disease characterized by a buildup of abnormal protein deposits in the body. He told Corriere della Sera in August he had lost 40 kilograms (nearly 90 pounds) in a year, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t know how long I have left to live, but I\u2019m not interested in living like this anyway.\u201d",
      "Toscani also said he would like to be remembered \u201cnot for any one photo but for my whole work, for the commitment.\u201d",
      "Toscani was the creative force behind shock ad campaigns of the 1980s and 1990s that featured images such as the pope kissing an imam on the lips, which angered the Vatican.",
      "Other images promoting the United Colors of Benetton depicted a priest embracing a nun, a newborn baby with its umbilical cord and a black woman breastfeeding a white baby, part of the brand\u2019s advocacy for diversity, religious tolerance and environmental messages.",
      "During a 1997 shoot of a Benetton campaign featuring Jews and Arabs living peacefully together in Israel, Toscani told The Associated Press, \u201cAny picture is a political image, so we make our choice and we go for the real thing.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cYou might have to face criticism. A lot of people don\u2019t like things that are different. Everybody likes to conform. We don\u2019t conform.\u201d",
      "His decadeslong relationship with Benetton was severed in 2020 after Toscani outraged relatives of victims of the deadly 2018 Genoa bridge collapse, telling RAI television, \u201cWho cares about a bridge collapse?\u201d He was responding to an outcry over a photograph of founding members of a political protest movement alongside key members of the Benetton family, which controlled the company that maintained the bridge.",
      "Toscani apologized in an interview with La Repubblica, saying: \u201cI am sorry. More: I am ashamed to apologize. I am humanly destroyed and deeply pained.\u201d But the damage was done, and Benetton ended a relationship that had flourished from 1982-2000 and been rekindled in 2018.",
      "Benetton remembered Toscani in a social media post: \u201cFarewell, Oliviero. Keep on dreaming,\u2019\u2019 beneath Toscani's 1989 photo of a hand offering a bouquet of flowers.",
      "Toscani was born in Milan on Feb. 28, 1942, the son of a photojournalist for Corriere della Sera. He studied photography and graphics at the University of the Arts in Zurich from 1961-65, and worked with the newly founded Vogue Italia and other major fashion publications.",
      "Over the years, he shot campaigns for such brands as Chanel, Robe di Kappa, Fiorucci and Esprit. But he was probably best known for his work for the United Colors of Benetton, with images that carried messages promoting equality and diversity while denouncing anorexia, homophobia, the death penalty and racism.",
      "His work for United Colors of Benetton, a brand then known most for its colorful knitwear, raised its global profile. In the early 1990s, he conceived and directed \u201cColors,\u201d a global publication distributed in Benetton stores, and created along with Luciano Benetton the research center Fabrica in Benetton\u2019s home city of Treviso that supported and launched many fashion industry careers.",
      "Toscani tackled the AIDS crisis in the early 1990s with a colored condom campaign, during which Benetton sold a range of colored condoms, and used a colorized version of a portrait of AIDS activist David Kirby surrounded by family as he was dying.",
      "In 2007, Toscani\u2019s \u201cNo Anorexia\u201d campaign for the Italian fashion brand Nolita sparked fresh discussions about the illness and its relationship to the fashion industry. Toscani\u2019s photograph with skeletally thin model Isabelle Caro was revealed on giant billboards and in newspaper ads during Milan Fashion Week and received worldwide attention.",
      "He was also involved in projects addressing problems such as road safety, violence against women and stray dogs.",

      "Woods added: \u201cIn this hellish landscape \u2018standing\u2019 is relative, but smoke and other damage is not like the utter destruction around us.\"",
      "Earlier this week, Woods was among hundreds of thousands around Los Angeles who were forced to evacuate as the fires spread and intensified. He has posted regular updates on X, showing charred ruins of homes near his, and had been convinced his house would fare no better.",
      "\u201cSo many beautiful messages from all of you,\u201d he posted later Friday. \u201cI\u2019m so happy and grateful, but honestly the entire area looks like the dark side of the moon.\u201d",
      "Numerous celebrities, from Paris Hilton to Billy Crystal, have confirmed their homes were lost or sustained damage in blazes burning in and around Los Angeles. At least 10 people have died, and thousands of structures and vehicles have been destroyed."

      "CORAL GABLES, Fla. -- Sam Moore, the surviving half and higher voice of the 1960s duo Sam & Dave that was known for such definitive hits of the era as \u201cSoul Man\u201d and \u201cHold On, I'm Comin,\u2019\u201d has died. He was 89.",
      "Publicist Jeremy Westby said Moore died Friday morning in Coral Gables, Florida, due to complications while recovering from surgery. No additional details were immediately available.",
      "Moore, who influenced musicians including Michael Jackson, Al Green and Bruce Springsteen, was inducted with Dave Prater into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.",
      "At the Memphis, Tennessee-based Stax Records, Moore and Prater were second only to Otis Redding. They transformed the \u201ccall and response\u201d of gospel music into a frenzied stage show and recorded some of soul music\u2019s most enduring hits, which also included \u201cYou Don\u2019t Know Like I Know,\u201d \u201cWhen Something is Wrong With My Baby\u201d and \u201cI Thank You.\u201d",
      "Most of their hits were written and produced by the team of Isaac Hayes and David Porter and featured the Stax house band Booker T. & the MGs, whose guitarist Steve Cropper received one of music\u2019s most famous shoutouts when Sam & Dave called \u201cPlay it, Steve\u201d midway through \u201cSoul Man.\u201d",
      "Like many \u201960s soul acts, Sam & Dave faded after the 1960s. But \u201cSoul Man\u201d hit the charts again in the late 1970s when the Blues Brothers, John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd recorded it with many of the same musicians. Moore had mixed feelings about the hit becoming associated with the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d stars, remembering how young people believed it originated with the Blues Brothers.",
      "In 2008, the movie \u201cSoul Men\u201d depicted a pair of aging, estranged singers who bore more than a little resemblance to Sam & Dave. Moore lost a lawsuit claiming the resemblance was too close.",
      "He also spent years suing Prater after Prater hired a substitute and toured as the New Sam & Dave. Prater died in a 1988 car crash in Georgia.",
      "Moore also pressed legal claims that the record industry had cheated him out of retirement benefits. Moore and other artists sued multiple record companies and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists in 1993.",
      "Moore told The Associated Press in 1994 that he joined the legal effort after learning, despite his million-selling records, his pension amounted to just $2,285, which he could take as a lump sum or in payments of $73 monthly.",
      "\u201cTwo thousand dollars for my lifetime?\u201d Moore said then. \u201cIf you\u2019re making a profit off of me, give me some too. Don\u2019t give me cornbread and tell me it\u2019s biscuits.\u201d",
      "Moore wrote the song \u201cDole Man,\u201d modeled on \u201cSoul Man,\u201d for Republican Bob Dole\u2019s presidential campaign in 1996. In 2017, he was among the few entertainers who performed for Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural festivities. Eight years earlier, Moore had objected when Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama\u2019s campaign used the song \u201cHold On, I\u2019m Comin\u2019.\u201d",
      "Moore was born Oct. 12, 1935, in Miami and got his start singing in church.",
      "He and Prater performed in soul and R&B clubs in the 1950s, but didn\u2019t meet until 1961 in Miami. Moore helped coach Prater on the lyrics of a song and they quickly became a popular local duo. In 1965, after signing with Atlantic Records, producer Jerry Wexler sent them to the label\u2019s Stax subsidiary in Memphis.",
      "Moore and Prater argued often and Moore told the AP in 2006 that a drug habit, which he kicked in 1981, played a part in the band\u2019s troubles and later made entertainment executives leery of giving him a fresh start. The duo broke up in 1970 and neither had another major hit.",
      "\u201cI did a lot of cruise ships, I did a lot of oldies shows,\" during those struggles, he said, adding that he once opened for a group of Elvis impersonators.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s funny to think back to it now. And I did a lot of shows where if I did a show with an oldie show, I had to actually audition,\" he said. \"But you know what? You keep your mouth shut and you get up there and you sing as hard and perform as hard as you can, and get the little money and go on about your business and try and pay those bills. I\u2019m laughing about it now, but at that time, man, it was really serious.\u201d",

      "With homes smoldered, streets emptied and friends scattered by evacuation orders, Guttenberg counted himself among the fortunate. His property was miraculously spared. But the actor-producer still struggled to reconcile his relief with the haunting sight of his ravaged, once lavish community.",
      "\u201cJust this morning, I woke up and I was really conscious of my mental state and my mental health, because the last three days, I've seen so much tragedy,\u201d said Guttenberg, pacing through the ruins of his neighborhood. He said his home has electricity but no running water.",
      "Guttenberg thanked God that his block was safe, but he said about 20 homes were burned \u201cpretty bad\u201d in his 80-home community after wind-whipped fires tore across Los Angeles, destroying homes, clogging roadways as tens of thousands fled as the fires burned uncontained Wednesday. He said the fires are the worst he's ever seen in his 66-years.",
      "The wildfires have burned the homes of several celebrities including Billy Crystal, Carey Elwes and Paris Hilton.",

      "During Guttenberg\u2019s stroll, it was an eerie scene with scorched palm trees, homes reduced to ash and rubble, and the daytime skies casted an ominous twilight over the devastation.",
      "\u201cI've seen people scared, people in wheelchairs, mothers and fathers trying to find their kids, people having anxiety and panic attacks,\u201d said Guttenberg, who returned to his neighborhood to help others who stayed behind with relief efforts. He has helped move cars to clear the street, handed out food and assisted neighbors from out their homes.",
      "\"All these houses behind me burned to the ground where their families enjoyed wonderful times together with their friends and family,\" said Guttenberg while pointing at one charred home before dropping his head in sadness. \u201cThere's really a lot of pain going on right now. I'm doing whatever I can to help alleviate it.\u201d",
      "For those looking to help, Guttenberg suggested starting with a simple call or text to ask displaced neighbors what they might need like food, supplies or emotional support. He also encouraged those who can return to their homes, if safe, to check on their property and assist others in assessing the damage.",
      "Guttenberg, the star of films like \u201cShort Circuit,\u201d \u201cPolice Academy and \u201dThree Men and a Baby,\" is unsure how the film and TV industry will able to help during the beginning of awards season.",
      "\u201cEverybody\u2019s gonna do what regular people do: Help each other, give each other food and water, help each other in their backyards, in their front yards,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though somebody\u2019s an actor, producer, writer, director, we\u2019re all just people. .. Maybe people can donate at one point to some sort of fund. But I just think, be a good neighbor right now.\u201d",
      "When asked about the timeline for his neighborhood's recovery, Guttenberg thinks it could take anywhere from five to 10 years to rebuild and fully heal.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a lot of work,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be unbelievable to try to rebuild this. Rebuild all the beautiful trees, homes and retail shops and lifestyle. The psychology of it all, it\u2019s going to take a long time.\u201d"

      "Schenk lived in Austria, and his death was announced by the Vienna State Opera.",
      "He created 31 productions there, starting with Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s \u201cJen\u016ffa\u201d in 1964 and ending with Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s \u201cThe Cunning Little Vixen\u201d in 2014. Many of his creations remain in use, including a 1979 version of Johann Strauss II's \u201cDie Fledermaus\u201d that was streamed around the world on New Year's Eve.",
      "\u201cOtto Schenk is an essential, unforgettable chapter in the history of our theater,\u201d Vienna State Opera Director Bogdan Ro\u0161\u010di\u0107 said in a statement. \u201cBut he was also an artist who shaped the world of theater for half a century like few others. As sacred as the theater was to him, he approached the works naturally and fearlessly, drawing on an immense knowledge. An infinite love for the singers went hand in hand with hard, uncompromising rehearsal work and honesty. \u201d",
      "Schenk led 16 productions at New York's Metropolitan Opera, starting with Puccini's \u201cTosca\u201d in 1968 and ending with Donizetti's \u201cDon Pasquale\u201d in 1996. His staging of Wagner's four-work \u201cDer Ring des Nibelungen\u201d premiered from 1986-89 and was shown in 20 full cycles from 1989 to 2009 and broadcast on public television in 1990. Schenk received a huge ovation when he took a curtain call after an April 18, 2009, performance of \u201cSiegfried.\u201d",
      "His romantic, realistic staging had set designer G\u00fcnther Schneider-Siemssen create images of a river, forest and mountains dominated by greens and oranges, and costumes by Rolf Langenfass that evoked the original Ring of the 1876 Bayreuth Festival. It was in a way a response to Patrice Ch\u00e9reau's centennial Ring at Bayreuth in 1976, set in an industrial age Ring and interpreted by some as Marxist.",
      "\u201cI wanted to tell a romantic old story, like starting with \u2018Once upon a time,\u2019\u201d Schenk said during a 1989 interview with The Associated Press. \u201cAll the secrets of Wagner\u2019s Ring should be guessed by the audience or found by the audience.\u201d",

He continued to act and performed 237 times at the Salzburg Festival from 1950-97, becoming head of drama there from 1986-88.",

      "\u201cAt a time when many new productions of `Der Ring des Nibelungen' might be more aptly entitled `Der Ringling des Barnum und Bailey,' the Metropolitan Opera\u2019s staging of Wagner\u2019s epic has cast a vote for the notion that maybe, just maybe, the composer knew best,\" New York Times critic Donal Henahan wrote in 1989. \u201cThe Metropolitan\u2019s trend-bucking project has aroused widespread suspicion, even resentment. `Traditional,' `conventional,' `regressive' and `childishly representational' were some of the nicer epithets thrown about in lobbies and in print. ... Even granting the possibility that radical rethinking of Wagner\u2019s works might occasionally stimulate thought about their everyday relevance, a staging that pays honor to the original is a useful counterbalance.\u201d",
      "Met presentations were long dominated by Schenk and Franco Zeffirelli, who had 11 stagings that premiered from 1964-98. Schenk said he did not look for hidden meanings.",

      "The Scottish rock band Franz Ferdinand sent a jolt across the music world two decades ago",
      "LONDON -- Two decades ago, the Scottish rock band Franz Ferdinand sent a jolt across the music world. They waltzed in stripped-shirts and quickly became global icons for their deliriously hooky songs, hitting a critical mass in the chant-along singles \u201cTake Me Out\u201d and \u201cDo You Want To.\u201d A lot has changed in that time, but the band never wavered in their dedication to 2000s indie ebullience. Over the last few years there's been a bit of an indie music resurgence, but for Franz Ferdinand, it never went away.",
      "On Friday, they will release \"The Human Fear,'' their sixth studio album and the first in seven years, making the end of the longest break between full lengths in their career.",
      "Frontman Alex Kapranos says the album tackles relationships forming and breaking down. \u201cThe title is a clue to the scene,\u201d he teases. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t written to the theme, at least not consciously.\u201d",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press in London, Kapranos and Franz Ferdinand bassist Bob Hardy discussed about \u201cThe Human Fear,\u201d the resurgence of indie music and the band's love for Chappell Roan and Charli XCX. Responses have been edited for length and clarity.",
      "KAPRANOS: The last song that was written, the last lyrics that were written was (for) the song \u201cHooked.\u201d It starts off with the line, \u201cI\u2019ve got the fear / I\u2019ve got the human fear.\u201d And I realize that so many of the songs had an underlying theme of fear to them. But not necessarily succumbing to fear, but more like overcoming fear.",
      "\u201cThe Doctor\u201d is about the fear of leaving an institution, and \u201cBar Lonely\u201d is the fear of leaving a relationship. \u201cNight or Day\u201d is the fear of committing to a relationship. But fear is fascinating because fear is universal. We all experience fear. We all experience the same fears. But how we respond to it is individual. And that\u2019s how we find who we are, our personalities. And overcoming fear feels good. That\u2019s why we watch horror films or ride rollercoasters \u2014 because you overcome fear and then feel very alive for having done so.",
      "KAPRANOS: The song starts off addressing that feeling that we all have sometimes, which is, you know, you feel that your life is collapsing around about you for one reason or another. It could be a relationship that is disintegrating. Often, it'll go that things tend to happen to you (all) at once. The relationship starts going south as well as your professional life. And then you realize that the washing machine leaked and your basement\u2019s flooded and just all that kind of annoying stuff. Your phone gets nicked or whatever. And it can be overwhelming. And you just, you have this sense of fear that, \"Gosh, everything\u2019s collapsing.\"",
      "I guess I was feeling a little bit like that when I was writing the song for one reason or another. And I thought, \u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d ... I\u2019m just going to do something astonishingly audacious. I\u2019m going to go into it with an audacious attitude and get through it that sort of way. And don't blame anybody else for it as well. Like, own the responsibility of overcoming the fear myself.",
      "KAPRANOS: We\u2019re not one of these kinds of bands that will sit down and say, \u201cRight, we\u2019ve got two months to write an album. \u201d For me, you\u2019re always writing, you\u2019re always coming up with ideas. And so, on this album, there\u2019s ideas that were written in the studio literally the day before it was sent off to be mastered. And there\u2019s also ideas \u2026 I think the oldest idea is the bassline (of) one of the songs, which is from 1995.",
      "I think the way my brain works is like if you imagine going into the office of a university\u2019s eccentric professor that\u2019s scattered with bits of paper. It's all kind of like catastrophic, organizational hell, but they know exactly where everything is. That\u2019s what my brain is like with bits of ideas and bits of songs and stuff like that. I know where they are, and when I need to use them, they\u2019ll come out.",
      "HARDY: And the show has become the reward for making records, to me. It all kind of focuses playing it live in front of an audience and seeing people react to it in the moment. When you release a record, you don\u2019t see people listen to it at home. You know, the way you kind of get the reaction is these live shows.",
      "HARDY: It's never gone away.",
      "KAPRANOS: There was a period in the late-2000s where there was point of saturation where, like, you turned on any mainstream radio show and you heard nothing but indie bands. And when it becomes that saturated, maybe the quality control goes down slightly. And then when that happens, there\u2019s always a reaction to it. And I think over the last decade, there\u2019s been a bit of, \u201cRight, okay, so we\u2019re going to listen to like pure pop instead.\u201d And of course, there\u2019s some brilliant stuff like Charli XCX. Amazing. Chappell Roan (is) incredible. But there\u2019s a lot of stuff that\u2019s maybe not quite premier tier as well. And I think there's been maybe a little bit of a reaction to that.",
      "I think from our perspective, just, yeah, make the thing that you love and then you\u2019re not really going to go wrong."

      "Appearing on \u201cSesame Street\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- Appearing on \u201cSesame Street\u201d? That's the best idea.",
      "The 55th season of the acclaimed family program features a star-studded lineup of musicians that would be the envy of any summer festival: SZA, Chris Stapleton, Noah Kahan, Rene\u00e9 Rapp and Samara Joy.",
      "The upcoming season will focus on lessons in emotional well-being. It debuts Jan. 16 on MAX with new episodes releasing every Thursday. \u201cSesame Street\u201d will also be available on PBS stations and to stream on PBS Kids in the fall.",
      "No one is more excited than Elmo himself.",
      "\u201cThere's a lot to learn from music \u2014 yeah, timing and harmonies and melody and different styles and different cultures,\u201d the 3 1/2-year-old monster told The Associated Press. \u201cIt's really cool! We've got a lot of wonderful people come and do some music with us on \u2018Sesame Street,' like Miss Rene\u00e9 Rapp and SZA! Chris Stapleton, Noah Kahan, Samara Joy \u2014 lots of great people!\u201d",
      "Songs double as life lessons on \u201cSesame Street,\u201d from an alt-R&B-pop track about gratitude with SZA to an acoustic number about feelings with Rapp.",
      "\"SZA is really cool \u2014 really talented. And \u2018gratitude\u2019 was a new word for Elmo, too. So, Elmo learned all about gratitude with SZA,\u201d he said.",
      "\"Elmo was feeling really, really happy after his playdate with Miss Rene\u00e9. It was a really beautiful song. She's got a great voice and Elmo hopes she comes back soon.\u201d",
      "As for the secret to a great \u201cSesame Street\u201d song? According to Tony - and Grammy-winning composer, producer and \u201cSesame Street\u201d music director Bill Sherman, its \u201cearworms on earworms.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf the verse is an earworm, so is the chorus. Mostly in pop music, the chorus is the earworm, and the verses are just a bunch of jumble.\u201d The difference, he explains, is that pop songs are about three and a half minutes long. Children's music is about a minute and a half. \u201cYou only have a very finite amount of time to do what you got to do.\u201d",
      "Usually, writers on the show provide Sherman and his team of songwriters with a script and lyrics detailing the lesson of each episode, as well as the name of the musical guest. Then they get to work, composing music true to the genre and spirit of each artist.",
      "Those musical guests take different levels of involvement, but the result is always awe-inspiring.",
      "Other highlights from this season include Kahan performing a foot-stomping folk song about music and feelings, Joy using jazz improvisation to teach a lesson in taking turns and a country ode to music and friends courtesy of Stapleton.",
      "\u201cChris Stapleton really wanted to write his own song,\u201d says Sherman, and so the pair hopped on a Zoom and wrote a song together, Stapleton with his guitar in tow, ideas flowing. \u201cIt was really one of the most surreal two-hour Zooms that I really ever had in my life.\u201d",
      "Joy took a different approach. \u201cSamara Joy insisted on singing live,\" says Sherman. \u201cIt very rarely happens on \u2018Sesame Street.\u2019 I can only count, like, a few times. So, there was like Stevie Wonder back in the day, which is a classic. And there\u2019s like Billy Joel, there\u2019s John Legend, there\u2019s a couple people that actually sing live. But Samara insisted on it.\u201d",
      "Her reasoning was simple. \"She said, \u2018Well, this whole episode is about improvisation and thinking on your toes. And so, if it\u2019s prerecorded, that\u2019s the opposite of what we\u2019re trying to teach.\u2019\"",
      "If there is a theme that connects all these performances to one another, it's a spirit of connection. At least, that's Elmo's theory: \u201cElmo thinks that music brings people together, you know? And some people who like some things and some people who like other things can kind of come together because they like the same kind of music. And that's kind of cool!\u201d",
      "\u201cSesame Street,\u201d designed by education professionals and child psychologists, is shown in more than 150 countries, has won over 200 Emmys, 11 Grammys, two Peabody Awards and received a Kennedy Center Honor for lifetime artistic achievement, the first time a television program got the award.",
      "There've been no shortage of great musical guests across the show's five decade run. So, who would they like to see pay a visit in the future? \u201cMiss Taylor Swift! Maybe she could revisit her \u2018Red\u2019 era?\u201d chimes in Elmo. That's his favorite of her albums.",
      "\u201cBut also, Elmo would love to sing with Miss Beyonc\u00e9. Destiny's Child was on \u2018Sesame Street,\u2019 so Elmo would love to have her back.\u201d"

      "Sierra Leone has declared a state of emergency after reporting its second case of mpox in less than four days",
      "DAKAR, Senegal -- Sierra Leone declared a state of emergency Monday after the country reported its second case of mpox in less than four days, health authorities said.",
      "Neither case had known recent contact with infected animals or other sick individuals, the health ministry said. Only the first case involved recent travel, limited to the airport town of Lungi in the northern Port Loko District between Dec. 26 and Jan. 6th. Both patients are receiving treatment at a hospital in the capital, Freetown.",
      "Mpox, also known as monkeypox, was first identified by scientists in 1958 when outbreaks of a \u201cpox-like\u201d disease in monkeys occurred. Until recently, most human cases were seen in people in central and West Africa who had close contact with infected animals.",
      "In 2022, the virus was confirmed to spread via sex for the first time and triggered outbreaks in more than 70 countries across the world that had not previously reported mpox. The Congo has borne the brunt of the epidemic, with a vast majority of the roughly 43,000 suspected cases and 1,000 deaths in Africa this year.",
      "Sierra Leone was previously the epicenter of the 2014 Ebola outbreak, the deadliest in history. The outbreak, primarily concentrated in West Africa, affected Sierra Leone the most, with nearly 4,000 deaths out of the more than 11,000 recorded globally. The country also lost 7% of its healthcare workforce to the outbreak.",

      "",
      "\"The electronic prosthetic knee is life-changing,\" said Adams, who lives in Lafayette, Colorado, with his wife and two kids. Without it, \"it would be like going back to having a wooden leg like I did when I was a kid.\" The microprocessor in the knee responds to different surfaces and inclines, stiffening up if it detects movement that indicates its user is falling.",
      "",
      "People who need surgery to replace a joint typically don't encounter similar coverage roadblocks. In 2021, 1.5 million knee or hip joint replacements were performed in United States hospitals and hospital-owned ambulatory facilities, according to the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ. The median price for a total hip or knee replacement without complications at top orthopedic hospitals was just over $68,000 in 2020, according to one analysis, though health plans often negotiate lower rates.",
      "",
      "To people in the amputee community, the coverage disparity amounts to discrimination.",
      "",
      "\"Insurance covers a knee replacement if it's covered with skin, but if it's covered with plastic, it's not going to cover it,\" said Jeffrey Cain, MD, a family physician and former chair of the board of the Amputee Coalition, an advocacy group. Cain wears two prosthetic legs, having lost his after an airplane accident nearly 30 years ago.",
      "",
      "AHIP, a trade group for health plans, said health plans generally provide coverage when the prosthetic is determined to be medically necessary, such as to replace a body part or function for walking and day-to-day activity. In practice, though, prosthetic coverage by private health plans varies tremendously, said Ashlie White, chief strategy and programs officer at the Amputee Coalition. Even though coverage for basic prostheses may be included in a plan, \"often insurance companies will put caps on the devices and restrictions on the types of devices approved,\" White said.",
      "",
      "An estimated 2.3 million people are living with limb loss in the U.S., according to an analysis by Avalere, a healthcare consulting company. That number is expected to as much as double in coming years as people age and a growing number lose limbs to diabetes, trauma, and other medical problems.",
      "",
      "Fewer than half of people with limb loss have been prescribed a prosthesis, according to a report by the AHRQ. Plans may deny coverage for prosthetic limbs by claiming they aren't medically necessary or are experimental devices, even though microprocessor-controlled knees like Adams' have been in use for decades.",
      "",
      "Cain was instrumental in getting passed a 2000 Colorado law that requires insurers to cover prosthetic arms and legs at parity with Medicare, which requires coverage with a 20% coinsurance payment. Since that measure was enacted, about half of states have passed \"insurance fairness\" laws that require prosthetic coverage on par with other covered medical services in a plan or laws that require coverage of prostheses that enable people to do sports. But these laws apply only to plans regulated by the state. Over half of people with private coverage are in plans not governed by state law.",
      "",
      "The Medicare program's 80% coverage of prosthetic limbs mirrors its coverage for other services. Still, an October report by the Government Accountability Office found that only 30% of beneficiaries who lost a limb in 2016 received a prosthesis in the following 3 years.",
      "",
      "Cost is a factor for many people.",
      "",
      "\"No matter your coverage, most people have to pay something on that device,\" White said. As a result, \"many people will be on a payment plan for their device,\" she said. Some may take out loans.",
      "",
      "The federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has proposed a rule that would prohibit lenders from repossessing medical devices such as wheelchairs and prosthetic limbs if people can't repay their loans.",
      "",
      "\"It is a replacement limb,\" said White, whose organization has heard of several cases in which lenders have repossessed wheelchairs or prostheses. Repossession is \"literally a punishment to the individual.\"",
      "",
      "Adams ultimately owed a coinsurance payment of about $4,000 for his new leg, which reflected his portion of the insurer's negotiated rate for the knee and foot portion of the leg but did not include the costly part that fits around his stump, which didn't need replacing. The insurer approved the prosthetic leg on appeal, claiming it had made an administrative error, Adams said.",
      "",
      "\"We're fortunate that we're able to afford that 20%,\" said Adams, who is a self-employed leadership consultant.",
      "",
      "Leah Kaplan doesn't have that financial flexibility. Born without a left hand, she did not have a prosthetic limb until a few years ago.",
      "",
      "Growing up, \"I didn't want more reasons to be stared at,\" said Kaplan, 32, of her decision not to use a prosthesis. A few years ago, the cycling enthusiast got a prosthetic hand specially designed for use with her bike. That device was covered under the health plan she has through her county government job in Spokane, Washington, helping developmentally disabled people transition from school to work.",
      "",
      "But when she tried to get approval for a prosthetic hand to use for everyday activities, her health plan turned her down. The myoelectric hand she requested would respond to electrical impulses in her arm that would move the hand to perform certain actions. Without insurance coverage, the hand would cost her just over $46,000, which she said she can't afford.",
      "",
      "Working with her doctor, she has appealed the decision to her insurer and been denied three times. Kaplan said she's still not sure exactly what the rationale is, except that the insurer has questioned the medical necessity of the prosthetic hand. The next step is to file an appeal with an independent review organization certified by the state insurance commissioner's office.",
      "",
      "A prosthetic hand is not a luxury device, Kaplan said. The prosthetic clinic has ordered the hand and made the customized socket that will fit around the end of her arm. But until insurance coverage is sorted out, she can't use it.",
      "",
      "At this point she feels defeated. \"I've been waiting for this for so long,\" Kaplan said.",

      "To age well, geriatricians say one underappreciated key is maintaining good balance",
      "Taking a shower. Grocery shopping. Moving around the kitchen. Getting dressed. The underappreciated link between these mundane activities is good balance, which geriatricians say is key to maintaining an independent lifestyle as we age.",
      "Lacking balance can be dangerous. In the U.S., 3 million older people seek medical care for fall-related injuries each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control. But falls are not inevitable, said Roopa Anmolsingh, a geriatrician who created the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s balance classes.",
      "\u201cSome people have a misconception that part of getting old is, you\u2019re going to fall. That\u2019s not true,\u201d Anmolsingh said. \u201cYou can control how you fall, or if you fall.\u201d",
      "To prevent falls, geriatricians say people should start asking themselves questions about their balance as early as 50 years old.",
      "Besides muscles and bones, other systems in the body can affect balance, so it\u2019s important to have a doctor check you if you ever feel unsteady, even if only occasionally. The cause could be related to blood pressure, a medication, inner-ear function, a nervous system issue or countless other potential problems.",
      "Even if unsteadiness is not an issue, you can determine whether you still might need an intervention with an easy at-home assessment.",
      "Standing next to a wall or something that can lend support if needed, raise one leg. If you can balance on each leg for 10 seconds, you should be fine, said Greg W. Hartley, a University of Miami professor of physical therapy specializing in geriatrics.",
      "\u201cIf you can\u2019t do that, then you should probably go see a physical therapist,\u201d he said.",
      "Another assessment, which Hartley recommended doing supervised, is called TUG, for \u201ctimed up and go.\u201d Sit in a chair and start a timer when you stand. Walk 10 feet (3 meters), come back and stop the timer upon sitting back down. If it takes longer than 15 seconds, the risk for a fall is very high. Twelve seconds or less, the likelihood of a fall is almost zero.",
      "The National Council on Aging offers an online resource to assess the risk of a fall with questions about medications, whether you worry about falling and if you have trouble stepping over a curb, among others.",
      "Because muscle mass begins to decline in most people during their 30s, geriatricians say the best way to preserve good balance is to stay physically active throughout life. But it\u2019s never too late to start prioritizing it, Anmolsingh said.",
      "Tai chi and yoga are particularly good for older adults because they involve controlled movements while shifting body weight. There also are individual exercises people can work into their everyday lives.",
      "Anmolsingh recommended standing on one foot while waiting in line at the grocery store. At home, try sitting up and down from a chair several times without using arm rests. While holding onto a chair or the wall, do three-way leg lifts on each side, lifting a leg to the front, side and then back. At the kitchen counter, take a few steps to the side in each direction.",
      "For general physical activity, which will improve balance as well as mood and overall health, the National Institute of Aging recommends at least 150 minutes per week. That should include a mixture of stretching to improve flexibility, an aerobic activity increasing the heart rate and strength training with weights or resistance bands.",
      "For balance-specific exercises, it\u2019s particularly important to do them regularly because it takes at least 50 hours of training to have a measurable impact, Hartley said. Besides strengthening the associated muscles, doing exercises repetitively for extended periods trains the brain to react properly when you slip or trip.",
      "\u201cJust like an athlete needs to do repetition to train for a sport, you\u2019re doing repetition to train for everyday balance activities,\u201d he said.",

      "It was a week of fire and ice.",
      "It began with millions of people across the U.S. shivering amid blizzard conditions and frigid air that lasted for days, thanks to a jet stream that slips out of its usual path more often these days. Then, catastrophe in California, with wind-whipped flames taking off in a landscape parched by months of drought to become Los Angeles' worst-ever wildfires.",
      "To cap it off, major weather monitoring agencies confirmed 2024 as the hottest year in global history. Even more dire, four of the six agencies said it was the first full year Earth went beyond a warming threshold seen as critical to limiting the worst effects of climate change.",
      "Welcome to one wild week of the climate crisis, scientists say. There will be more.",
      "\u201cFor the average person, this means the changes you\u2019re experiencing \u2014 more extreme weather, rising costs due to climate impacts, threats to food and water security \u2014 aren\u2019t anomalies,\u201d said Victor Gensini, a meteorology professor at Northern Illinois University. \u201cThey\u2019re the new normal unless we take action.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe last week of weird weather has been alarming,\u201d said Natalie Mahowald, chair of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Cornell University. \u201cI hope it\u2019s not a sign of things to come, because we\u2019ve barely seen any climate change compared to what we are going to get unless we radically cut CO2 emissions.\u201d",
      "Here's how the week unfolded.",
      "The cold came first.",
      "The Arctic is warming four times faster than the rest of the world, which means the difference between temperatures up north and down south are shrinking \u2014 along with sea ice that releases more heat into atmosphere. That means more energy bouncing off and warping or moving the polar vortex, scientists say. And climate change is also messing with the jet stream, the air currents that circle the globe.",
      "The result? More frequent blasts of intense cold in winter even as global temperatures heat up overall.",
      "The blizzard dumped more snow in some parts of Kansas than they usually get in a year, one Kansas State University meteorologist said. Ice-coated trees downed power lines in eastern Kentucky, and a U.S. Olympian skied on the National Mall in Washington.",
      "Farmers rushed to move cows to keep them from freezing to death and to feed and water them as rural roads became impassable. Travel stalled as multiple states warned motorists not to chance the treacherous snow and ice.",
      "About 200 people, many homeless, sheltered at a roller rink in Cincinnati. The alternative was frostbite or worse in exposure to temperatures that were expected to slip from freezing to sub-freezing overnight.",
      "Out West, wildfire took hold.",
      "The Palisades Fire erupted in the Santa Monica mountains and moved quickly on Santa Ana winds gusting to 100 mph \u2014 much faster than normal. The winds were so strong they grounded airplanes normally used to drop water on the flames.",
      "The blaze reached near the Getty Museum and by the end of the day, several celebrities, including Billy Crystal, Mandy Moore and Jhen\u00e9 Aiko, had lost homes. Less than 72 hours before, many stars had convened to walk the Golden Globes\u2019 red carpet.",
      "The Eaton Fire tore through Altadena, killing 2 people and closing about 10 school districts.",
      "Climate change laid the groundwork for California\u2019s megafires. Atmospheric rivers dumped huge amounts of water on the region that caused plenty of plant growth. Then, a fast onset of drought dried them out, providing plenty of fodder for the flames.",
      "The water system used to fight the Palisades fire in Los Angeles buckled in the morning, as some hydrants ran dry as they were overstressed without assistance from firefighting aircraft.",
      "The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power was pumping from aqueducts and groundwater into the system, but demand was so high that it wasn\u2019t enough to refill three 1-million gallon tanks in hilly Pacific Palisades. At least 1,000 buildings were engulfed in flames.",
      "The Sunset Fire started, too, threatening the Hollywood Hills and forcing mandatory evacuations in Hollywood.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump criticized state and local officials' water management policies. But experts said critics were connecting unrelated issues and spreading false information during a crisis.",
      "By the afternoon, calmer winds aided firefighters in making some headway, though by that point at least five fires were still active and some burned out of control in the L.A. area.",
      "Scenes of the destruction started to emerge. Recovery crews pulled a body from the rubble of a beachfront residence in Malibu.",
      "AccuWeather, a private company that provides data on weather and its impact, estimated the overall wildfire damage could reach $57 billion, though much of the destruction remains to be surveyed.",
      "At the same time, another winter storm bore down on the South, with warnings and advisories for at least 20 states. Many had gone through the same thing just days earlier.",
      "Major weather monitoring agencies said 2024 was the hottest since record-keeping began, easily passing 2023.",
      "Even more significant: 2024 was the first year with a global average that broke the long-term warming limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 1800s that was set as a goal by the 2015 Paris climate agreement.",
      "Extreme weather like this week's is \u201caffecting so many more people all at one time,\u201d said Barbara Hofer, a professor emerita of psychology at Middlebury College. \u201cIncreasingly, the scale is changing. The loss is mounting.\"",
      "Hofer said the growing impact may make some people deny climate change, ignore it or become numb to it as \u201ca way to avoid what's psychologically uncomfortable.\"",
      "Such a week can also energize positive change, she said. But Hofer said she thinks that will be harder, at least in the U.S., as Trump takes office. He's promised to halt federal climate action and repeal existing legislation aimed at the problem.",

      "A California man says his two cats died and a third was hospitalized after he fed them raw milk recalled for bird flu risk",
      "A California man whose two cats died after drinking raw milk recalled for bird flu risk says he meant to keep his beloved pets healthy, but his efforts tragically backfired.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s horrible when you realize that you\u2019re the one that actually gave them the milk that killed them,\u201d said Joseph Journell, 56, of San Bernardino.",
      "Journell lost his 14-year-old tabby, Alexander, and Tuxsie, a 4-year-old tuxedo cat, in late November. A third cat, 4-year-old Big Boy, was hospitalized for a week before tests showed the animal was infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus.",
      "The cats drank unpasteurized milk from lots recalled by Raw Farm, of Fresno, whose dairy products were pulled from California store shelves in December after health officials found the virus in milk for sale, he said. The animals' deaths were confirmed by state and county health officials. The cats were kept indoors, with no access to potentially infected birds, and ate conventional, not raw, pet food, the owner said.",
      "Journell said he had been drinking Raw Farm milk himself for several months because he heard it had \u201cbetter immunity and healing properties\u201d than pasteurized milk. He thought it might be able to help Alexander, who had been losing weight.",
      "\u201cI was trying to make him healthier and make him live longer,\u201d Journell said.",
      "Instead, Alexander died on Thanksgiving Day. Tuxsie followed two days later.",
      "Big Boy was hospitalized and treated with antiviral medications, Journell said. The veterinary team collected urine samples from the cat, which were confirmed positive for H5N1 at labs run by the U.S. Agriculture Department and Cornell University, records show.",
      "Big Boy returned home blind and without the use of his back legs, though he is recovering, Journell said. A fourth cat, Cleo, didn\u2019t drink the milk and remained healthy.",
      "Journell has demanded that Raw Farm owner Mark McAfee compensate him for the more than $12,000 he spent treating the cats, according Seattle food safety lawyer Ilana Korchia, who is representing him.",
      "In an interview, McAfee disputed that the virus was capable of sickening the animals days after it was bottled and sold, citing preliminary research.",
      "But Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital, said flu virus survival likely varies widely in different lots of milk. Experts with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention previously confirmed that cats that drank raw milk from infected cows developed neurological disease and died.",
      "\u201cI think the poor cats are the best indicator!\u201d Webby wrote in an email.",
      "Nearly a dozen cats in California have died since early December after consuming raw milk or raw pet food contaminated with bird flu, health officials have said.",
      "The infections have followed a massive outbreak of the bird flu virus in dairy cows, which has affected in more than 900 U.S. dairy herds in 16 states. About 80% of those herds are in California.",
      "Federal and state health officials have warned people not to drink raw milk because of the potential for infection with bird flu and a host of other germs. Officials also have cautioned pet owners to avoid feeding unpasteurized milk and raw meat diets to their animals.",
      "\u201cCats should not be fed any products from affected farms if those products have not been thoroughly cooked or pasteurized to kill the virus,\u201d the FDA warned last month.",
      "After the cats got sick, Journell said he fell ill himself and sought care at a Kaiser Permanente hospital in Fontana, Calif. He said he wasn't checked for bird flu, despite his known exposure to the virus, because medical staff didn't have tests available to detect it.",
      "A Kaiser spokesperson declined to comment on Journell's case specifically, but said the hospital system is following CDC guidelines for screening for bird flu.",
      "Journell has recovered physically but said he's still suffering from the \u201cmental anguish\" of losing his pets. Despite the ordeal, he said he still thinks raw milk offers some health benefits.",
      "Nevertheless, he won't be drinking it any time soon.",

      "\u2014 The flu, caused by influenza viruses that are always changing, leads to fever, chills, cough, sore throat, runny nose, body aches, headaches and feeling tired. Flu symptoms tend to hit more quickly than cold symptoms, and can last anywhere from a few days to two weeks.",

      "This is especially true after using the bathroom and eating or preparing food, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.",
      "Don't speed through it, either. Count to 20, slowly, while you scrub away.",

      "COVID-19 generally spreads through the air from droplets and particles, and the CDC says the risk of getting the virus from a contaminated surface is low.",
      "Viruses can spread through talking, coughing and sneezing, so cover your mouth with a tissue if you feel a tickle in your throat or your nose. Then, wash your hands. Again.",

      "Above all, if you're symptomatic, stay at home to keep from getting others sick.",
      "To treat a cold, flu or COVID-19, rest and drink fluids. You can take pain relievers to lower a fever or help with an achy body. Humidifiers can help with symptoms, too.",

    "summary": "The District of Columbia is suing the federal government over pollution in the Anacostia River, hoping it will lead to a cleanup of the urban waterway",
    "story": [
      "The District of Columbia is suing the federal government over pollution in the Anacostia River, hoping it will lead to a cleanup of the urban waterway",
      "The District of Columbia on Friday filed a lawsuit against the federal government over pollution in the Anacostia River, arguing it has inflicted \u201ccatastrophic harm\u201d on the mostly poor and minority communities living along the urban waterway.",
      "The lawsuit argues that federal government, which owns and controls the riverbed, has since the 1800s dumped toxic waste, heavy metals and chemicals including carcinogenic PCBs in the river and refused to clean it up. The 9-mile (14-kilometer) river flows through Washington, D.C. and parts of Maryland. For decades, it was treated as a municipal dumping ground for industrial waste, storm sewers and trash. That contamination largely affected communities of color.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that PCBs from the Washington Navy Yard were dumped in the river along with hazardous chemicals from the Kenilworth Landfill and chemical waste from federal printing facilities. It also blamed the federal government for poorly managing the District of Columbia's sewer system, which led to the dumping of raw sewage and toxic waste into the river.",
      "That pollution has led to swimming bans and warnings about fishing along the river, the lawsuit alleges, calling the federal government its biggest polluter.",
      "\u201cIt has systematically contaminated the River through the indiscriminate dumping and release of hazardous substances and through destructive dredge and fill operations,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb said pollutants in the river don't break down and cause long-lasting harm to the environment, aquatic wildlife, and human health, including cancer, neurological and developmental disorders and birth defects.",
      "The District of Columbia is demanding that the federal government pay for the river's cleanup.",
      "The lawsuit comes as the District of Columbia has made progress in cleaning up the river and returning to a time where residents fished and boated and wildlife including bald eagles, osprey, cranes, kingfishers and eel thrived there.",
      "A $3.29 billion sewer upgrade, including a series of tunnels drilled under the city to capture storm and sewage water, has reduced overflows into the river by 91%, according to DC Water, the city\u2019s water utility. The final section of the Anacostia Tunnel System went online in 2023, and the overall system is expected to reduce overflows by 98%.",
      "Pepco, the city\u2019s utility, also reached an agreement with the District of Columbia to pay more than $57 million for discharging hazardous chemicals from their power plants into soil, groundwater and storm sewers for decades that polluted the Anacostia and other areas. The settlement was believed to be the largest in the utility\u2019s history.",
      "The payments will be used in part to clean up the river. Other measures the city government instituted like a fee on plastic bags since 2009 have also helped keep trash out, experts say.",
      "Still, the Anacostia remains polluted. It received a failing grade for the third time in six years in 2023 from a nonprofit that grades the river\u2019s health based on its fecal bacteria content and the state of its aquatic vegetation.",

      "Setting boundaries at work can be tricky",
      "NEW YORK -- When Justin Stewart started his career, he juggled several jobs to make ends meet. He poured himself into his full-time role as a news show production assistant from 3 a.m. until noon. Then he rushed to the airport where he rented cars or to the big box stores where he pulled retail shifts.",
      "Sometimes, he slept in his car between jobs. Then he was hospitalized for exhaustion and a staph infection.",
      "\u201cWhile people around me praised my hustle, I eventually paid the price,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cThe doctor looked at me and said, \u2018I don\u2019t know what lifestyle you\u2019re living, but you\u2019re too young to be this stressed. You\u2019re going to have to quit something.'\"",
      "So Stewart, now 36, began setting boundaries. He gave up the side jobs, deciding he could survive without extra income. If people from the news show texted him after-hours, he let them know he was off-duty and where else to call.",
      "Setting boundaries at work, and in life, can be tricky. Many people find it difficult to say no, especially to a manager. Some get a sense of satisfaction from being needed or pleasing others.",
      "But learning to turn down a request or invitation is essential for protecting our physical and mental health, experts say. And as with any new skill, drawing boundaries gets easier with practice.",
      "Experts in well-being and organizational behavior, along with other workers, shared strategies for setting limits.",
      "Adding tasks to your calendar may seem counterintuitive if scaling back is the goal, but can provide more control over your time.",
      "Bobby Dutton, the founder of event production company GBM6, uses a technique he calls \u201caggressive calendering.\u201d He schedules the task he\u2019s most likely to procrastinate on, such as handling contracts and invoices, for every Monday at 2 p.m. To keep his calendar from becoming overloaded, he also books time for recurring routine tasks like making coffee, walking the dog and eating lunch.",
      "If you\u2019re unaccustomed to saying no, you can write down what you\u2019re going to say beforehand and rehearse it. Stewart worked on letting colleagues know when his assignment load began feeling too heavy with phrases like \u201cHey, this is a lot for me\" or \"You gave me seven stories, I think I can get four or five done.\u201d",
      "Cara Houser, a workplace engagement coach, says you don\u2019t have to explain yourself when declining a request. You can simply say you\u2019re not available at that time, followed by \u201cThanks for asking, and I hope to have more capacity next time.\u201d",
      "If the recipient of your \u201cno\u201d tries to argue, you can respond, \u201cI hear you feel that way. But for me, this is what I\u2019ve decided to do for that day,\u201d Houser said.",
      "Entrepreneur Amber Krasinski grew up in a working-class environment where saying no to a boss could mean losing a paycheck. As the founder of marketing company IvyHill Strategies, Krasinski worries she'll lose clients if she turns down a project. \u201cNot yet\u201d is her go-to phrase when one more project is too much.",
      "\u201cThat phrase has helped me through a lot of situations,\u201d she said.",
      "It can be tempting to agree immediately when we're asked to chip in. But there may be times when we're better off demurring. When faced with a new work request, take five minutes to assess your workload, energy level and priorities before responding, suggests Israa Nasir, a psychotherapist in New York.",
      "Nasir says a former boss frequently texted work-related questions at 10 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. \u201cI didn\u2019t say, \u2018Don\u2019t text me,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cI said, \u2019Can we check in on Fridays before the weekend? So everything that\u2019s on your mind, you can (tell me) and then I can plan my time accordingly.\u201d",
      "Pay attention to the activities and interactions that leave you feeling drained or overwhelmed, Nasir said. Put those kinds of events on a \u201cNo List.\" The list doesn't mean you decline every time you're asked, but don't say yes right away, she advises.",
      "Mobile devices make it easier to work from anywhere, and harder to draw boundaries. But there are ways to adjust our devices so they're less distracting.",
      "After noticing that she checked email far too frequently on weekends, Nasir starting moving the Gmail app from her iPhone\u2019s homepage to the second page from Friday night to Sunday night.",
      "An email signature is another tool you can use to manage expectations, by publishing working hours or upcoming vacation schedules, said Candice Pokk, a senior consultant in organizational effectiveness at Segal Consulting.",
      "Pokk includes a \u201cWell Being Notice\u201d at the bottom of her emails which reads, \u201cReceiving this email outside normal working hours? Managing a work-life balance is unique for everyone. I have sent this email at a time that works for me. Please respond at a time that works for you.\u201d",
      "With the popularity of online meeting software, it's easy for others to overload your calendar with invitations. Accepting every one can leave little time for other work.",
      "Janine Pelosi, CEO of Oslo-based video technology company Neat, thinks workers should be able to leave a meeting that's not relevant to them, if it's an environment where that's accepted.",
      "If you're unsure it's worthwhile to attend, you can request an agenda in advance, or ask what is the desired outcome, she said.",
      "Publisher Lori Perkins, 65, was working 12 to 16 hours daily when a cancer diagnosis halted her routine. During chemotherapy, she could only muster up enough energy to put in four hours a day, and even then felt like she was working \u201cin a vat of molasses.\u201d",

      "BANGKOK -- Nearly all of the world\u2019s 35,000 online pharmacies are being run illegally and consumers who use them risk getting ineffective or dangerous drugs, according to the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s annual report on \u201c notorious markets.\u201d The report also singled out 19 countries over concerns about counterfeit or pirated products.",
      "The report also named about three dozen online retailers, many of them in China or elsewhere in Asia that it said are allegedly engaged in selling counterfeit products or other illegal activities.",
      "The report says 96% of online pharmacies were found to be violating the law, many operating without a license and selling medicines without prescriptions and safety warnings.",
      "Their websites often look like legitimate e-commerce platforms, often with false claims that they are approved by the Food and Drug Administration, said the report, released Wednesday. The FDA and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration have both issued warnings about risks of buying prescription medicines from such sources.",
      "It cited a survey by the Alliance for Safe Online Pharmacies\u2019 Global Foundation that found nearly one in four Americans who have used online pharmacies reported having encountered substandard, fake or harmful medicines.",
      "Last year, Federal prosecutors reported that a network of illegal drug sellers based in the U.S., the Dominican Republic and India had packaged potentially deadly synthetic opioids into pills disguised as common prescription drugs and sold millions of them through fake online drugstores, federal prosecutors said Monday. At least nine people died of narcotics poisoning between August 2023 and June 2024 after consuming the counterfeit pills, the indictment said.",
      "Apart from the risks of using drugs that may contain inert ingredients or those that could cause allergies, the medicines are sometimes made in unsanitary conditions, said the report, which did not give annual statistics for those who may have died or otherwise been harmed.",
      "The USTR\u2019s annual report cited examples from inside the United States, but and also mentioned risks of imported ingredients including fentanyl from China. Many of the illicit online pharmacies are based outside the U.S.",
      "The \u201cNotorious Markets List\u201d did laud progress in fighting counterfeit and pirated goods.",
      "In one case, U.S. authorities, industry groups and the police collaborated in shutting down a Hanoi, Vietnam-based piracy ring, Fmovies, and other related piracy sites, in July and August.",
      "The report said the world\u2019s then-largest pirated movies site had drawn more than 6.7 billion visits from January 2023 to June 2024.",
      "In another Vietnam-linked case, two people operating pirate television platform BestBuyIPTV were convicted and ordered to pay fines and forfeit property.",
      "The report also cited crackdowns on online piracy in Brazil and the United Kingdom and busts of sellers of counterfeit purses, clothing and shoes in Kuwait.",
      "But problems remain with cyberlockers that thwart efforts to restrict piracy of movies and other content and of so-called \u201cbulletproof\u201d internet service providers, or ISPs, that promise people using them leeway for using pirate sites, it said.",
      "One such ISP is Avito, a Russian-based ad platform that allegedly lets sellers advertise counterfeit products.",
      "Baidu Wangpan, a cloud storage service of China\u2019s largest search engine provider, Baidu, was named for allegedly failing to enforce or being slow to act on copyright protection.",
      "The report also pointed to social-commerce site Pinduoduo and to Douyin Mall, a Chinese online platform owned by Tiktok owner ByteDance. It said the shopping platforms have sought to build up protections but that they still host many counterfeit goods.",
      "It also named Shopee, a Singapore-based online and mobile e-commerce site, saying some country-focused platforms serving Southeast Asia and South American had better track records in fighting piracy than others.",
      "IndiaMART, an big business-to-business marketplace in India, still offers a slew of counterfeit products, it said.",
      "While a large share of theft of intellectual property has moved online, the report also highlighted real world locations notorious for selling counterfeit products, including markets in Turkey, bazaars in the United Arab Emirates and Saigon Square Shopping Mall in Vietnam\u2019s Ho Chi Minh City.",
      "The report said Bangkok\u2019s MBK Center, a huge mall of about 2,000 stores, had actively cracked down on counterfeiting, though such products still can be found there."

      "MADRID -- Spain is planning a raft of measures to address its brewing housing crisis, including an up to 100% tax on properties that non-European Union residents buy.",
      "Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez announced the plan this week which will tackle housing affordability and high rents in the Southern European nation. He said the overall goal was to provide \u201cmore housing, better regulation and greater aid.\u201d",
      "However, it remains unclear if the plan put forth by S\u00e1nchez\u2019s minority coalition would pass in Parliament.",
      "Here's a look at what's happening:",
      "Like most rich countries, Spain is in the throes of a growing housing affordability problem. Skyrocketing rents are particularly acute in cities like Barcelona and Madrid, where incomes have failed to keep up, especially for young people. Housing prices are also steadily rising, especially in cities and coastal areas.",
      "Rental prices have also been driven up by short-term rentals mainly offered for tourists. Spain receives more tourists than almost any country in the world with more than 88.5 million people having visited the country in 2024.",
      "The negative side to tourism, or \u201covertourism,\u201d has at times sparked tension between visitors and residents concerned about rising rental prices, the proliferation of short-term rentals on platforms, like AirBnB, and water supplies that can be stretched in some parts of the country, including the popular Canary and Balearic islands.",
      "Last year, protestors took to the streets on various occasions across the country to raise concerns about the growth of tourism and high rental prices. Barcelona\u2019s town hall has pledged to completely eliminate all short-term rentals to tourists in the coming years.",
      "Spain plans to limit the number of homes foreigners purchase by raising taxes on homes bought by non-European Union residents by up to 100%.",
      "Non-EU residents bought 27,000 properties in Spain in 2023, S\u00e1nchez said while announcing the plan, \u201cnot to live in\u201d but \u201cto make money from.\"",
      "S\u00e1nchez did not provide a timeline or details on how he plans to implement the tax.",
      "Other measures proposed include higher taxes on holiday rentals and a tax break for landlords who provide affordable housing in high-rent areas.",
      "The rising cost of living has driven voter discontent across many wealthy countries in recent years, including the United States.",
      "But as one of Europe\u2019s leading Socialist politicians, the housing crunch is a crucial question for S\u00e1nchez to resolve as he tries to keep his left-wing minority coalition afloat after winning four-year another term in 2023.",

      "A prominent opposition figure in Uganda will stand trial on the serious charge of treachery, a military court ruled Tuesday, escalating the legal trouble Kizza Besigye faces ahead of presidential elections scheduled for 2026",
      "KAMPALA, Uganda -- A prominent opposition figure in Uganda will stand trial on the serious charge of treachery, a military court ruled Tuesday, escalating the legal trouble Kizza Besigye faces ahead of presidential elections scheduled for 2026.",
      "Treachery carries the death penalty for those convicted.",
      "Besigye, who has contested the presidency four times, went missing in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, on Nov. 16. Days later, he and his co-accused, an assistant named Obeid Lutale, appeared before a military court in Kampala, the Ugandan capital.",
      "Besigye was charged with illegal possession of a firearm and a charge relating to the alleged solicitation of military support overseas in order to destabilize national security. Besigye, who denied the charges, has since been remanded in custody.",
      "A military prosecutor on Monday amended the charge sheet to include treachery and introduce a third suspect, who is a serving army officer, surprising defense attorneys who then challenged the move.",
      "Besigye, 68, has faced arrest and assault many times in his political career. But he\u2019s never been convicted of a crime.",
      "Amnesty International has called for Besigye\u2019s release, saying his \u201cabduction clearly violated international human rights law and the process of extradition with its requisite fair trial protections.\u201d",
      "Besigye\u2019s trial is \u201cthe latest example of Uganda\u2019s authorities misusing military courts and military-related charges to clamp down on the opposition,\u201d according to Human Rights Watch.",
      "The unfolding trial of Besigye is being watched closely by Ugandans anxious over political maneuvers ahead of presidential elections. Although Yoweri Museveni, who has held power since 1986, is expected to seek re-election, some observers believe he may step aside.",
      "Museveni has no obvious successor within the ranks of the ruling National Resistance Movement party, one reason for widespread fears over an unpredictable political transition.",
      "Besigye, a qualified physician who retired from Uganda\u2019s military at the rank of colonel, is a former president of the opposition Forum for Democratic Change, or FDC, party. With Besigye at its helm, the FDC was for many years Uganda\u2019s most prominent opposition group. He is a fierce critic of Museveni, for whom he once served as military assistant and personal doctor before they fell out in the 1990s over what Besigye said was Museveni\u2019s slide into authoritarianism.",
      "Museveni has long been criticized by human rights groups over alleged violations against opposition figures.",
      "Uganda has not witnessed a peaceful transfer of power since independence from British colonial rule in 1962."

      "Rescuers have sent a cage-like structure into one of South Africa\u2019s deepest gold mines to bring out survivors among hundreds of illegal miners trapped for months in an abandoned shaft",
      "STILFONTEIN, South Africa -- Rescuers sent a cage-like structure down into one of South Africa\u2019s deepest gold mines on Tuesday to bring out survivors among hundreds of illegal miners trapped for months in an abandoned shaft. More than 100 are believed to have died of starvation or dehydration.",
      "Civic organizations and groups representing the miners say that at least 24 bodies and 34 survivors have been brought out of the Buffelsfontein Gold Mine since Friday, but more than 500 miners are still believed to be underground, many of them ill and starving. Police said they are uncertain how many remain, but it is likely to be hundreds.",
      "Six of the bodies and eight survivors were recovered early Tuesday, said Mzukisi Jam, the regional chairperson of the South African National Civics Organization, an umbrella for civic and rights groups. Jam was at the mine.",
      "The mine near the town of Stilfontein, southwest of Johannesburg, has been the scene of a tense standoff between police, miners and members of the local community since November, when authorities first launched an operation to try and force the miners out. Relatives of the miners say some of them have been underground since July.",
      "Authorities say the miners are able to come out and are refusing, but that has been disputed by rights groups and activists, who have fiercely criticized police tactics in cutting off the miners' food and water supplies from the surface in an attempt to force them out. The rights groups say many of the miners are dying of starvation and unable to climb out because the shaft is too steep and the ropes and pulley system they used to enter have been removed.",
      "\u201cWe are happy that this (rescue) operation is happening, even though we believe that if it was done earlier, we wouldn\u2019t even have one dead person,\u201d Jam said.",
      "Illegal mining is common in parts of gold-rich South Africa where companies close down mines that are no longer profitable, leaving groups of informal miners to illegally enter them to try and find leftover deposits.",
      "Large groups of illegal miners often go underground for months to maximize their profits, taking food, water, generators and other equipment with them, but also relying on others in their group on the surface to send down more supplies.",
      "Some have escaped from the mine since November and been arrested, authorities have confirmed, although the exact number is not clear. Police say the miners are afraid of being arrested if they come out.",
      "Rights activists said the only way out is for miners to make a dangerous trek to another shaft, which can take days, and crawl out there. They said many of the miners are too weak or ill to climb out. The mine is 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) deep and has multiple shafts, many levels and is a maze of tunnels, and the community mining group said there are numerous groups of miners in various parts of the mine.",
      "Residents have gathered near the mine desperately waiting for news on family members. The community organized its own rescue operation on Friday before the official one by authorities began Monday.",
      "\u201cThe last time I spoke to my brother was in July, when he told us that he is going underground,\" said Zinzi Tom, a sister of one of the miners who remained underground. \"We had not heard anything from him, but yesterday one of the miners who surfaced said he saw him about two weeks ago. Apparently he is very sick and he is struggling to survive.\u201d",
      "The Mining Affected Communities United in Action group, which took authorities to court in December to force them to allow food, water and medicine to be sent down to the miners, released two cellphone videos which they said were from underground and showed dozens of dead bodies of miners wrapped in plastic. A spokesman for the group said \u201ca minimum\u201d of 100 miners had died.",
      "The cellphone videos purportedly from the depths of the mine are filmed by a man who can be heard saying, \u201cThis is hunger. People are dying because of hunger,\u201d as he records emaciated-looking men sitting on the damp floor of the mine. He adds: \u201cPlease help us. Bring us food or take us out.\u201d",
      "South Africa's minister of police and minister of mineral resources were due to visit the mine on Tuesday, while authorities have come under scrutiny for their tactics.",
      "South African Cabinet Minister Khumbudzo Ntshavheni told reporters in November that the government would not help the miners, which they considered \u201ccriminals.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are not sending help to criminals,\" she said, according to local media. \u201cWe are going to smoke them out. They will come out.\u201d",

      "A Philippine security official says China is \u201cpushing us to the wall\u201d with growing aggression in the disputed South China Sea and warned that \u201call options are on the table\u201d for Manila\u2019s response, including new international lawsuits",
      "MANILA, Philippines -- A Philippine security official said Tuesday that China is \u201cpushing us to the wall\u201d with growing aggression in the disputed South China Sea and warned that \u201call options are on the table\u201d for Manila's response, including new international lawsuits.",
      "On Tuesday, a large Chinese coast guard ship patrolled hotly disputed Scarborough Shoal and then sailed toward the northwestern coast of the Philippines, coming as close as 77 nautical miles (143 kilometers), Philippine officials said in a news conference.",
      "\"The presence of the monster ship in Filipino waters \u2026 77 nautical miles from our shoreline, is unacceptable and, therefore, it should be withdrawn immediately by the Chinese government,\u201d Jonathan Malaya, assistant director-general of the National Security Council, said at the news conference alongside senior military and coast guard officials.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re pushing us to the wall,\u201d Malaya said of China.",
      "Two Philippine coast guard ships, backed by a small surveillance aircraft, repeatedly ordered the 165-meter (541-foot) Chinese coast guard ship to withdraw from the Philippines' exclusive economic zone, a 200-nautical mile (370-kilometer) stretch of water, Philippine coast guard Commodore Jay Tarriela said.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing there is, hour-by-hour and day-to-day, (we're) challenging the illegal presence of the Chinese coast guard for the international community to know that we\u2019re not going to allow China to normalize the illegal deployment,\" Tarriela said.",
      "There was no immediate comment from Chinese officials. In the past, they have repeatedly accused the Philippines and other rival claimant states including Vietnam and Malaysia of encroaching on what they say are \u201cundisputed\u201d Chinese territorial waters.",
      "Under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who took office in mid-2022, the Philippines has aggressively defended its territorial interests in the South China Sea, a key global trading route. That has brought Philippine forces into frequent confrontations with China\u2019s coast guard, navy and suspected militia boats and sparked fears that a bigger armed conflict could draw in the United States, the Philippines\u2019 longtime treaty ally and China\u2019s regional rival.",
      "The lopsided conflict has forced the Philippines to seek security arrangements with other Asian and Western countries, including Japan, with which it signed a key agreement last July which would allow their forces to hold joint combat training. The pact, which must be ratified by lawmakers of both countries before it takes effect, was the first such agreement to be forged by Japan in Asia.",
      "China surrounded Scarborough Shoal with its coast guard and other ships after a tense territorial standoff with the Philippines in 2012. The Philippines responded by bringing its disputes with China to international arbitration in 2013 and largely won three years later when an arbitration panel in The Hague invalidated China\u2019s expansive claims in the busy sea passage under the 1982 United Convention on the Law of the Sea.",
      "China has rejected the 2016 arbitration ruling and continues to openly defy it.",
      "\u201cWill this lead to another case?\u201d Malaya said. \u201cAll options are on the table because the closer the monster ship is in Philippine waters, the more it makes tensions high and the more that the Philippine government contemplates things it was not contemplating before.\u201d",
      "China has warned the Philippines from pursuing another legal case in an international forum after the arbitration, preferring bilateral negotiations, which give Beijing an advantage because of its size and clout, a senior Philippine official has said on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authority to discuss such sensitive issues publicly.",
      "The two countries have also been discussing their territorial conflicts under a bilateral consultation mechanism to avoid an escalation of the disputes. The next round of talks will be hosted by China, the official said."

      "PARIS -- France\u2019s new prime minister, Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, is facing his first major test at parliament on Tuesday as his government has no majority amid unprecedented political instability.",
      "Bayrou will address lawmakers through a general policy speech meant to outline his top priorities, including key budget decisions, one month after he was appointed by President Emmanuel Macron.",
      "Bayrou urgently needs to pass a budget bill for 2025. Following the collapse of the previous government, an emergency law has been approved to enable the state to levy taxes from Jan. 1, pay basic expenses and avoid a shutdown.",
      "But only a proper budget would help reduce France\u2019s deficit and allow key expenses such as defense measures needed amid the war in Ukraine or aid promised to angry farmers.",
      "Financial markets, ratings agencies and the European Commission are pushing France to comply with EU rules limiting debt and keep France\u2019s borrowing costs from spiraling. That would threaten the prosperity of eurozone countries.",
      "France's deficit is estimated to reach 6% of its gross domestic product in 2024. Finance Minister \u00c9ric Lombard said last week the government is \u201caiming for a deficit of between 5 and 5.5%\u201d this year.",
      "When he took office, Bayrou said that \u201cno one knows the difficulty of the situation better\u201d than he does, comparing the challenges faced to an \u201cHimalaya.\u201d",
      "Bayrou\u2019s Cabinet relies on a fragile deal between Macron\u2019s centrist allies and conservatives of The Republicans party who even together have no parliamentary majority.",
      "The previous government was in place for only three months before being brought down by opposition lawmakers from both the left and the far right amid a budget dispute.",
      "To avoid a repetition of that scenario, Bayrou seeks to secure a nonaggression pact with the Socialists so that they wouldn\u2019t support any future move to topple the new government.",
      "The Socialists said they are open to talks on the condition that they would include negotiations on Macron's unpopular pension reform that passed two years ago.",
      "However, the possibility of another no-confidence vote is still looming.",
      "The hard-left France Unbowed party refused to enter into talks with the government and already announced it would file a no-confidence motion.",
      "A vote later this week would have little chance of succeeding as the far right appears unwilling to support such move in the immediate term.",
      "Yet the question could be raised again during the future budget debate at parliament, with more uncertainty on the result.",
      "Macron\u2019s plan to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 unleashed months of mass protests from January to June 2023 that damaged his leadership. The legislation, which has gradually started being implemented, also requires people to work 43 years to receive a full pension.",
      "The Socialists are now urging Bayrou to announce a \u201csuspension\u201d of the reform in order to provide time to renegotiate it, with the aim of backtracking on the age of 64 and introducing specific measures for those who have long careers and certain professions considered to be hard work.",
      "A suspension, if it was to be announced, would prompt anger on the other side of the political spectrum, possibly weakening Bayrou\u2019s government even further.",
      "The conservative Senate president, G\u00e9rard Larcher, warned that the pension measures shouldn't be suspended or rescinded.",
      "\u201cIf we were to repeal the pension reform, the cost would be 3.4 billion euros ($3,47 billion) in 2025 and almost 16 billion ($16.3 billion) in 2032,\u201d he said.",
      "Far-right leader Marine Le Pen \u2014 Macron\u2019s fiercest rival \u2014 was instrumental in ousting the previous government.",
      "Bayrou consulted her when forming the new government, and Le Pen remains a powerful force. Her National Rally party has the largest single group in the National Assembly, France's powerful lower house of parliament.",
      "In recent days, Bayrou's government sought to sideline Le Pen by negotiating instead with the Socialists, the Greens and the Communists on budget issues.",
      "The president of the National Rally, Jordan Bardella, criticized those talks and warned Monday that his party would oppose any budget that would raise the cost of medication, provide more health care for migrants staying illegally in the country and impose new taxes on businesses. Such measures would justify a no-confidence vote, he said.",
      "But Le Pen faces her own headaches in the months to come \u2014 a March court ruling over alleged illegal party financing could see her barred from running for office.",

      "THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- On Dutch Openness Day, this year\u2019s release of secret documents from state archives suddenly left Peter Baas with fundamental questions about his father\u2019s stature as a World War II resistance fighter.",
      "While many were cleaning up the mess from New Year\u2019s Eve fireworks on Jan. 1, hundreds of thousands of others in the Netherlands looked for their relatives in a new database containing the names of some 425,000 people investigated for collaboration with the Nazis from 1940-45.",
      "Some looked out of curiosity, others out of concern.",
      "One of those names was Ludolf Baas, a resistance fighter who taped microfilm of Nazi atrocities to his body and smuggled it over enemy lines. \u201cWhen I saw my father\u2019s name, I was shocked,\u201d Peter Baas told The Associated Press. He wondered if his father\u2019s legacy was a lie and needed to find out if one of society's ugliest stigmas would also stick to him.",
      "\u201cThe publication of the list of names has caused great social unrest,\u201d the NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies, said in a statement Friday. The research organization, founded days after the Netherlands was liberated, has called for the government to intervene.",
      "Nazi collaboration is a controversial topic in the Netherlands and much of Europe and is often shrouded in family mystery and stifled under a cloak of silence. Initially, the Netherlands was long seen as a welcoming safe haven for persecuted groups. Many Jewish families, like that of famed diarist Anne Frank, fled Germany in the 1930s for the relative safety of their Dutch neighbors.",
      "That changed when the Dutch surrendered to the Germans in 1940. Only 27% of the Dutch Jewish population survived the war, significantly less than the survival rate in France and Belgium and collaboration made persecution easier.",
      "Eight decades after the war ended, many still worry about what that legacy means.",

      "Originally, the National Archive wanted to make much more than just the names of suspects public. The organization had been working to digitize and publish all 30 million pages of materials, from secret police records to witness statements, on a newly created website.",
      "Just before Christmas though, after a formal warning from the Dutch privacy watchdog that releasing the records would violate EU privacy rules, Dutch education minister Eppo Bruins intervened. Now, only the names and corresponding file numbers are immediately available.",

      "\u201cThis is a very complicated way to get your family history,\u201d Baas said.",

      "Pope Francis' autobiography is being released Tuesday",
      "ROME -- An introspective Pope Francis has divulged some of the behind-the-scenes dynamics of the secret 2013 conclave that elected him pope and the resistance he has encountered ever since, in his autobiography being released Tuesday that also doubles down on some of his more controversial decisions as pontiff.",
      "\u201cHope: The Autobiography\u201d was only supposed to be published after Francis\u2019 death. But at his own request, the book is hitting bookshelves now in more than 80 countries to coincide with the start of the church's Holy Year.",
      "Its publishers say it\u2019s the first autobiography ever written by a sitting pope, though Francis has collaborated with plenty of other memoir-type books before, and much of his papacy and personal backstory are already well known.",
      "But \u201cHope\u201d does provide personal insights into how history\u2019s first Latin American pope interprets his childhood in Buenos Aires and how it has informed his priorities as pope. Drawn from conversations over six years with Italian journalist Carlo Musso, \u201cHope\u201d offers Francis\u2019 own sometimes unflattering assessments of decisions he made or things he regrets \u2014 at least before he became pope.",
      "It\u2019s almost confessional at times, an 88-year-old Jesuit performing the Ignatian examination of his conscience at the end of his life to identify things he said or did that he now realizes could have been done better. Whether it\u2019s the time when he insisted that a schoolmate pay to repair a bike he had broken, or knocked another schoolmate nearly unconscious, he seems deeply ashamed of his younger self and says he still doesn\u2019t believe himself worthy of the papacy.",
      "\u201cIf I consider what is the greatest gift that I desire from the Lord, and have experienced, it is the gift of shame,\u201d he writes at one point.",
      "Curiously, two periods of Bergoglio\u2019s past which have remained somewhat mysterious to outsiders are once again avoided in \u201cHope.\u201d One concerns his stint in C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina from 1990-1992. Francis has never really explained the internal Jesuit dynamics that resulted in him being exiled to work as a confessor at the Jesuit church more than a decade after he was provincial of the order in Argentina. The period is mentioned only in passing when Francis refers simply to \u201cthe dark night at C\u00f3rdoba.\u201d",
      "The other period of unknown in Bergoglio\u2019s backstory concerns the time he spent in Germany doing research on the theologian Romano Guardini for a dissertation he never finished.",
      "Also given short shrift was the impact of the clergy sexual abuse scandal, which convulsed his papacy for several years. The scandal exploded during Francis\u2019 2018 trip to Chile and the pope mentions the scandal briefly in the book. But he spends far more time recalling a more heart-warming memory from the Chile trip, when he married a pair of flight attendants on board the papal plane during the flight to Iquique.",
      "The second half of the book, focusing on the papacy, is far less self-critical and in fact is strident in defending his sometimes controversial decisions. It is here that Francis provides further details of his emotions as the votes started going his way on the second day of balloting during the March 2013 conclave that elected him pope.",
      "Francis reveals that he was among those cardinals receiving \u201cstopgap votes\u201d in the first rounds, when cardinals toss out votes to see which way the balloting winds are heading. He says he wasn\u2019t keeping count in the early rounds but realized that his fate was sealed once he got 69 votes on the fourth ballot, out of the 77 needed for a two-thirds majority of the 115 cardinals.",
      "The fifth ballot \u2013 the one that made him pope -- actually had to be done twice. An extra ballot paper got stuck to one that a cardinal had filled out, so that when the papers were counted there were 116 rather than 115. The papers were burned without having even been opened and a new fifth ballot called.",
      "\u201cWhen my name was pronounced for the seventy-seventh time, there was a burst of applause, while the reading of the votes went on,\u201d he writes. \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly how many votes there were in the end, I was no longer listening, the noise covered the voice of the scrutineer.\u201d",
      "One of the first things he did after the vote was to embrace Cardinal Angelo Scola, the archbishop of Milan who had been such a favorite going into the conclave that the Italian bishops conference had dummied up a press release announcing his election. \u201cHe deserved that embrace,\u201d Francis writes.",
      "Once in the sacristy, known as the \u201cRoom of Tears,\u201d to be outfitted with the papal garb, Francis reveals that he had in his pocket his old episcopal ring which he used, suggesting that he had an intuition getting dressed in the morning that he would indeed be elected.",
      "\u201cThe red shoes? No, I have orthopedic shoes. I\u2019m rather flat-footed,\u201d he writes of his sartorioal choices that night. Nor did he want the red velvet cape, known as a mozzetta, favored by his predecessor. \u201cThey were not for me. Two days later they told me I would have to change my trousers, wear white ones. They made me laugh. I don\u2019t want to be an ice cream seller, I said. And I kept my own.\u201d",
      "Those looking for current Vatican gossip in \u201cHope\u201d will be somewhat disappointed, as Francis only fleetingly touches on the more controversial parts of his papacy. He is far more certain of his decisions made as pope, even doubling down on blasting traditionalist Catholic priests as rigid and mentally unstable.",
      "\u201cThis rigidity is often accompanied by elegant and costly tailoring, lace, fancy trimmings, rochets. Not a taste for tradition but clerical ostentation,\u201d he writes. \u201cThese ways of dressing up sometimes conceal mental imbalance, emotional deviation, behavioral difficulties, a personal problem that may be exploited.\u201d",
      "He writes that the reform of the Vatican bureaucracy, particularly the effort to impose international accounting and budgeting standards on its finances, have been the most difficult task of his papacy and one that generated \u201cthe greatest resistance to change.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have been summoned to a battle,\" he writes.",
      "He strongly defends his decision to authorize a sweeping trial of 10 people, including a cardinal, accused of alleged financial misconduct related to an investment in a London property. The trial resulted in several convictions, but also cost the Holy See reputational harm, given questions about whether the defendants received a fair trial and Francis\u2019 own role in the saga.",
      "\u201cThe decisions that I made in that respect were not easy, I was sure there would be problems, but I also know that the truth must never be hidden and being opaque is always the worst choice,\u201d he writes.",
      "After African bishops unanimously rejected his approval of gay blessings, Francis stands by his decision and insists that the blessing is for the people, not the relationship. \u201cHomosexuality is not a crime,\u201d he writes, repeating a statement he first made in a 2023 interview with The Associated Press.",

      "Tens of thousands of naked Hindu ascetics and millions of pilgrims are taking dips in sacred rivers in the first of a series of major baths in the Maha Kumbh festival, the largest religious congregation on Earth",
      "PRAYAGRAJ, India -- Tens of thousands of naked Hindu ascetics and millions of pilgrims took dips in freezing water at the confluence of sacred rivers in northern India on Tuesday, in the first of a series of major baths in the Maha Kumbh festival, the largest religious congregation on Earth.",
      "Holding tridents, swords, spears and small two-headed drums, ash-smeared Hindu holy men marched and rode chariots at sunrise toward the confluence of the Ganges, Yamuna and mythical Saraswati rivers in the northern city of Prayagraj. The men \u2014 with matted dreadlocks and crowns of marigolds \u2014 chanted religious slogans praising Hindu deity Lord Shiva on the way to the bathing site in a large procession with singing, drumming and blowing of horns.",
      "Millions of Hindu pilgrims followed them into the confluence.",
      "The Maha Kumbh festival \u2014 held every 12 years \u2014 started Monday, with more than 15 million pilgrims bathing in the holy rivers, according to officials. Over about the next six weeks, the festival is expected to draw more than 400 million people, many of whom will take part in elaborate rituals.",
      "Hindus believe that bathing at the confluence will cleanse them of their sins and release them from the cycle of rebirth.",
      "Among the bathers was Venkatesh Ramaling, a tech specialist from southern Pune city.",
      "\u201cIt is amazing to see how people are just diving in such cold water. People have such strong faith here, and looking at them I feel inspired,\u201d Ramaling said. \u201cAfter taking the bath, I feel really good and full of positivity.\"",
      "The festival has its roots in a Hindu tradition that says the god Vishnu wrested a golden pitcher containing the nectar of immortality from demons. Hindus believe that a few drops fell in the cities of Prayagraj, Nasik, Ujjain and Haridwar \u2014 the four places where the Kumbh festival has been held for centuries.",
      "The Kumbh rotates among the four pilgrimage sites about every three years on a date determined by the cosmic alignment of the sun, moon and Jupiter.",
      "This year\u2019s festival is the biggest and grandest of them all.",
      "Authorities have built a sprawling tented city on the riverbanks to accommodate the holy men, pilgrims and tourists visiting the festival. The government has provided more than $765 million for the event, hoping to impress India\u2019s largely Hindu population and draw visitors from around the world.",
      "\u201cIt is some culmination, some distillation of so much spiritual pursuit, so it is fascinating to see everyone with one purpose,\" said Stephen Barker, a New York-based artist who was at the festival.",
      "The tent city is equipped with 3,000 kitchens and 150,000 toilets. About 50,000 security personnel are also stationed in the city to maintain law and order and crowd management.",
      "On Tuesday, millions thronged to the riverbanks, with some carrying clothes, blankets and food on their heads and others lugging wheeled bags. Entire families and groups of people from faraway villages marched in huge lines as security personnel blared warnings to avoid stampedes that have marred the festival in the past.",
      "Rajnish Diwedi, a senior police official who oversees security at the festival, said at least 2,700 cameras, some powered by AI, are being used to send crowd movement and density information to four central control rooms, where officials can quickly deploy personnel. Police are also using automated systems to avoid stampedes, he said.",
      "Groups of Hindu ascetics have set up sprawling camps at the site, with tens of thousands of pilgrims visiting them to hear religious discourses and attend prayers. These ascetics \u2014 called Naga Sadhus \u2014 are part of religious orders that were once mercenary armies who generally revere Hinduism\u2019s Lord Shiva.",
      "Sri Digambar Ishwargiri, a Naga Sadhu who traveled from western Junagadh city, about 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) from Prayagraj, said a dip in the holy waters is a step toward attaining salvation. He sat cross-legged beside a small wood fire and a ceremonial trident inside a tent as devotees visited him for blessings.",
      "\u201cThis is the holy place for salvation,\u201d Ishwargiri said, adding that ascetics like him are \u201csoldiers of the Hindu religion.\u201d",
      "\"We safeguard our faith,\u201d he said.",
      "Bathing takes place every day at the site, but on the most auspicious dates, Hindu ascetics charge toward the holy rivers at dawn.",
      "Many pilgrims also stay for the entire festival, observing austerity, giving alms and bathing at sunrise every day. The river baths, prayer, meditation and yoga sessions and other religious rituals are organized by Hindu ascetics and supported with public funds.",

      "The top aide of impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol has pleaded with law enforcement to abandon their efforts to detain him over last month\u2019s martial law imposition, as authorities prepared a second attempt to take him into custody",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- The top aide of impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol pleaded with law enforcement on Tuesday to abandon their efforts to detain him over last month\u2019s martial law imposition, as authorities prepared a second attempt to take him into custody.",
      "In his statement, presidential chief of staff Chung Jin-suk said Yoon could instead be questioned at a \u201cthird site\u201d or at his residence and claimed that the anti-corruption agency and police were trying to drag him out like he was a member of a \u201cSouth American drug cartel.\u201d",
      "However, Yoon Kab-keun, one of the president\u2019s lawyers, said Chung issued the message without consulting them and that the legal team has no immediate plans to make the president available for questioning by investigators.",
      "Yoon Suk Yeol has not left his official residence in Seoul for weeks, and the presidential security service prevented dozens of investigators from detaining Yoon after a nearly six-hour standoff on Jan. 3.",
      "The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials and police pledged more forceful measures to detain Yoon while they jointly investigate whether Yoon\u2019s brief martial law declaration on Dec. 3 amounted to an attempted rebellion. The National Police Agency has convened multiple meetings of field commanders in Seoul and nearby Gyeonggi province in recent days to plan the detainment efforts and the size of those forces fueled speculation that more than a thousand officers could be deployed in a possible multiday operation. The agency and police have openly warned that presidential bodyguards obstructing the execution of the warrant could be arrested on site.",
      "The anti-corruption agency and police haven\u2019t confirmed when they would return to the presidential residence, which has been fortified with barbed wire and rows of vehicles blocking paths. But Chung said he understood \u201cD-day\u201d to be Wednesday, without specifying the information he had.",
      "Anti-corruption agency and police officials met with representatives of the presidential security service Tuesday morning for unspecified discussions regarding efforts to execute the detention warrant for Yoon, the agency said. It wasn't immediately clear whether they any kind of compromise was reached.",
      "The country\u2019s acting leader, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, had raised concerns on Monday about potential clashes between authorities and the presidential security service, which, despite a court warrant for Yoon\u2019s detention, has insisted it\u2019s obligated to protect the president.",
      "The anti-corruption agency and police have \u201ccompleted preparations for a siege,\u201d Chung said. \u201cThey are ready to tear down the walls at any moment and handcuff President Yoon Suk Yeol, who remains isolated in his residence in Hannam-dong and forcibly remove him,\u201d he added, accusing investigators of trying to humiliate the president.",
      "\u201cThousands of citizens are staying up through the night in front of the presidential residence, vowing to protect the president. If a conflict were to break out between the police and citizens, an unimaginable tragedy could occur.\u201d",
      "Over the past two weeks, thousands of anti-Yoon and pro-Yoon supporters have gathered daily at competing rallies near Yoon\u2019s office in Seoul, anticipating another detention attempt. Yoon\u2019s lawyers have claimed that images of him being dragged out in handcuffs could trigger a huge backlash from his supporters and spark a \u201ccivil war\u201d in a country deeply divided over ideological and generational lines.",
      "Yoon made a short-lived declaration of martial law and deployed troops to surround the National Assembly on Dec. 3, which lasted only hours before lawmakers managed to get through the blockade and voted to lift the measure.",
      "His presidential powers were suspended when the opposition-dominated Assembly voted to impeach him on Dec. 14 and accused him of rebellion. His fate now rests with the Constitutional Court, which has begun deliberating on whether to formally remove Yoon from office or reject the charges and reinstate him."

      "South Korea\u2019s military says North Korea has test-fired multiple missiles toward its eastern waters in its second launch event of 2025",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea on Tuesday test-fired multiple missiles toward its eastern waters, South Korea\u2019s military said, as it continued its weapons demonstrations ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the short-range ballistic missiles were fired from a northern inland area and flew about 250 kilometers (155 miles) before landing in waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.",
      "The joint chiefs said the South Korean military has strengthened surveillance while sharing the launch information with the U.S. and Japanese militaries. It said it strongly condemns the test, describing it as a \u201cclear provocation\" that poses a serious threat to the region's peace and stability.",
      "It was North Korea\u2019s second launch event of 2025, following a ballistic launch last week.",
      "North Korea said the Jan. 6 test was a new hypersonic intermediate-range missile designed to strike remote targets in the Pacific as leader Kim Jong Un vowed to further expand his collection of nuclear-capable weapons to counter rival nations.",
      "North Korea is coming off a torrid year in weapons testing. The systems it demonstrated in 2024 included solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missiles designed to strike the U.S. mainland and various shorter-range missiles designed to overwhelm missile defenses in South Korea. There concerns that its military capabilities could advance further through technology transfers from Russia, as the two countries align over the war in Ukraine.",
      "At a year-end political conference, Kim vowed to implement the \u201ctoughest\u201d anti-U.S. policy and criticized the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to strengthen security cooperation with Seoul and Tokyo, which he described as a \u201cnuclear military bloc for aggression.\u201d",
      "North Korean state media did not specify Kim\u2019s policy plans or mention any specific comments about Trump. During his first term as president, Trump met Kim three times for talks on the North\u2019s nuclear program.",
      "Even if Trump returns to the White House, a quick resumption of diplomacy with North Korea could be unlikely. Kim\u2019s strengthened position \u2014 built on his expanded nuclear arsenal, deepening alliance with Russia and the weakening enforcement of U.S. international sanctions \u2014 presents new challenges to resolving the nuclear standoff, experts say."

      "LONDON -- Queen Elizabeth II wasn\u2019t told details of her long-time art adviser's double life as a Soviet spy because palace officials didn\u2019t want to add to her worries, newly declassified documents reveal.",
      "The files about royal art historian Anthony Blunt are among a trove from the intelligence agency MI5 released Tuesday by Britain's National Archives. They shed new light on a spy ring linked to Cambridge University in the 1930s, whose members spilled secrets to the Soviet Union from the heart of the U.K. intelligence establishment.",
      "Blunt, who worked at Buckingham Palace as Surveyor of the Queen\u2019s Pictures, was under suspicion for years before he finally confessed in 1964 that, as a senior MI5 officer during World War II, he had passed secret information to Soviet agents.",
      "In one of the newly released files, an MI5 officer notes that Blunt said he felt \u201cprofound relief\u201d at unburdening himself. In return for information he provided, Blunt was allowed to keep his job, his knighthood and his social standing \u2013 and the queen was apparently kept in the dark.",
      "In 1972, her private secretary, Martin Charteris, told MI5 chief Michael Hanley that \u201cthe queen did not know and he saw no advantage in telling her about it now; it would only add to her worries and there was nothing that could done about him.\u201d",
      "The government decided to tell the monarch in 1973, when Blunt was ill, fearing a media uproar once Blunt died and journalists were able to publish stories without fear of libel suits.",
      "Charteris reported that \u201cshe took it all very calmly and without surprise,\u201d and \u201cremembered that he had been under suspicion way back\u201d in the early 1950s. Historian Christopher Andrew says in the official history of MI5 that the queen had previously been told about Blunt in \u201cgeneral terms.\u201d",
      "Blunt was publicly unmasked as a spy by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in the House of Commons in November 1979. He was finally stripped of his knighthood, but never prosecuted, and died in 1983 at the age of 75.",
      "Files held by Britain\u2019s secretive intelligence services usually remain classified for several decades, but the agencies are inching toward more openness. Some of the newly released documents will feature in an exhibition, entitled \u201cMI5: Official Secrets,\u201d opening at the National Archives in London later this year.",
      "Two of the Cambridge spies, Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess, fled to Russia in 1951. A third, Kim Philby, continued to work for foreign intelligence agency MI6 despite falling under suspicion. As evidence of his duplicity mounted, he was confronted in Beirut in January 1963 by his friend and fellow MI6 officer Nicholas Elliott.",
      "The declassified files include Philby\u2019s typed confession and a transcript of his discussion with Elliott.",
      "In it, Philby admitted he had betrayed Konstantin Volkov, a KGB officer who tried to defect to the West in 1945, bringing with him details of moles inside British intelligence \u2013 including Philby himself. As a result of Philby\u2019s intervention, Volkov was abducted in Istanbul, taken back to Moscow and executed.",
      "Elliott reported that Philby said that if he had his life to lead again, he would probably have behaved in the same way.",
      "\u201cI really did feel a tremendous loyalty to MI6. I was treated very, very well in it and I made some really marvelous friends there,\" Philby said, according to the transcript. \"But the overruling inspiration was the other side.\u201d",
      "Philby told Elliott that the choice faced now that he was exposed was \u201cbetween suicide and prosecution.\u201d Instead, he fled to Moscow, where he died in 1988.",
      "The Cambridge spies have inspired myriad books, plays movies and TV shows, including the 2023 series \u201c A Spy Among Friends,\u201d starring Guy Pearce as Philby and Damian Lewis as Elliott. Blunt featured in a 2019 episode of \u201c The Crown,\u201d played by Samuel West."

      "The leader of a prominent European Jewish organization says authorities across Europe need to immediately take action against a precipitous rise in antisemitism",
      "LARNACA, Cyprus -- Governments across Europe need to immediately take action against a precipitous rise in antisemitism that\u2019s driving thousands of Jews to abandon the continent, the leader of a prominent European Jewish organization said Monday.",
      "Rabbi Menachem Margolin, chairman of the European Jewish Association (EJA), said some 40,000 Jews have already left Europe in recent years with no intention of returning as a result of a rise in antisemitic sentiment.",
      "Instead of a wave of solidarity with Israel following the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack that triggered a war now in its 15th month, Margolin said antisemitism has skyrocketed by 2,000%, according to statistics he says have been collated by organizations that monitor antisemitism.",
      "Margolin said 2025 will be a \u201ccritical year\u201d for European Jews because the course of action that governments will take to combat antisemitism will determine the future of Jewish communities on the continent.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s still a chance that Jewish people will be living in Europe,\u201d Margolin told The Associated Press in an interview ahead of a gala dinner honoring former Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades for his efforts to foster closer Cyprus-Israel relations during his tenure.",
      "\u201cBut if the governments of Europe will not take serious measures that we are demanding from them in this year this is the beginning of the end of Jewish presence in Europe,\u201d he said.",
      "His said the EJA, the largest Jewish organization in Europe representing several hundred Jewish communities, brought together Jewish leaders from across the continent for a summit on tackling rising antisemitism.",
      "He said European governments need to move beyond mere verbal condemnations of antisemitic behavior and take effective action to ensure the safety and security of Jewish institutions and Jews practicing their customs in Europe.",
      "Authorities also need to establish a \u201ccode of conduct\u201d by which demonstrations against Israel don\u2019t devolve into antisemitic protests, Margolin said.",
      "These immediate steps should be accompanied by \u201cstrong and swift\u201d punishment of individuals found guilty of antisemitic actions.",
      "Over the long term, Europe needs prosecutors who have a clear understanding of the many forms antisemitism can take, as well as programs introduced in schools to educate people against antisemitic attitudes.",
      "\u201cBut more important is the willingness of the government to combat antisemitism,\u201d said Margolin.",
      "The EJA chairman said antisemitism is \u201ccoming from all sides of the political spectrum\u201d as Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine fuels concern and uncertainty within Europe that\u2019s compounded by \u201cdemographic change.\u201d",
      "Margolin attributed political shortsightedness to European elected officials who \u201cpretend to think that everything is just alright\u201d and \u201cdo not understand the emergency of combating antisemitism.\u201d",
      "He said his organization chose to hold the summit in Cyprus because Jewish people on the eastern Mediterranean island nation feel \u201cvery, very welcome\u201d and secure while the government has close relations with the state of Israel.",
      "According to Margolin, opposition to the Jewish state is the prime reason for antisemitism in Europe.",
      "\u201cThe moment the government is friendly towards Israel and understands and defends Israel\u2019s right to defend itself, it reduces a lot of tension against Jewish people,\u201d Margolin said."

      "WARSAW, Poland -- The defense ministers of Europe's five top military spenders said Monday they want to continue increasing their investments in defense but described meeting President-elect Donald Trump's challenge for them to raise spending to 5% of their overall economic output as complicated.",
      "The defense ministers of Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Poland came together near Warsaw for a meeting in a new format that they established after Trump was re-elected last year. Their first meeting in this format of five NATO members was held in Berlin in late November.",
      "The five are seeking ways to maintain their support for Ukraine as U.S. policy is expected to shift when Trump takes power. They also discussed how to strengthen Ukraine\u2019s own weapons production capacity.",
      "The German minister, Boris Pistorius, stressed at the start of the meeting that they all support a just peace for Ukraine, one in which Kyiv has a say over its fate. There are concerns in Europe that Trump could push Ukraine to make unacceptable concessions to Russia.",
      "The defense leaders also addressed questions of military spending after Trump recently called for NATO allies to increase their spending to 5% of gross domestic product, a level that no NATO member has reached \u2014 not even Poland, which is the closest, spending over 4% and expected to approach 5% this year.",
      "Several of the ministers said that focusing on the number as a percentages isn't enough.",
      "\u201cI just think that a static debate about percentages doesn\u2019t really help us if it doesn\u2019t ultimately lead to the implementation of what NATO has agreed upon together, what the goals must be,\" Pistorius said at a joint press conference. \"In my opinion, that\u2019s what matters.\"",
      "He also said that for Germany to invest 5% in defense would mean spending a little more than 40% of its entire national budget on defense. \u201cI think that would put an end to the debate very quickly,\u201d he said.",
      "His Italian counterpart, Guido Crosetto, said his government knows it needs to spend more on defense but also needs to weigh that against reviving the economy.",
      "\u201cIncreasing defense spending at a time of economic crisis is more complicated than at other times,\u201d Crosetto said. \"If we combine the two, that is, if we make the European defense industry one of the ways in which we can revive the economy, we can combine the two.\u201d",
      "French Defense Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu said that while there will be increases in security spending, they should not all go to purely military purposes but also should be used to protect society against cyberattacks, terrorism, and other non-military threats.",
      "\u201cAnd you\u2019re all repeating 2%, 3%, 4%, without really knowing what the point is,\" Lecornu said, responding to a reporter's question. \"Well, let me be straightforward. The situation is worse than during the Cold War. It\u2019s worse than during the Cold War simply because we have new areas that have become militarized, and these are largely digital,\u201d Lecornu said.",
      "\u201cAnd you can see that we are in a world in which we can be defeated without having been invaded. And that means that the responsibility for the defense of our countries will go well beyond military issues alone,\" Lecornu said."

    "summary": "Lebanon&rsquo;s new president has asked prominent diplomat and jurist Nawaf Salam to form the country&rsquo;s new government after Salam was named prime minister by a large number of legislators",
    "story": [
      "Lebanon\u2019s new president has asked prominent diplomat and jurist Nawaf Salam to form the country\u2019s new government after Salam was named prime minister by a large number of legislators",
      "BEIRUT -- Lebanon\u2019s new president has asked prominent diplomat and jurist Nawaf Salam to form the country\u2019s new government after Salam was named prime minister by a large number of legislators Monday. The move apparently angered the Hezbollah group and its allies.",
      "Salam is currently serving as the head of the International Court of Justice and his nomination was made by Western-backed groups as well as independents in the Lebanese parliament. Salam has the support of Saudi Arabia and Western countries as well. Hezbollah legislators abstained from naming any candidate for the prime minister\u2019s post.",
      "Salam's nomination is seen by many as a glimpse of hope after the 14-month Israel-Hezbollah war that left 4,000 people dead and more than 16,000 wounded and caused destruction totaling hundreds of millions of dollars. The war stopped in late November when a U.S.-brokered 60-day truce went into effect.",
      "Shortly after Salam won majority backing from legislators, some people celebrated in the streets of Beirut with fireworks amid hopes that his nomination and last week\u2019s election of army commander Gen. Joseph Aoun as president would help release billions of dollars of investments and loans by foreign donors.",
      "Salam will have a difficult mission ahead of him following the truce with Israel that caused widespread destruction in the Mediterranean nation and weakened the Iran-backed Hezbollah. He will also have to work on getting the small nation out of its historic five-year economic meltdown.",
      "In past years, Hezbollah has repeatedly blocked Salam from becoming prime minister, casting him as a U.S.-backed candidate.",
      "\u201cWe will see their acts when it comes to forcing the occupiers to leave our country, bringing back prisoners, reconstruction\u201d and the implementation of the U.N. Security Council resolution that ended the Israel-Hezbollah war, the head of Hezbollah\u2019s parliamentary bloc, Mohammed Raad, said after meeting with Aoun.",
      "Raad added that Hezbollah extended its hand last week by electing Aoun and they were hoping to meet an extended hand from the other side, \u201cbut this hand was cut off.\u201d",
      "Last week\u2019s election of Aoun as president and Monday\u2019s nomination of Salam is likely to lead to a flow of funds from Western and oil-rich Arab nations to Lebanon to help in the reconstruction process. Tens of thousands of Lebanese have lost their savings since the country's banking sector crashed as a result of the economic crisis.",
      "Neither Aoun nor Salam are considered part of the country\u2019s political class that is blamed for widespread corruption and mismanagement over the past decades that exploded in October 2019 into one of the world\u2019s worst economic meltdowns in more than a century.",
      "Lebanon has been run by a caretaker government for more than two years and Aoun was elected after a 26-month vacuum in the president's post.",
      "After a day of consultations between Aoun and legislators, Salam got the backing of 84 deputies, while outgoing Prime Minister Najib Mikati received nine votes. Thirty-four legislators from the 128-member legislature abstained.",
      "Shortly after the results came out, Mikati called Salam to congratulate him and wish him luck with the new job.",
      "Antoine Shoukeir, the presidency's director general, told reporters after the consultations that Salam now is prime minister-designate, adding that he is currently outside Lebanon and should be back in the coming hours. A meeting was scheduled for Tuesday at the presidential palace in Beirut's southeastern suburb of Baabda between Aoun, Salam and parliament Speaker Nabih Berri after which he will start the process of forming a new Cabinet.",
      "It was not immediately clear whether Salam plans to resign as head of the ICJ.",
      "\u201cMy voice is for Nawaf Salam because my voice is for Lebanon and no one else,\u201d independent legislator Paula Yacoubian told journalists after meeting with Aoun.",
      "Salam, 71, is a member of a prominent Sunni Muslim family from Beirut and his late paternal uncle, Saeb Salam, was one of the Lebanese leaders who fought for the country\u2019s independence from France and later served several terms as Lebanon\u2019s prime minister. Salam\u2019s cousin, Tammam, also served as prime minister for two years starting in 2014.",
      "Salam holds a doctorate in political science from France\u2019s prestigious Sciences Po university as well as a doctorate in history from France\u2019s Sorbonne University. He also has a Master of Laws degree from Harvard Law School. Salam has worked as a lecturer at several universities, including the American University of Beirut.",
      "In 2007, he was named Lebanon\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, where he served for 10 years. In 2018, Salam was elected as a judge on the ICJ and in February last year he was elected as president of the court becoming the first Lebanese citizen to hold the post.",
      "Salam is married to journalist Sahar Baasiri, who for many years was a columnist at Lebanon\u2019s leading An-Nahar daily. Baasiri has been serving since 2018 as Lebanon\u2019s ambassador to UNESCO."

      "The accident occurred early Monday in Kachin state\u2019s Hpakant township, a remote mountainous region at the center of the lucrative jade mining industry, about 950 kilometers (600 miles) north of Myanmar\u2019s biggest city, Yangon. It\u2019s a region where sporadic fighting has broken out between the Myanmar army and ethnic guerrilla forces.",

      "He said about 50 houses there were buried by muddy water that seeped from a pond about 300 feet (91 meters) away where many tons of mining debris and waste had been poured.",
      "Two local rescuers told the AP it was difficult finding missing people due to the large amount of mud, and large machinery was needed. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they feared retaliation from the military or the guerrilla forces fighting it.",
      "Kachin-based online media reported that about 30-50 people could be missing.",
      "Landslides occur several times a year around Hpakant\u2019s jade mines. In July 2020, at least 162 people died in a landslide in the same area, and 113 were killed in a November 2015 one.",
      "Most victims are independent miners who settle near mounds of discarded earth excavated by heavy machinery used by mining companies.

      "Most scavengers are unregistered migrants from other areas, making it hard to determine how many people are missing after accidents.",

      "\u201cHe has a negotiating style which involves positioning himself in the best way he can for discussions. I think that is what this is,\u201d Hillman told the AP.",
      "Trump continues to erroneously cast the U.S. trade deficit with Canada \u2014 a natural resource-rich nation that provides the U.S. with commodities like oil \u2014 as a subsidy.",
      "Hillman noted Canada buys more from the United States than any other country but is prepared to buy more.",
      "\u201cWe are happy to source what we can from the United States. And we have some big military procurements coming up for example, replacing our entire submarine fleet,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe those are some purchases that can happen from the U.S.\u201d",
      "Hillman said 70% of Canada's military procurement is American sourced. That includes a plan to purchase 88 F-35 fighter jets.",
      "Alberta's Premier Danielle Smith said earlier Monday she favors appeasing Trump by trying to narrow the trade gap, saying the solution is that Canada finds ways to buy more American goods. Smith visited Mar-a-Lago, Trump's home in Florida, over the weekend and spoke to Trump.",
      "Hillman has said the U.S. had a $75 billion trade deficit with Canada last year but noted a third of what Canada sells into the U.S. is energy exports.",
      "Hillman said trade with Canada supports over 8 million jobs in the United States and Canada is the number one customer to 36 U.S. states. She said Canada provides a lot of primary materials that go into U.S. manufacturing.",
      "\"Adding 25% tariffs to those products will raise the price for Americans almost immediately,\u201d Hillman said. \u201cAnd at a time when the cost of living is challenging, when food prices are high, it seems like the wrong direction to go in.\"",
      "Hillman also reiterated that Canada will retaliate if tariffs are placed on Canadian goods and that will mean a cost for Americans.",
      "\u201cCanada will respond,\" she said. \u201cTherefore your number one customer will make American products more expensive and Canadians will probably look for alternatives to those products.\u201d",
      "Hillman said Canada is not interested in a trade war but said it will be hard for the Canadian government to not respond if the U.S. government makes choices that hurt Canadians.",
      "She said it doesn't make sense for Trump to reverse what he accomplished in his first term when he renegotiated the free trade deal with Canada and Mexico.",
      "\u201cWe are 99% tariff free with the United States, 99% tariff free. And that tariff level is as a result of the USMCA,\u201d Hillman said, referring to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. \u201cThat was negotiated by President Trump. He achieved that success so why would we backtrack from this success that he achieved in his last administration. It just doesn\u2019t make a lot sense.\"",
      "Hillman gave Trump credit for accelerating Canada's plans to increase security at the border. Trump initially threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all Canadian goods if the government does not stem what Trump calls a flow of migrants and drugs in the U.S. \u2014 even though far fewer of each crosses into the U.S. from Canada than from Mexico, which Trump has also threatened.",
      "Canada now has a billion plus border security plan.",
      "\u201cWe have moved really quickly, I\u2019ll be honest, because President Trump focused the mind to put together a full package of improvements,\" Hillman said.",
      "Hillman said also said the U.S. and Canada are in a \u201cgenerational struggle\" with China, a powerful adversary. Trump has been clear about the economic and security threat that Beijing poses, she said. The ambassador said Canada has the energy America needs to drive the artificial intelligence revolution.",
      "\"That is really not possible, based on our experts and American experts, without greater cooperation with Canada through oil and gas, through nuclear, through hydro electricity,\u201d Hillman said.",
      "\u201cIf we are working at odds then frankly China wins. China is trying to drive us apart. That is clear. They look for every opportunity to do so. That\u2019s not good for us, our citizens and Americans.\u201d"

      "Honda and Nissan announced in December that they plan to seek a merger, a move that reports said may have partly been driven by Foxconn's interest in Nissan.",
      "Here's an update on Foxconn's auto ambitions.",
      "Whether or not Foxconn wanted to make a bid for Nissan, it has big ambitions, saying it eventually intends to make four of every 10 EVs sold in the world. The contract manufacturer has invested nearly $1.3 billion in auto-related acquisitions in the past decade, according to Mergermarket, a merger and acquisitions research firm.",
      "In addition to Foxtron, its automaking joint venture with Taiwan's Yulon Motor, it has a 50% joint venture with Stellantis NV to design and sell automotive semiconductors and a 50% joint venture with Germany\u2019s ZF Friedrichshafen AG, a major auto supplier, to make passenger car chassis. It has invested in Indigo Technologies, which is commercializing a road sensing system developed at MIT. It also has a collaboration agreement with Blue Solutions to develop solid state batteries and has a collaboration with Italian auto designer Pininfarina.",
      "Foxconn holds a 34% stake in Japanese electronics company Sharp, which has been inching toward the automotive sector. This year, Foxconn and Sharp introduced an LDK+ (living, dining, kitchen) concept vehicle, a boxy minivan that converts to a living space with solar and storage battery and a big LCD screen.",
      "\u201cLeveraging a plug-and-play strategy similar to its electronics operations, Foxconn\u2019s foray into electric vehicles is a pre-emptive move in anticipation of the increasing convergence of electronics and automotive technologies,\u201d Vivian Wong, head of Mergermarkets\u2019 M&A Analytics for the Asia Pacific, said in an emailed comment.",

      "Huawei has several EV joint ventures in what it has dubbed its Harmony Intelligent Mobility Alliance, including Luxeed brand EVs with Chery Automobile and Aito brand EVs with Seres Group. Its joint venture with JAC Motor, an automaker based in eastern China's Anhui province, has announced plans to compete with luxury brands such as Rolls-Royce and Mercedes Benz AG.",
      "Some Japanese electronics companies also are jumping on the bandwagon. Apart from Sharp's partnership with Foxconn, entertainment and technology giant Sony Corp. has an EV joint venture with Honda that plans to introduce the EV Afeela sedan for pre-sale this year.",
      "The increasing reliance on connectivity between cars, phones, laptops and televisions has lured such companies into a market that is quickly being transformed by electrification, even if inroads into some markets have stalled due to tariffs and other factors.",

      "Reports by Japanese media and by Taiwan\u2019s Central News Agency said Hon Hai\u2019s chief strategy officer, Nissan veteran executive Jun Seki, visited France for talks with France\u2019s Renault SA, which holds a 15% stake in Nissan and more shares held in a French trust. Seki is a former chief operating officer of Nissan and former president of Dongfeng Nissan, a joint venture in China.",
      "In formally announcing plans to attempt a merger with Honda, Nissan Motor Corp. CEO Makoto Uchida said Foxconn had not directly approached his company about a possible merger. Foxconn did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Nissan\u2019s internal woes are a small part of the bigger challenge posed to all major automakers by the ascent of Tesla, which makes more than half of its EVs in China, and Chinese automakers like BYD in an industry so competitive that more than a dozen Chinese EV makers have already folded, bested by bigger and stronger companies that got into the game before them.",
      "As the pace of sales growth slows, with car buyers questioning the affordability and convenience of switching to electrics, the going has been rough, and Foxconn has a long way to go before it can compete with industry leaders like BYD and Tesla.",
      "It was set to manufacture the Endurance battery EV truck at a former General Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio, which it acquired in 2023. Lordstown Motors Corp. then filed for bankruptcy. Foxconn also set up a partnership in 2021 with Fisker Inc., maker of the Ocean EV truck, that called for making up to 250,000 vehicles. Fisker filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in June.",
      "But the company appears undaunted.",

      "Trump has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all Canadian imports.",
      "\u201cThe 51st state, that\u2019s not going to happen,\" Trudeau said in an interview with MSNBC. \u201cBut people are talking about that, as opposed to talking about what impact 25% tariffs (has) on steel and aluminum coming into the United States.\"",
      "Trudeau told MSNBC: \"No American wants to pay 25% more for electricity or oil and gas coming in from Canada. That\u2019s something I think people need to pay a little more attention to.\u201d",
      "Trump has also said that if Canada merged with the U.S., taxes would decrease and there would be no tariffs.",
      "\u201cI know that as a successful negotiator he likes to keep people off balance,\" Trudeau said of Trump's threats to use economic force to turn Canada into the 51st state. Trump has also erroneously cast the U.S. trade deficit with Canada \u2014 a natural resource-rich nation that provides the U.S. with commodities like oil \u2014 as a subsidy.",
      "Canadian officials say that if Trump follows through with his threat of punishing tariffs, Canada would consider slapping retaliatory tariffs on American orange juice, toilets and some steel products. Already during Trump's first term in the White House, Canada responded to Trump's tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum with its own on American products like bourbon, Harley Davidson motorcycles and playing cards.",
      "\u201cHe got elected to try and make life easier for all Americans, to support American workers,\u201d Trudeau said of Trump. \u201cThese (tariffs) are things that are going to hurt them.\u201d",
      "Trump said last week that the U.S doesn\u2019t need oil, or anything else, from Canada. But almost a quarter of the oil that the U.S. consumes each day comes from Canada. The energy-rich western province of Alberta exports 4.3 million barrels of oil a day to the U.S.",
      "Data from the United States Energy Information Administration shows that the U.S. consumes 20 million barrels a day, and produces about 13.2 million barrels a day.",
      "Canada, a founding partner of NATO and home to more than 40 million people, is also the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $2.7 billion worth of goods and services cross the border each day.",
      "Trump has said that he would reconsider his tariff threat if Canada made improvements in managing security at the Canada-U.S. border, which he and his advisers see as a potential entry point for undocumented migrants.",
      "Trudeau has said that less than 1% of illegal immigrants and fentanyl cross into the U.S. from Canada.",
      "But after a meeting last November with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, the president-elect\u2019s private club and residence in Florida, Trudeau announced an increase in spending on border security, expressing willingness to address Trump's concerns in hopes that he would reconsider his tariff threat.",
      "With the challenge of Trump\u2019s second administration looming and Trudeau's party trailing badly in the polls, the beleaguered Canadian prime minister announced his resignation last Monday. He will be replaced on March 9, when his Liberal party is set to pick a new leader."

      "The 76ers, the mayor's office and Comcast Spectator \u2014 which owns the Wells Fargo Center, where the team currently plays \u2014 did not respond Sunday to requests for comment. The team rents the arena from Comcast Spectacor, which also owns the Philadelphia Flyers of the NHL, who also play there.",
      "The council had voted on Dec. 19 to approve the downtown arena after more than two years of heated debate over the proposal, and the owners of the NBA team had hoped to move in to what would be called 76 Place by 2031. The council vote came despite vocal opposition from nearby Chinatown residents and other activists.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so livid right now I don\u2019t even know what to do,\u201d Jimmy Harrity, an at-large member of the council, told the newspaper. Harrity, who supported the team\u2019s move, said, \u201cI feel as though I was used as a pawn.\u201d",
      "Mayor Cherelle Parker, a Democrat who had championed the plan, has said the entire city will benefit from what she called a \u201chistoric game-changing economic development project.\u201d Supporters had hoped the 18,500-seat arena would help revive a distressed retail corridor called Market East, which runs from City Hall to the Liberty Bell. The area has struggled for years despite several redevelopment efforts.",
      "The team owners, Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, had pushed for city approval by year\u2019s end so they could meet their target opening date. They had vowed not to ask the city for any construction funding, although they were free to seek state and federal funds. Instead of property taxes, they would have paid about $6 million in annual payments in lieu of taxes.",
      "Opponents feared the arena would bring gridlock on game days as well as gentrification and rising rents to the area.",
      "The Chinatown community has fought a series of proposed developments since the 1960s, including casinos, a prison, a baseball stadium and a highway, the last of which dissected the neighborhood when it opened in 1991."

      "ALTADENA, Calif. -- The sight of celebrity mansions and movie landmarks reduced to ashes can make it seem like the wildfires roaring through the Los Angeles area affected a constellation of movie stars.",
      "But a drive through the charred neighborhoods around Altadena shows that the fires also burned through a remarkable haven for generations of Black families avoiding discriminatory housing practices elsewhere. They have been communities of racial and economic diversity, where many people own their own homes.",
      "Some now fear the most destructive fires in California\u2019s history have altered that for good. Recovery and rebuilding may be out of reach for many, and pressures of gentrification could be renewed.",
      "Samantha Santoro, 22, a first-generation college student at Cal Poly Pomona, remembered being annoyed when the initial news coverage of the wildfires focused more on celebrities. She and her sister, who attends UC Berkeley, worry how their Mexican immigrant parents and working-class neighbors who lost their homes in Altadena will move forward.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ll just go to my second home and stay there,'\" Santoro said.",
      "The landlord of their family's two-bedroom house with a pool had never increased the $1,650 rent, making it possible for the Santoros to affordably raise their daughters. Now, they're temporarily staying with a relative in Pasadena. The family has renters insurance but not much else.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s hard to believe that you have nothing,\u201d Santoro said, through tears, thinking of her parents. \"Everything that they ever worked for was in that house.\u201d",
      "Altadena had been a mix of tiny bungalows and magnificent mansions. The community of 42,000 includes blue-collar families, artists, entertainment industry workers and white-collar ones. About 58% of residents are non-white, with one-fourth of them Hispanic and nearly a fifth Black, according to Census data.",
      "During the Civil Rights era, Altadena became a rare land of opportunity for Black Americans to reach middle class without the discriminatory practices of denying them access to credit. They kept homes within the family and helped others to flourish. Today, the Black home ownership rate there is at 81.5%, almost double the national rate.",
      "That's impressive considering 92% of the 15,000 residences in Altadena are single-family homes, according to the 2023 Census American Community Survey. The median income is over $129,000. Just over 7% of residents live in poverty.",
      "Victoria Knapp, chair of the Altadena Town Council, worries that the fires have irreparably changed the landscape for these families.",
      "\u201cSomeone is going to buy it and develop who knows what on it. And that is going to change the character of Altadena,\" Knapp said, adding that those with fewer resources will be disproportionately hurt.",
      "The family of Kenneth Snowden, 57, was one of the Black families able to purchase a home in 1962. That house, as well as the one Snowden bought almost 20 years ago, are both gone.",
      "He is challenging state and federal officials to help all fire-affected communities fairly because \u201cyour $40 million home is no different than my $2 million home.\u201d",
      "Snowden wants the ability to acquire home loans with 0% interest. \"Give us the ability to rebuild, restart our lives,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can spend billions of dollars fighting a war, you can spend a billion dollars to help us get back where we were at.\u201d",
      "Shawn Brown lost not only her home but also the public charter school she founded in Altadena. She had a message for fellow Black homeowners who might be tempted with offers for their property: \u201cI would tell them to stand strong, rebuild, continue the generational progress of African-Americans.\"",
      "She and other staff at Pasadena Rosebud Academy are trying to raise money to rebuild while looking at temporary sites in churches.",
      "But even some churches have burned. At Altadena Baptist Church, the bell tower is pretty much the only thing still standing.",
      "The Rev. George Van Alstine and others are trying to help more than 10 church members who lost homes with needs like navigating insurance and federal aid. The pastor is worried the fires will lead to gentrification, with Black parishioners, who make up half the congregation, paying the price.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a number of families who are probably going to have to move out of the area because rebuilding in Altadena will be too expensive for them,\u201d he said.",
      "The 32-year-old photographer Daniela Dawson, who had been working two jobs to meet the $2,200 rent for her studio apartment, fled the wildfires with her Hyundai SUV and her cat, Lola. She lost almost everything else, including thousands of dollars of photography gear.",
      "She did not have renter's insurance. \u201cObviously now I\u2019m thinking about it. Wish I had it,\u201d she said.",
      "Dawson plans to return to Arizona, where she lived previously, and regroup. But she likely won\u2019t be returning to Altadena.",

      "The wildfires that erupted this week across Los Angeles County are far from contained, but they're already expected to be the costliest in U.S. history and among the worst natural disasters",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The wildfires that erupted this week across Los Angeles County are still raging, but already are projected to be among the costliest natural disasters in U.S. history.",
      "The devastating blazes have killed at least 11 people and incinerated more than 12,000 structures since Tuesday, laying waste to entire neighborhoods once home to multimillion-dollar properties.",
      "While it's still too early for an accurate tally of the financial toll, the losses so far likely make the wildfires the costliest ever in the U.S., according to various estimates.",
      "A preliminary estimate by AccuWeather put the damage and economic losses so far between $135 billion and $150 billion. By comparison, AccuWeather estimated the damage and economic losses caused by Hurricane Helene, which tore across six southeastern states last fall, at $225 billion to $250 billion.",
      "\u201cThis will be the costliest wildfire in California modern history and also very likely the costliest wildfire in U.S. modern history, because of the fires occurring in the densely populated areas around Los Angeles with some of the highest-valued real estate in the country,\u201d said Jonathan Porter, the private firm\u2019s chief meteorologist.",
      "AccuWeather factors in a multitude of variables in its estimates, including damage to homes, businesses, infrastructure and vehicles, as well as immediate and long-term health care costs, lost wages and supply chain interruptions.",
      "The insurance broker Aon PLC also said Friday that the L.A. County wildfires will likely end up being the costliest in U.S. history, although it did not issue an estimate. Aon ranks a wildfire known as the Camp Fire in Paradise, California, in 2018 as the costliest in U.S. history up to now at $12.5 billion, adjusted for inflation. The Camp Fire killed 85 people and destroyed about 11,000 homes.",
      "The L.A. County wildfires, which were fueled by hurricane-force Santa Ana winds and an extreme drought, remained largely uncontained Saturday. That means the final tally of losses from the blazes is likely to increase, perhaps substantially.",
      "\u201cTo put this into perspective, the total damage and economic loss from this wildfire disaster could reach nearly 4% of the annual GDP of the state of California,\u201d AccuWeather's Porter said.",
      "In a report Friday, Moody's also concluded that the wildfires would prove to be the costliest in U.S. history, specifically because they have ripped through densely populated areas with higher-end properties.",
      "While the state is no stranger to major wildfires, they have generally been concentrated in inland areas that are not densely populated. That's led to less destruction per acre, and in damage to less expensive homes, Moody's noted.",
      "That's far from the case this time, with one of the largest conflagrations destroying thousands of properties across the Pacific Palisades and Malibu, home to many Hollywood stars and executives with multimillion-dollar properties. Already, numerous celebrities have lost homes to the fires.",
      "\u201cThe scale and intensity of the blazes, combined with their geographic footprint, suggest a staggering price tag, both in terms of the human cost and the economic toll,\u201d Moody's analysts wrote. The report did not include a preliminary cost estimate of the wildfire damage.",
      "It could be several months before a concrete tally of the financial losses from the wildfires will be possible.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in the very early stages of this disaster,\u201d Porter said."

      "NEW ORLEANS -- The second-guessing began before the bodies had been cleared from the debris of the deadly Bourbon Street truck attack.",
      "A law firm signed up survivors of what it called a \u201cpredictable and preventable\u201d tragedy. Politicians parried blame for the latest mass-casualty event in New Orleans\u2019 infamous adult playground. And investigations targeted the ill-fated removal of the street's bollards, steel columns designed to restrict vehicle access.",
      "But as the city seeks to recover and beefs up security ahead of next month's Super Bowl and Carnival season, law enforcement and community leaders are confronting an existential question as old as the entertainment district: Can Bourbon Street be protected in a way that preserves its unique, round-the-clock revelry?",
      "\u201cOnce we start to hear what it\u2019s actually going to take to secure the French Quarter and the Mardi Gras parade routes, I don\u2019t know if this city is going to have an appetite for all that,\u201d said Rafael Goyeneche, a former prosecutor who is president of the Metropolitan Crime Commission watchdog group.",
      "\u201cIf we try to make New Orleans as secure as an airport, people aren't going to like it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t Disney World.\u201d",
      "Shock and grief have given way to finger-pointing over whether additional security could have stopped \u2014 or mitigated \u2014 the Islamic State group-inspired attack, which killed 14 people when Shamsud-Din Jabbar drove a pickup through a New Year's crowd.",
      "In the difficult days since, proposals for new safety measures have ranged from banning vehicular traffic in the French Quarter to turning the historic neighborhood into a state park.",
      "Many locals who depend on tourism agree that something has to give.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just too wide open. It\u2019s too trustworthy down here,\u201d said Bryan Casey, 53, a native New Orleanian who has worked on Bourbon Street since the late 1990s and waits tables at Galatoire\u2019s, an upscale restaurant that opened in 1905. Casey and his colleagues wiped blood off the wall after the attack as bodies lay mangled in front of the establishment.",
      "Bourbon Street should have been made into a pedestrian mall long ago, Casey said: \u201cThere\u2019s people watching and they\u2019re going to get you, so you got to be careful.\u201d",
      "Much of the immediate focus has centered on the absence of the bollards, which had stopped working reliably and were being replaced ahead of the Super Bowl.",
      "City leaders have been criticized for the timing of that project and failing to implement a suitable replacement during their repair. A lawsuit filed Thursday on behalf of victims alleged the city \u201chad years of opportunities\u201d to patch up vulnerabilities.",
      "But a half dozen current and former law enforcement officials in Louisiana described the bollard issue as a red herring, saying that even if they had been functioning they may not have prevented the attack given how hell-bent Jabbar appeared on creating carnage.",
      "The broader safety conundrum is more complex, they said, given the quarter's dense, alcohol-fueled crowds and structural challenges inherent to an early 18th-century neighborhood built for horse-drawn buggies. Policing here is even more complicated in a city with notoriously high crime, a chronic shortage of officers and a new state law allowing permit-less concealed carry of firearms.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know of another place that has the same challenges for protecting people,\u201d said Ronnie Jones, a public safety consultant who served in the Louisiana State Police for 32 years, including as deputy superintendent.",
      "\u201cA lot of people in public safety don\u2019t want to talk about it, but we just can\u2019t guarantee that everybody going to the French Quarter is going to be safe,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThere\u2019s a tradeoff here, and we\u2019ve never, ever, found that balance.\u201d",
      "The city\u2019s newly hired security consultant, William J. Bratton, a former New York City police commissioner, said he recognizes the importance of maintaining a festive atmosphere during carnival even as he works with city police to bolster security over the next few months.",
      "\u201cOne of the things I talked about is developing security provisions that don\u2019t change Mardi Gras, don\u2019t change the flavor of it, the excitement of it and the nature of it,\u201d Bratton said at a news conference this week. \u201cTo develop security protocols that don\u2019t become so intrusive, so disruptive.\u201d",
      "The New Year's attack was far from the first deadly vehicle incident on Bourbon Street.",
      "In 1972, one person died and 18 were injured when a teenager fleeing police in a stolen car crashed through metal barricades and sped down the thoroughfare at 70 mph (about 113 kph). Ten years later a man smashed through steel barricades and careened down nearly seven blocks, injuring at least 11. And in 1995, an intoxicated 63-year-old man drove a beer van through a crowd attending a St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade, killing one and injuring 38.",
      "More recent Bourbon Street tragedies have involved gun violence, including multiple fatal shootings last year. In 2014, a mass shooting killed a 21-year-old woman and wounded nine others, including a bystander shot through her cheek. Two years later a person was killed and nine others were wounded in a shooting.",
      "Many of those incidents prompted similar calls for change and accountability, raising questions about civil liberties and what, if anything, the city is willing to sacrifice in the name of public safety. City, state and federal law enforcement officials have offered varying solutions that critics have said were mere stopgaps, likening them to putting Band-Aids on a wound that has never quite healed.",
      "\u201cI was part of those conversations when we were looking to create a very robust security package, including metal detectors and infrared technology that could alert if something metal was in someone's clothing \u2014 none of that ever materialized,\u201d said Michael Harrison, a former head of New Orleans police who later became commissioner in Baltimore. \u201cThere are ways to prevent ramming attacks. There\u2019s not yet a way to prevent people from walking on Bourbon Street and doing bad things.\u201d",
      "Pedicab driver Jody \u201cCajun Queen\u201d Boudreaux, 65, said Bourbon Street has always embodied New Orleans' laissez-faire charm and she is not sure whether the city has the will to shore up its lax security.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re a target, clearly. They know we have holes, they know we are all scrambling and they also know that our vibe is \u2018Laissez les bons temps rouler\u2019\u201d she said, invoking the famous Cajun French saying that means, \u201cLet the good times roll.\u201d \u201cI think it can be balanced, I truly do.\u201d",
      "Andrew Monteverde, co-vice president of the New Orleans Firefighters Association, said first responders and law enforcement deal with a raft of emergencies, from extinguishing fires to saving people in cardiac arrest. The more that limited resources are dedicated to one part of the city, he added, the less is available to deal for elsewhere.",
      "\u201cCould you possibly make the French Quarter so secure that you couldn\u2019t even spit on the sidewalk?\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe, but then what would you trade off?\u201d",
      "At The Beach on Bourbon Street, where workers screen clubgoers at every entrance with handheld metal detectors, general manager Woody Ryder has become inured to the frequent shootings after working there for seven years. \u201cThere's crazy people out there,\u201d he said.",
      "But the recent attack has made him uneasy. Ryder and his staff are still recovering from witnessing what he and others likened to a \u201cwar zone.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe city has already failed us,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m hesitant as soon as I turn on Bourbon Street.\u201d",

      "The Sounion had been a disaster-in-waiting in the waterway, with 1 million barrels of crude oil aboard that had been struck and later sabotaged with explosives by the Iranian-backed Houthis as part of their campaign over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. It took months for salvagers to tow the vessel away, extinguish the fires and offload the remaining crude oil.",

A French destroyer operating as part of Operation Aspides rescued its crew of 25 Filipinos and Russians, as well as four private security personnel, after they abandoned the vessel and took them to nearby Djibouti.",

      "The Houthis have targeted some 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October 2023. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels as well.",

      "The decision by Russia\u2019s state-owned energy giant Gazprom, which came into effect a day after a gas transit agreement between Russia and Ukraine expired, halted gas supplies to Transnistria\u2019s gas-operated Kuciurgan power plant, the country\u2019s largest, which provided a significant portion of Moldova\u2019s electricity.",
      "Copanca, like over a dozen other towns or villages administered by Moldovan authorities in the capital Chisinau but situated close to Transnistria, remains interconnected to the separatist region\u2019s Soviet-era energy infrastructure leaving them vulnerable amid the energy crisis.",
      "Planned daily electrical outages throughout Transnistria \u2014 which includes Copanca \u2014 are currently scheduled for four hours twice a day. While the Kuciurgan power plant transitioned to coal and has led to some unexpected outages, some residual gas remained in the pipes.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to get by with the electricity and gas shortages,\u201d said Donici. \u201cYesterday, we were without power for eight hours. Everyone is scratching their heads, figuring out what to do, so they don\u2019t freeze.\u201d",
      "Citing findings by British and Norwegian audit firms, Moldova\u2019s pro-Western government claims its debt stands close to $8.6 million, and has accused Moscow of weaponizing energy to destabilize the European Union candidate country. Russia has denied it is meddling in Moldova.",

      "Transnistria \u2014 which broke away after a short war in 1992 and is not recognized by most countries \u2014 declared a state of emergency last month as the gas crisis loomed. A large majority of Transnistria\u2019s roughly 350,000 people speak Russian as their first language and some 200,000 are Russian citizens. Russia also bases about 1,500 troops in a so-called frozen conflict zone as \u201cpeacekeepers.\u201d",

      "Last month, Moldova\u2019s parliament also voted to impose a state of emergency in the energy sector, as the crisis threatened to leave the former Soviet republic without sufficient energy this winter, and fears that the situation could trigger a humanitarian crisis in Transnistria, where temperatures often drop to subzero degrees Celsius.",
      "The looming crisis also prompted Chisinau to implement a series of energy-saving measures beginning Jan. 1, which include reducing lighting in public and commercial buildings by at least 30%, and energy-intensive businesses operating during off-peak hours.",
      "Moldova's state energy company, Energocom, has increased electricity purchases from neighboring Romania to ensure capacity but are also more costly. Although a mild January is helping matters, energy prices have increased and the government has said it will provide help to offset bills.",

      "\u201cTiraspol is not autonomous in the decisions it makes,\u201d he said on Thursday. \u201cThis crisis is induced by the Russian Federation in order to destabilize the Republic of Moldova and to use the Republic of Moldova in Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine.\u201d",
      "After visiting Copanca and other villages in a similar bind on Thursday, Moldovan President Maia Sandu said some kindergartens and schools have been provided with power generators, and that mayors can request help from Chisinau to supply firewood, wood-burning pellets, and generators.",

      "Carina Cazac, the owner of a convenience store in Copanca, said locals rushed to purchase essentials like oil and flour when the crisis hit, and that generators and oil lamps quickly sold out.",
      "\u201cA lot of people were stressed, and they started buying gas lamps,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's easier in the villages because most people have wood-burning stoves \u2026 others bought generators.\u201d",
      "But, she added, \u201cPrices have risen significantly, and not everyone can afford a generator.\"",

    "summary": "Credit card defaults are on the rise for Americans, reaching the highest amount in 14 years",

      "Credit card defaults are on the rise for Americans, reaching the highest amount in 14 years",
      "NEW YORK -- Credit card defaults are on the rise for Americans, reaching the highest level in 14 years. U.S. credit card defaults jumped to a record $46 billion from January through September 2024, according to the Financial Times, citing data analyzed by BankRegData.",
      "With high levels of credit card debt and high inflation, many consumers have found themselves unable to cover monthly payments, leading some to default.",
      "A borrower goes into default when they miss credit card payments for over 180 days, roughly six months. When there is a failure to pay over such a long period, banks generally take this as a sign that a borrower won't pay the debt anymore, said Matt Sotir, financial advisor with Equitable Advisors based in New Hampshire.",
      "Defaulting on credit card debt can have serious consequences, including a negative impact on credit reports that lead to a long-lasting effect on the ability to borrow money, said Sotir.",
      "\u201cThese are debts that have a lot of impact and I think sometimes people don't realize that if they missed (a payment), how bad it could be for them in other areas,\u201d added Sotir.",
      "Here\u2019s what you should know about credit card defaults.",
      "There are several levels of consequences when credit card payments are not made. It begins with late fees, higher interest rates and a potentially lower credit score. If a borrower doesn't pay for 30 days the bank considers the credit card \u201cdelinquent\u201d and the borrower's credit scores can be damaged further.",
      "When a borrower fails to make a payment for roughly six months, the bank considers the credit card in default, which means they will close your account and refer you to a collection agency, said Chip Lupo, writer at WalletHub.",
      "\u201cThat's where you're going to really have trouble obtaining future credit for a while,\u201d said Lupo.",
      "When a collection agency assumes your debt, they will reach out via phone, email and mail to encourage you to pay up. Eventually, if not paid, the collection agency may take legal action against the borrower.",
      "The first step is to be proactive, recommended Sotir. Whether it\u2019s reaching out to your bank or working with a financial advisor, the quicker you start looking for viable solutions the more consequences you will be able to avoid.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen it over the years, when someone gets in trouble, it\u2019s easy to cocoon and not want to deal with it,\u201d said Sotir",
      "Sotir and Bandebo recommend that you reach out to your credit card company to negotiate the debt since it\u2019s in the bank\u2019s best interest to help you catch up. If your account goes to a collections agency, find out if they can offer a payment plan or seek help from a non-profit credit counseling organization or financial advisor.",
      "It's best if you pay your credit card in full every month, but if that is not possible, gettting to at least the minimum monthly payment each month can help you avoid falling further into debt, said Rikard Bandebo, chief economist at VantageScore, a credit modeling company.",
      "\u201cDo whatever you can not to get to the next stage. If you're 30 days late, try to avoid getting to 60 days and absolutely try to do everything you can to avoid getting default,\u201d said Bandebo.",
      "If you are having trouble making payments on your credit card, Bandebo recommends you reach out to your bank and ask if you can be placed in a payment plan.",
      "Other alternatives include reaching out to a credit counseling organization or transferring your credit card debt to a 0% interest card, though that typically comes with a fee.",
      "Defaulting on a credit card will mean serious consequences for your credit score, and that will limit how much you will be able to borrow in the future, and how much it will cost you. If you don't pay your credit card bill for a month, your credit score will likely fall between 60 and 100 points, said Bandebo. While there is not an specific amount of points that your credit score will fall should you default, it will appear on your credit report for seven years, added Bandebo.",
      "Bandebo often uses the analogy of credit scores being similar to reputation; it takes a long time to build up but one mistake to set you back for a long time.",
      "\u201cThere's not miracle solutions that once you've missed a payment, or you've gone to default, to simple go back to where you were. You can't just flip a switch,\" said Bandebo.",
      "If you find that you cannot regularly make payments to your credit cards, Sotir recommends you start by looking at your budget to find which expenses can be cut, and or considering whether you need an extra source of income.",
      "\u201cFor most people, it's really about understanding how much money is coming in and where it's going,\u201d added Sotir.",
      "If your expenses outweigh your income, Sotir recommends looking for a temporary second job, find if you have assets that you can sell, or asking family if they can help you while you get back on your feet. Additionally, some banks offer hardship programs that provide assistance for people who can\u2019t afford large and high-interest credit card balances.",
      "Bankruptcy should be considered the last option if you have exhausted all other alternatives, added Lupo.",
      "If your budget doesn\u2019t allow you to resume payments, it\u2019s important to start looking for alternatives as soon as possible, recommended Bandebo.",

      "Daniil Medvedev has used his racket to smash a tiny camera attached to the net at the Australian Open while he was trailing in his first-round match in the main stadium",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) \u2014 Daniil Medvedev used his racket to smash a tiny camera attached to the net at the Australian Open while he was trailing someone ranked 418th before eventually avoiding a monumental upset and winning 6-2, 4-6, 3-6, 6-1, 6-2 in the first round at Rod Laver Arena on Tuesday.",
      "The No. 5-seeded Medvedev earned the title at the 2021 U.S. Open and is a three-time runner-up at Melbourne Park, including a year ago, but was hardly playing his best in the second and third sets against Kasidit Samrej, a wild-card entry from Thailand who was making his Grand Slam debut.",
      "\u201cI know I play better when I play more tennis,\u201d Medvedev joked afterward. \u201cSo I was like, \u2018Why play 1 hour, 30 (minutes)?\u2019 Need a minimum of three hours, at least, to feel my shots better.\u201d",
      "The camera-destroying racket swings happened in what would be the last game of the third set, which Samrej claimed to take a two-sets-to-one-lead in the best-of-five match.",
      "Medvedev's display of anger came after he lost a 13-stroke point to trail 40-15. Samrej hit a shot that clipped the net, altering its trajectory and throwing off the Russian's balance, before a cross-court forehand passing winner left Medvedev unable to make contact.",
      "Medvedev went up to the net and brought his racket forward with full force five times, breaking his equipment while shattering a small black camera and sending pieces of it flying. That earned a code violation warning for racket abuse from the chair umpire.",
      "Soon enough, Medvedev had dropped the set, leaving him with plenty of work to do to avoid a massive upset in his first match of the 2025 season. Medvedev quickly did turn things around, though, claiming 12 of the remaining 15 games, and 61 of the remaining 94 points.",
      "He finished with 24 aces and fewer than half as many unforced errors as Samrej, 34 to 69.",
      "\u201cIn the end of last year, this match, I probably would have lost it,\u201d said Medvedev, who went 3-1 in five-setters at the 2024 Australian Open. \u201cNew year, new energy.\u201d",
      "Samrej got treatment from a trainer because of a problem with his left leg late in the fourth set.",
      "He was trying to become the lowest-ranked man to eliminate one of the top five seeded players at a Grand Slam tournament since the ATP's computerized rankings began in 1973, according to the International Tennis Federation.",
      "The biggest such result entering Tuesday was when No. 234 Alex Kim beat No. 4 Yevgeny Kafelnikov at the 2002 Australian Open.",
      "Samrej earned his way into this year's Australian Open bracket by going through four rounds of a wild-card playoff for the Asia-Pacific region in November. He never had played against someone ranked higher than 78th until Tuesday and never has beaten anyone ranked higher than 157th.",
      "\u201cI watched his matches, and I didn't see this level, so I was surprised,\u201d Medvedev said. \u201cIf he plays like this every match, his life will be good.\u201d",

      "Organized by Ukraine\u2019s Association of Football, the \u201cLeague of the Mighty\u201d is Ukraine\u2019s first soccer championship for amputees. Over the past year, the association has invested in local communities to establish teams, recognizing the growing number of war-wounded citizens as a result of the nearly three-year war.",
      "With six outfield players and one goalkeeper on each side, they engaged in intense matches. Outfield players, all lower-limb amputees, and goalkeepers with upper-limb amputations, played without prostheses, relying on wrist clutches for control.",
      "Pokrova AMP won the tournament, with captain Valentyn Osovskyi describing the triumph as exhilarating. \u201cWe're really glad that we had to work our way through, it was interesting,\u201d he said, adding that the goal is to have their own championship and to create a strong team to represent Ukraine on the international level.",
      "\u201cThis will be a priority for the next few years for us,\u201d said Andriy Shevhenko, president of the Ukrainian Association of Football, noting there are more than 100,000 amputees in the country, most of them \u201csoldiers who defended our country.\u201d",
      "For Olena Balbek, adviser to the president of the association, the sport is one way to provide mental and physical rehabilitation for amputees while also normalizing their growing presence in society.",
      "\u201cThis is a societal effort,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re focusing on sports because it\u2019s our area of expertise, to make sure this is normalized.\u201d",
      "Citing their own research, Balbek said the association boasts at least 60 professional amputee players in Ukraine \u2013 a significant number considering there are around 1,000 worldwide.",
      "Though the reasons are unfortunate, Balbek said, \u201cWe have a huge potential in terms of engaging people in the sport.\u201d",
      "Featuring five teams from across Ukraine, the weekend\u2019s championship served as a testament to the association\u2019s success in developing grassroots amputee football across the country since the full-scale invasion began. A dedicated department within the association assists local groups in creating teams.",
      "The work is multifaceted, said Balbek, involving communication with veteran\u2019s groups, local initiatives and football clubs underscoring the importance of establishing amputee teams.",
      "\u201cFootball is the best rehabilitation for me,\" said Mykola Gatala, captain of the Pokrova AMP-One team. \"It has helped me both physically and mentally. I\u2019m doing it with my brothers in arms who went through the same things I did. We understand each other.\u201d",

      "DALLAS -- Mike McCarthy will not return as coach of the Dallas Cowboys, who are going on three decades since their last Super Bowl title, owner Jerry Jones said Monday.",
      "Jones said the organization and McCarthy mutually agreed to part ways. A search for the team's next coach begins immediately, he said.",
      "\u201cI have great respect for Mike, and he has led the team through some very unique and challenging times during his tenure,\u201d Jones said in a statement.",
      "McCarthy\u2019s contract expired on Jan. 8 following a 7-10 season. Dallas was 12-5 each of the three years before that under him, but still hasn\u2019t been past the divisional round of the NFC playoffs since its last Super Bowl at the end of the 1995 season.",
      "University of Colorado coach Deion Sanders \u2014 who played on the last Super Bowl-winning Cowboys team \u2014 has a good relationship with Jones and could emerge as a coaching candidate. The two have discussed the job, according to a person with knowledge of the conversation. The person, speaking on condition of anonymity because a formal interview hasn\u2019t been arranged, said the team was still in the process of gathering candidates.",
      "The Cowboys had an exclusive negotiating window with McCarthy through Tuesday, but the parties decided to split ahead of the deadline.",
      "At least one NFL team asked during that time about talking to the 61-year-old coach, who won a Super Bowl with Green Bay.",
      "Next season will be the 30th for the Cowboys since winning the last of their five Super Bowl titles.",
      "Before taking the Dallas job after a full season out of coaching, McCarthy was with the Packers for 13 seasons and had a 125-77-2 record from 2006-18. He was 10-8 in the playoffs and led Green Bay to a Super Bowl title at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Cowboys, 14 years ago.",
      "There were also three other NFC championship games for McCarthy in Green Bay, and that is what Jones envisioned \u2014 and more \u2014 when he hired the coach in 2020 after Jason Garrett never got that far in his 10 years.",
      "McCarthy finished with a 50-38 record in Dallas, including a 1-3 mark in the playoffs. That included last season, when the Cowboys were NFC East champions and had won 16 consecutive home games before trailing by 32 points in the fourth quarter of a 48-32 wild-card loss to the seventh-seeded Packers.",
      "Dallas played the final nine games this season without franchise quarterback Dak Prescott because of a torn hamstring. Top receiver CeeDee Lamb, seven-time Pro Bowl guard Zack Martin, cornerback Trevon Diggs and rushing defending DeMarcus Lawrence also finished the season on injured reserve.",
      "Garrett had the franchise\u2019s second-longest coaching tenure. Hall of Fame coach Tom Landry was the coach for the Cowboys\u2019 first 29 seasons, the same number of seasons they have now gone since winning a Super Bowl. Jones fired two-time Super Bowl winner Landry when he bought the Cowboys before the 1989 season.",
      "Only 12 NFL coaches have more career regular-season wins than McCarthy\u2019s 174, which is still far behind Don Shula\u2019s record 328. The only active coaches with more wins than McCarthy are Andy Reid (302 in 29 seasons) and Mike Tomlin (183 in 18 seasons).",
      "Jones' next coach will be his ninth. He hired Jimmy Johnson from the University of Miami, and the Cowboys won back-to-back Super Bowls in the 1992-93 seasons before the college teammates at Arkansas had an acrimonious split.",
      "Barry Switzer replaced Johnson, a Pro Football Hall of Fame coach, and won a Super Bowl in his second season but was fired two years later following a 6-10 season. Bill Parcells, another Hall of Famer, led the Cowboys to the playoffs twice in four seasons from 2003-06 but lost in the wild-card round both times.",

It\u2019s a great quarterback, obviously with Lamar and what he\u2019s able to do. He\u2019s one of the most dynamic, if not the most dynamic, quarterback in the league. He\u2019s so fun to watch. But I\u2019ll be watching their defense this week, so that\u2019s our focus.\u201d",

      "Nix finished 13 of 22 for 144 yards in an outing where Denver punted four times and turned the ball over on downs twice.",
      "And the Broncos attacking defense was kept at bay by an Allen-led attack that was more than content in gaining small chunks of yards on lengthy time-consuming drives.",
      "The Broncos, who had an NFL-leading 63 sacks this seasons, sacked Allen just twice in an game where the Bills punted once.",
      "Trailing 7-3, Cook scored the go-ahead touchdown 2:03 into the second quarter to cap a 13-play, 81-yard drive. All three of Buffalo\u2019s first-half possessions featured 11 or more offensive snaps.",
      "The Broncos had little response in a first half that ended with Denver trailing 10-7 after Wil Lutz banked a 50-yard field-goal attempt off the right upright as time expired. The miss was Lutz\u2019s first since Week 10 when his 35-yard attempt was blocked by the Chiefs to preserve Kansas City\u2019s 16-14 win.",

      "LAS VEGAS -- Adam Edstrom tipped in Jonny Brodzinski's shot off the rush at 5:57 of the third period for the winning goal in the New York Rangers' 2-1 victory Saturday night over the Vegas Golden Knights.",
      "The Rangers are 4-1-1 in their last six games. Vegas, which was defeated 4-0 on Thursday night by the New York Islanders, lost consecutive games for the first time since Nov. 17 and 20.",
      "Vincent Trocheck scored the other New York goal on a power play, and Igor Shesterkin made 29 saves.",
      "Mark Stone scored on a power play for the Golden Knights' goal. Ilya Samsonov had 24 saves.",
      "Vegas' Ivan Barbashev returned after missing the previous 10 games because of an upper-body injury. Even with the missed time, his 15 goals are tied with Brett Howden for the team lead. Barbashev didn't waste any time trying to make an impact, taking a shot on goal just 17 seconds into the game.",
      "Rangers: Top linemates Artemi Panarin and Trocheck continue to produce. They each have recorded at least one point in the past four games. Their combined point total over that span is 12 (five goals, seven assists).",
      "Golden Knights: The Golden Knights were fourth in scoring entering the game with an average of 3.46 goals. They have scored just one goal total in back-to-back losses.",
      "The Rangers trailed 1-0 in the second period when the puck hit off Mika Zibanejad\u2019s stick and hit Trocheck in the stomach. Somehow, Trocheck backhanded the shot into the net to tie the game before immediately heading to the locker room. He returned a short time later.",
      "4 \u2014 The number of power-play goals the Rangers have scored in their past three games.",
      "The Rangers are at Colorado on Tuesday night and the Golden Knights host Minnesota on Sunday night.",

Askarov continued to show promise as the Sharks\u2019 goaltender of the future with several point-blank saves. \u2026 Will Smith, part of the team's young core, did not take a shift in the third period but remained on the bench.",

      "This defeat, of course, hurt more than the four that preceded it.",
      "\u201cI'm worried less about the regular season,\u201d coach Mike Tomlin said. \u201cIn the single-elimination tournament, I\u2019m really just disappointed in how we performed tonight, given the opportunity we had.\u201d",
      "Pittsburgh\u2019s strength this season was its defense. The unit was consistently effective in shutting down the run and notched 33 takeaways, tied for the NFL lead.",
      "In this game, however, the Steelers were trampled by star running back Derrick Henry and quarterback Lamar Jackson.",
      "Henry ran for 186 yards and two touchdowns. Jackson carried for 81 yards and also threw a pair of TD passes.",
      "The Ravens finished with a 299-29 advantage in yards rushing. That was too much for Pittsburgh to overcome, but the Steelers never stopped trying.",
      "\u201cThe best part about the game is the guys didn\u2019t give up,\u201d quarterback Russell Wilson said. \u201cIn the National Football League sometimes guys check out. We didn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Pittsburgh failed to force a turnover, leaving its offense a long way to go on virtually every possession. Against the Ravens, scoring two touchdowns wasn't nearly enough.",

      "Pittsburgh's final month of the regular season included a 34-17 loss in Baltimore that propelled the Ravens toward the division crown and a home game to start the playoffs. The Steelers (10-8) also lost to Philadelphia, Kansas City and finally, at home against a Cincinnati team that came in with an 8-8 record.",
      "Pittsburgh has never had a losing record in Tomlin's 18 seasons and has reached the playoffs a dozen times under his direction. Although both streaks continued this season, it's unlikely Tomlin or Steelers fans will look back on this chapter with any sense of pride.",
      "Just as disheartening, the Steelers have lost six consecutive postseason games since an 18-16 win over the Chiefs in January 2017. It's been one-and-done for Pittsburgh over its last five trips to the playoffs, and Tomlin is still striving for his first Super Bowl win since the 2008 season. He moved within one loss of matching Marvin Lewis' dubious NFL record of seven consecutive playoff defeats.",
      "\u201cI'm just assessing what transpired tonight,\u201d Tomlin said. \u201cThose are my bags, not their bags. The journey that we were on certainly came to a disappointing end tonight.\u201d",
      "Eager for a fresh start after ending the regular season with a thud, the Steelers stumbled from the outset on a chilly night in Baltimore.",
      "After Pittsburgh's opening possession ended with a punt, Baltimore (13-5) covered 95 yards in 13 plays for a 7-0 lead on a touchdown pass by Jackson to Rashod Bateman. Another three-and-out followed for the Steelers, who were outgained 128-27 in the first quarter.",

      "Just before the half, the Ravens applied another slap in the face to the reeling Steelers. Tomlin called a timeout with 1:08 remaining in hopes of getting the ball back as Baltimore faced a third down on its own 17.",
      "The move backfired. The Ravens zipped downfield and went up 21-0 on Jackson's TD pass to Justice Hill with 2 seconds left.",
      "Pittsburgh finally got into the end zone with a third-quarter touchdown pass from Wilson to Van Jefferson, but Baltimore promptly answered with a 70-yard drive, ending with a 44-yard run by Henry.",
      "The Steelers again closed within 14 points, but that was as close as they'd get. Wilson lamented the defeat, but treasured his first season in Pittsburgh following stays in Seattle and Denver.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been truly a blessing in my life, one of the best years for me personally, to be a Pittsburgh Steeler,\" said Wilson, still in uniform long after the final whistle.",

      "They did get creative on the first drive, lining Henry up for a direct snap from center while Jackson came across and faked a sweep. Henry kept the ball for a 34-yard gain. Jackson capped the possession with a 15-yard scoring strike to Rashod Bateman, who was Baltimore's top healthy receiver with Zay Flowers (knee) unavailable.",

      "Henry made it 14-0 with an 8-yard run with 4:09 left in the half. After a Pittsburgh punt, the Steelers called timeout on third-and-2 from the Baltimore 18, hoping to get the ball back, but the Ravens converted and then quickly moved into position to score.",
      "On second down from the Pittsburgh 5 with 11 seconds left, Jackson nearly used up the remaining time scrambling around, but he eventually dumped the ball off to an open Justice Hill, who went into the end zone with 2 seconds left.",
      "The Steelers drove 98 yards for a touchdown on their first second-half possession, with Russell Wilson throwing a 30-yard scoring pass to Van Jefferson. Baltimore quickly answered when Henry broke free up the middle for a 44-yard TD \u2014 Pittsburgh defenders were caught out of position because Jackson faked a run to the left after handing the ball off.",
      "Wilson answered with a 36-yard touchdown strike to George Pickens in the third, but that was it for the scoring. Wilson went 20 of 29 for 270 yards on a night when neither team turned the ball over.",
      "Pittsburgh T Dan Moore Jr. injured an ankle.",
      "The Ravens need Denver to win at Buffalo on Sunday if they're going to host a game next weekend. If that happens, Houston would come to Baltimore. If not, Baltimore would head to Buffalo for a matchup between Jackson and fellow MVP candidate Josh Allen.",

      "\u201cIt was a sad moment when Roger went, because the injuries had a lot to do with it. And Rafa also struggled with injuries. Nole is still quite fit, I have to say,\u201d said Wesley Koolhof, 35, who retired last year with one Grand Slam title in men's doubles and one in mixed doubles. \u201cYou know it\u2019s going to happen at one point that all the legends are going to retire. Nole is still going strong. Who knows how many years he has left in him?\u201d",

      "Asked what he expects to see from Djokovic in Australia, Carlos Alcaraz smiled and replied: \u201cA really dangerous player.\u201d",

      "SAO PAULO -- Brazil's President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva on Monday signed a bill restricting the use of smartphones at school, following a global trend for such limitations.",
      "The move will impact students at elementary and high schools across the South American nation starting in February. It provides a legal framework to ensure students only use such devices in cases of emergency and danger, for educational purposes, or if they have disabilities and require them.",
      "\"We cannot allow humanism to be replaced by algorithms,\u201d Lula said in a closed ceremony at the presidential palace in the capital, Brasilia, adding that the bill \u201cacknowledges the work of every serious person in education, everyone who wants to take care of children and teenagers in this country.\u201d",
      "In May, Fundacao Getulio Vargas, a leading think-tank and university, said Brazil had more smartphones than people, with 258 million devices for a population of 203 million Brazilians. Local market researchers said last year that Brazilians spend 9 hours and 13 minutes per day on screens, one of the world's highest figures.",

A survey released in October by Brazilian pollster Datafolha said that almost two-thirds of respondents supported banning the use of smartphones by children and teenagers at schools. More than three-quarters said those devices do more harm than good to their children.",

      "As of 2023, about two-thirds of Brazilian schools imposed some restriction on cellphone use, while 28% banned them entirely, according to a survey released in August by the Brazilian Internet Steering Committee.",
      "The Brazilian states of Rio de Janeiro, Maranhao and Goias have already passed local bills to ban such devices at schools. However, authorities have struggled to enforce these laws.",
      "Authorities in Sao Paulo, the most populous state in Brazil, are discussing whether smartphones should be banned both in public and private schools.",
      "Gabriele Alexandra Henriques Pinheiro, 25, works at a beauty parlor and is the mother of a boy diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. She also agrees with the restrictions, but says adults will continue to be a bad example of smartphone use for children.",
      "\u201cIt is tough,\u201d she said. \u201cI try to restrict the time my son watches any screens, but whenever I have a task to perform I have to use the smartphone to be able to do it all,\u201d she said.",
      "Institutions, governments, parents and others have for years associated smartphone use by children with bullying, suicidal ideation, anxiety and loss of concentration necessary for learning. China moved last year to limit children\u2019s use of smartphones, while France has in place a ban on smartphones in schools for kids aged six to 15.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s totally not clear why this La Nina is so late to form, and I have no doubt it\u2019s going to be a topic of a lot of research,\u201d L'Heureux said.",
      "In the United States, La Ninas tend to cause drier weather in the South and West. They tend to make weather wetter in parts of Indonesia, northern Australia and southern Africa, L'Heureux said. They typically bring more Atlantic hurricanes in summer months, but L\u2019Heureux forecast that this La Nina will have dissipated by the summer.",
      "El Nino often leads to rainier weather in the United States, and tends to increase temperatures globally while La Nina has the opposite effect. Studies have found that La Nina droughts have been costlier than weather extremes linked to El Nino.",
      "The last La Nina ended in 2023 after an unusual three-year stretch.",

      "In a collision between free speech and national security, the Supreme Court will hear arguments over the fate of TikTok, a digital age cultural phenomenon that roughly half the U.S. population uses for entertainment and information",
      "WASHINGTON -- In one of the most important cases of the social media age, free speech and national security collide at the Supreme Court on Friday in arguments over the fate of TikTok, a wildly popular digital platform that roughly half the people in the United States use for entertainment and information.",
      "TikTok says it plans to shut down the social media site in the U.S. by Jan. 19 unless the Supreme Court strikes down or otherwise delays the effective date of a law aimed at forcing TikTok's sale by its Chinese parent company.",
      "Working on a tight deadline, the justices also have before them a plea from President-elect Donald Trump, who has dropped his earlier support for a ban, to give him and his new administration time to reach a \u201cpolitical resolution\u201d and avoid deciding the case. It's unclear if the court will take the Republican president-elect's views \u2014 a highly unusual attempt to influence a case \u2014 into account.",
      "TikTok and China-based ByteDance, as well as content creators and users, argue the law is a dramatic violation of the Constitution's free speech guarantee.",
      "\u201cRarely if ever has the court confronted a free-speech case that matters to so many people,\u201d lawyers for the users and content creators wrote. Content creators are anxiously awaiting a decision that could upend their livelihoods and are eyeing other platforms.",
      "The case represents another example of the court being asked to rule about a medium with which the justices have acknowledged they have little familiarity or expertise, though they often weigh in on meaty issues involving restrictions on speech.",
      "The Biden administration, defending the law that President Joe Biden signed in April after it was approved by wide bipartisan majorities in Congress, contends that \u201cno one can seriously dispute that (China's) control of TikTok through ByteDance represents a grave threat to national security.\u201d",
      "Officials say Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok\u2019s U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread or suppress information.",
      "But the government \u201cconcedes that it has no evidence China has ever attempted to do so,\u201d TikTok told the justices, adding that limits on speech should not be sustained when they stem from fears that are predicated on future risks.",
      "In December, a panel of three appellate judges, two appointed by Republicans and one by a Democrat, unanimously upheld the law and rejected the First Amendment speech claims.",
      "Adding to the tension, the court is hearing arguments just nine days before the law is supposed to take effect and 10 days before a new administration takes office.",
      "In language typically seen in a campaign ad rather than a legal brief, lawyers for Trump have called on the court to temporarily prevent the TikTok ban from going into effect but refrain from a definitive resolution.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns expressed by the Government \u2014 concerns which President Trump himself has acknowledged,\u201d D. John Sauer, Trump\u2019s choice to be his administration\u2019s top Supreme Court lawyer, wrote in a legal brief filed with the court.",
      "Trump took no position on the underlying merits of the case, Sauer wrote. Trump's campaign team used TikTok to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, and Trump met with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, in December. He has 14.7 million followers on TikTok.",
      "The justices have set aside two hours for arguments, and the session likely will extend well beyond that. Three highly experienced Supreme Court lawyers will be making arguments. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar will present the Biden administration's defense of the law, while Trump\u2019s solicitor general in his first administration, Noel Francisco, will argue on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance. Stanford Law professor Jeffrey Fisher, representing content creators and users, will be making his 50th high court argument.",
      "If the law takes effect, Trump's Justice Department will be charged with enforcing it. Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance have argued that the new administration could seek to mitigate the law\u2019s most severe consequences.",
      "But they also said that a shutdown of just a month would cause TikTok to lose about one-third of its daily users in the U.S. and significant advertising revenue.",
      "As it weighs the case, the court will have to decide what level of review it applies to the law. Under the most searching review, strict scrutiny, laws almost always fail. But two judges on the appellate court that upheld the law said it would be the rare exception that could withstand strict scrutiny.",
      "TikTok, the app's users and many briefs supporting them urge the court to apply strict scrutiny to strike down the law.",
      "But the Democratic administration and some of its supporters cite restrictions on foreign ownership of radio stations and other sectors of the economy to justify the effort to counter Chinese influence in the TikTok ban.",
      "A decision could come within days.",

      "But not all innovation is good, according to a panel of self-described dystopia experts that has judged some products as \u201cWorst in Show.\" The award that no company wants to win calls out the \u201cleast repairable, least private, and least sustainable products on display.\"",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing more and more of these things that have basically surveillance technology built into them, and it enables some cool things,\u201d Liz Chamberlain, director of sustainability at the e-commerce site iFixit told The Associated Press. \u201cBut it also means that now we\u2019ve got microphones and cameras in our washing machines, refrigerators and that really is an industry-wide problem.\u201d",
      "The fourth annual contest announced its decisions Thursday.",
      "Kyle Wiens, CEO of iFixit, awarded the Ultrahuman Rare Luxury Smart Ring the title of \u201cleast repairable.\u201d",
      "The rings, which come in colors like dune and desert sand, cost $2,200. Wiens said the jewelry \u201clooks sleek but hides a major flaw: its battery only lasts 500 charges.\u201d Worse, he said, is the fact that replacing the battery is impossible without destroying the device entirely.",
      "\u201cLuxury items may be fleeting, but two years of use for $2,200 is a new low,\u201d he said.",

      "The feature \u201cincreases energy consumption, encourages wasteful takeout consumption and distracts drivers\u2014all while adding little value,\u201d Higginbotham said. That landed the in-car system as \u201cleast sustainable\u201d on the list.",
      "TP-Link's Archer BE900 router won for \u201cleast secure\u201d of CES. The company is a top-selling router brand in the U.S. But its products are vulnerable to hacking, said Paul Roberts, founder of The Security Ledger.",
      "\"By Chinese law, TP-Link must report security flaws to the government before alerting the public, creating a significant national security risk,\" he said. \u201cYet TP-Link showcased its Archer BE900 router at CES without addressing these vulnerabilities.\u201d",

      "An international team of scientists say they\u2019ve successfully drilled one of the oldest ice cores yet, penetrating nearly 2 miles to Antarctic bedrock to reach ice that's at least 1.2 million years old",
      "An international team of scientists announced Thursday they\u2019ve successfully drilled one of the oldest ice cores yet, penetrating nearly 2 miles (2.8 kilometers) to Antarctic bedrock to reach ice they say is at least 1.2 million years old.",
      "Analysis of the ancient ice is expected to show how Earth's atmosphere and climate have evolved. That should provide insight into how Ice Age cycles have changed, and may help in understanding how atmospheric carbon changed climate, they said.",
      "\u201cThanks to the ice core we will understand what has changed in terms of greenhouse gases, chemicals and dusts in the atmosphere,\u201d said Carlo Barbante, an Italian glaciologist and coordinator of Beyond EPICA, the project to obtain the core. Barbante also directs the Polar Science Institute at Italy's National Research Council.",
      "The same team previously drilled a core about 800,000 years old. The latest drilling went 2.8 kilometers (about 1.7 miles) deep, with a team of 16 scientists and support personnel drilling each summer over four years in average temperatures of about minus-35 Celsius (minus-25.6 Fahrenheit).",
      "Italian researcher Federico Scoto was among the glaciologists and technicians who completed the drilling at the beginning of January at a location called Little Dome C, near Concordia Research Station.",
      "\u201cIt was a great a moment for us when we reached the bedrock,\u201d Scoto said. Isotope analysis gave the ice's age as at least 1.2 million years old, he said.",
      "Both Barbante and Scoto said that thanks to the analysis of the ice core of the previous Epica campaign they have assessed that concentrations of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, even during the warmest periods of the last 800,000 years, have never exceeded the levels seen since the Industrial Revolution began.",
      "\u201cToday we are seeing carbon dioxide levels that are 50% above the highest levels we\u2019ve had over the last 800,000 years,\" Barbante said.",
      "The European Union funded Beyond EPICA (European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica) with support from nations across the continent. Italy is coordinating the project.",
      "The announcement was exciting to Richard Alley, a climate scientist at Penn State who was not involved with the project and who was recently awarded the National Medal of Science for his career studying ice sheets.",
      "Alley said advancements in studying ice cores are important because they help scientists better understand the climate conditions of the past and inform their understanding of humans\u2019 contributions to climate change in the present. He added that reaching the bedrock holds added promise because scientists may learn more about Earth\u2019s history not directly related to the ice record itself.",

      "\u201cHuge rivers like the Amazon can appear mighty, but at the same time freshwater environments are very fragile,\u201d said study co-author Patricia Charvet, a biologist at Brazil's Federal University of Cear\u00e1.",
      "Freshwater habitats \u2013 including rivers, lakes, ponds, streams, bogs and wetlands \u2013 cover less than 1% of the planet\u2019s surface, but support 10% of its animal species, said Catherine Sayer, a zoologist at the International Union for Conservation of Nature in England.",
      "The researchers examined around 23,500 species of dragonflies, fish, crabs and other animals that depend exclusively on freshwater ecosystems. They found that 24% were at risk of extinction \u2013 classified as vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered \u2013 due to compounding threats from pollution, dams, water extraction, agriculture, invasive species, climate change and other disruptions.",
      "\u201cMost species don\u2019t have just one threat putting them at risk of extinction, but many threats acting together,\u201d said Sayer, a study-co-author.",
      "The tally, published in the journal Nature, is the first that time researchers have analyzed the global risk to freshwater species. Previous studies have focused on land animals including including mammals, birds and reptiles.",

      "LAS VEGAS -- Interior lighting aimed at reducing motion sickness. Shiny holographic dashboards displayed on windshields. And AI-powered voice assistants paired with infotainment systems to keep you company on long drives.",
      "Automakers pulled out all the stops to showcase their latest advances for in-vehicle experiences at CES, the Consumer Technology Association\u2019s annual trade show of all things tech, in Las Vegas this week. Hyundai Mobis unveiled a full-windshield holographic technology, while BMW spotlighted its new \u201ciDrive\u201d panoramic display. And Honda and Sony Honda Mobility showed what consumers can expect with their upcoming electric vehicles.",
      "Many of these driving enhancements aim to \u201cmake life on board more comfortable,\u201d explains Axel Maschka, executive vice president and head of the business division at Hyundai Mobis. And for some consumers today, he adds, \u201cthis \u2018living space\u2019\" of a car's interior has become a dominant part of a vehicle's appeal.",
      "Hyundai Mobis' holographic windshield display provides a glimpse into that. The technology, which won't be on the market for at least several more years, projects information ranging from driving speed to safety alerts across the entire windshield, and also provides some entertainment options for those who aren\u2019t behind the wheel. To keep the driver's eyes on the road, the panoramic display looks different depending on where you sit. A demo from the South Korean company shows the front row passenger can watch a movie or play a video game projected ahead of them, for example, but it's not visible to the driver.",
      "Maschka claims the holographic windshield gives drivers an easier view of key information in their line of sight and keeps other distractions in the car out of sight.",
      "Car safety experts have long stressed that keeping drivers' eyes on the road is critical. Simplicity is also key, says Ian Reagan, a senior research scientist at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an education and research nonprofit. Too many visual display features can be overwhelming, he explains.",
      "\u201cDriver distraction is a big concern with visual displays in vehicles,\u201d said Reagan, who cautions that safety \u201cdoesn't always win out\u201d over what some companies determine is going to be \u201csexy and sell\u201d for consumers. Still, Reagan says he's encouraged by recent developments in panoramic displays that aim to keep key, minimal information in a car's line of sight.",
      "Beyond Hyundai Mobis, that's part of what BMW, which showed off its new Panoramic iDrive and Operating System X, also says it's trying to do. The system, which will be integrated into of new models starting later this year, projects a panoramic display onto the vehicles' lower windscreen.",
      "The technology offers a range of digital features and can be personalized by different colors, apps and other preferences. But in the driver's line of sight, Stephan Durach, BMW\u2019s Head of UI/UX Development, said the goal was to avoid redundancies.",
      "\u201cYou often hear the phrase, \u2018your car is your smartphone on wheels.\u2019 And to be honest, I don\u2019t like this at all,\u201d Durach told The Associated Press. He said that the display aims to show a minimal amount of the most important information above the dashboard, in efforts to help reduce distractions.",
      "Honda and Sony Honda Mobility also spotlighted in-cabin features that drivers will soon encounter in their new EV lineup.",
      "Sony Honda Mobility says \u201cAfeela 1\" will include an interactive AI-powered voice agent. In Monday's remarks, CEO Yasuhide Mizuno said that \u201ccustomers can be entertained by communicating with Afeela 1\u201d \u2014 noting that Afeela's agent is \u201cfocused on conversation\u201d and \u201cproactively talks to you\u201d to provide useful information as you drive.",
      "The Afeela 1, scheduled to go on sale later this year with deliveries anticipated for mid-2026, also touts a panoramic screen and infotainment system filled with a variety of entertainment apps. Online reservations for the car opened in California this week.",
      "Meanwhile, Honda spotlighted \u201cultra-personal optimization\u201d for customers of its upcoming 0 series of electric vehicles \u2014 the first two models of which are set to launch in North America next year. The Japanese car giant unveiled the operating system that it plans to use in all 0 series models, \u201cAISMO OS,\u201d which it says will be integrated into vehicle operations ranging from automated driving and advanced driver assistance to in-car infotainment.",
      "In-vehicle software functions will also continue to be updated after purchase. \u201cThe more it is used, the more personalized it will become,\u201d Katsushi Inoue, global head of electrification business development at Honda, said in Tuesday remarks.",
      "While there's ample excitement around the latest bells and whistles announced from car companies like those on display at CES this week, there are still questions about the safety and efficacy of new features.",
      "Reagan points to AI-powered voice agents and the growing buzz around partial automated driving. He says his team's research shows that people interacting with partially-automated driving are \u201cmore distracted than ever\u201d because drivers have to \u201calways be ready\u201d for changes in vehicle assistance.",
      "And while AI voice assistants bring promising solutions to keeping drivers' eyes on the road, Reagan notes that they're not all built equally. How they are implemented is key, he said, noting that if a voice assistant requires too much back and forth or complicated answers it can also lead to frustration and distraction.",
      "Beyond in-vehicle experiences, EVs showcased at CES this week highlighted the state of sustainable energy in the car industry today \u2014 and the need to expand charging sources for consumers. Honda has a venture with seven other automakers to create the \u201cIONNA\u201d charging network in North America and said Tuesday it plans to expand such efforts \u201cto ensure that Honda 0 Series owners will have access to more than 100,000 charging stations by 2030.\u201d",
      "Honda is also exploring ways to provide \u201cpersonalized\u201d charging experiences for its EV customers down the road.

      "Hearing a lot about Lemon8 lately? You\u2019re not the only one.",
      "Amid a looming U.S. ban on TikTok, content creators have been pushing the platform's sister app. Lemon8 resembles an amalgamation of the types of short-form videos found on TikTok and the picture-perfect aesthetic of Instagram and Pinterest.",
      "Like its popular relation, Lemon8 is owned by China-based ByteDance, whose collection of internationally available apps also includes the video editing app CapCut and the photo and art editing app Hypic. In addition, the company operates Douyin, the Chinese sibling of TikTok that follows Beijing\u2019s strict censorship rules.",
      "Lemon8 launched in the U.S. in 2023, a few years after it first popped up in Asian markets. Though it garnered some media and user interest in its early days, the app hasn\u2019t taken off as much as TikTok, which has more than 170 million U.S. users.",
      "But more people have downloaded the app in the past month, making it one of the top-ranking free apps on Apple\u2019s app store. Lemon8's popularity could potentially soar further depending on the outcome of a U.S. Supreme Court hearing Friday over a law requiring TikTok to break ties with ByteDance or face a U.S. ban.",
      "TikTok says it plans to shut down the platform in the U.S. by Jan. 19 if the government prevails, as it did in a lower court.",
      "Influencers previously partnered with Lemon8 to promote the lesser-known app on TikTok. In recent weeks, many of them have hailed Lemon8 as the place to go if TikTok is banned under federal law. Some have also been recommending it through paid sponsored posts tagged #lemon8partner, showing a recent corporate push to generate more users.",
      "But there's a hitch. The law, which would wipe out TikTok\u2019s U.S. operation if it\u2019s not sold to an approved buyer, states the divest-or-ban requirement applies generally to apps that are owned or operated by ByteDance, TikTok or any of their subsidiaries. That means even though Lemon8 and CapCut are not explicitly named in the statute, their futures in the U.S. also are in jeopardy.",
      "Jasmine Enberg, an analyst at market research company Emarketer, noted that the creators recommending Lemon8 may not be aware of the possible implications for the other ByteDance apps because the law does not identify them.",
      "The recent Lemon8 ads on TikTok also may be a sign that ByteDance is \u201choping or betting\u201d Lemon8 slips through the cracks as lawmakers and regulators focus their attention on TikTok, Enberg said. Representatives for the companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "To boost Lemon8\u2019s user base, TikTok announced in November that creators would be able to access a Lemon8 account with the same account they use on TikTok, a feature the company says will enhance their ability to cross-post content. TikTok said the integration was designed to expand creators \u201creach and engagement potential.\u201d",
      "Like TikTok, Lemon8\u2019s main feed features both a \u201cfollowing\u201d section that lets users look at content from the creators they follow and a \u201cFor You\u201d section that recommends other posts. The newer platform also sorts posts into different categories, like relationships, wellness and skincare.",
      "ByteDance has not disclosed the number of global or U.S. users on Lemon8, which is believed to be miniscule compared to its trend-setting sister app. Data from the research firm SimilarWeb indicates Lemon8 has a little over 1 million daily active users.",
      "Market intelligence company Sensor Tower estimates the app saw a significant jump in global downloads in December \u2014 a 150% increase \u2014 compared to an average 2% month-over-month decline last year. The U.S. accounted for 70% of the month's downloads.",
      "The largest number of U.S. downloads were performed on Dec. 19, according to Sensor Tower. That was the day after the Supreme Court said it would hear this week's oral arguments over the constitutionality of the federal law that could ban TikTok.",
      "The law passed with bipartisan support last year after lawmakers and Biden administration officials expressed concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over U.S. user data or sway public opinion towards Beijing\u2019s interests by manipulating the algorithm that populates users\u2019 feeds.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court on Dec. 27 to pause the potential TikTok ban from going into effect until he is inaugurated and his administration can pursue a \u201cpolitical resolution\u201d to the issue."

    "story": [
      "A renowned Israeli TV journalist who lost his ability to speak clearly because of ALS is returning to the air using artificial-intelligence software that recreates his widely recognized gravelly voice",
      "JERUSALEM -- When a renowned Israeli TV journalist lost his ability to speak clearly because of ALS, he thought his career might be over. But now, using artificial-intelligence software that can recreate his widely recognized gravelly voice, Moshe Nussbaum \u2014 known to generations of viewers simply as \u201cNussi\u201d \u2014 is making a comeback.",
      "Nussbaum, 71, was diagnosed two years ago with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a progressive disease also known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease that attacks nerve cells that control muscles throughout the body.",
      "At the time, he vowed to viewers of Israel's Channel 12 News to continue working as long as he was physically able. But, gradually, it became more and more difficult.",
      "It was a devastating blow to the career of a leading, no-nonsense reporter who for more than 40 years had covered many of Israel\u2019s most important stories from the field. He had appeared from the scenes of suicide bombing attacks and the front lines of wars in Gaza and Lebanon, and had covered scandals in Israel\u2019s parliament and high-profile court cases.",
      "After Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war in Gaza, Nussbaum was unable to report from the field. It was the first war of his career he had ever sat out, he noted in a recent interview with colleagues at Channel 12, the country's largest station.",
      "Even though he was having trouble moving and speaking, he launched a segment interviewing injured soldiers from Israeli hospitals. His questions were slow and halting, but he kept it up for the first half of the war. Then, as it became increasingly difficult to speak, and to be understood, his interviews became less frequent.",
      "On Monday, Channel 12 made the surprising announcement that it would bring Nussbaum back to the air in the coming weeks as a commentator\u2014 with the help of AI.",
      "\u201cIt took me a few moments to absorb it and to understand that it is me speaking now,\u201d Nussbaum told The Associated Press via text message. \u201cSlowly, slowly, I\u2019m understanding the incredible meaning of this device for everyone with disabilities, including me.\u201d",
      "Nussbaum will report his stories, and then write them up, using an AI program that has been trained to speak using Nussbaum\u2019s voice. He will be filmed as if he were presenting, and his lips will be \u201ctechnologically adjusted\u201d to match the words.",
      "People with speech disorders have used traditional text-to-speech technology for years, but those voices sound robotic and flat, and lack emotion. In contrast, AI technology is trained using recordings of a person\u2019s voice \u2014 there are thousands of hours of Nussbaum speaking thanks to his lengthy career in TV and radio \u2014 and it can mimic their intonations and phrasing.",
      "Thrilled by the possibilities the technology affords him, Nussbaum said he is also worried about the ease with which the technology could be used by bad actors to spread fake news and falsehoods.",
      "In its current form, the technology will not work for live broadcasts, so Nussbaum won't be able to go out into the field, which is his favorite part of the job, he said. Instead, he will focus on commentary and analysis about crime and national security, his areas of expertise for decades.",
      "Ahead of the broadcasts, Channel 12 released a preview showing snippets of Nussbaum speaking naturally \u2014 garbled and difficult to understand \u2014 followed by the new \u201cNussi AI.\u201d The new version sounds strikingly like the old Nussbaum, speaking quickly and emphatically. Nussbaum was filmed as if he was presenting the report, sitting straight with his trademark bushy eyebrows moving up and down for emphasis.",
      "\u201cHonestly, this is my first time sitting here in the studio after more than a year,\u201d AI Nussbaum says in the preview. \u201cIt feels a bit strange, and mostly, it tugs my heart.\u201d",
      "AI-powered voice cloning has grown exponentially in recent years. Experts have warned that the technology can amplify phone scams, disrupt democratic elections and violate the dignity of people \u2014 living or dead \u2014 who never consented to having their voice recreated to say things they never said.",
      "It\u2019s been used to produce deepfake robocalls mimicking President Joe Biden. In the U.S., authorities recently charged a high school athletic director with using AI to generate a fake audio clip of the school\u2019s principal making racist remarks.",
      "But the technology also has tremendous potential to help people who have lost their ability to speak clearly. A U.S. congresswoman who cannot speak due to complications from Parkinson\u2019s and a related palsy has used a similar AI program to give a speech on the House floor, and the technology has also helped a young woman who lost her voice due to a tumor.",
      "Channel 12 declined to say which AI program it was using.",
      "Nussbaum had worried that ALS would rob him of the career he loved. In an interview with Channel 12, he recounted telling his managers \u201cdon\u2019t feel like you\u2019re pitying me, doing me a favor,\" he said. \"The day you come to the conclusion that this is it \u2014 tell me. I\u2019ll know how to accept it without a problem.\u201d",
      "He calls his new AI-enabled persona a \u201cmagic trick\u201d that enabled his comeback, and believes it will raise awareness in Israel of ways that people with disabilities \u2014 especially progressive disabilities \u2014 can continue to work.",
      "\u201cThe fact that Channel 12 and my news managers are allowing me to reinvent myself anew, that is one of the most important medicines I can get in my fight with this disease,\u201d he said."

      "Rescue workers in the freezing, high-altitude Tibet region are searching for more survivors and victims, one day after a strong earthquake leveled thousands of houses and killed at least 126 people near a holy city for Tibetan Buddhists",
      "BEIJING -- Rescue workers in the freezing, high-altitude Tibet region in western China searched Wednesday for more survivors and victims of a strong earthquake that struck a day earlier near a holy city for Tibetan Buddhists, killing at least 126 people and leveling thousands of houses.",
      "Tents, quilts and other relief items were being delivered to people whose homes were uninhabitable or unsafe. Temperatures fell well below freezing overnight in an area with an average altitude of about 4,200 meters (13,800 feet).",
      "The confirmed death toll stood at 126 with another 188 injured as of Tuesday evening. The earthquake struck the city of Xigaze, the traditional seat of the Panchen Lama, the second-highest figure in Tibetan Buddhism. It was not immediately known whether he was in his Tashi Lhunpo Monastery at the time of the quake or how much damage the city sustained. The quake's distance from Xigaze, which sprawls across a high altitude plain, was about 25 kilometers (15 miles).",
      "The Chinese government and followers of the Dalai Lama, Tibetan Buddhism's highest figure, have feuded over who should hold the position of Panchen Lama since a boy appointed by the Dalai Lama disappeared in the mid-1990s and a Chinese-backed candidate was approved for the position. The Dalai Lama, viewed by the Chinese government as a dangerous separatist, denounced the move and has refused to recognize the current Panchen Lama.",
      "China's government says Tibet has been part of its territory for centuries, but many Tibetans say they were functionally independent for most of that time. China's People's Liberation Army invaded the territory in 1950 and the Dalai Lama fled to India nine years later during an uprising against Chinese rule, seen as eroding Tibet's unique Buddhist culture.",
      "More than 500 aftershocks were recorded after the earthquake, which the U.S. Geological Survey said measured magnitude 7.1. China\u2019s earthquake center recorded a magnitude of 6.8.",
      "The quake was also about 75 kilometers (50 miles) from Mount Everest and the border with Nepal, where the shaking sent people running out of their homes in the capital.",
      "The dead included at least 22 of the 222 residents of Gurum, the official Xinhua News Agency cited the village's Communist Party chief, Tsering Phuntsog, as saying. The victims included his 74-year-old mother, and several other of his relatives remained buried in the debris.",
      "\u201cEven young people couldn\u2019t run out of the houses when the earthquake hit, let alone old people and children,\u201d Tsering Phuntsog said.",
      "More than 3,600 houses collapsed, according to a preliminary survey, and 30,000 residents have been relocated, Xinhua said, citing the city government in Xi, also known by its Tibetan spelling, Shigatse.",
      "The Ministry of Emergency Management has 1,850 rescuers on the ground along with firefighters and others, state broadcaster CCTV said.",
      "Tibet is generally closed to foreign journalists over reports about the ill treatment of the native population by Chinese authorities.",
      "Chinese leader Xi Jinping ordered \u201call-out rescue efforts to save lives and minimize casualties,\u201d Xinhua reported. Communications in the area have also been restored, allowing smoother delivery of emergency goods, it said.",
      "A candlelight vigil was planned in Dharamsala, India, home of the Dalai Lama and a large Tibetan population, on Wednesday night, and an announcement on the Dalai Lama\u2019s website said he would lead a prayer ceremony in memory of the victims on Thursday.",
      "Asked about the prayer ceremony, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said, \u201cWe are very clear about the separatist nature and political schemes of the Dalai Lama and remain highly vigilant.\u201d",
      "Guo expressed confidence that the people in the earthquake zone would be able to rebuild under \u201cthe strong leadership\u201d of the Communist Party.",

      "When he was still a boy making the long, tedious trips between his school and his woodsy home in the mountains during the 1980s, JoeBen Bevirt began fantasizing about flying cars that could whisk him to his destination in a matter of minutes",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- When he was still a boy making long, tedious trips between his school and his woodsy home in the mountains during the 1980s, JoeBen Bevirt began fantasizing about flying cars that could whisk him to his destination in a matter of minutes.",
      "As CEO of Joby Aviation, Bevirt is getting closer to turning his boyhood flights of fancy into a dream come true as he and latter-day versions of the Wright Brothers launch a new class of electric-powered aircraft vying to become taxis in the sky.",
      "The aircraft \u2014 known as \"electric vertical take-off and landing vehicle, or eVTOL \u2014 lift off the ground like a helicopter before flying at speeds up to 200 miles per hour (322 kilometers per hour) with a range of about 100 miles (161 kilometers). And these craft do it without filling the air with excessive noise caused by fuel-powered helicopters and small airplanes.",
      "\u201cWe are just a few steps from the finish line. We want to turn what are now one- and two-hour trips into five-minute trips,\u201d Bevirt, 51, told The Associated Press before a Joby air taxi took off on a test flight in Marina, California \u2014 located about 40 miles south from where he grew up in the mountains.",
      "Archer Aviation, a Silicon Valley a Silicon Valley company backed by automaker Stellantis and United Airlines, has been testing its own eVTOLs over farmland in Salinas, California, where a prototype called \u201cMidnight\u201d could be seen gliding above a tractor plowing fields last November.",
      "The tests are part of the journey that Joby Aviation and other ambitious companies that collectively have raised billions of dollars are taking to turn flying cars into more than just pie-in-the-sky concepts popularized in 1960s-era cartoon series, \u201cThe Jetsons,\u201d and the 1982 science fiction film, \u201cBlade Runner.\u201d",
      "Archer Aviation and nearby Wisk Aero, with ties to aerospace giant Boeing Co. and Google co-founder Larry Page, are also at the forefront in the race to bring air taxis to market in the United States. Joby has already formed a partnership to connect its air taxis with Delta Air Lines passengers while Archer Aviation has lined up a deal to sell up to 200 of its aircraft to United Airlines.",
      "Flying taxis have made enough regulatory inroads with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to result in the recent creation of a new aircraft category called \u201cpowered lift,\u201d a step that the agency hadn't taken since helicopters were introduced for civilian use in the 1940s.",
      "But there are more regulatory hurdles to be cleared before air taxis will be allowed to carry passengers in the U.S., making Dubai the most likely place where eVTOLs will take commercial flight \u2014 perhaps by the end of this year.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a tricky business to develop a whole new class of vehicles,\u201d said Alan Lim, director of Alton Aviation Consultancy, a firm tracking the industry's evolution. \u201cIt is going to be like a crawl, walk, run situation. Right now, I think we are still crawling. We are not going to have the Jetsons-type reality where everyone will be flying around everywhere in the next two to three years.\u201d",
      "China is also vying to make flying cars a reality, a quest that has piqued President-elect Donald Trump's interest in making the vehicles a priority for his incoming administration during the next four years.",
      "If the ambitions of eVTOL pioneers are realized in the U.S., people will be able to hop in an air taxi to get to and from airports serving New York and Los Angeles within the next few years.",
      "Because its electric taxis can fly unimpeded at high speeds, Joby envisions transporting up to four Delta Air Lines passengers at a time from New York area airports to Manhattan in about 10 minutes or less. To start, air taxi prices almost certainly will be significantly more that the cost of taking a cab or Uber ride from JFK airport to Manhattan, but the difference could narrow over time because eVTOLs should be able to transport a higher volume of passengers than ground vehicles stuck in traffic going each way.",
      "\u201cYou will see highways in the sky,\u201d Archer Aviation CEO Adam Goldstein predicted during an interview at the company's San Jose, California, headquarters. \u201cThere will be hundreds, maybe thousands of these aircraft flying in these individual cities and it will truly change the way cities are being built.\u201d",
      "Investors are betting Goldstein is right, helping Archer raise an additional $430 million late last year from a group that included Stellantis and United Airlines. The infusion came shortly after a Japanese automaker poured another $500 million into Joby to bring its total investment in that company to nearly $900 million.",
      "Those investments were part of the $13 billion that eVTOL companies have raised during the past five years, according to Alton Aviation.",
      "Both Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation went public in 2021 through reverse mergers, opening up another fundraising avenue and making it easier to recruit engineers with the allure of stock options. Both companies have been able to attract workers away from electric automaker Tesla and rocket maker SpaceX and, in Archer's instance, raiding the ranks of Wisk Aero.",
      "The Wisk defections triggered a lawsuit accusing Archer of intellectual property theft in a dispute that was resolved with a 2023 settlement that included an agreement for the two sides to collaborate on some facets of eVTOL technology.",
      "Before going public, Joby also acquired eVTOL technology developed by ride-hailing service Uber in an $83 million deal that also brought those two companies together as partners.",
      "But none of the deals or technological advances have stopped the losses from piling up at the companies building flying cars. Joby, whose roots date back to 2009 when Bevirt founded the company, has sustained $1.6 billion in losses since its inception while Archer has amassed nearly $1.5 billion in losses since its founding in 2018.",
      "While they moved to commercial air taxi services, both Joby and Archer are trying to bring in revenue by negotiating contracts to use their eVTOLs in the U.S. military for deliveries and other other short-range missions. Archer has forged a partnership with Anduril Industries, a military defense technology specialist founded by Oculus headset inventor Palmer Luckey, to help it win deals.",
      "The uncertain prospects have left both companies with relatively low market values by tech industry standards, with Joby's hovering around $7 billion and Archer's $6 billion.",
      "But Bevirt sees blue skies ahead. \u201ceVTOLs are going to transform the way we move,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a dramatically better way to get around. Seeing the world from the air is better than being stuck in the traffic on the interstate.\u201d"

    "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2025 02:39:16 -0500",
    "summary": "The Justice Department has released Volume One of special counsel Jack Smith's final report, detailing his election interference investigation into Donald Trump.",
    "story": [
      "The DOJ released Smith's final report on his election interference probe.",
      "Special counsel Jack Smith's final report lays out in no uncertain terms federal prosecutors' position that Donald Trump -- who is set to be inaugurated president in less than a week -- would have been convicted on multiple felonies for his alleged efforts to unlawfully overturn the results of the 2020 election, had voters not decided to send him back to the White House in the 2024 election.",
      "That was one of the primary conclusions included in Smith's final report on his election interference investigation, which the Justice Department released early Tuesday morning after a federal judge, late Monday night, cleared the way for the report's release.",
      "The report lays out the probe that resulted in Trump being charged in 2023 with four felony counts of undertaking a \"criminal scheme\" to overturn the results of the 2020 election in an effort to subvert democracy and remain in power. Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges.",
      "The case, as well as Smith's classified documents case against Trump, was dropped following Trump's reelection in November due to a longstanding Justice Department policy prohibiting the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "\"The Department's view that the Constitution prohibits the continued indictment and prosecution of a President is categorical and does not turn on the gravity of the crimes charged, the strength of the Government's proof, or the merits of the prosecution, which the Office stands fully behind,\" the report said. \"Indeed, but for Mr. Trump's election and imminent return to the Presidency, the Office assessed that the admissible evidence was sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction at trial.\"",
      "After conducting interviews with 250 witnesses voluntarily, calling 55 people to testify before the grand jury, executing dozens of subpoenas and search warrants, and sifting through a terabyte of publicly accessible data, Smith's team concluded they could convince a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump committed multiple federal crimes when he attempted to overturn the election, the report said.",
      "\"The throughline of all of Mr. Trump's criminal efforts was deceit -- knowingly false claims of election fraud -- and the evidence shows that Mr. Trump used these lies as a weapon to defeat a federal government function foundational to the United States' democratic process,\" the report said.",
      "For the first time, the report shed light on the internal deliberations of the prosecutors who sought to prove that Trump \"engaged in an unprecedented criminal effort\" while navigating the uncharted legal territory of charging a former president.",
      "While prosecutors considered charging Trump with violating the Insurrection Act, Smith wrote that he opted against the approach because of the \"litigation risk that would be presented by employing this long-dormant statute.\" According to the report, prosecutors worried that Trump's actions did not amount to an insurrection because he was already in power -- rather than challenging a sitting government -- when the riot took place. Smith also noted that his office did not obtain \"direct evidence\" of Trump's \"intent to cause the full scope of the violence that occurred on January 6.\"",
      "Smith also noted that the case against Trump presented unique challenges, including Trump's \"ability and willingness\" to use social media to target witnesses, courts, and prosecutors with \"threats and harassment.\" Like any other case involving a conspiracy, prosecutors also expressed concerns about convincing witnesses to cooperate while the defendant still exerted influence and command over his alleged co-conspirators.",
      "\"That dynamic was amplified in this case given Mr. Trump's political and financial status, and the prospect of his future election to the presidency,\" the report said.",
      "Despite those concerns, Smith's report laid out how prosecutors planned to rebut Trump's expected arguments to secure a conviction, laying out a play-by-play for how a trial would have proceeded had Trump lost the election.",
      "If the former president argued that he acted in good faith when he claimed there was election fraud, prosecutors would present \"strong proof\" that Trump himself knew his claims of fraud were false. The report noted that Trump repeatedly noted in private how he lost the election, including berating Vice President Mike Pence for being \"too honest\" to challenge the results, telling his family \"you still have to fight like hell\" even if he lost the election, and remarking to a staffer, \"Can you believe I lost to this f'ing guy?\" after seeing Biden on television.",
      "\"This was not a case in which Mr. Trump merely misstated a fact or two in a handful of isolated instances. On a repeated basis, he and co-conspirators used specific and knowingly false claims of election fraud,\" the report said.",
      "If Trump argued he was following the advice of his lawyers, prosecutors planned to present evidence showing that his lawyers were acting as accomplices to the crime, preventing Trump from legally being able to employ the argument.",
      "And if Trump argued that he was just using his First Amendment right when he challenged the election, prosecutors planned to highlight that Trump employed his statements to commit other crimes, including using false statements to defeat a government function, obstruct an official proceeding, and injure the right to vote.",
      "\"The Office was cognizant of Mr. Trump's free speech rights during the investigation and would not have brought a prosecution if the evidence indicated he had engaged in mere political exaggeration or rough-and-tumble politics,\" the report said. \"The conduct of Mr. Trump and co-conspirators, however, went well beyond speaking their minds or contesting the election results through our legal system.\"",
      "In the report, Smith also detailed multiple interviews with various so-called \"fake electors\" who he said sought to cast votes for Trump -- and admitted they would not have done so \"had they known the true extent of co-conspirators' plans.\"",
      "Smith told how investigators obtained Signal messages where \"Co-Conspirator 4\" -- previously identified by ABC News as former DOJ official Jeffrey Clark -- sent a message to Rep. Scott Perry saying he had received a highly classified briefing on foreign interference in the 2020 election that \"yielded nothing\" to support allegations of a stolen election.",
      "\"Bottom line is there is nothing helpful to P,\" Clark's message said, according to the report.",
      "The report cites the handwritten notes of former Vice President Mike Pence that the special counsel obtained, about which Smith wrote, \"In repeated conversations, day after day, Mr. Trump pressed Mr. Pence to use his ministerial position as President of the Senate to change the election outcome, often by citing false claims of election fraud as justification; he even falsely told Mr. Pence that the 'Justice Department [was] finding major infractions.'\"",
      "Regarding the House select committee's investigation into the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, the report said that probe only \"comprised a small part of the Office's investigative record, and any facts on which the Office relied to make a prosecution decision were developed or verified through independent interviews and other investigative steps.\"",
      "Volume One of Smith's final report was released to the public early Tuesday after U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, following a weeklong court battle, ruled Monday that the Justice Department could release it.",
      "Trump's former co-defendants in his classified documents case, longtime aide Walt Nauta and staffer Carlos De Oliveira, had sought to block the release of both the classified documents volume and the Jan. 6 volume, but Cannon -- who last year dismissed the classified documents case -- allowed the public release of the Jan. 6 volume after determining that its contents have no bearing on the evidence or charges related Nauta and De Oliveira in their ongoing case.",
      "After conferring with Smith, Garland determined that he would not publicly release Volume Two pertaining to the classified documents investigation because Nauta and De Oliveira's cases were technically still on appeal.",
      "In the classified documents case, Trump pleaded not guilty in 2023 to 40 criminal counts related to his handling of classified materials after leaving the White House, after prosecutors said he repeatedly refused to return hundreds of documents containing classified information. The former president, along with Nauta and De Oliveira, pleaded not guilty in a superseding indictment to allegedly attempting to delete surveillance footage at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate.",
      "Smith resigned as special prosecutor on Friday after wrapping up the cases and submitting his report to Garland.",

      "Approximately 92,000 people remain under mandatory evacuation orders with another 89,000 under evacuation warnings, due to intense Santa Ana winds fueling the flames that have scorched 40,000 acres and left at least 24 people dead. Severe fire conditions are expected to continue through Wednesday.",
      "The fires -- which are only partially contained -- first broke out in the Pacific Palisades on Jan. 7, followed by multiple other infernos across LA county, which have decimated entire neighborhoods and sent people fleeing from their homes to safety.",

      "Humanitarian chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s instantly deployed relief efforts in Southern California last week via his nonprofit World Central Kitchen, mobilizing a network of restaurant and food truck partners within hours of the blazes to serve nourishing meals to first responders and evacuees with the help of hundreds of volunteers.",
      "The nonprofit, which responds to natural disasters worldwide, has been inundated with both donations and offers to lend a helping hand on the ground.",
      "There has been a robust response to deliver aid during this difficult time, including from celebrities like Jennifer Garner -- who has lived in the Pacific Palisades for over 20 years and spoke to NBC News about passing out meals with World Central Kitchen in Altadena -- to Good Samaritans and longtime residents alike.",
      "Cameron Smith, an LA resident of 12 years who volunteered all weekend with World Central Kitchen, told \"Good Morning America\" the nonprofit is \"delivering food to pretty much everyone who needs it.\"",
      "\"It's been nothing short of incredible seeing them mobilize and combine forces, sometimes even collaborating to deliver incredible meals to those in need,\" he said. \"I've had the specific pleasure of delivering to frontline firefighters, as well as animal control workers who have been hard at work saving animals from the fires.\"",
      "Smith added that \"it's been absolutely incredible to see the restaurant community come together.\"",
      "\"Even restaurants in LA that have extremely sought-after reservations, like Felix Trattoria in Venice, are stepping up and committing to the cause,\" he said, referring to chef Evan Funke's famed Italian spot on Abbot Kinney Boulevard. \"Everyone has been more than happy to help, even providing much more than initially outlined by WCK to ensure everyone is getting the meals they deserve.\"",
      "On top of his and wife Nikki Smith's combined efforts with World Central Kitchen, the father-to-be told \"GMA\" he's been organizing virtual donations and pooling his efforts with local friends Nick and Karin Ruffini, coordinating Costco and Walmart shopping trips, purchasing highly requested relief items and filling up his Jeep Grand Cherokee to the brim with supplies.",
      "With 200 private donations as of time of publication, Smith and his friends have worked directly with donation drop-off locations and used donated funds to purchase additional essential supplies such as baby diapers, wipes, new baby clothes, strollers, non-perishable food, flashlights, batteries, new blankets, toiletries, bottled water, and new socks and undergarments \"for frontline workers and those directly affected by the fires.\"",
      "\"The volunteers' heartfelt gratitude and excitement upon receiving these much-needed supplies has been truly uplifting,\" Smith said of the continued efforts with YMCA and Baby2Baby locations around LA.",
      "Just 50 miles south of Pacific Palisades in Huntington Beach, chef Andrew Gruel has transformed his popular seafood restaurant Calico Fish House into a community hub where those impacted have been able to get everything from free meals to air purifiers.",
      "\"Over the past three days, we've probably had over 300 volunteers and $200,000 worth of product donations,\" Gruel told \"GMA.\" \"This weekend was a full blown donation drive through here. We had traffic cones and volunteers helping repackage items that were being dropped at the restaurant, with pallets full of supplies.\"",
      "Like so many, Gruel has helped coordinate donations, spreading the word for requests on social media to help support those in need with the help of his wife Lauren Gruel, who has also acted as a support to displaced families, hearing their stories and offering some moments of comfort.",
      "\"We've had probably 50 families come down here that have been affected by the fires to get a meal. Some of them for two days straight,\" Gruel said. \"We're letting them pick up and take everything they need until they move to where they're going next.\"",
      "With such demand in the impacted area, Gruel said one of his longtime farmer vendors in Bakersfield -- Santa Carota Beef -- \"took his trailer out and brought us about 1,000 pounds of meat.\"",
      "\"He loaded it up with diapers and wipes too and drove eight hours there and back to help out,\" he said.",
      "Without a forklift of his own to move the massive amounts of supplies, Gruel worked directly with the Dream Center Foundation in LA -- which has 1,700 rooms for people displaced since the fire evacuations began -- using its machinery to help do the heavy lifting and ultimately distribute the products.",
      "\"There are so many amazing stories in the midst of all this,\" Gruel said. \"We're individually talking to these families and its really horrible, but then we had three giant Amazon trucks pull up full of donations, so I'm trying to stay positive.\"",

      "The GOP House speaker claimed California leaders \u201cwere derelict in their duty.\u201d",
      "Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said Monday that \"there should probably be conditions\" on aid to help California deal with devastating wildfires when asked if he's open to sending funding, signaling a possible political battle over helping the traditionally Democratic state.",
      "\"I think there should probably be conditions on that aid. That's my personal view. We'll see what the consensus is. I haven't had a chance to socialize that with any of the members over the weekend because we've all been very busy, but it'll be part of the discussion,\" Johnson said.",
      "He did not offer specifics and ABC News has asked his office to clarify.",
      "Johnson said the House Republican Conference will have a \"serious discussion\" about aid and blamed leadership in California who he said, \"were derelict in their duty,\" echoing claims made by President-elect Donald Trump about the state's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, and Karen Bass, the Democratic mayor of Los Angeles.",
      "\"Obviously, there has been water resource management, forest management, mistakes, all sorts of problems, and it does come down to leadership, and it appears to us that state and local leaders were derelict in their duty, and in many respects. So, that's something that has to be factored in,\" he said.",
      "Johnson said, \"there's some discussion\" within GOP conference to tie the debt limit increase to aid to California but cautioned \"we will see how it goes.\"",
      "After natural disasters, additional funding to help rebuild is usually approved with few if any conditions and typically receives bipartisan support.",
      "Johnson's initial stance could mean a partisan fight in Congress over disaster relief for California in the coming days and weeks.",
      "Given the slim margin Republicans hold in the House, the speaker will likely need Democrats to ultimately back any final proposal.",

      "In October, the couple survived Hurricane Milton, which slammed the Florida coast. Now, they are among thousands of residents to lose their homes in the unprecedented firestorm continuing to burn across Los Angeles County.",
      "\"We've seen weather events get more and more extreme. That Category 5 was unprecedented,\" Cooper told ABC News of experiencing back-to-back natural disasters on both coasts. \"This firestorm was unprecedented.\"",
      "Shekarchian recalled driving home last Tuesday evening and seeing a \"lightning strike of fire\" in the hills near their home in Altadena. He said that when he got to his house, there was no electricity and he found Cooper sitting inside next to candles \"like the candles we had from when we survived Hurricane Milton.\"",
      "Fueled by hurricane-strength winds, the Eaton Fire ravaged the communities of Altadena and Pasadena, destroying at least 7,000 structures, including homes and businesses, officials said. On Monday, the fire was 33% contained after consuming more than 14,000 acres.",
      "The Eaton Fire is one of several blazes to break out during Tuesday and Wednesday's Santa Ana windstorm, which struck during a severe drought, authorities said. At one point, seven wildfires were burning all at once across a 45-square-mile area of Los Angeles County.",
      "The Palisades Fire in the oceanside community of Pacific Palisades remains the largest of the fires. The Palisades Fire has destroyed more than 5,000 homes and scorched nearly 24,000 acres. The inferno was 14% contained Monday as firefighters braced for a new Santa Ana wind event forecast to buffet the area through Wednesday.",
      "At least 24 fire-related deaths occurred in the Eaton and Palisades fires, the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner's Offices confirmed. Nearly two dozen people remain unaccounted for, according to the Los Angeles County sheriff. Many of those who died in the fires were elderly or disabled, officials said.",

      "Planning to rebuild",

      "\"I actually didn't realize I was going to lose my home until we saw the news of the fire spreading far beyond where mentally I was prepared for them even to go,\" Cooper told ABC News.",
      "Even after evacuating, Cooper said she believed they would find their home still intact only to learn she and Shekarchian suffered a complete loss.",

      "\"My husband had come home from work, and he ran in the house and just started screaming, 'There's a fire on the hill. We need to get out,'\" Cheryl Ku said. \"I ran out back, saw the fire at the poles and I immediately called 911.\"",
      "A Ring doorbell camera on their home captured the scary moments after the couple spotted the fire charging into their neighborhood. The Ring video recorded Jeffrey frantically hosing down the exterior of his home while constantly trying to keep an eye on flames advancing toward him.",
      "\"It was a nightmare,\" Jeffrey Ku said. \"And I think the worst part was every time I checked on the fire, it got worse.\"",
      "The couple said their home was left standing.",
      "Neighbors of the couple told ABC News they also saw the Eaton Fire apparently ignite near the transmission tower and rapidly explode.",
      "\"There was no other fire, no flames anywhere around,\" said neighbor Pedro Rojas, who recorded video of the flames near the transmission tower at 6:24 p.m. on Tuesday. \"Because it was so dark that if there were flames in any other places we would have noticed it.\"",
      "Fire officials trying to determine the cause of the Eaton Fire and the other blazes told ABC News they were aware of the videos showing flames near the transmission tower at the onset of the firestorm.",
      "The Southern California Edison company issued a statement to ABC News, saying that while the Eaton Fire started in its service area, a preliminary analysis shows \"no interruptions or electrical or operational anomalies until more than one hour after the reported start of the fire.\" The utility company also said no fire agency has suggested its equipment caused the Eaton Fire.",
      "But Pedro Pizarro, president and CEO of Edison International, the parent company of Southern California Edison, told ABC News on Monday that the company cannot yet rule out the possibility that its energy infrastructure played a role in sparking the wildfires.",

      "\"It was just marked by smoke from the flames. I thought that was a beautiful sign,\" Robyn Migel said.",
      "Ivan Migel said that when he saw the angel amid the rubble, he burst into tears.",
      "\"It also just gave me hope to move forward and to rebuild from this experience,\" Ivan Migel said.",

      "\"I've just had to let go of that sadness of what we didn't do in those moments because my family and my pets got out safely and that was the most important,\" Robyn Migel said.",
      "Learning his home and business were lost",
      "Mike Geller of Pacific Palisades told ABC News that he not only lost his home but also the jewelry store his family has owned in Palisades Village for almost three generations.",
      "Now at age 48, Geller said he has to start over.",

I'm not even sure how I'm talking to you. I'm absolutely in shock. I'm just going through the motions. It hasn't really set in yet.\u201d",
      "Geller said he has filed a personal insurance claim, but doesn't know when it will be processed. He said he and many of his neighbors, especially older residents who bought their homes decades ago for $50,000 to $75,000, will not have the means to rebuild.",
      "\"Those people will not be able to come back. And if they do and they have insurance, will they rebuild?\" Geller said. \"Look, if I'm 75, 80 years old, you know, how much time do I have?\u201d",
      "Geller said he and his wife are considering not rebuilding.",
      "\"It's about quality of life,\" he said. \"If it takes me three years to rebuild, how much time do I actually have left at that point?\"",
      "'Nobody stood a chance'",
      "They are used to saving lives and property, but on Monday veteran Los Angeles Fire Department members Capt. Jerry Puga, Capt. Al Hugo and firefighter George Baxter told ABC News that the Eaton Fire has left them all homeless.",
      "\"I never thought I'd be a victim. But now I am, along with my colleagues,\" Baxter said.",
      "Baxter said that when the Eaton Fire swept into his Altadena neighborhood, he tried to defend his home and his neighbor's residence with just a water hose.",
      "\"Nobody stood a chance. Nobody could prepare for it. It's just a natural disaster,\" said Baxter, who has been a member of the LAFD for 30 years.",
      "Hugo recalled that as a rookie firefighter, he had helped battle a large fire that struck Altadena in 1994, but he said he's never seen a fire as ferocious as the one that destroyed his home.",
      "\"As prepared as you can be, nobody expected the fire to do what it did,\" Hugo said. \"It caught everybody off guard. It really did.\"",
      "When the Eaton Fire started just after 6 p.m. on Tuesday, Puga said he didn't expect it to grow into a monster inferno.",
      "\"I went to sleep that night knowing that there was a fire, but never thinking that it was going to get to me,\" Puga said.",
      "When Puga awoke the next morning and started to drive into the city, he said he realized the erratic behavior of the fire was something he had never witnessed before and that the blaze was headed to his neighborhood. He said he turned around and headed back home, calling his family from his vehicle to warn them.",
      "\"As soon as I got home, we were able to get out. An hour later, we managed to go back and the house was fully engulfed,\" Puga said. \"We lost the house, the property, the materials -- but the family is safe, and that's the most important thing.\"",

      "Several lawsuits were filed against Southern California Edison.",
      "A flurry of separate lawsuits were filed Monday against Southern California Edison, a utility company in California, by homeowners and renters who lost their homes in the Eaton Fire. The four lawsuits each allege the company failed to de-energize all of its electrical equipment despite red flag warnings issued by the National Weather Service.",
      "\"The property damage and economic losses caused by the Eaton Fire is the result of the ongoing custom and practice of Defendant of consciously disregarding the safety of the public and not following statutes, regulations, standards, and rules regarding the safe operation, use and maintenance of their overhead electric facilities,\" said a complaint filed by Evangeline Iglesias, who said she worked a decadeslong career with FedEx in order to buy a single-family home that was destroyed in the fire.",
      "On Monday, the CEO of the parent company of SCE told ABC News' \"Good Morning America\" that investigations are underway to determine if any of their equipment contributed to either the Eaton or Hurst fires' ignitions.",
      "\"You can't rule out anything ever until you can get your eyes on the equipment,\" Pedro Pizarro, the president and CEO of Edison International, told ABC News' George Stephanopoulos. \"Typically, when there's a spark created by equipment, we will see the electrical anomaly -- we haven't seen that.\"",
      "\"That said, we have not been able to get close to the equipment,\" he continued. \"As soon as we can get close to it, we'll inspect and be transparent with the public.\"",
      "Officials have repeatedly said they are still investigating the cause of the Eaton and Hurst fires, as well as the other several wildfires that cropped up in January.",
      "The four lawsuits allege that the company failed to de-energize all of its electrical equipment on Jan. 7 despite \"repeated and clear warnings\" by the National Weather Service of wind gusts as high as 100 mph, and an extreme risk of fire, according to one of the lawsuits.",
      "\"Despite knowing of an extreme fire risk, Defendants deliberately prioritized profits over safety. This recklessness and conscious disregard for human safety was a substantial factor in bringing about the Eaton Fire,\" said a complaint filed by a group of renters, including Michael Kreiner, who was forced to evacuate.",
      "\"In my decades of experience handling wildfire litigation, the Eaton Fire is among the most devastating and heart-wrenching cases I've seen,\" said Patrick McNicholas, the attorney who represents Kreiner and other renters. \"This goes beyond a failure of responsibility -- it is gross negligence in an area highly vulnerable to wildfires, especially with well-documented weather alerts and high wind risks.\"",
      "One of the lawsuits filed on behalf of multiple families who lost their homes, alleges the Eaton Fire was caused when SCE's energized transmission and electrical equipment created an \"electrical arcing event which sent a shower of spars and molten metal down to the ground into a receptive fuel bed.\"",
      "The complaints also allege SCE failed to properly inspect and maintain their electric facilities.",
      "\"These Defendants failed to properly inspect and maintain their electric facilities in order to cut costs, with the full knowledge that any incident was likely to result in a wildfire that would burn and destroy real and personal property, displace homeowners from their homes and disrupt businesses in the fire area,\" said a complaint filed by Jeremy Gursey, who lost his home in Altadena.",
      "According to Gursey's complaint, SCE's electrical transmission system \"was in a dangerous condition, posing a significant risk of electrical failure, fire and property damage to surrounding property and communities.\"",
      "\"Had SCE acted responsibly, the Eaton Fire could have been prevented,\" the complaint says.",
      "In a statement, a spokesperson for SCE told ABC News, \"Our hearts remain with our communities during the devastating fires in Southern California, and we remain committed to supporting them through this difficult time. SCE crews, contractors and mutual assistance partners are dedicated to safely restoring power to our customers. SCE understands that a lawsuit related to the Eaton fire has been filed but has not yet been served with a complaint. SCE will review the complaint when it is received.

    "story": [
      "The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds reached its highest level in 14 months.",
      "Bond yields have surged worldwide, threatening to lift mortgage rates and credit card payments for hundreds of millions of people. The U.S. is no exception.",
      "The yield on a 10-year Treasury bond, or the amount paid to a bondholder annually, stands at about 4.8%, marking about half a percentage-point jump over the past month. That figure marks the highest yield for 10-year Treasury bonds in 14 months.",
      "Yields spiked in recent days after a stronger-than-expected jobs report last week gave the Federal Reserve reason to delay interest rate cuts forecast for later this year.",
      "The news came after a monthslong stretch of stubborn inflation had already dampened hopes of a rate cut early in 2025.",
      "The rise in bond yields may hammer borrowers, but larger annual payments from low-risk treasuries could offset some of that pain, analysts said. Higher yields, they added, could make it more difficult for the stock market to sustain gains from previous years, but the exact effect remains uncertain.",
      "\"The rising rates on bonds will certainly impact everybody,\" Adam Lampe, CEO of Mint Wealth Management, told ABC News.",
      "Here's what the increased bond yields mean for your finances, according to experts:",
      "'Benefits savers and punishes borrowers'",
      "The downside of rising bond yields is clear, experts said: borrowing costs go up.",
      "Long-term Treasury yields help set interest payments for mortgages, credit cards, car loans and just about any other type of borrowing, Dominic Pappalardo, chief multi-asset strategist at Morningstar Investment Management, told ABC News.",
      "This financial pain is exemplified by the housing market, where the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has climbed to 6.93%, Freddie Mac data shows. In September, that average rate hovered just above 6%.",
      "\"Anybody who has to borrow money will have to pay higher interest rates, therefore increasing their costs,\" Pappalardo said.",
      "The impact of bond yields on consumers isn't entirely negative, however.",
      "The trend means better returns for investors who place their money into financial instruments such as money market funds or high-interest savings accounts, which are safer investments than the stock market.",
      "The average yield for a money market fund -- a batch of investments in low-risk government and corporate debt -- stands at 4.27%, according to Vanguard. That rate well exceeds the current year-over-year inflation rate of 2.7%, meaning a money market fund offers an opportunity for returns even when accounting for inflation, experts said.",
      "\"For those who want to see their money go up faster than the inflation rate, you can do it now with almost no risk,\" Jim Bianco, a market analyst at Bianco Research, told ABC News.",
      "In other words, the rise in bond yields portends good days to come for those with money to save and bad ones for those in need of a loan.",
      "\"High interest rates benefit savers and punish borrowers,\" Pappalardo said.",
      "Risk for the stock market",
      "The rise in bond yields could also prove a warning sign for the stock market, experts said.",
      "Inflation has slowed dramatically from a peak of more than 9% in June 2022, but price increases remain above the target rate of 2%. The inflation rate has ticked up in recent months.",
      "Traders anticipate higher interest rates for a longer period, suggesting expectations of a more prolonged bout of inflation than previously thought just a few months ago.",
      "If that worry comes to pass, the central bank would need to keep borrowing costs high, which could place downward pressure on economic activity and weaken corporate profits.",
      "\"Equities don't look as attractive in a higher-interest-rate environment,\" said Lampe, of Mint Wealth.",
      "The stock market climbed to record highs in 2024, extending banner gains achieved the previous year. The S&P 500 -- the index to which many people's 401(k)s are pegged -- soared 25% last year.",
      "The market may be due for a cooldown in 2025, Bianco said. \"You'll get more moderate types of returns,\" he added.",
      "Still, stock performance may defy expectations, as it did in previous years when many analysts expected an economic downturn, some experts said.",
      "Inflation may come under control sooner than expected, or initiatives put forward by President-elect Donald Trump could accelerate economic growth, even in the face of high interest rates.",
      "The possibility of breakneck growth presents its own risk, however, since a booming economy would likely bring a burst of consumer demand and further price increases, Bianco said.",
      "The thorny outlook for the stock market may bolster investor appetite for bonds, he added.",
      "\"Bond funds will return you most of what the stock market will return you, but with less risk,\" Bianco said.",

      "On Monday, planes doused homes and hillsides with bright pink fire-retardant chemicals, while crews and fire engines were being placed near particularly vulnerable spots with dry brush. Dozens of water trucks rolled in to replenish supplies after hydrants ran dry last week when the two largest fires erupted.",
      "Tabitha Trosen and her boyfriend said she feels like they are \u201cteetering\u201d on the edge with the constant fear that their neighborhood could be the next under threat.",
      "\u201cOur cats are ready to go, we have their carriers by the door prepped with their little stuffed animals and things like that,\u201d Trosen said, adding that she's packed things as she thinks about what she could lose. \u201cIt\u2019s like, how do I take care of myself, and what are the things that will ground me as a human and remind me of my background and my life and my family.\u201d",
      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and other officials \u2014 who have faced criticism over their initial response to fires that began last week \u2014 expressed confidence Monday that the region was ready to face the new threat with additional firefighters brought in from around the U.S., as well as Canada and Mexico.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re absolutely better prepared,\u201d LA County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said when asked what will be different from a week ago, when hurricane-force winds propelled multiple fires across the parched, brush-filled region that hasn\u2019t seen rain in more than eight months.",
      "There have been more than a dozen wildfires in Southern California since Jan. 1, mostly in the greater Los Angeles area. The latest started late Monday in a dry riverbed in Oxnard, about 55 miles (about 89 kilometers) northwest of Los Angeles, and was burning in an agricultural area.",
      "The winds are predicted to pick up starting early Tuesday and continue through midday Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service. They are not expected to reach hurricane-force like last week, but they could ground firefighting aircraft, Marrone said, warning if winds reach 70 mph (112 kph), \u201cit\u2019s going to be very difficult to contain that fire.\"",
      "Fire officials advised residents in high-risk areas to just leave home \u2013 and not wait for formal evacuation orders -- if they sense danger.",
      "That\u2019s exactly what Tim Kang of La Crescenta did last Wednesday. Feeling sick from the smoky air and fearful of nearby fires spreading, Kang and his brothers packed up and have stayed away from their neighborhood.",
      "\u201cEverything just felt like, \u2018Oh man, the world\u2019s ending,\u2019\u201d said Kang, who's staying with his girlfriend in Pasadena.",

      "The National Weather Service warned the weather will be \u201cparticularly dangerous\u201d on Tuesday, when wind gusts could reach 65 mph (105 kph). A large part of Southern California around Los Angeles is under this extreme fire danger warning through Wednesday, including densely populated Thousand Oaks, Northridge and Simi Valley.",
      "The Eaton Fire near Pasadena is roughly one-third contained, while the largest blaze in Pacific Palisades on the coast is far less contained.",
      "The death toll is likely to rise, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said Monday. At least two dozen were missing, he said.",
      "Luna said he understands that people are eager to return to their homes and neighborhoods to survey the damage, but he asked for their patience. \"We have people literally looking for the remains of your neighbors,\u201d he said.",
      "At a Monday evening community meeting about the Palisades Fire, a Los Angeles Police Department official said many people reported as missing had been found. It wasn\u2019t clear if there was overlap in the numbers shared by the sheriff.",
      "The slower winds over the weekend allowed some people to return to previously evacuated areas. Many had no idea if their homes or neighborhoods were still standing.",
      "Jim Orlandini, who lost his hardware store in Altadena, a hard-hit neighborhood next to Pasadena, said his home of 40 years survived.",
      "\u201cThe whole time I was thinking, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to find when I get back here and after 40 years, you know, you got a lot of stuff you forget about that would disappear if the house burned down. So we\u2019re thankful that it didn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "LA city Fire Chief Kristin Crowley urged people to stay away from burned neighborhoods filled with broken gas lines and unstable buildings.",
      "Just under 100,000 in Los Angeles County remained under evacuation orders, half the number from last week.",
      "Firefighters over the weekend fought flames in Mandeville Canyon \u2014 home to Arnold Schwarzenegger and other celebrities \u2014 after the Palisades Fire spread, prompting new evacuation orders. Crews continued battling there Monday before potentially strong winds could push the flames toward the famous J. Paul Getty Museum and the University of California, Los Angeles.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9, Disney and other celebrities and entertainment organizations have pledged millions to help those who have been displaced or lost their homes. Other stars \u2014 and ordinary people \u2014 have left large donations of clothing and other items along street corners in around the city.",
      "Dozens of people have been arrested for looting after the wildfires. Officials are now starting to see price gouging and scams, including with hotels and short-term rentals and medical supplies, said Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman.",
      "The fires that began Tuesday north of downtown LA have burned more than 12,000 homes, cars and other structures.",
      "Authorities haven\u2019t determined an official cause for any of the fires. Southern California Edison has acknowledged agencies are investigating whether its equipment may have started a smaller blaze.",
      "A lawsuit filed Monday claims the utility's equipment sparked the much bigger Eaton Fire. Edison did not respond to a request for comment and last week said it had not received any suggestions that its equipment ignited that blaze.",
      "AccuWeather\u2019s early estimates suggest the fires could be the nation\u2019s costliest ever, topping $250 billion including what\u2019s to come in the next days. The reconstruction cost for commercial and residential properties inside areas with active fires could be $14.8 billion, according to real estate data tracker CoreLogic.",

    "summary": "The state with the highest per capita number of people on probation is trying to lower that number",
    "story": [
      "The state with the highest per capita number of people on probation is trying to lower that number",
      "ATLANTA -- For three years, Jamariel Hobbs was confined to Georgia, unable to travel freely or move where he wanted to. At the beginning, a probation officer showed up at random times of night to test him for drugs.",
      "The soft-spoken Hobbs, now 29, was among almost 176,000 Georgia residents on probation, the largest per capita population in the United States. Then he got lucky. Because of a new law, the court slashed what was supposed to be nine years of probation to three.",
      "He was free.",
      "\u201cProbation feels like a leash,\u201d he said. \u201cI have my future back.\u201d",
      "People are often put on probation for low-level crimes such as drug possession or nonviolent theft. Georgia refuses to cap sentences the way many other jurisdictions do.",
      "The practice of long sentences persisted for years despite research suggesting that the likelihood of people reoffending drops after three years on probation. In short, longer probation may do little to improve public safety.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re talking about folks who have often been through a lot of trauma and feel like they are constantly walking around with a weight on their shoulders, a cloud over their head, where the smallest little thing could completely derail all the work they\u2019ve put in,\u201d said Wade Askew of the Georgia Justice Project.",
      "People on probation also have to pay fees to help offset the cost of monitoring them, a particular burden for low-income people.",
      "Under state law, a lot more people like Hobbs could have been free. In 2017, Georgia lawmakers passed a bipartisan bill designed to reduce the number of people on probation by letting some off early. According to a study by the Urban Institute, the measure could have translated into roughly one-third of the men and women on felony probation being offered sentences with the opportunity for time off their probation after three years at most, providing they stayed out of trouble.",
      "Instead, just 213 sentences that included the possibility of an early end to probation actually finished ahead of schedule, according to Georgia\u2019s Department of Community Supervision.",
      "The Legislature\u2019s directive fell short for multiple reasons. Judges often failed to include possible early termination dates for probation when they should have and they turned down the Department of Community Supervision\u2019s requests to end probation early.",
      "In 2021, the Legislature passed a second law outlining stricter guidelines to make the process more automatic.",
      "To qualify for their freedom, people who are convicted of a felony for the first time have to pay off any restitution they owe and avoid being arrested for anything more serious than a routine traffic violation. They also have to have avoided their probation being revoked anytime within the previous two years. Judges or prosecutors can request a hearing if they oppose a case.",
      "And people who have been on probation for at least three years can seek an early end if they meet the criteria, even if they were originally sentenced to a longer period.",
      "Observers \u2013 including judges and lawyers \u2013 say the new law seems to be more effective than the original.",
      "By last January, Georgia\u2019s probationary population had fallen about 8% from 190,475 in 2021, according to the Department of Community Supervision, echoing nationwide trends.",
      "The department said it could not readily provide the number of people released from probation under the criteria set out in 2021. What is known, is that at least 26,523 sentences have ended early since the bill passed, though many of those terminations could have been granted for other reasons.",
      "\u201cIt has been a very successful, very big first step,\u201d Askew said.",
      "Some defense lawyers and advocates across the state say they still see eligible people on probation struggle to get probation officers to act. Others say they encounter judges and prosecutors less friendly to the changes.",
      "\u201cIf you want to get something done, you\u2019ve really got to hound them,\u201d said Devin Rafus, an Atlanta defense lawyer.",
      "Jamariel Hobbs had a friendly judge.",
      "The Emory University graduate\u2019s life seemed to be on track after he earned his degree in Japanese in 2019. He landed a sales job peddling auto parts across the South. Then, the pandemic took a toll on Hobbs\u2019 mental health. After intervening in a family argument in 2020, he was charged with aggravated assault, according to Hobbs and the indictment against him.",
      "He spent months couch surfing after his friends bailed him out of jail. He lost his job and his company car. In December 2021, he was sentenced to a year of incarceration and nine on probation, but was able to avoid jail time by enrolling in Georgia\u2019s Accountability Court Program for people with mental health and substance abuse problems. It was there that he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and prescribed medication for it.",
      "He now works for a biopharmaceutical company and recently began serving as a peer outreach coordinator for people recovering from substance abuse or mental health issues.",
      "Hobbs said his probation officers didn\u2019t make it clear to him that his sentence included the possibility of early release from probation. So it felt surreal when he got a letter from Judge Layla Zon in December and was off probation days later.",
      "Now he hopes to move to North Carolina, where the cost of living is more affordable and he dreams of starting an organization to help people with health and wellness.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sitting here probation-free,\u201d Hobbs said, pausing to smile. \u201cIt\u2019s a blessing.\u201d",
      "Judge Zon agreed.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really one of the better things that I get to do as a judge, to reward that person for what they\u2019ve accomplished and for doing what we\u2019ve asked them to do,\u201d she said.",

    "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2025 01:14:17 -0500",
    "summary": "When 2020 census results were released more than three years ago, they showed a 276% boom in the number of people classified as multiracial in the United States since 2010",
    "story": [
      "When 2020 census results were released more than three years ago, they showed a 276% boom in the number of people classified as multiracial in the United States since 2010",
      "When the 2020 census results were released, they showed a boom in the number of people classified as multiracial in the United States since 2010. Two Princeton sociologists now say that jump was mostly an illusion.",
      "The 276% increase largely happened because of a change in how people were classified by the U.S. Census Bureau rather than strong shifts in racial or ethnic identity or major growth, according to a paper published last month by Paul Starr and Christina Pao. The Census Bureau for the first time provided space on the census form for people to write-in their families' origins, which guided how the statistical agency categorized them.",
      "People who were classified as being two or more races rose from 2.9% to 10.2% of the U.S. population from 2010 to 2020, and the increase was most noticeable among Hispanic people. The share of the white alone population dropped from 72.4% to 61.6%, provoking handwringing among some conservative commentators about what they called a loss of white power.",
      "The Princeton researchers argued that anyone who marked themselves as Black or as white on the 2020 census form but then wrote that they were of Latin American origin was reclassified by a computerized algorithm as multiracial even though they had marked themselves as a single race. The same multiracial reclassification appeared to have been made for people who self-identified as white only but then wrote that their origins were from an African country, according to the researchers.",
      "\u201cSo the 2020 census produced a sudden jump in the multiracial count and a precipitous decline in the count of the white population, contributing to an unwarranted panic among white conservatives about demographic change,\u201d Starr said in an email. \u201cThe procedure was misleading, and the public was misled about the extent of racial change.\u201d",
      "When the figures were released in mid-2021, Census Bureau officials said the new method was an improvement that did a better job of capturing the complexities of how people identify their race and ethnicity in the 21st century. At the same time, they acknowledged that some of the dramatic growth likely came from their changes.",
      "For the first time, empty spaces were left on the 2020 census form so that respondents could write in their \u201corigins,\u201d such as \u201cGerman\u201d or \u201cJamaican,\u201d when answering the race question. The detailed answers guided the Census Bureau in classifying the respondents and members of their households into race and ethnicity categories.",
      "\u201cThese improvements reveal that the U.S. population is much more multiracial and diverse than what we measured in the past,\u201d Census Bureau officials said at the time.",
      "The official numbers on multiracial people are important because they are used for redrawing political districts, civil rights enforcement, labor data, health statistics and distributing federal funding. As the daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother, Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 run for the White House as the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee put multiracial identity in the spotlight.",
      "The Princeton researchers said the Census Bureau mistakenly mixed up ancestry with identity and national origin with race, and they believe the agency should abandon using \u201corigins\u201d to categorize people.",
      "The issue flew under the radar because of other distractions surrounding the 2020 census, such as the Trump administration's unsuccessful attempt to add a citizenship question, a controversial new data-privacy method and the COVID-19 pandemic, which threw the nation's head count off schedule. Black, Hispanic and American Indian residents on reservations were undercounted in the 2020 census.",
      "Researchers have been asking the Census Bureau since 2021 to rerun the 2020 data using 2010 methods so that an \u201capples to apples\u201d comparison of demographic changes can be made, but the agency hasn't done it yet, said historian Margo Anderson, who served on a National Academies panel that reviewed the quality of the census.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s 2025 and people have been asking since 2021, \u2018What the hell did you do?\u2019\u201d Anderson said. \u201cThere is a lot of frustration there because we can't know.\u201d",
      "The Census Bureau has historically struggled to classify multiracial people, said Susan Graham, an advocate for multiracial representation in official statistics. Respondents weren\u2019t allowed to check more than one race until the 2000 census",
      "\u201cWas the 2020 Census subjected to a fictitious multiracial boom? Possibly,\u201d Graham said. \u201cAs always, answers only get more confusing when the federal government goes back and tries, one more time, to get it right.\u201d",
      "Race and ethnic categories used by the federal government are changing further to combine questions about race and ethnicity instead of asking about them separately. A Middle Eastern and North African category also is being added which will reduce the number of respondents identifying as white.",
      "Not all demographers think the Census Bureau's methodological change was that profound.",
      "\u201cI don't think it's that big of a deal for most people using the data,\u201d said William Frey, a demographer at The Brookings Institution. \u201cI think that the Census Bureau is trying hard to get this right.\"",

    "summary": "Hawaii Gov. Josh Green is proposing a range of new penalties to crack down on people who flout the state&rsquo;s fireworks laws",
    "story": [
      "Hawaii Gov. Josh Green is proposing a range of new penalties to crack down on people who flout the state\u2019s fireworks laws",
      "HONOLULU -- Hawaii Gov. Josh Green on Monday proposed a range of new penalties to crack down on those who flout the state's fireworks laws, nearly two weeks after a fireworks explosion at a Honolulu home on New Year's Eve killed four people and injured about 20 others.",
      "The potential new measures include $300 tickets police could issue to those who shoot off fireworks and class A felony charges and decades in prison for those whose use of fireworks leads to serious injury or death. The governor plans to include the proposals in a bill he will send lawmakers for the new legislative session beginning Wednesday.",
      "\u201cWe want to deter people from doing this. Three hundred dollars will probably send a chilling effect over a lot of young people, I would expect,\u201d Green said at a news conference. \u201cBut getting a major felony on one\u2019s record and doing time in jail, I hope will give everyone pause.\u201d",
      "State and county officials have struggled for years to contain illegal fireworks in Hawaii, where it's become common for people to launch professional-grad aerial explosives from the streets in front of their homes all year round. Law enforcement officers have seized 227,000 pounds (103,000 kilograms) of fireworks since 2023, much of it from container ships at ports, but also from packages shipped by air. The director of the state Department of Law Enforcement said last week that authorities intercept U.S. Postal Service parcels containing illegal fireworks almost daily.",
      "New Year's is a particularly active time for contraband fireworks displays. They usually result in injuries and in some years people have died, but the start to this year was deadlier than ever.",
      "Green said his proposals were aimed at streamlining and clarifying Hawaii\u2019s fireworks laws so prosecutors can secure convictions more quickly and successfully.",
      "Under the proposal, police issuing $300 citations wouldn\u2019t need to collect evidence. They would just need a witness - a police officer or someone else - to identify the person who set off fireworks, said Tricia Nakamatsu, deputy attorney general. This would be particularly helpful for law enforcement because evidence in fireworks cases often go up in smoke.",
      "The person receiving a ticket would either pay the fine or go to court to contest it, much like a traffic ticket.",
      "This infraction wouldn\u2019t be a crime and so would decriminalize fireworks use at a low level. Crucially, courts would only need a preponderance of evidence to impose a fine. That's in contrast to a criminal charge which prosecutors must prove beyond a reasonable doubt to secure a conviction.",
      "\u201cThe citations themselves can also be issued much, much faster. It does not require an officer to go back to the office to write reports, to collect evidence, to submit for testing,\u201d Nakamatsu said. This would help officers get back on the road more quickly, she added.",
      "The governor's team came up with $300 amount because that's currently the fine imposed on those who use cell phones while driving. The principle in both cases is similar, she said, in that both actions could kill one or more people.",
      "For the more serious penalties, the governor proposes to slap heavier punishments on repeat offenders and those who cause serious injury or death with their fireworks. This would apply to those who import illegal fireworks, those who buy and sell them and to the end user who lights them.",
      "It\u2019s currently a Class C felony to possess more than 25 pounds of fireworks, which is punishable by up to five years in prison in Hawaii.",
      "The enhanced charges could lead to Class A felony convictions, which under Hawaii law are punishable by up to 20 years to life in prison.",
      "\u201cPeople, if they take the life of an innocent soul near them, have to be accountable and they\u2019re going to have to spend significant time in prison,\u201d Green said.",
      "The governor said he understands people enjoy the spectacle of fireworks but he said they must be enjoyed in a safe way. He said he would support having more public fireworks displays throughout the year so people can still watch fireworks.",
      "The Department of Law Enforcement last week asked lawmakers for $5.2 million to hire eight people and expand a forensic lab to crack down on fireworks smuggling."

      "Known as \u201ccongestion pricing,\u201d the first-in-the-nation program launched on Jan. 5, collecting $9 from most passenger cars entering the city below Central Park during peak hours and higher fees on trucks and other vehicles. In the days since, total traffic in the tolling zone has dropped by 7.5% \u2014 or roughly 43,000 cars per day \u2014 compared to the equivalent period last year, Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials said.",

      "The effect in New York has been most pronounced during the morning rush hour period, with travel times over certain crossings \u2014 including the typically traffic-choked Holland and Lincoln tunnels that run under the Hudson River from New Jersey \u2014 falling by 40% or more, Michaelson said.",
      "Despite anecdotal reports of more crowded train cars, she said the agency had not clocked a noticeable increase in subway users, largely because the baseline number of riders \u2014 over 3 million daily \u2014 is so high. However, a handful of bus routes originating in Brooklyn and Staten Island had seen an increase in ridership the previous week.",
      "Within the congestion zone, the immediate impact has been more mixed. While certain thoroughfares have seen traffic reductions, others routes have stayed largely the same. A Midtown crosstown bus widely derided as New York\u2019s slowest saw its runtime shaved by only a minute, according to MTA data. And there has been little noticeable change during the overnight hours, when the toll for passenger cars goes down to $2.25, officials said.",
      "Bob Pishue, an analyst with INRIX, a traffic-data analytics company, said the MTA\u2019s initial data matched the findings of the firm, which has been comparing drivers\u2019 GPS data before and after the program launched.",
      "\u201cFewer people are coming into Manhattan, but we\u2019re not seeing a significant impact on speeds within the zone yet,\u201d he said. \u201cSome trips are faster, some are slower.\u201d",
      "He cautioned against drawing broad conclusions after barely a week, noting that many drivers were likely taking a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach.",
      "Congestion pricing has sharply divided residents of New York and neighboring areas, touching off protests from many drivers, along with threats of sabotage and viral videos on how to evade the fee.",
      "Proponents of congestion pricing, meanwhile, have hailed its launch as a transformative moment for a city contending with worsening traffic and aging public transportation infrastructure desperately in need of upgrades.",
      "Initially slated to begin in June, the program was halted at the last moment by New York Gov. Kathy Hochul. A one-time supporter of the program, the Democrat said her position changed following conversations with \u201cordinary\u201d New Yorkers, including a Manhattan diner owner concerned the toll would disincentivize customers driving in from New Jersey.",
      "Hochul later revived the program but at the lower price of $9 for most drivers, down from the $15 fee initially approved by the state.",
      "Tarek Soliman, the owner of Comfort Diner in midtown Manhattan, said he had spoken directly with the governor about his fears of losing New Jersey customers. While he said it was too early to tell if the program had hurt business, the new fee was already having at least one impact on him.",
      "\u201cEvery weekend, I used to drive to the garage next to the diner,\u201d Soliman, a resident of Astoria, Queens, said by phone Monday. \u201cNow I don\u2019t drive. I take the subway.\u201d"

      "A lawsuit filed against Southern California Edison claims the utility\u2019s equipment sparked the deadly Eaton Fire burning just outside Los Angeles",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014",
      "Lawsuits filed Monday claim utility equipment sparked one of the two deadly wildfires burning in the Los Angeles area while some Pacific Palisades residents believe the other blaze may have started when hurricane-force winds reignited the remnants of an extinguished New Year's Day fire.",
      "Authorities haven\u2019t determined an official cause for the fires, which roared to life last Tuesday and have killed at least 24 people. A team from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives took the lead on the investigations.",
      "Multiple lawsuits against Southern California Edison claim the utility\u2019s equipment sparked the deadly Eaton Fire burning near Pasadena. Edison has acknowledged fire agencies are investigating whether its equipment may have started a far smaller LA-area fire that broke out the same day.",
      "The Eaton Fire destroyed at least 7,000 homes and other structures and laid waste to entire neighborhoods. Attorneys representing homeowners who lost their homes said Monday that it is their belief that Edison\u2019s equipment caused it. Video taken during the fire\u2019s early minutes shows a large blaze directly beneath electrical towers.",
      "\u201cThere is clear evidence from video footage, photographs, and witness accounts that the fire was caused by electrical equipment operated by Defendants Edison International and Southern California Edison,\u201d according to one complaint, filed on behalf of Altadena resident Evangeline Iglesias.",
      "Gabriela Ornelas, an Edison spokesperson, said the utility is aware that a lawsuit has been filed, but has not yet reviewed it. \u201cOur hearts remain with our communities during the devastating fires in Southern California, and we remain committed to supporting them through this difficult time,\u201d she said.",
      "Last week, Edison filed a report with the California Public Utilities Commission related to the Eaton Fire that said it has not received any suggestions that its equipment was involved in the ignition of that fire. \u201cPreliminary analysis by SCE of electrical circuit information for the energized transmission lines going through the area for 12 hours prior to the reported start time of the fire shows no interruptions or electrical or operational anomalies until more than one hour after the reported start time of the fire,\u201d the utility reported.",
      "Edison also submitted a filing with the utilities commission about the Hurst fire in the Sylmar neighborhood of Los Angeles that started last Tuesday. The utility said \u201ca downed conductor was discovered at a tower\u201d near where the fire started.",
      "But the utility added it \u201cdoes not know whether the damage observed occurred before or after the start of the fire.\u201d That fire burned more than a square mile (2.6 square kilometers) and is now contained.",
      "Meanwhile, a New Year's Day fire that broke out at the same place as the Jan. 7 fire that ripped through Pacific Palisades to become the most destructive in Los Angeles city history, is a particular source of interest for residents who saw both blazes.",
      "Asked about speculation that remnants of the Jan. 1 fire reignited in Pacific Palisades, LAPD Assistant Chief Dominic Choi said Monday that no causes have been ruled out.",
      "The Los Angeles Fire Department reported a brush fire shortly after midnight on Jan. 1 in the area of Pacific Palisades. The initial report was 3 to 4 acres (1.2 to 1.6 hectares) of heavy brush burning under 15 mph (24 kph) winds. Water dropping helicopters and firefighters on the ground battled the blaze, which grew to 8 acres (3 hectares), and it was reported as contained less than five hours later, according to reports posted on the department\u2019s website.",
      "Residents say the wind-whipped blaze that ripped through that community started in the same location as a fire sparked by fireworks shot off just after midnight on New Year's Day. The hurricane-force winds that day could have helped ignite any embers that remained. Officials have not directly attributed the Jan. 1 fire to fireworks.",
      "\u201cI still think it\u2019s too coincidental that it would be in almost exactly the same spot. The fireworks went off that night. The firefighters were there,\u201d said Sue Pascoe, a resident who lost her home and who runs the neighborhood news website Circling the News, which has been writing about the connection to the New Year's Day fire since the Jan. 7 start.",
      "The official investigations could take months, and with strong winds again in the forecast, the area is at risk for more fires that could further complicate efforts to determine cause.",
      "Ginger Colbrun, a spokesperson for the ATF, said it is too early to determine the cause of the Palisades fire. Colbrun said investigators did an initial assessment of the area Friday and began processing the scene Monday.",
      "Pacific Palisades resident Robert Trinkkeller said he saw the fire early on New Year\u2019s Day, and watched aircraft drop water on it.",
      "When he saw the fire break out on Jan. 7, Trinkkeller said he immediately thought it was linked.",
      "\u201cIn my opinion, it was a rekindling of the six-day old fire,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the exact same place.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. has ended its latest legal battle against the company that owns the salvage rights to the Titanic shipwreck",
      "NORFOLK, Va. -- The U.S. government has scrapped its litigation against the company that owns the salvage rights to the Titanic, noting that the firm no longer has expedition plans to the shipwreck that could break federal law.",
      "The scuttling of the government's latest legal battle isn't necessarily the end of RMS Titanic Inc.'s attempts to enter the rapidly deteriorating ocean liner or to fetch more historic objects. The company said last month that it's still considering the implications of future expeditions.",
      "But the U.S. on Friday withdrew its motion to intervene in a federal admiralty court in Virginia, which oversees salvage matters for the world's most famous shipwreck. The withdrawal concluded the second of two legal battles in five years that the U.S. has waged against RMS Titanic Inc, the company that has retrieved and exhibited the ship's artifacts.",
      "The U.S. filed its latest legal challenge in 2023 when RMST was planning to take images inside the ship's hull and pluck items from the surrounding debris field. RMST also said it would possibly recover freestanding objects from the room where the ocean liner broadcast its distress calls.",
      "The U.S. argued that entering the hull \u2014 or disturbing the wreck \u2014 would violate a 2017 federal law and a corresponding agreement with Great Britain. Both regard the site as a hallowed memorial to the more than 1,500 people who died when the ship struck an iceberg in 1912.",
      "RMST ultimately scaled back its dive plans, stating that it would only take external images. The change followed the 2023 implosion of the Titan submersible, which killed RMST\u2019s director of underwater research Paul-Henri Nargeolet and four others onboard.",
      "The experimental Titan craft was operated by a separate company, OceanGate, to which Nargeolet was lending his expertise. He was supposed to lead the RMST expedition.",
      "After RMST revised its dive plans, the U.S. stopped trying to block that particular expedition, which produced detailed images of the wreck in September. But the government told the federal court in Norfolk last year that it wanted to leave the door open to challenging subsequent expeditions.",
      "RMST, however, told the court in December that it won\u2019t visit the wreck in 2025 and hasn't settled on any plans for future expeditions. The company said it will continue to \u201cdiligently consider the strategic, legal, and financial implications of conducting future salvage operations at the site.\u201d",
      "In response, the U.S. withdrew its motion to intervene.",
      "\u201cShould future circumstances warrant, the United States will file a new motion to intervene based on the facts then existing,\u201d the government wrote in a filing on Friday.",
      "RMST has been the court-recognized steward of Titanic artifacts since it won salvage rights to the ship in 1994. The firm has recovered and conserved thousands of items, from silverware to a piece of the ship\u2019s hull, which millions of people have seen through exhibits.",
      "The company's last expedition to recover artifacts was in 2010, before the federal law and international agreement took effect.",
      "The first federal enforcement was in 2020, when RMST wanted to retrieve and exhibit the radio that broadcast the Titanic\u2019s distress calls.",
      "U.S. District Judge Rebecca Beach Smith, who presides over Titanic salvage matters, gave RMST permission. But the U.S. government swiftly challenged the plan. The legal battle never played out because RMST indefinitely delayed the expedition in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "Smith noted during a court hearing in March that time may be running out for expeditions inside the Titanic. The ship is rapidly deteriorating on the North Atlantic seabed."

      "His wide-ranging opinions could provide some insight into how he could approach the top Pentagon job if confirmed. At times, he says he's been misconstrued, but other times he's tried to soften his previously stated views on contentious topics.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re absolutely better prepared,\u201d LA County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said when asked what will be different from a week ago, when hurricane-force winds propelled multiple fires across the parched, brush-filled region that hasn\u2019t seen rain in more than eight months.",
      "The winds are predicted to pick up late Monday into early Tuesday, but they are not expected to reach hurricane-force like last week. However, they could ground firefighting aircraft, Marrone said, warning if winds reach 70 mph (112 kph), \u201cit\u2019s going to be very difficult to contain that fire.\"",

      "The National Weather Service warned the weather will be \u201cparticularly dangerous\u201d on Tuesday, when wind gusts could reach 65 mph (105 kph). A large part of Southern California around Los Angeles is under this extreme fire danger warning through Wednesday, including densely populated Thousand Oaks, Northridge and Simi Valley.",
      "The Eaton Fire near Pasadena is roughly one-third contained, while the largest blaze in Pacific Palisades on the coast is far less contained.",
      "The death toll is likely to rise, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said Monday. At least two dozen were missing, he said.",
      "Luna said he understands that people are eager to return to their homes and neighborhoods to survey the damage, but he asked for their patience. \"We have people literally looking for the remains of your neighbors,\u201d he said.",
      "At a Monday evening community meeting about the Palisades Fire, a Los Angeles Police Department official said many people reported as missing had been found. It wasn\u2019t clear if there was overlap in the numbers shared by the sheriff.",
      "The slower winds over the weekend allowed some people to return to previously evacuated areas. Many had no idea if their homes or neighborhoods were still standing.",
      "Jim Orlandini, who lost his hardware store in Altadena, a hard-hit neighborhood next to Pasadena, said his home of 40 years survived.",
      "\u201cThe whole time I was thinking, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to find when I get back here and after 40 years, you know, you got a lot of stuff you forget about that would disappear if the house burned down. So we\u2019re thankful that it didn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "LA city Fire Chief Kristin Crowley urged people to stay away from burned neighborhoods filled with broken gas lines and unstable buildings.",
      "Just under 100,000 in Los Angeles County remained under evacuation orders, half the number from last week.",
      "Firefighters over the weekend fought flames in Mandeville Canyon \u2014 home to Arnold Schwarzenegger and other celebrities \u2014 after the Palisades Fire spread, prompting new evacuation orders. Crews continued battling there Monday before potentially strong winds could push the flames toward the famous J. Paul Getty Museum and the University of California, Los Angeles.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9, Disney and other celebrities and entertainment organizations have pledged millions to help those who have been displaced or lost their homes. Other stars \u2014 and ordinary people \u2014 have left large donations of clothing and other items along street corners in around the city.",
      "Dozens of people have been arrested for looting after the wildfires. Officials are now starting to see price gouging and scams, including with hotels and short-term rentals and medical supplies, said Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman.",
      "The fires that began Tuesday north of downtown LA have burned more than 12,000 homes, cars and other structures.",
      "Authorities haven\u2019t determined an official cause for any of the fires. Southern California Edison has acknowledged agencies are investigating whether its equipment may have started a smaller blaze.",
      "A lawsuit filed Monday claims the utility's equipment sparked the much bigger Eaton Fire. Edison did not respond to a request for comment and last week said it had not received any suggestions that its equipment ignited that blaze.",
      "AccuWeather\u2019s early estimates suggest the fires could be the nation\u2019s costliest ever, topping $250 billion including what\u2019s to come in the next days.

      "But the first-term governor sees room for bipartisan compromise as she looks to advance policies that have long been stymied under the GOP-controlled Legislature.",
      "While President-elect Donald Trump swept the battleground state, Hobbs noted in a recent interview with The Associated Press that Arizona voters also elected Democrat Ruben Gallego to the U.S. Senate, sending the message that they want their political leaders to work across the aisle to solve the thorniest of issues.",
      "\u201cThe issues we\u2019re facing \u2014 affordability for families, water security, protecting our border and keeping communities safe \u2014 those are not Republican or Democratic issues,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re just Arizona issues that our elected leaders, myself included, need to work together to solve.\u201d",
      "Hobbs, who will be up for reelection next year, is expected to outline her priorities when she addresses lawmakers at the start of the session Monday.",
      "Here's a look at key policy areas:",
      "It was just two weeks after the November election when Hobbs visited the Arizona-Mexico border and vowed to work with Trump\u2019s administration on issues like stopping fentanyl trafficking. But she also acknowledged some families are worried about the president-elect's deportation threats.",
      "While not wanting to speculate, Hobbs says Arizona will focus its limited law enforcement resources on keeping violent criminals off the streets, regardless of their immigration status.",
      "Arizona voters last year approved a measure empowering local police to arrest people suspected of illegally crossing the border, so it\u2019s unclear what new restrictions on immigration Republicans might push beyond ensuring adequate funding for law enforcement.",
      "Hobbs will look to pressure lawmakers again to plug regulatory holes to protect groundwater sources. Her calls last year to update the state's water laws failed to win legislative approval, leaving her administration to take executive action in December to curb unchecked pumping in one rural area.",
      "This time around, Hobbs is optimistic she can reach a deal with lawmakers on revamping groundwater regulations. In the absence of a pact, Hobbs says she won\u2019t hesitate to act unilaterally.",
      "The stakes are high as Arizona has grappled with long-term drought and needs to come up with a plan by the end of 2026 to manage its dwindling share of water from the over-tapped Colorado River.",
      "Reining in Arizona's school voucher program remains on Hobbs' wish list.",
      "The program, which started in 2011 for disabled children and expanded to all students in 2022, lets parents subsidize private-school tuition and other educational costs with public money.",
      "Hobbs and fellow Democrats have criticized the program, saying it contributes to a drain on the state's coffers. Republican lawmakers have championed the program as a cornerstone of the school choice movement. The budget approved by lawmakers last year after weeks of negotiations with Hobbs' office included only a small cut in spending for the program.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden spoke Sunday with relatives of three Americans the U.S. government is looking to bring home from Afghanistan, but it was unclear from the call if a deal to bring them back that is now on the table could be completed before the he leaves office next week.",
      "Biden's call with family members of Ryan Corbett, George Glezmann and Mahmoud Habibi took place in the waning days of his administration as officials try to negotiate a deal that could bring them home in exchange for Muhammad Rahim, one of the remaining detainees at Guantanamo Bay.",
      "Corbett, who had lived in Afghanistan with his family at the time of the 2021 collapse of the U.S.-backed government, was abducted by the Taliban in August 2022 while on a business trip and Glezmann, an airline mechanic from Atlanta, was taken by the Taliban's intelligence services in December 2022 while traveling through the country.",
      "Officials believe the Taliban is still holding both men as well as Habibi, an Afghan American businessman who worked as a contractor for a Kabul-based telecommunications company and also went missing in 2022. The FBI has said that Habibi and his driver were taken along with 29 other employees of the company, but that all except for Habibi and other person have since been freed.",
      "The Taliban has denied that it has Habibi, complicating the talks with the U.S. government.",
      "On the call Sunday, Biden told the families that his administration would not trade Rahim, who has been held at Guantanamo since 2008, unless the Taliban releases Habibi, according to a statement from Habibi's brother, Ahmad Habibi.",
      "\u201cPresident Biden was very clear in telling us that he would not trade Rahim if the Taliban do not let my brother go,\u201d the statement said. \u201cHe said he would not leave him behind. My family is very grateful that he is standing up for my brother.\u201d",
      "Ryan Fayhee, a lawyer acting on behalf of Corbett's relatives, said the family was grateful to Biden for the call but also implored him to act on the deal.",
      "\u201cA deal is now on the table and the decision to accept it \u2014 as imperfect as it may be \u2014 resides exclusively with the President,\u201d Fayhee said in a statement. \u201cHard decisions make great Presidents, and we hope and believe that President Biden will not let perfection be the enemy of the good when American lives are at stake.\u201d",
      "If a deal is not done before Jan. 20, it would fall to the incoming Trump administration to pick up negotiations, though it's unclear if officials would take a different approach when it comes to releasing a Guantanamo detainee the U.S. government has deemed a danger.",
      "Just 15 men remain at Guantanamo, down from a peak of nearly 800 under former President George W. Bush.",
      "Rahim is one of just three remaining detainees never charged but also never deemed safe for the U.S. to even consider transferring to other countries, as it has done with hundreds of other Muslim detainees brought to Guantanamo but never charged.",
      "The U.S. has described Rahim as a direct adviser, courier and operative for Osama bin Laden and other senior al-Qaida figures and a continuing threat to U.S. national security, despite never charging him or otherwise formally making public any evidence against Rahim in his 17 years at Guantanamo.",
      "Successive U.S. administrations have kept Rahim under wraps to a degree remarkable even for the military-run detention at Guantanamo.",
      "His attorney, James Connell, told a U.N. human rights commission recently that Rahim was being \u201csystematically silenced\u201d by the U.S. Connell claimed to the same panel that a U.S. official had told him \u201cevery word Rahim utters on any topic is classified on the basis of national security.\u201d",

Since the fires first began Tuesday, they have burned more than 12,000 structures, a term that includes homes, apartment buildings, businesses, outbuildings and some vehicles, and killed at least 24 people. The White House said Saturday that the Department of Defense is making its nearby bases available for emergency shelter, including more than 1,000 available beds.",

      "New trees are vulnerable, and volunteers often have to go out and water them for the first few years.",
      "\u201cEvents like this can greatly increase our mortality rates,\u201d Vejar said.",
      "Past fires and extreme winds have torn off many limbs and taken down trees, especially ones planted in narrow strips of land where there isn't room for much soil, Vejar said.",
      "When it\u2019s safe to conduct field assessments, urban tree experts will go out to inspect, re-stake and retie trees toppled by winds, and remove and replace those that were lost.",
      "Replanting trees in burned neighborhoods is harder now because of climate change, said Will Berleson, a professor at USC\u2019s Department of Earth Sciences and researcher with the university\u2019s Urban Trees Initiative. Even though many of the city\u2019s mature trees might only be 30 or 40 years old, they \u201cstarted growing at times when it was not as hot and didn\u2019t have these kinds of wet and dry fluctuations that we seem to be seeing now,\u201d he said.",
      "Some experts see tree losses as an opportunity to continue teaching Los Angeles residents about the place they live and what plants are the best fit, not necessarily the iconic ones of Hollywood movies. They would like to replace nonnative species like palms \u2014 which are more closely related to grasses \u2014 with trees that provide shade and can withstand extreme heat and drought.",
      "Aaron Thomas, director of urban forestry at the environmental nonprofit North East Trees, said trees such as the coast live oak are a good option. They are native to the region and are fire resilient \u2014 in fact, they need to burn to reproduce, he said.",
      "Thomas, who grew up in Altadena, has family members who lost homes to the Eaton Fire. His brother\u2019s home burned, but the five coast live oaks in his backyard survived.",
      "For him it's another reminder that cities need to think about how we rebuild in general and how we reforest communities with native flora: \u201cThat\u2019s what we need to do.\u201d",
      "But planting trees with climate-resilient features such as large canopies isn't always easy, and cities must consider community input when deciding what to plant. Trees that provide a lot of shade can make it difficult for drivers to see around corners, for instance. Where space is at a premium, sometimes there\u2019s just not enough room above or below ground to plant them.",
      "Berleson added that it will take a long time for neighborhoods to look like what they did before the fires.",
      "Trees provide myriad benefits. They clean the air and improve mental health. They capture stormwater runoff and replenish groundwater. And during heat waves that are getting hotter and deadlier, shade trees cool the air and urban surfaces.",
      "Vejar said his group knows there will be setbacks, but that is the reality we're living in.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s climate change. It\u2019s water restrictions. It\u2019s extreme weather events,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so in the face of this, all we can do is continue to build and rebuild and steward our urban forests in such a way that makes it more resilient in the face of these extreme weather events.\u201d",

      "Firefighters scrambled to make further progress against wildfires that have killed at least 24 people in the Los Angeles area as forecasters again warned of dangerous weather with the return of strong winds this week",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Firefighters scrambled Sunday to make further progress against wildfires that have destroyed thousands of homes and killed 24 people in the Los Angeles area as forecasters again warned of dangerous weather with the return of strong winds this week. At least 16 people were missing, and authorities said that number was expected to rise.",
      "The National Weather Service issued red flag warnings for severe fire conditions through Wednesday, with sustained winds of 50 mph (80 kph) and gusts in the mountains reaching 70 mph (113 kph). The most dangerous day will be Tuesday, said weather service meteorologist Rich Thompson.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re going to have really strong gusty Santa Ana winds, a very dry atmosphere and still very dry brush, so we still have some very critical fire weather conditions out there,\u201d Thompson said at a community meeting Saturday night.",
      "Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony C. Marrone said 70 additional water trucks arrived to help firefighters fend off flames spread by renewed gusts. \u201cWe are prepared for the upcoming wind event,\u201d Marrone said. Fire retardant dropped by aircraft Sunday will act as a barrier along hillsides, officials said.",
      "Fierce Santa Anas have been largely blamed for turning the wildfires sparked last week into infernos that leveled entire neighborhoods around the city where there has been no significant rainfall in more than eight months.",
      "Twelve people were missing within the Eaton Fire zone and four were missing from the Palisades Fire, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said. Luna added that \u201cdozens\u201d more reports might have come in Sunday morning and investigators were reconciling whether some of the missing might be among the dead. There are no children among those reported missing, he said.",
      "Meanwhile, the death toll rose to 24 over the weekend. Eight of the deaths were attributed to the Palisades Fire and 16 resulted from the Eaton Fire, the Los Angeles County coroner\u2019s office said in a statement Sunday evening.",
      "Officials said they expected that figure to increase as teams with cadaver dogs conduct systematic grid searches in leveled neighborhoods. Authorities have established a center where people can report the missing.",
      "Officials also were building an online database to allow evacuated residents to see if their homes were damaged or destroyed. In the meantime, LA city Fire Chief Kristin Crowley urged people to stay away from scorched neighborhoods.",
      "\u201cThere are still active fires that are burning within the Palisades area, making it extremely, extremely dangerous for the public,\" Crowley said at a Sunday morning briefing. \u201cThere\u2019s no power, there\u2019s no water, there\u2019s broken gas lines, and we have unstable structures.\u201d",
      "Officials warned the ash can contain lead, arsenic, asbestos and other harmful materials.",
      "About 150,000 people in Los Angeles County remained under evacuation orders, with more than 700 residents taking refuge in nine shelters, Luna said. Officials said most of the orders in the Palisades area were unlikely to be lifted before the red flag warnings expire Wednesday evening.",
      "\u201cPlease rest assured that first thing Thursday we will begin talking about repopulation,\u201d Marrone said.",
      "By Sunday morning, Cal Fire reported the Palisades, Eaton, Kenneth and Hurst fires had consumed more than 62 square miles (160 square kilometers), an area larger than San Francisco. The Palisades Fire was 11% contained and containment on the Eaton Fire reached 27%. Those two blazes accounted for 59 square miles (nearly 153 square kilometers).",
      "Crews from California and nine other states are part of the ongoing response that includes nearly 1,400 fire engines, 84 aircraft and more than 14,000 personnel, including newly arrived firefighters from Mexico.",
      "Minimal growth was expected Sunday for the Eaton Fire \u201cwith continued smoldering and creeping\u201d of flames, an LA County Fire Department incident report said. Most evacuation orders for the area have been lifted.",
      "After a fierce battle Saturday, firefighters managed to fight back flames in Mandeville Canyon, home to Arnold Schwarzenegger and other celebrities near Pacific Palisades not far from the coast, where swooping helicopters dumped water as the blaze charged downhill.",
      "The fire ran through chaparral-covered hillsides and also briefly threatened to jump over Interstate 405 and into densely populated areas in the Hollywood Hills and San Fernando Valley.",
      "Looting continues to be a concern, with authorities reporting more arrests as the devastation grows. Michael Lorenz, a captain with the Los Angeles Police Department, said seven people have been arrested in recent days, with two suspects \u201cposing as firefighters coming and in and out of houses.\u201d",
      "Asked exactly how many looters have been arrested, Lorenz said he couldn\u2019t give a precise number but that officers were detaining about 10 people a day. California National Guard troops arrived Friday to help guard properties.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom posted on X Saturday that \u201cCalifornia will NOT allow for looting.\u201d",
      "The fires that began Tuesday just north of downtown LA have burned more than 12,000 structures.",
      "No cause has been determined for the largest fires and early estimates indicate the wildfires could be the nation's costliest ever. A preliminary estimate by AccuWeather put the damage and economic losses so far between $135 billion and $150 billion.",
      "In an interview that aired Sunday on NBC, Gov. Gavin Newsom said the fires could end up being the worst natural disaster in U.S. history.",
      "\u201cI think it will be in terms of just the costs associated with it, in terms of the scale and scope,\u201d he said.",
      "Along with crews from other states and Mexico, hundreds of inmates from California\u2019s prison system were also helping firefighting efforts. Nearly 950 incarcerated firefighters were dispatched \u201cto cut fire lines and remove fuel to slow fire spread,\u201d according to an update from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.",
      "Though the state has long relied on prison labor to fight fires, the practice is controversial as the inmates are paid little for dangerous and difficult work. Inmates are paid up to roughly $10.24 each day, with additional money for 24-hour shifts, according to the corrections department.",
      "Volunteers overflowed donation centers and some had to be turned away at locations including the Santa Anita Park horse racing track, where people who lost their homes sifted through stacks of donated shirts, blankets and other household goods.",
      "Altadena resident Jose Luis Godinez said three homes occupied by more than a dozen of his family members were destroyed.",
      "\u201cEverything is gone,\u201d he said, speaking in Spanish. \"All my family lived in those three houses and now we have nothing.\u201d",
      "Newsom issued an executive order Sunday aimed at fast-tracking the rebuilding of destroyed property by suspending some environmental regulations and ensuring that property tax assessments are not increased.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got to let people know that we have their back,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t walk away because we want you to come back, rebuild, and rebuild with higher quality building standards, more modern standards. We want to make sure that the associated costs with that are not disproportionate, especially in a middle-class community like this.\u201d",
      "The White House said as of Sunday more than 24,000 people have registered for federal assistance made available by President Joe Biden's major disaster declaration last Wednesday.",
      "LA Mayor Karen Bass said Sunday that she has spoken with members of the incoming presidential administration and said she expects Donald Trump will come visit the devastated region.",
      "Bass faces a critical test of her leadership during the city's greatest crisis in decades, but allegations of leadership failures, political blame and investigations have begun.",
      "Newsom on Friday ordered state officials to determine why a 117 million-gallon (440 million-liter) reservoir was out of service and some hydrants had run dry.",
      "Crowley, the LA fire chief, said city leadership failed her department by not providing enough money for firefighting. She also criticized the lack of water.",

      "The wildfires tearing through Los Angeles have taken lives and thousands of homes",
      "For Irina Contreras, a program manager for Los Angeles County\u2019s Department of Arts and Culture, outdoor education was a refuge for both her and her daughter during the pandemic.",
      "Now, much of that refuge has been burned in the raging wildfires around Los Angeles.",
      "Her 7-year-old daughter, Ceiba, hikes with a kid\u2019s adventure group called Hawks and attended Matilija, a bilingual forest school for preschool and kindergarten. Rain or shine, she and her friends would spend their days climbing, jumping, hiking, and swimming in places like Eaton Canyon Nature Area, a 190-acre (77-hectare) preserve near Altadena, now destroyed by fire.",
      "Ceiba learned to ask plants for permission before taking samples to glue into her nature journal. Once, her group discovered a hidden path that led behind a waterfall. Ceiba couldn't stop talking about it for days.",
      "For parents like Contreras, the wildfires have been devastating not just because of the loss of life and thousands of homes. They are mourning natural and educational areas that served as sanctuaries and learning spaces for local families, especially in the years since the pandemic. The fires have torn through natural areas that served every type of educational setting: public and private schools, nature-based preschools, homeschool groups, summer camps and more.",
      "They have burned school buildings, too, including Odyssey Charter School in Altadena, which Miguel Orde\u00f1ana's children attend.",
      "\u201cThe community has been devastated by the fire,\u201d said Orde\u00f1ana, senior manager of community science at the Natural History Museum. \u201cIt\u2019s been a challenge to carefully share that news with my children and help them work through their emotions. A lot of their friends lost their homes. And we don\u2019t know the impact to school staff, like their teachers, but a lot of them live in that area as well and have lost their homes.\u201d",
      "Some areas untouched by fire were inaccessible because of poor air quality. Griffith Park, home of the Hollywood sign, had not been affected by the end of the week but it's not clear when the air quality there will be good enough to resume outdoor programs, said Orde\u00f1ana, who was the first to capture on camera a late puma in the nearby area that gained fame under the name P-22.",
      "Orde\u00f1ana said his family was able to connect with some other families from Odyssey Charter School for pizza and an indoor playdate, but he is uncertain what the days will look like for them with school closures already extending through next week.",
      "All schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation\u2019s second largest, were closed Friday because of heavy smoke and ash over the city. Classes will not resume until conditions improve, officials said. Pasadena Unified School District also closed schools and several of its campuses sustained damage, including Eliot Arts Magnet Middle School.",
      "The California Department of Education released a statement Wednesday saying 335 schools from Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside, Ventura, and San Diego counties were closed. It was unclear how many would be closed Monday.",
      "During the pandemic, Contreras felt like she was stuck on a screen. She devoted much of her energy to working, writing and organizing, but her daughter\u2019s outdoor education helped her better understand the value of stepping away from the grind.",
      "Contreras feels confident the outdoor programs will return, although it\u2019s unclear when it will be safe for people to hike around areas like Eaton Canyon.",
      "\u201cThe nature center is gone,\u201d Richard Smart, superintendent of the Eaton Canyon Natural Area in Pasadena, said Thursday. \u201cThe wildflowers, the shrubs are gone.\u201d The park hosted dozens of school field trips a year and Smart estimates more than a thousand students visited yearly.",
      "\u201cTeachers liked it because it was also free, it was local, it was nearby. And it was a place to see nature \u2014 wild nature but also in a friendly, safe environment,\u201d he said.",
      "Only a few exterior walls of the Eaton Canyon Nature Center were left standing, he said.",
      "\u201cFor many of the local school districts, we truly were in their backyard, and now they won\u2019t be able to use it for the foreseeable future,\u201d he said. \u201cThe park is such a touchstone for people in the community, and so to lose that is just, devastating is not even the right word. It feels indescribable.\u201d",
      "Many parents and teachers are likely wondering what to do and where to take their children as fires continue to burn across Los Angeles, said Lila Higgins, a senior manager for community science at the Natural History Museum and author of \u201cWild L.A,\u201d a field trip and nature guidebook.",
      "A certified forest therapy guide, Higgins says time in nature lowers heart rates, lowers blood pressure and helps children with attention deficit disorder feel more calm and relaxed.",
      "\u201cFor children\u2019s cognitive development, time in nature and time spent connecting with nature is so important,\" she said. Outdoor spaces also can help children learn how to develop relationships through connections with animals, understand orientation through space by following trails and map-reading and understand human impact on wildlife.",
      "\u201cA lot of the places that we\u2019re talking about are really popular with homeschoolers, but they also are a destination for some field trips, certainly places like Eaton Canyon,\" said Greg Pauly, co-author of \u201cWild L.A.\u201d and director of the Urban Nature Research Center at the museum. \"I do think it\u2019s safe to say that people are going to continue to be interacting with those landscapes and it will hopefully still be a field trip destination in the future. But it\u2019s certainly going to be a while before that happens.\"",

      "Many Republican state officials are aligning with Trump's policies by pledging to help him crack down on illegal immigration, for example. Some Democratic state officials are mounting a resistance movement, looking for ways to shield their states from potential federal policies restricting abortion and transgender rights, among other things. Some prominent Democratic governors, meanwhile, have taken a more conciliatory approach in an effort to forge a working relationship with the new administration.",

      "Governors and lawmakers in red states are lining up behind Trump's pledge to crack down on illegal immigration and deport many who are living in the U.S. illegally. A joint statement from 26 Republican governors said they \u201cstand ready to utilize every tool at our disposal \u2014 whether through state law enforcement or the National Guard \u2014 to support President Trump in this vital mission.\u201d",
      "Republican lawmakers in a growing number of states are proposing to give local law officers the power to arrest people who entered the country illegally, mirroring a recent Texas law that has been placed on hold while courts consider whether it unconstitutionally usurps federal authority. One bill in Missouri would offer a $1,000 reward to informants who tip off authorities about people in the country illegally and allow private bounty hunters to find and detain them.",
      "Governors in some blue states are taking a wait-and-see approach to Trump's immigration plans, willing to cooperate on deporting people who commit crimes but not in using the National Guard for widespread roundups of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.",
      "Other Democratic-led jurisdictions are bracing for a showdown. The California Legislature has convened a special session to erect shields against Trump's policies on immigration and other issues.",
      "Most U.S. abortions are carried out using drugs rather than through surgical procedures, and that is where the current abortion fight is focused.",
      "At least four states \u2014 Indiana, Missouri, New Hampshire and Tennessee \u2014 have bills introduced aimed at banning pills. None take the same approach as Louisiana, which last year classified the drugs as controlled dangerous substances.",
      "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is suing a New York doctor, claiming she wrongly prescribed via telehealth and sent pills to a Texas woman, even though a New York law aims to protect such prescriptions.",
      "And the Republican attorneys general of Idaho, Kansas and Missouri are in court trying to roll back federal approvals of one of the pills usually used in abortion.",
      "Several efforts to expand the use of public money to pay for kids to attend private school suffered high-profile defeats in the November elections, including in Nebraska, Kentucky and Colorado.",
      "But Trump\u2019s victory is seen as a boon for such efforts, which in recent years have exploded in popularity. A dozen states, almost all red, have programs allowing any student to apply for government funding for private education, including at religious schools.",
      "With Trump in office, states could see more incentives such as block grants or tax benefits to adopt or expand models like vouchers, which subsidize private school tuition for families. Texas, for example, is expected to see momentum on the school choice front, with a number of voucher proponents winning seats in the Legislature.",
      "Many conservative states also are pushing to bring Christianity into public K-12 education through moves such as requiring schools to teach the Bible and post the Ten Commandments. Trump has promised to promote prayer and Bible reading in schools, with current courts more amenable to religion in the public sphere, including schools.",
      "In Texas, officials in November approved a curriculum that intertwines language arts with biblical lessons and the state education superintendent in Oklahoma has sought to require Bible-related lessons.",
      "Efforts to end diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, initiatives are expected to expand in Republican-led states under Trump, who has vowed to get rid of perceived \u201cwokeness\u201d in education. More higher education institutions may join the ranks of those already dismantling diversity offices in states such as Florida, Kentucky, North Carolina, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska and Texas.",
      "Attorneys general and legislatures in red states also are likely to put pressure on the private sector to pare back DEI initiatives. A Tennessee law provides one model, forbidding financial institutions from considering a customer\u2019s participation in \u201cdiversity, equity and inclusion training.\u201d",
      "Republican lawmakers are expected to keep pushing for restrictions on the rights of transgender people, particularly transgender minors.",
      "More than 30 such bills have been proposed in Texas. Although Texas and other states have bans on gender-affirming care for transgender minors, there are calls to go further, such as barring Medicaid and other state-funded government programs from spending on gender-affirming care for people of any age.",
      "In his campaign last year, Trump leaned into attacks on transgender rights, suggesting a looming shift in federal policy.",
      "The future of some of the measures could rest on a U.S. Supreme Court ruling expected this year on whether Tennessee had the right to ban gender-affirming care for transgender minors.",
      "Most Republican-controlled states already have laws banning or limiting gender-affirming care for minors and participation in women\u2019s and girls sports for transgender women and girls. Several also dictate which school restrooms transgender people may use.",

Kennedy Jr., a lawyer with no medical or public health degrees, has called fluoride an \u201cindustrial waste\u201d and said in a Nov. 2 post on X that the Trump administration would \u201cadvise all U.S. water systems\u201d to stop putting fluoride in the water. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water has long been considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century because it prevents tooth decay.",
      "Arkansas lawmakers have filed bills to repeal a statewide fluoridation program and allow local public water systems to hold elections so residents can decide whether to put fluoride in the water. Montana also has a proposed bill to \u201d ban the use of fluoride,\u201d though the full text of the bill isn\u2019t available yet.",
      "Vaccination laws and mandates are still in play in state governments, too. Alabama may consider changing its vaccination laws to require parental consent for any vaccine to be given to a minor age 14 or older; currently, children that age can decide whether they want medical services. Wyoming has a bill that would impose a civil penalty of up to $5,000 on a business or entity that gets state or federal money if found to discriminate based on whether someone is wearing a mask, has had a COVID-19 vaccination or has been tested for COVID-19.",

      "The plan includes proposals for growth zones where development will be focused, and suggests the technology will be used to help tackle issues such as potholes.",
      "While estimates from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) support the claim that AI could increase productivity, it also says the changes may come gradually.",
      "The government tasked AI adviser Matt Clifford with creating a UK action plan for supporting the growth of artificial intelligence and its use in public services.",
      "He came back with 50 recommendations which are now being implemented.",
      "Among these is for the UK to invest in a new supercomputer to boost computing power - marking a change in strategy after the Labour government ditched the previous government's plans for a supercomputer at Edinburgh University.",
      "Sir Keir said AI \"will drive incredible change\" in the country and \"has the potential to transform the lives of working people\".",
      "\"We're going to make AI work for everyone in our country,\" he added, saying the \"battle for the jobs of tomorrow is happening today\".",
      "Sir Keir said the UK would become one of the AI \"superpowers\" - mirroring former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's drive to boost the UK sector so it could rival that of the US and China.",
      "At the time, many of Sunak's proposals were geared towards mitigating future risks of highly powerful AI systems.",
      "In October 2023, he said AI could enable faster, easier production of chemical and biological weapons, or be used by terrorist groups to spread disinformation.",
      "He added that in a worst-case scenario, society could lose control over AI.",
      "His government's emphasis on \"safety\" seems largely absent in this new plan  - instead focusing on maximising opportunities, growth and innovation.",
      "The pivot away from the previous narrative of caution and safety suggests the government has decided the UK should attempt to compete in the AI arms race, currently lead by major global players including the US and China.",
      "However, building data centres and boosting the nation's computing power will not happen overnight.",
      "This means the government is unlikely to see the end results of this major project ahead of the next general election - when Labour will have to convince voters that it was still the right decision, at a time when public finances remain stretched.",
      "Professor Dame Wendy Hall said the proposals were \"ambitious\", but necessary to help the UK keep up with the pace of development.",
      "\"It's an ambitious plan but there's a lot of upfront investment,\" she told BBC Radio Four's Today programme.",
      "\"It will take some time to see a return on that investment and they've got to be in it for the long-term.\"",
      "How the AI plan could affect you",
      "Among the government's proposals are:",
      "AI will be used by the public sector to enable its workers to spend less time doing admin and more time delivering services.Several \"AI Growth Zones\" around the UK will be created, involving big building projects and new jobs.AI will be fed through cameras around the country to inspect roads and spot potholes that need fixing Teachers and small business owners were highlighted as two groups that could start using AI for things like faster planning and record-keeping.AI is already being used in UK hospitals for important tasks such as diagnosing cancer more quickly and it will continue to be used to support the NHS.",

      "But shadow science secretary Alan Mak said Labour was \"delivering analogue government in a digital age\".",
      "While the push towards AI is seen as way of cutting down on public spending, Mak accused Labour of undermining this goal with its economic policies.",
      "\"Labour's economic mismanagement and uninspiring plan will mean Britain is left behind,\" he said.",
      "Science and Technology Secretary Peter Kyle told the BBC there was no reason why the UK could not create tech companies on the same scale as Google, Amazon, and Apple.",
      "\"At the moment, we don't have any frontier conceptual, cutting-edge companies that are British-owned.\"",
      "He highlighted DeepMind, which created technology enabling computers to play video and board games, as an example of a former British-born company that was now US-owned.",
      "It was founded by three University College London students before its acquisition by Google.",
      "Tim Flagg, chief operating officer of UKAI - a trade body representing British AI businesses - said the proposals take a \"narrow view\" of the sector's contributors and focus too much on big tech.",
      "\"AI innovation spans industries, from small enterprises to non-tech sectors, all driving the new industrial revolution,\" he said.",
      "\"It's time the government recognised this broader definition and tapped into the full potential of AI across the UK.\"",
      "What is AI and how does it work?",
      "Is AI the answer for better government services?",
      "AI 'not perfect'",
      "There are continuing questions over the risks of introducing AI systems that can \"hallucinate\" or make things up, or discriminate against certain groups of people due to bias.",
      "Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden said \"we're only at the foothills of this\" and AI was a developing technology.",
      "He said a government-developed AI teaching assistant had been used by about 30,000 teachers in England so far.",
      "\"It saves teachers about three-and-half hours a week - gives them their Sunday evening back, if you like, in terms of lesson preparation and classroom preparation,\" he told BBC Breakfast.",
      "McFadden said AI applications used by the health service can detect some cancers earlier which are not detectable by the human eye.",
      "However he acknowledged AI was \"not perfect\" after Apple faced calls to withdraw a controversial feature that generated inaccurate news alerts on its latest iPhones.",
      "\"We've got to have an eye on safety as well as opportunity,\" McFadden said.",

    "summary": "Workers making clothes for the fast fashion giant tell the BBC they labour for up to 75 hours a week.",
    "story": [
      "The hum of sewing machines is a constant in parts of Guangzhou, a thriving port on the Pearl River in southern China.",
      "It rattles through the open windows of factories from morning until late at night, as they finish the t-shirts, shorts, blouses, pants and swimwear that will be shipped to fill wardrobes in more than 150 countries.",
      "This is the sound of Panyu, the neighbourhood known as the \"Shein village\", a warren of factories that power the world's largest fast fashion retailer.",
      "\"If there are 31 days in a month, I will work 31 days,\" one worker told the BBC.",
      "Most said they only have one day off a month.",
      "The BBC spent several days here: we visited 10 factories, spoke to four owners and more than 20 workers. We also spent time at labour markets and textile suppliers.",
      "We found that the beating heart of this empire is a workforce sitting behind sewing machines for around 75 hours a week in contravention of Chinese labour laws.",
      "These hours are not unusual in Guangzhou, an industrial hub for rural workers in search of a higher income; or in China, which has long been the world's unrivalled factory.",
      "But they add to a growing list of questions about Shein, once a little-known Chinese-founded company that has become a global behemoth in just over five years.",
      "Still privately-owned, it was valued at about \u00a354bn ($66bn) in a fundraising round in 2023. It is now eyeing a potential listing on the London Stock Exchange.",
      "Its meteoric rise, however, has been dogged with controversy about its treatment of workers and allegations of forced labour.",
      "Last year it admitted to finding children working in its factories in China.",
      "The company declined to be interviewed but told the BBC in a statement that \"Shein is committed to ensuring the fair and dignified treatment of all workers within our supply chain\" and is investing tens of millions of dollars in strengthening governance and compliance.",
      "It added: \"We strive to set the highest standards for pay and we require that all supply chain partners adhere to our code of conduct. Furthermore, Shein works with auditors to ensure compliance.\"",
      "Shein's success lies in volume - the inventory online runs into the hundreds of thousands - and deep discounts: \u00a310 dresses, \u00a36 sweaters, prices that hover below \u00a38 on average.",
      "Revenue has soared, outstripping the likes of H&M, Zara and Primark. The cut-price sales are driven by places like the Shein village, home to some 5,000 factories, most of them Shein suppliers.",
      "The buildings have been hollowed out to make way for sewing machines, rolls of fabric and bags brimming with cloth scraps. The doors to their basements are always open for the seemingly endless cycle of deliveries and collections.",
      "As the day passes, the shelves fill up with warehouse-bound, clear plastic bags labelled with a now-distinctive five-letter noun.",
      "But even past 22:00, the sewing machines - and the people hunched over them - don't stop as more fabric arrives, in trucks so full that bolts of colour sometimes tumble onto the factory floor.",
      "\"We usually work, 10, 11 or 12 hours a day,\" says a 49-year-old woman from Jiangxi unwilling to give her name. \"On Sundays we work around three hours less.\"",
      "She is in an alleyway, where a dozen people are huddled around a row of bulletin boards.",
      "They are reading the job ads on the board, while examining the stitching on a pair of chinos draped over it.",
      "This is Shein's supply chain. The factories are contracted to make clothes on order - some small, some big. If the chinos are a hit, orders will ramp up and so must production. Factories then hire temporary workers to meet the demand their permanent staff cannot fulfil.",
      "The migrant worker from Jiangxi is looking for a short-term contract - and the chinos are an option.",
      "\"We earn so little. The cost of living is now so high,\" she says, adding that she hopes to make enough to send back to her two children who are living with their grandparents.",
      "\"We get paid per piece,\" she explains. \"It depends how difficult the item is. Something simple like a t-shirt is one-two yuan [less than a dollar] per piece and I can make around a dozen in an hour.\"",
      "Examining the stitching on the chinos is crucial for making that decision. All around her, workers are calculating how much they will get paid to make each piece of clothing and how many they can make in an hour.",
      "The alleys of Panyu function as labour markets, filling up in the mornings as workers and scooters rush past the breakfast dumpling cart, the cups of steaming soybean milk and the hopeful farmer selling chicken and duck eggs.",
      "Standard working hours appear to be from 08:00 to well past 22:00, the BBC found.",
      "This is consistent with a report from the Swiss advocacy group Public Eye, which was based on interviews with 13 textile workers at factories producing clothes for Shein.",
      "They found that a number of staff were working excessive overtime. It noted the basic wage without overtime was 2,400 yuan (\u00a3265; $327) - below the 6,512 yuan the Asia Floor Wage Alliance says is needed for a \"living wage\". But the workers we spoke to managed to earn anywhere between 4,000 and 10,000 yuan a month.",
      "\"These hours are not unusual, but it's clear that it's illegal and it violates basic human rights,\" said David Hachfield from the group. \"It's an extreme form of exploitation and this needs to be visible.\"",
      "The average working week should not exceed 44 hours, according to Chinese labour laws, which also state that employers should ensure workers have at least one rest day a week. If an employer wants to extend these hours, it should be for special reasons.",
      "While Shein's headquarters are now in Singapore, there is no denying the majority of its products are made in China.",
      "And Shein's success has drawn the attention of Washington, which is increasingly wary of Chinese firms.",
      "In June, Donald Trump's pick for US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, said he had  \"grave ethics concerns\" about Shein's \"deep ties to the People's Republic of China\": \"Slave labour, sweatshops, and trade tricks are the dirty secrets behind Shein's success,\" he wrote.",
      "Not everyone would agree with Rubio's choice of words to describe the conditions at Shein's suppliers. But rights groups say that the long working hours, which have become a way of life for many in Guangzhou, are unfair and exploitative.",
      "The machines dictate the rhythm of the day.",
      "They pause for lunch and dinner when the workers, metal plates and chopsticks in hand, file into the canteen to buy food. If there is no more space to sit, they stand in the street.",
      "\"I've been working in these factories for more than 40 years,\" said one woman who spent just 20 minutes eating her meal. This was just another day for her.",
      "Inside, the factories we visit are not cramped. There is enough light and industrial-sized fans have been brought in to keep workers cool. Huge posters urge staff to report underage workers - likely a response to finding two cases of child labour in the supply chain last year.",
      "The BBC understands that the company is keeping a closer eye on its suppliers ahead of plans to go public on the London Stock Exchange.",
      "\"This is about their reputation,\" says Sheng Lu, a professor in Fashion and Apparel Studies at the University of Delaware. \"If Shein can successfully achieve an IPO then it means they are recognised as a decent company. But if they are to keep the confidence of investors, they have to take some responsibility.\"",
      "One of the biggest challenges Shein faces is accusations that it sources cotton from China's Xinjiang region.",
      "Once touted as among the world's best fabric, Xinjiang's cotton has fallen out of favour after allegations that it is produced using forced labour by people from the Muslim Uyghur minority - a charge that Beijing has consistently denied.",
      "The only way to get around this criticism is to be more transparent, Prof Sheng says.",
      "\"Unless you fully release your factory list, unless you make your supply chain more transparent to the public, then I think it's going to be very challenging for Shein.\"",
      "A major advantage, he adds, is that Shein's supply chain is in China: \"Very few countries have a complete supply chain. China has this - and nobody can compete.\"",
      "Aspiring rivals like Vietnam and Bangladesh import raw materials from China to make clothes. But Chinese factories rely entirely on local sources for everything, from fabric to zippers and buttons. So it's easy to make a variety of garments, and they are able to do it quickly.",
      "That especially works for Shein whose algorithm determines orders. If shoppers repeatedly click on a certain dress, or spend longer looking at a wool sweater, the firm knows to ask factories to make more - and fast.",
      "For workers in Guangzhou, this can be a challenge.",
      "\"Shein has its pros and cons,\" one factory owner told us. \"The good thing is the order is eventually big, but profit is low and it's fixed.\"",
      "Shein, given its size and influence, is a hard bargainer. So factory owners have to cut costs elsewhere, often resulting in lower staff wages.",
      "\"Before Shein, we produced and sold clothes on our own,\" said an owner of three factories. \"We could estimate the cost, decide the price  and calculate the profit. Now Shein controls the price, and you have to think about ways to reduce the cost.\"",
      "When orders peak, however, it's a bonanza. The company ships around one million packages a day on average, according to data from ShipMatrix, a logistics consultancy firm.",
      "\"Shein is a pillar of the fashion industry,\" said Guo Qing E, a Shein supplier.",
      "\"I started when Shein started. I witnessed its rise. To be honest, Shein is an awesome company in China. I think it will become stronger, because it pays on time. This is where it is most trustworthy.",
      "\"If payment for our goods is due on the 15th, no matter whether it's millions or tens of millions, the money will be paid on time.\"",
      "Shein, with its gruelling hours and sometimes lower wages, may not be a source of comfort to all its workers. But it is a source of pride for some.",
      "\"This is the contribution we Chinese people can make to the world,\" said a 33- year-old supervisor from Guangdong, who didn't want to give her name.",
      "It's dark outside and workers are filing back into factories after their dinner for the final stretch. She admits the hours are long, but \"we get on well with each other. We are like a family\".",
      "Hours later, after many workers head home for the night, the lights in several buildings stay on.",
      "Some people work until midnight, one factory owner told us. They want to earn more money, he said.",

      "In a letter to the PM, Mr Russell argued that the Online Safety Act, which aims to force tech giants to take more responsibility for their sites' content, needed fixing and said a \"duty of care\" should be imposed on the firms.",
      "Speaking to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, Kyle expressed his \"frustration\" with the Act, which was passed by the previous Conservative government in 2023.",
      "The Conservative government had originally included in the legislation plans to compel social media companies to remove some \"legal-but-harmful\" content, such as posts promoting eating disorders.",
      "However the proposal triggered a backlash from critics, including the current Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who were concerned it could lead to censorship.",

      "The plan was dropped for adult social media users and instead companies were required to give users more control to filter out content they did not want to see. The law still expects companies to protect children from legal-but-harmful content.",
      "Kyle said the section on legal-but-harmful content had been taken out of the bill adding: \"So I inherited a landscape where we have a very uneven, unsatisfactory legislative settlement.\"",

    "summary": "Pharmaceutical firms are turning to AI to find new molecules that might be able to tackle disease.",
    "story": [
      "This is the fourth feature in a six-part series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments.",
      "Over a video call, Alex Zhavoronkov holds up a small, green, diamond-shaped pill.",
      "It has been developed by his company to treat a rare progressive lung disease for which there is no known cause or cure.",
      "The new drug has yet to be approved, but in small clinical trials has shown impressive efficacy in treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).",
      "It's one of a new wave of drugs where artificial intelligence (AI) has been integral to its discovery.",
      "\"We can't say we have the first AI discovered and designed molecule approved,\" says Dr Zhavoronkov, the co-founder and CEO of US-based start-up Insilico Medicine. \"But we may be the furthest along the path.\"",
      "Welcome to the great AI drug race, where a host of companies are employing the power of AI to do what has traditionally been the job of medicinal chemists.",
      "That includes both smaller, specialist AI-driven biotech companies, which have sprung up over the past decade, and larger pharmaceutical firms who are either doing the research themselves, or in partnership with smaller firms.",
      "Among the newer players is Alphabet, the parent company of Google, which launched UK-based AI drug discovery company Isomorphic Labs, in late 2021.",
      "Its CEO, Demis Hassabis, shared this year's Nobel prize in chemistry for an AI model that is expected to be useful for AI drug design.",
      "Using AI to do drug discovery could make an \"enormous difference\" for patients, says Chris Meier, of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG).",
      "Bringing a new drug to market takes on average 10 to 15 years, and costs more than $2bn (\u00a31.6bn).",
      "It's also risky: about 90% of drugs that go into clinical trials fail. The hope is that using AI for the drug discovery part of that process could cut the time and cost, and result in more success.",
      "A new era, where AI is at the centre of the drug discovery process is emerging, says Charlotte Deane, a professor of structural bioinformatics at Oxford University, who develops freely available AI tools to help pharmaceutical companies and others improve their drug discovery.",
      "\"We are at the beginning of just how good that might be,\" she says.",
      "It is unlikely to lead to fewer pharmaceutical scientists, say experts - the real savings will come if there are fewer failures - but it will mean working in partnership with AI.",
      "A recently published analysis by BCG found at least 75 \"AI-discovered molecules\" have entered clinical trials with many more expected.",
      "\"That they are now routinely going into clinical trials is a major milestone,\" says Dr Meier. The next \u2013 and \"even bigger milestone\" \u2013 will be when they start to come out the other end.",
      "However, Prof Deane notes that there is no definition yet of what exactly counts as an \"AI discovered\" drug and, in all the examples to date, there has still been lots of human involvement.",
      "There are two steps within the drug discovery process where AI is being most heavily deployed explains Dr Meier.",
      "The first is in identifying, at the molecular level, the therapeutic target that it is intended the drug will act to correct, such as a certain gene or protein being altered by the disease in a way it shouldn't.",
      "While traditionally scientists test potential targets in the lab experimentally, based on what they understand of a disease, AI can be trained to mine large databases to make connections between the underlying molecular biology and the disease and make suggestions.",
      "The second, and more common, is in designing the drug to correct the target.",
      "This employs generative AI, also the basis of ChatGPT, to imagine molecules that might bind to the target and work, replacing the expensive manual process of chemists synthesising many hundreds of variations of the same molecule and trying them to find the optimal one.",
      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "Insilico Medicine, founded in 2014 and which has received more than $425m in funding, used AI for both steps, as well as to predict the probability of success in clinical trials which it then feeds back into its drug discovery work.",
      "Currently the firm has six molecules in clinical trials, including to treat IPF for which the next phase of trials is being planned.",
      "In addition four molecules have been cleared to enter trials, and nearly 30 others are showing promise.",
      "All have been \"discovered from scratch using generative AI\", says Dr Zhavoronkov. \"Our machines dream until they come up with a perfect drug that fits all our criteria.\"",
      "The novel molecule to treat IPF was designed by the company's generative AI software after it was given the objective of inhibiting a protein called TNIK, which has never been targeted before for treating IPF, but was suggested by another set of the company's AI software as the most likely regulator of the disease.",
      "Possibilities suggested by the system were then synthesised and tested.",
      "The discovery process was far quicker and leaner than standard for the industry, notes Dr Zhavoronkov.",
      "It took 18 months and required synthesis and testing of 79 molecules, where usually it would be expected to take about four years and at least the synthesis of 500. Other of Insilco's molecules have even lower numbers, he says.",
      "The lack of data from which AI can learn remains the biggest challenge for the field generally, say experts.",
      "That cuts across both target identification and molecule design, and can potentially introduce biases.",
      "US-based Recursion Pharmaceuticals says its approach mitigates the problems of limited data.",
      "Through automated experiments, it generates massive quantities of data related to the entire collection of molecules that makes up the human body. It then trains AI tools to understand that data and find unexpected relationships.",
      "To help to do that, last year it installed what it says is the fastest supercomputer owned and operated by any pharmaceutical company.",
      "It has had some success. A molecule developed by the company to treat both lymphoma and solid tumours is now being tested on cancer patients in early-stage clinical trials.",
      "It was developed after the AI spotted a new way of targeting a gene which is thought to be important in driving these cancers, but which nobody had previously cracked how to target on its own.",
      "Recursion co-founder and CEO Chris Gibson says what matters most in the field is something neither Recursion nor anyone else has yet shown: that these AI-discovered molecules can make it through clinical trials and that, over time, they deliver an increased probability of success over traditional methods.",
      "When that happens, says Dr Gibson, \"it'll be obvious to the world that this is the way to go\"."

    "published": "Thu, 09 Jan 2025 01:29:15 GMT",
    "summary": "Donald Trump's planned tariffs are expected to greatly impact international trade in 2025.",
    "story": [
      "Inflation, interest rates and tariffs mean 2025 is shaping up to be an intriguing year for the global economy. One in which growth is expected to remain at a \"stable yet underwhelming\" 3.2%, according to the International Monetary Fund. So what might that mean for all of us?",
      "Exactly a week before Christmas there was a welcome gift for millions of American borrowers - a third interest rate cut in a row.",
      "However, stock markets fell sharply because the world's most powerful central banker, US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, made clear they shouldn't expect as many further cuts in 2025 as they might have hoped for, as the battle against inflation continues.",
      "\"From here, it's a new phase, and we're going to be cautious about further cuts,\" he said.",
      "In recent years, the Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine have led to sharp price rises around the world, and although prices are still increasing the pace has slowed markedly.",
      "Despite that, November saw inflation push up in the US, eurozone and UK to to 2.7%, 2.2% and 2.6% respectively. It highlights the difficulties many central banks face in the so-called \"last mile\" of their battle against inflation. Their target is 2%, and it might be easier to achieve if economies are growing.",
      "However, the biggest difficulty for global growth \"is uncertainty, and the uncertainty is coming from what may come out of the US under Trump 2.0\", says Luis Oganes, who is head of global macro research at investment bank JP Morgan.",
      "Since Donald Trump won November's election he's continued to threaten new tariffs against key US trading partners, China, Canada and Mexico.",
      "\"The US is going into a more isolationist policy stance, raising tariffs, trying to provide more effective protection to US manufacturing,\" says Mr Oganes.",
      "\"And even though that is going to support US growth, at least in the short term, certainly it's going to hurt many countries that rely on trade with the US.\"",
      "New tariffs \"could be particularly devastating\" for Mexico and Canada, but also be \"harmful\" to the US, according to Maurice Obstfeld, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, and a previous economic advisor to President Obama.",
      "He cites car manufacturing as an example of an industry that \"depends on a supply chain that is spread across the three countries. If you disrupt that supply chain, you have massive disruptions in the auto market\".",
      "That has the potential to push up prices, reduce demand for products, and hurt company profits, which could in turn drag down investment levels, he explains.",
      "Mr Obstfeld, who is now with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, adds: \"Introducing these types of tariffs into a world that is heavily dependent on trade could be harmful to growth, could throw the world into recession.\"",
      "The tariffs threats have also played a role in forcing the resignation of Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.",
      "Even though the majority of what the US and China sell each other is already subject to tariffs from Donald Trump's first term in office, the threat of new tariffs is a key challenge for the world's second-biggest economy in the year ahead.",
      "In his new year address President Xi Jinping acknowledged the \"challenges of uncertainties in the external environment\", but said the economy was on \"an upward trajectory\".",
      "Exports of cheap goods from its factories are crucial to China's economy. A drop off in demand because tariffs push prices up would compound the many domestic challenges, including weak consumer spending and business investment, that the government is trying to tackle.",
      "Those efforts are helping, according to the World Bank, which at the end of December increased its forecast for China's growth from 4.1% to 4.5% in 2025.",
      "Beijing has yet to set a growth target for 2025, but thinks it's on course for 5% last year.",
      "\"Addressing challenges in the property sector, strengthening social safety nets, and improving local government finances will be essential to unlocking a sustained recovery,\" according to the World Bank's country director for China, Mara Warwick.",
      "Those domestic struggles mean the Chinese government is \"more welcoming\" of foreign investment, according to Michael Hart, who is president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China.",
      "Tensions between the US and China, and tariffs have grown under the Biden presidency, meaning some companies have looked to move production elsewhere.",
      "However, Mr Hart points out that \"it took 30 to 40 years for China to emerge as such a strong supplier manufacturer\", and whilst \"companies have tried to mitigate some of those risks... no one's prepared now to completely replace China.\"",
      "One industry that is likely to continue to be at the heart of global trade battles is electric vehicles. More than 10 million were made in China last year, and that dominance led the US, Canada and European Union (EU) to impose tariffs on them.",
      "Beijing says they're unfair, and is challenging them at the World Trade Organization.",
      "However, it's the prospect of Donald Trump imposing tariffs that is concerning the EU.",
      "\"Restrictions on trade, protectionist measures, are not conducive to growth, and ultimately have an impact on inflation that is largely uncertain,\" the president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, said last month. \"[But] in the short term, it's probably net inflationary.\"",
      "Germany and France are the traditional engines of Europe's economic growth. But their poor performance amid political instability over the past year means that, despite a recent uptick in growth, the eurozone risks losing momentum in the year ahead.",
      "That is, unless consumers spend more and businesses increase their investments.",
      "In the UK higher prices could also come as a result of tax and wage increases, according to one survey.",
      "One barrier to cutting eurozone interest rates is that domestic inflation, which focuses on the prices of items that are less prone to influence from external factors, remains at 4.2%. That's more than double the overall inflation target of 2%, and strong wage pressure has been a barrier getting it down further.",
      "It's been similar in the US according to Sander van 't Noordende, the chief executive of Randstad, the world's biggest recruitment firm.",
      "\"In the US, for instance, [wage inflation] is still going to be around 4% in 2024. In some Western European countries, it's even higher than that.",
      "\"I think there's two factors there. There's the talent scarcity, but there's also, of course, the inflation and people demanding to get more for the work they do.\"",
      "Mr van 't Noordende adds that many companies are passing those extra costs on to their customers, which is adding upward pressure to general inflation.",
      "A slowdown in the global jobs market reflects a lack of \"dynamism\" from companies and economic growth is key to reversing that, he says.",
      "\"If the economy is doing well, businesses are growing, they start hiring. People see interesting opportunities, and you just start seeing people moving around\".",
      "One person starting a new role in 2025 is Donald Trump, and a raft of economic plans including tax cuts and deregulation could help the US economy to continue to thrive.",
      "Whilst much won't be revealed before he's back in the White House on 20 January,  \"everything points to continued US exceptionalism at the expense of the rest of the world,\" says JP Morgan's Mr Oganes.",
      "He's hopeful that inflation and interest rates can continue to come down around the world, but warns that \"a lot of it will depend on what are the policies that get deployed, particularly from the US.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 12 Jan 2025 00:59:47 GMT",
    "summary": "As Love Island All Stars returns, we find out if reality stars can still have a lucrative social media career.",
    "story": [
      "The cast of this year's Love Island All Stars, a spin-off featuring former contestants, has been described as \"dating royalty\" by its makers.",
      "More than half of the 12 islanders heading to the South African villa were finalists on their respective series, while 2022 winner Ekin-Su C\u00fclc\u00fclo\u011flu is also rumoured to be entering later on.",
      "Appearing on Love Island was once seen as a route to independent fame and success.",
      "But could the return of names from some of the show\u2019s most popular series be a sign that the once-profitable pipeline from Islander to influencer or TV star is coming to an end?",
      "Becoming an influencer is a well-worn career path for those leaving Love Island, and past contestants have been paid by brands to sell everything from cosmetics to cars to social media users.",
      "Perhaps the highest achiever in this role has been 2019 series runner-up Molly-Mae Hague, who went on to work as a creative director for fast fashion brand Pretty Little Thing, and has recently launched her own fashion company.",
      "But Molly-Mae appeared on Love Island at the peak of its popularity. The episode in which she and Tommy Fury lost out to winners Amber Gill and Greg O'Shea is still the show's most watched ever, attracting over six million viewers.",
      "Hitting these heights isn't possible for every former cast member, something more recent contestant Tanyel Revan believes aspiring influencers need to be aware of.",
      "\"One thing about this industry that people have to remember is that if you don't maintain it 24/7, which is very hard because it is a bit of a fake lifestyle, you can easily be forgotten,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "\"I think a lot of influencers go back on All Stars because they need to keep up and have that boost,\" she adds.",
      "Tanyel, 28, appeared on a winter series of the show in 2023, when interest was still high (its final was watched by over a million people), but not at the levels Molly-Mae experienced in 2019.",
      "The hairdresser says while she has earned some \"extra income\" from social media influencing, the haircare company she started before entering the villa is what gives her \"stability\".",
      "\"I am a businesswoman who has got my own salon,\" Tanyel adds.",
      "'It's very saturated'",
      "A lot has changed since Love Island first aired in its current form in 2015. More than 300 people have now appeared on the UK edition of the show - being an ex-Islander is no longer an exclusive club.",
      "For a while, finalists enjoyed rumoured six-figure brand deals with fast fashion companies and sponsored Instagram posts that could earn them thousands.",
      "But according to social media expert and co-founder of Sloane House Marketing, Bryleigh Flack, the appetite for this type of content no longer exists.",
      "\"The way we digest content is completely different to how we did even five years ago,\" she says.",
      "\"There are so many adverts, not even just influencer ads but when you are scrolling, even through your friends' [Instagram] stories, you're hit with them, it's very saturated,\" she says.",
      "Bryleigh says big-brand partnerships used to be the best way to make money, but \"appealing to the masses\" is no longer the best strategy for influencers, thanks to newer platforms like TikTok, which use a different algorithm to choose content for users.",
      "She says there is a new type of content creator in 2025 - the \"micro influencer\" - who may not have loads of followers, but has a really engaged and specific audience.",
      "These creators \"really hone in on their audience and know them\", she adds. \"For example, mums with young families or girls that love to go out every weekend, they're completely different people so trying to market to them both won't work.\"",
      "'Just being good looking is not going to get you much'",
      "Billy Brown, who appeared on series eight of Love Island in 2022, says many of the people he was on the show with saw it as an easy route to becoming an influencer.",
      "\"I know a lot of people who came out, quit their job and thought that's it now, but it's not.",
      "\"You can earn a lot of money from that show but if you don't do well, it's not the case,\" says the 25-year-old, who entered the main villa after impressing fellow contestant Tasha Ghouri in second villa Casa Amor.",
      "Billy, who owns businesses in construction and property development, says that days after leaving the show, he was \"getting up at half four in the morning [for work] and then going to a movie premiere at night\".",
      "\"I didn't let it get to my head, I think I was one of the only people who could say 'look, it's not all glitz and glam',\" he adds.",
      "Billy has maintained a social media presence in the years since, featuring content on his construction work alongside more lifestyle and sports-focused material.",
      "He says he still earns some money from influencing but thinks that's due to his personality, rather than his follower count, a relatively modest 115,000. In contrast, Molly-Mae has over eight million.",
      "\"People [who go on the show] need to focus on what they like, instead of just being known for being on Love Island.",
      "\"You have to have something about you, just being good looking is not going to get you much,\" he adds.",
      "'People would do adverts for every single company'",
      "Love Island's cultural relevance has become a topic of conversation in recent years due to falling viewing figures.",
      "At the show's peak in 2019, it achieved an average of nearly six million viewers, with more recent series in 2023 and 2024 attracting around one to two million.",
      "With the reality TV dating genre's recent boost from Netflix shows such as Love is Blind, The Ultimatum and Too Hot to Handle, audiences now have more options than ever at their disposal.",
      "Jake Lee, who runs Alpha Talent Group, represents stars from across sport, entertainment and social media.",
      "He manages boxer Tommy Fury and sports presenter Mac Griffiths (known as Michael on Love Island), who both appeared on the aforementioned 2019 series of the show.",
      "\"People would come off a show and do adverts for every single company, because these companies would want to take advantage of the quick exposure they could get,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"But four or five months down the line you'd be harming your own career, because you'd used your platform the wrong way and there'd be no credibility there,\" he adds.",
      "Jake says more recent reality TV contestants have learnt a lot from the mistakes of their predecessors, who were leaving shows with no real strategy.",

      "She signed her first record deal in 2017, based on the strength of a song she had uploaded to YouTube called Die Young.",
      "Cast as a singer-songwriter in mould of Lorde and Lana Del Rey, she failed to make much of an impact, and was dropped by her label during the pandemic.",
      "But by that stage, she had already recorded a song that would become her calling card.",
      "Titled Pink Pony Club, it was inspired by a visit to an LA gay club, and helped her define a new sound - camp, liberated and packed with singalong choruses.",
      "The experience also spawned her campy stage persona, which she has described as a \"larger-than-life, drag queen version of myself\".",
      "After finding a new record label, she released her debut album, The Rise And Fall Of A Midwest Princess, in September 2023.",
      "A slow-burning success, it only sold a few thousand copies in its first week of release. But word began to spread - and when she played California's Coachella Festival last April, the crowd that turned up for her mid-afternoon set was huge.",
      "More importantly, the show was broadcast on YouTube - going viral after Roan  leaned into the TV cameras and declared: \"I'm your favourite artist's favourite artist.\" The performance has subsequently been watched more than a million times.",
      "Around the same time, she released a stand-alone single called Good Luck, Babe, that talked about her experience of falling in love with her best friend.",
      "\"It's a pop song with a sad element to it,\" she told BBC News last year.",
      "\"It's very common in queer relationships, when someone is still coming to terms with their queerness, [that] they'll kiss 100 boys to 'stop the feeling', as the song says.",
      "\"And it's like, 'Sure, OK. Your time will come.'\"",
      "The single eventually reached number two in the UK charts, and The Rise And Fall Of The Midwest Princess became a number one album after it was re-released on vinyl last summer.",
      "Since then, Roan has been nominated for six Grammy awards, including album of the year, and won best new artist at the Billboard Music Awards in December.",
      "She has also experienced the downside of her sudden fame, and spoke out about the \"creepy behaviour\" of certain fans who \"yelled\" and \"harassed\" her at private moments; and who had approached her family and friends.",

      "They rely on measurements like body temperature to predict ovulation (when an egg is released from the ovary).",
      "Companies say they can be as much as 93% reliable when used correctly.",
      "However, they require people to take readings and control when they have sex, avoiding intercourse on days when the app tells them that they may be fertile.",
      "The NHS says if you do not follow the instructions exactly, the method is only 76% effective. This means 24 in 100 women will get pregnant when tracking their fertility for a year.",
      "In comparison, the pill and the mini pill are 91% effective with \"typical use\" and 99% effective with \"perfect\" use.",
      "Hormonal coils or implants, which do not rely on the user remembering to take them, are 99% effective.",
      "For the study, researchers from NHS Forth Valley and the University of Edinburgh compared data from the British Pregnancy Advisory Service for the periods January to June 2018 (33,495 women) and January to June 2023 (55,055 women) to see if contraceptive use changed.",

      "\"The market has exploded. There are hundreds of them and some are more reliable than others. Plus you don't need a prescription, and so you may not get all the information you need.\"",

      "Abortion provider MSI Reproductive Choices UK told the BBC it too has seen more women using fertility awareness methods.",
      "Tanya Lane, contraception lead, explained: \"This could be a result of the rise in popularity of social media platforms like TikTok, which has seen more people sharing their experiences...and content creators doing paid partnerships with brands of fertility awareness methods that might be influencing people to choose this option.",

Then we need to address why people are ditching hormonal and non hormonal contraception and the role the spread of misinformation plays in this.\"",
      "Paula Baraitser, medical director of the NHS-partnered free sexual health service provider SH:24, said there could be many reasons why women are switching, including concerns about future fertility and possible side effects.",

    "summary": "Should more AI be used to help GPs with consultations and administrative work?",
    "story": [
      "This is the fifth feature in a six-part series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments.",
      "The difficulty of getting an appointment with a GP is a familiar gripe in the UK.",
      "Even when an appointment is secured, the rising workload faced by doctors means those meetings can be shorter than either the doctor or patient would like.",
      "But Dr Deepali Misra-Sharp, a GP partner in Birmingham, has found that AI has alleviated a chunk of the administration from her job, meaning she can focus more on patients.",
      "Dr Mirsa-Sharp started using Heidi Health, a free AI-assisted medical transcription tool that listens and transcribes patient appointments, about four months ago and says it has made a big difference.",
      "\u201cUsually when I\u2019m with a patient, I am writing things down and it takes away from the consultation,\u201d she says. \u201cThis now means I can spend my entire time locking eyes with the patient and actively listening. It makes for a more quality consultation.\u201d",
      "She says the tech reduces her workflow, saving her \u201ctwo to three minutes per consultation, if not more\u201d. She reels off other benefits: \u201cIt reduces the risk of errors and omissions in my medical note taking.\"",
      "With a workforce in decline while the number of patients continues to grow, GPs face immense pressure.",
      "A single full-time GP is now responsible for 2,273 patients, up 17% since September 2015, according to the British Medical Association (BMA).",
      "Could AI be the solution to help GP\u2019s cut back on administrative tasks and alleviate burnout?",
      "Some research suggests it could. A 2019 report prepared by Health Education England estimated a minimal saving of one minute per patient from new technologies such as AI, equating to 5.7 million hours of GP time.",
      "Meanwhile, research by Oxford University in 2020, found that 44% of all administrative work in General Practice can now be either mostly or completely automated, freeing up time to spend with patients.",
      "One company working on that is Denmark's Corti, which has developed AI that can listen to healthcare consultations, either over the phone or in person, and suggest follow-up questions, prompts, treatment options, as well as automating note taking.",
      "Corti says its technology processes about 150,000 patient interactions per day across hospitals, GP surgeries and healthcare institutions across Europe and the US, totalling about 100 million encounters per year.",
      "\u201cThe idea is the physician can spend more time with a patient,\u201d says Lars Maal\u00f8e, co-founder and chief technology officer at Corti. He says the technology can suggest questions based on previous conversations it has heard in other healthcare situations.",
      "\u201cThe AI has access to related conversations and then it might think, well, in 10,000 similar conversations, most questions asked X and that has not been asked,\u201d says Mr Maal\u00f8e.",
      "\u201cI imagine GPs have one consultation after another and so have little time to consult with colleagues. It\u2019s giving that colleague advice.\u201d",
      "He also says it can look at the historical data of a patient. \u201cIt could ask, for example, did you remember to ask if the patient is still suffering from pain in the right knee?\u201d",
      "But do patients want technology listening to and recording their conversations?",
      "Mr Maal\u00f8e says \u201cthe data is not leaving system\u201d. He does say it is good practice to inform the patient, though.",
      "\u201cIf the patient contests it, the doctor cannot record. We see few examples of that as the patient can see better documentation.\u201d",
      "Dr Misra-Sharp says she lets patients know she has a listening device to help her take notes. \u201cI haven\u2019t had anyone have a problem with that yet, but if they did, I wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, currently, 1,400 GP practices across England are using the C the Signs, a platform which uses AI to analyse patients\u2019 medical records and check different signs, symptoms and risk factors of cancer, and recommend what action should be taken.",
      "\u201cIt can capture symptoms, such as cough, cold, bloating, and essentially in a minute it can see if there\u2019s any relevant information from their medical history,\u201d says C the Signs chief executive and co-founder Dr Bea Bakshi, who is also a GP.",
      "The AI is trained on published medical research papers.",
      "\u201cFor example, it might say the patient is at risk of pancreatic cancer and would benefit from a pancreatic scan, and then the doctor will decide to refer to those pathways,\u201d says Dr Bakshi. \u201cIt won\u2019t diagnose, but it can facilitate.\u201d",
      "She says they have conducted more than 400,000 cancer risk assessments in a real-world setting, detecting more than 30,000 patients with cancer across more than 50 different cancer types.",
      "An AI report published by the BMA this year found that \u201cAI should be expected to transform, rather than replace, healthcare jobs by automating routine tasks and improving efficiency\u201d.",
      "In a statement, Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, chair of General Practice Committee UK at the BMA, said: \"We recognise that AI has the potential to transform NHS care completely - but if not enacted safely, it could also cause considerable harm. AI is subject to bias and error, can potentially compromise patient privacy and is still very much a work-in-progress.",
      "\"Whilst AI can be used to enhance and supplement what a GP can offer as another tool in their arsenal, it's not a silver bullet. We cannot wait on the promise of AI tomorrow, to deliver the much-needed productivity, consistency and safety improvements needed today.\u201d",
      "How AI uncovers new ways to tackle difficult diseases",
      "AI is trained to spot warning signs in blood tests",
      "Could AI help prevent diabetes-related sight loss?",
      "Alison Dennis, partner and co-head of law firm Taylor Wessing's international life sciences team, warns that GPs need to tread carefully when using AI.",
      "\"There is the very high risk of generative AI tools not providing full and complete, or correct diagnoses or treatment pathways, and even giving wrong diagnoses or treatment pathways i.e. producing hallucinations or basing outputs on clinically incorrect training data,\u201d says Ms Dennis.",
      "\u201cAI tools that have been trained on reliable data sets and then fully validated for clinical use \u2013 which will almost certainly be a specific clinical use, are more suitable in clinical practice.\u201d",
      "She says specialist medical products must be regulated and receive some form of official accreditation.",
      "\u201cThe NHS would also want to ensure that all data that is inputted into the tool is retained securely within the NHS system infrastructure, and is not absorbed for further use by the provider of the tool as training data without the appropriate GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation] safeguards in place.\"",
      "For now, for GPs like Misra-Sharp, it has transformed their work. \u201cIt has made me go back to enjoying my consultations again instead of feeling time pressured.\u201d"

      "Ray, 62 from south London, became one of the first patients to receive the weight-loss jab Wegovy on the NHS last year and has lost 14kg (just over two stone) in five months.",
      "BBC Panorama joined him as he was prescribed his first dose at London's Guy's Hospital, where he was told he would probably need to take the drug all his life to prevent him regaining weight. He said he felt \"blessed\" to be given the drug.",
      "But the NHS spending watchdog NICE has ruled that each patient can only receive Wegovy for two years. And only a tiny proportion of the eligible 3.4 million patients in England are getting access to the drugs.",
      "Prof Naveed Sattar, who leads the UK government's Obesity Healthcare Goals programme, says if everyone eligible was given the drug right away \"it would simply bankrupt the NHS\".",
      "Being overweight is now the norm and nearly one in three adults in England is obese - double the rate of just 30 years ago.",
      "Obesity can be very bad for your health, and treating the complications from it is estimated to cost the NHS across the UK more than \u00a311bn a year.",
      "Wegovy and another drug called Mounjaro can help patients lose about 15 to 20% of their bodyweight, according to trials.",
      "That sort of weight loss can have a dramatic impact on health, and greatly reduce a patient's risk of many conditions, from diabetes to cancer, joint problems and heart disease.",
      "BBC Panorama has been given exclusive access to the weight management service at London's Guy's Hospital, which has begun rolling out Wegovy to a small group of patients who meet the criteria - a body mass index (BMI) of more than 35 and at least one weight-related health complication.",
      "They include care home worker Ray, who weighed 148kg or 23 stone when he began taking Wegovy in July 2024. He has struggled with his weight all his life.",
      "Ray needs two operations, but doctors have said he needs to lose weight first.",
      "With so many patients meeting the criteria, the hospital is prioritising those like Ray who need surgery or who have multiple weight-related health complications.",
      "Here, not only is Ray given the drug, which is taken via weekly injection under the skin, but he gets face-to-face support from doctors and dietitians - advice not always given to those buying the drug privately online.",
      "They stress the jabs do not do all the work and it is important that patients change their lifestyle, and eat healthier food and smaller portions.",
      "Ray is joined at the appointment by one of his daughters, Sophie, who says it would be \"amazing\" if he could reach his goal of losing three stone: \"I wouldn't recognise him. It would be like I have a brand new dad.\"",
      "For now, the drug is available on the NHS in England via these specialist services, mostly in hospitals.",
      "But the chances of getting the drug are low.",
      "Out of more than 130,000 patients eligible for weight-loss drugs in south-east London, the Guy's clinic reckons it can only see about 3,000.",
      "The weight-loss jab that most people know is Ozempic. It has been in huge demand and popularised by celebrities, from Elon Musk to Sharon Osbourne. In fact, it is meant to be for type 2 diabetes.",
      "Wegovy contains the same ingredient, semaglutide, but in different dosages.",
      "Semaglutide mimics a gut hormone that sends signals to our brain telling us we are full. It also slows the transit of food through the stomach.",
      "In trials, patients on Wegovy lost an average of 15% body weight, when combined with lifestyle and dietary advice.",
      "Experts warn the drugs should only be taken under proper medical supervision, because like all medicines they come with side effects, which not all patients can cope with.",
      "These are mostly gastro-intestinal - such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea or constipation - but there are potentially serious complications including inflammation of the pancreas.",
      "To help them cope with the side effects, patients are started on a low dose of the weight-loss jabs, and it is gradually increased, month by month.",
      "Ray is doing well on the drug, eating smaller portions, and after five months there is a visible difference.",
      "At his appointment at Guy's just before Christmas, he weighs 134kg, a weight loss of 14kg or just over two stone.",
      "He is delighted. \"I can't believe the amount of weight I've lost. Every time my daughters see me they say I'm shrinking. It's been a really good journey.\"",
      "Ray says he feels \"lucky\" to have had access to the drug via the NHS, especially now he is a granddad to Willow.",
      "Ray says despite putting many new holes in his belt, his trousers are so loose they are falling off him.",
      "Prof Barbara McGowan, an expert in obesity and diabetes, who runs the weight management service at Guy's is delighted with the progress of patients such as Ray.",
      "She says most clinicians hope that NICE's two-year limit will be removed \"because obesity is a chronic disease and we need to manage it long-term\".",
      "That may not be such an issue now that a second, even more effective drug has been approved by NICE (the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence).",
      "Mounjaro has been dubbed the \"King Kong\" of weight-loss jabs as in a key trial, patients lost an average of 21% of bodyweight over eight months.",
      "Unlike Wegovy, no restriction has been put on how long NHS patients can stay on the drug.",
      "But the NHS is going to roll out the drug over 12 years because of concerns it could overwhelm services.",
      "Over the next three years it is estimated just 220,000 people in England will benefit, out of 3.4 million who are eligible.",
      "Prof Sattar, from Glasgow University, says it is a simple matter of economics: \"The cost of the drugs is still at a level where we cannot afford to treat several million people within the UK with these drugs. It would simply bankrupt the NHS.\"",
      "How do weight loss drugs like Mounjaro and Wegovy work?The Briefing Room: Will new weight loss drugs save or bankrupt the NHS?",
      "How do weight loss drugs like Mounjaro and Wegovy work?",
      "The Briefing Room: Will new weight loss drugs save or bankrupt the NHS?",
      "He estimates it costs the NHS about \u00a33,000 a year to give a patient either Mounjaro or Wegovy.",
      "So if everyone eligible in England received them right now, that would be about \u00a310bn annually - half the entire NHS drugs budget.",
      "Jean, who is 62, hopes Mounjaro will help her to get her weight and health back on track. She shows me a picture of herself on her phone from a decade before, when she was visibly far lighter and healthier.",
      "\"I was a fitness fanatic. I went to the gym practically every day. I don't know what happened, why I fell off the wagon.\"",
      "She believes her relationship with food is \"terrible\". \"I have a lot of food noise and I tend to act on it,\" she says, using a term coined to describe cravings and preoccupation with food.",
      "Jean is eligible for Mounjaro because she has type 2 diabetes and has been injecting insulin for five years.",
      "She is worried about side effects, which are similar to those for Wegovy, but will be carefully monitored at a diabetes clinic in south London linked to Guy's.",
      "Mounjaro helps stabilise blood-sugar levels and boost the body's natural production of insulin.",
      "After just five weeks on the drug, Jean is able to stop her insulin. She is delighted: \"I think it's Mounjaro, and willpower as well - I have to give myself some credit.\u202f I think the drug silences the food noise and I'm not constantly sitting around thinking about what I'm going to eat.\"",
      "After two months on the drug, Jean is back in the gym, and has lost more than 3kg (half a stone).",
      "She is disappointed in her weight loss, but determined to shed more pounds as her Mounjaro dose is increased.",
      "But Jean and the other patients getting Wegovy and Mounjaro on the NHS are the minority.",
      "Prof Sattar reckons more than nine in 10 patients currently on weight-loss drugs in the UK are paying for them privately.",
      "He points out that obesity rates are highest in areas of social deprivation.",
      "\"The people perhaps who stand to benefit the most, who are less affluent and from more deprived communities, are simply not able to afford this drug. It's not fair. It's just a reality of the economics of the situation.\"",
      "But Prof Sattar told me that rising obesity levels could also eventually \"bankrupt\" the NHS.",
      "With smoking levels continuing to fall, he now regards excess weight and obesity as the \"major driver, bar none, of long-term multiple health conditions\".",
      "Both he and Prof McGowan believe that weight-loss jabs have an important role to play and could eventually bring some wider savings.",
      "Prof McGowan says Ray is a good example: \"We treat a lot of the complications associated with obesity. Ray has pre-diabetes. We're hoping to go into remission and therefore prevent all the complications associated with that progressive disease.",
      "\"He might need joint surgery but achieving weight loss can prevent a lot of complications and ultimately save the NHS a lot of money.\"",
      "Prof Sattar says in 10 years there could be 20 weight-loss drugs on the market, including some in tablet form. As more effective and cheaper drugs become available, they could produce savings for the NHS, he says.",
      "The UK government also thinks weight-loss drugs could eventually bring wider economic benefits.",
      "A five-year trial in Manchester will look at the wider impact of Mounjaro beyond the individual health benefits, including whether it helps some people struggling with obesity to get back into work.",
      "The drugs are not a magic bullet for obesity, but after decades of expanding waistlines, they offer hope to millions.",
      "For now, though, the health service doesn't have the resources to treat all those eligible. It means - for years to come - only a minority like Ray will get access on the NHS. The rest will have to pay - or go without.",

      "This is the sort of conversation doctors and nurses are having in hospitals up and down the country as a severe flu season puts the NHS under pressure.",
      "More than a dozen hospitals have declared critical incidents - including some of those considered among the best in the country.",
      "Earlier this week, the BBC visited Warwick Hospital. It is run by the South Warwickshire trust, which is one of the top rated in the country and has prided itself on the smooth running of its four hospitals.",
      "But the caseload has been overwhelming this week.",
      "Warwick Hospital has 375 beds and at one point the predicted demand was almost 100 more than that. For the first time ever, it's had to declare a critical incident - the highest alert level in the NHS.",
      "The BBC was there when hospital administrators made the call. Declaring a critical incident is a warning to the local health system that things are getting bad. Often, it frees up hospitals to redeploy doctors and create new temporary ward space.",
      "Over a two-day period, the BBC saw doctors and nurses doing just that: finding stop-gap solutions to treat patients in whatever safe settings could be established.",
      "With emergency departments overflowing, sick people need to be treated in the chairs they're sitting in.",
      "Others have had to wait in ambulances parked outside emergency units for hours before they could even be taken inside.",

      "Back in the emergency department, doctors, nurses and consultants discuss how to make space for new arrivals.",
      "Beds are at an absolute premium in the hospital. So many patients have arrived that a room near the ambulance entrance has been set up for people considered \"fit to sit\".",
      "Every chair is occupied.",
      "\"It isn't ideal,\" one doctor says. \"But it is safe.\"",

      "Dr Paw tells us: \"The people that come in now are sicker than they used to be. And here we are, trying to get them out quicker.\"",
      "He then moves on to a man who was admitted for a heart attack two days ago but is no longer receiving active treatment. Can he safely be moved, Dr Paw wonders.",
      "\"These are the decisions we're being forced to make,\" he tells the BBC.",

      "A surge in cases of the flu-like human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in China has raised fears of another Covid-style pandemic.",
      "Images of hospitals overrun with masked patients have circulated widely on social media, but health experts say HMPV is not like Covid, and point out it has been around for many years.",
      "They say China and other countries are simply experiencing the seasonal increase in HMPV typically seen in winter.",
      "What is HMPV, what are the symptoms, and how does it spread?",
      "First identified in the Netherlands in 2001, HMPV spreads through direct contact between people, or when someone touches a contaminated surface.",
      "The virus leads to a mild upper respiratory tract infection for most people.",

      "Why are HMPV cases rising in China?",
      "Like many respiratory infections, HMPV is most active during late winter and spring.",
      "This is because viruses survive better in the cold, and can pass more easily from one person to another as people spend more time indoors with closed windows.",
      "In northern China, the current HMPV spike coincides with low temperatures that are expected to last until March.",

      "It said Chinese authorities have confirmed that the health care system is not overwhelmed and there have been no emergency declarations or responses to date.",

      "However its latest data shows the percentage of people testing positive for the disease rose sharply in the third week of December and remained at that higher level the following week.",
      "But the UKHSA says this is completely in line with normal seasonal trends, and the level of the disease being seen in GP surgeries and hospitals is as expected.",
      "Is there any chance of another Covid-like pandemic?",
      "Fears of a Covid-style pandemic are overblown, experts say, noting that such events are typically caused by new viruses, which is not the case with HMPV.",
      "The disease is already globally present and has been around for decades. This means people across the world have \"some degree of existing immunity due to previous exposure\", Dr Hsu said.",
      "\"Almost every child will have at least one infection with HMPV by their fifth birthday and we can expect to go onto to have multiple reinfections throughout life,\" said Paul Hunter, a medical professor at University of East Anglia in England.",

      "Badenoch has been demanding a national inquiry into grooming gangs, but has faced criticism after reports she had so far failed to meet any victims.",
      "On Monday, the Labour MP for Rotherham, Sarah Champion, joined calls for a public inquiry, saying it was required to \"restore faith in our safeguarding systems\".",

      "Rotherham MP Champion backs national grooming inquiry",
      "MPs vote against Tory call for new grooming gangs inquiry",
      "Speaking to GB News on Monday evening, Badenoch said she was \"going to do everything, and the Conservative Party is going to do everything, to make sure that you [survivors] get justice\".",
      "Pressed on why the previous Conservative government had not commissioned an inquiry into grooming gangs, she said: \"I think we thought that the inquiries that we'd started would be enough.\"",
      "\"I thought 'oh, there's an inquiry taking place, let's see what it comes out with,' and what we've seen is that we've had multiple non-national inquiries. They are not enough. Let's do more,\" she said.",
      "Badenoch said she believed a new national inquiry should look at a \"systematic pattern of behaviour\" among certain communities in the country.",
      "It is \"people very, very poor, sort of peasant background \u2013 very, very rural, almost cut off from even the home origin countries that they might have been in,\" she said. \"They're not necessarily first generation,\" she added.",
      "She said a \"culture of silence\" in the state needed to be addressed.",
      "Between 1997 and 2013, several areas of the country - including Oldham and Rotherham - were blighted by gangs of men, predominantly of Pakistani descent, who raped and trafficked children as young as 11.",
      "An independent report, published by Prof Alexis Jay in 2014, estimated 1,400 girls had been abused in Rotherham.",
      "She would later go on to lead a national review into child sexual abuse, which lasted seven years and made 20 recommendations when it was published in 2022.",
      "Prof Jay has previously said victims want to see action on her recommendations, rejecting the calls for a fresh probe.",
      "There have also been a series of local reviews into child sex abuse in Manchester, Rochdale and Oldham, which were published between 2020 and 2024 and found authorities had failed to protect children from sexual exploitation by gangs of predominantly Asian men.",
      "In recent weeks, the Conservatives and Reform UK have been calling for a new national inquiry into grooming gangs.",
      "Earlier this month, the Tories failed in a bid to force a fresh national investigation by amending a government education bill.",
      "When asked whether the reason that a national inquiry had not been called was because politicians could be implicated in a cover-up, and whether the Labour Party was resisting an investigation, Badenoch said that it was \"certainly something that we have to look at\".",
      "\"I am not afraid, the Conservative Party is under new leadership. What we did before to tackle it is clearly not enough, we need to do a lot more, and Labour needs to get on board with that.\"",
      "Champion, the Labour MP for Rochdale, has called for a national statutory inquiry into grooming gangs, with councils leading the investigations.",
      "Under the model suggested by Champion, the Home Office would act as a central \"hub,\" setting terms and empowering councils to compel testimony, while local \"spokes\" would lead inquiries and send findings for a national report.",
      "Champion, who has been campaigning on child protection for over a decade, said: \"I have long believed that we need to fully understand the nature of this crime and the failures in the response of public bodies if we are to truly protect children.\"",
      "Speaking to BBC Breakfast, she argued locally-run investigations had uncovered child sexual abuse, but have \"been missing\" the power to compel witnesses to testify and hold offenders accountable.",
      "'Range of views'",
      "Two other Labour figures from places affected - Rochdale MP Paul Waugh and Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham - have also called for limited new inquiries.",
      "But Downing Street has said its priority is to implement the recommendations of Prof Jay's national review in 2022.",
      "Last week, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said one of the key proposals from the report - for workers in certain roles to face mandatory requirements to report abuse - would be added to the Crime and Policing Bill.",
      "Number 10 said on Monday that there would be a \"range of views\" on the issue of a new inquiry, and the government would be \"guided and led by the victims and survivors\".",
      "Security Minister Dan Jarvis said he understood why colleagues were calling for a new national inquiry, but argued the government's priority was \"delivering the justice that these victims deserve\".",
      "He told BBC Breakfast: \"We think the best and most timely way to do that is to do the work that the previous government were not able to do of implementing the findings of Prof Alexis Jay's report.\""

    "story": [
      "UK laws on internet safety are \"very uneven\" and \"unsatisfactory\", Technology Secretary Peter Kyle has said, following calls from campaigners to tighten the rules.",
      "On Saturday, Ian Russell, the father of Molly Russell, who took her own life at 14 after seeing harmful content online, said the UK was \"going backwards\" on the issue.",
      "In a letter to the PM, Mr Russell argued that the Online Safety Act, which aims to force tech giants to take more responsibility for their sites' content, needed fixing and said a \"duty of care\" should be imposed on the firms.",
      "Speaking to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, Kyle expressed his \"frustration\" with the Act, which was passed by the previous Conservative government in 2023.",
      "The Conservative government had originally included in the legislation plans to compel social media companies to remove some \"legal-but-harmful\" content, such as posts promoting eating disorders.",
      "However the proposal triggered a backlash from critics, including the current Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who were concerned it could lead to censorship.",
      "In July 2022, Badenoch, who was not then a minister, said the bill was in \"no fit state to become law\" adding: \"We should not be legislating for hurt feelings.\"",
      "Another Conservative MP, David Davis, said it risked \"the biggest accidental curtailment of free speech in modern history\".",
      "The plan was dropped for adult social media users and instead companies were required to give users more control to filter out content they did not want to see. The law still expects companies to protect children from legal-but-harmful content.",
      "Kyle said the section on legal-but-harmful content had been taken out of the bill adding: \"So I inherited a landscape where we have a very uneven, unsatisfactory legislative settlement.\"",
      "He did not commit to making changes to the current legislation but said he was \"very open-minded\" on the subject.",
      "He also said the act contained some \"very good powers\" he was using to \"assertively\" tackle new safety concerns and that in the coming months ministers would get the powers to make sure online platforms were providing age-appropriate content.",
      "Companies that did not comply with the law would face \"very strident\" sanctions, he said.",
      "Following the interview, a Whitehall source told the BBC the government was not planning to repeal the Online Safety Act, or pass a second act, but to work within what ministers believe are its limitations.",
      "Ministers are not ruling out further legislation but wanted \"to be agile and quick\" to keep up with fast-moving trends, a source said.",
      "How can you keep children safe online?",
      "Molly Russell's dad warns UK 'going backwards' on online safety and urges PM to act",
      "Facebook and Instagram get rid of fact checkers",
      "In his letter, Ian Russell argued that \"ominous\" changes in the tech industry put greater pressure on the government to act.",
      "He said Mark Zuckerberg, the boss of Meta which owns Facebook and Instagram, and Elon Musk, owner of the social media site X, were \"at the leading edge of a wholesale recalibration of the industry\".",
      "He accused Zuckerberg of moving away from safety towards a \"laissez-faire, anything-goes model\" and \"back towards the harmful content that Molly was exposed to\".",
      "Earlier this week, Zuckerberg said Meta would be getting rid of fact checkers, and instead adopt a system \u2013 already introduced by X - of allowing users to add \"community notes\" to social media posts they deemed to be untrue.",
      "This marked a change from Meta's previous approach, introduced in 2016, whereby third party moderators would check posts on Facebook and Instagram that appeared to be false or misleading.",
      "Content flagged as inaccurate would be moved lower in users' feeds and accompanied by labels offering viewers more information on the subject.",
      "Defending the new system, Zuckerberg said moderators were \"too politically biased\" and it was \"time to get back to our roots around free expression\".",
      "The step comes as Meta seeks to improve relations with incoming US President Donald Trump who has previously accused the company of censoring right-wing voices.",
      "Zuckerberg said the change - which only applies in the US - would mean content moderators would \"catch less bad stuff\" but would also reduce the number of \"innocent\" posts being removed.",
      "Responding to Russell's criticism, a Meta spokesperson told the BBC there was \"no change to how we treat content that encourages suicide, self-injury, and eating disorders\" and said the company would \"continue to use our automated systems to scan for that high-severity content\".",
      "Asked about the change, Kyle said the announcement was \"an American statement for American service users\" adding: \"There is one thing that has not changed and that is the law of this land.\"",
      "\"If you come and operate in this country you abide by the law, and the law says illegal content must be taken down,\" he said.",
      "Rules in the Online Safety Act, due to come into force later this year, compel social media firms to show that they are removing illegal content - such as child sexual abuse, material inciting violence and posts promoting or facilitating suicide.",
      "The law also says companies have to protect children from harmful material including pornography, material promoting self-harm, bullying and content encouraging dangerous stunts.",
      "Platforms will be expected to adopt \"age assurance technologies\" to prevent children from seeing harmful content.",
      "The law also requires companies to take action against illegal, state-sponsored disinformation. If their services are likely to be accessed by children they should also take steps to protect users against misinformation."

      "Ian Russell, who backed the previous government bringing in new requirements for tech firms in the Online Safety Act, calls the way the regulator Ofcom is implementing the rules a \"disaster\".",
      "In a letter to Sir Keir Starmer on Saturday, seen by the BBC, Mr Russell says there is \"widespread dismay\" among bereaved families who have fought for tougher protections, and that more young people have lost their lives because of \"dither and delay\".",
      "And he warns that without tougher actions, \"the streams of life-sucking content seen by children will soon become torrents: a digital disaster driven by the actions of tech firms, and being left unchallenged by a failing regulatory model\".",
      "\"This preventable harm would be happening on your watch,\" he writes to Sir Keir.",

Along with other bereaved parents we have met in the past couple of years - including Esther Ghey, Judy Thomas, and Mariano Janin - he has told his family's story with huge dignity, and for a simple reason: he doesn't want anyone else to go through the pain.",

The Internet Watch Foundation boss, Derek Ray-Hill, also told us: \"Unless Ofcom is more ambitious in its interpretation of the Act, so many of the things the legislation makes possible will remain frustratingly out of reach.\"",
      "There is a sense in Whitehall of \"wait and see\". Ministers have acknowledged that as technology advances, extra laws might be required. The Home Office is expected in the next couple of weeks to outline new offences to tackle child abuse online.

      "Dear Prime Minister,",
      "Six months ago, you were elected on a platform that promised an end to short-term sticking plaster solutions. I am writing to you as a bereaved father and online safety campaigner because it is evident that urgent action is required to protect young people from the horrors they are routinely exposed to online.",
      "It's now over seven years since the death of my youngest daughter Molly. More than ever before, I am convinced that strong and effective online safety regulation is the most powerful tool available to prevent the loss of ever more young lives at the hands of social media platforms whose indifference to children's safety is fundamentally baked into their commercial strategies, business models and products.",
      "However, in recent months it has become clear that progress towards online safety has stalled \u2013 and we are now going backwards. Regulation as it is currently designed is failing to deliver the protection that children and parents need, want and deserve. No one can credibly claim that Ofcom's implementation of the Online Safety Act is anything other than a disaster \u2013 a view not only shared widely by civil society but also increasingly privately shared across many parts of your Government.",
      "Ofcom's choices when implementing the Act have starkly highlighted intrinsic structural weaknesses with the legislative framework. We not only have a regulator which has fundamentally failed to grasp the urgency and scale of its mission, but a regulatory model that inherently and significantly constrains its ability to reduce preventable harms.",
      "While I understand that this is legislation you inherited and did not design, the reality is that unless you now commit to act decisively to fix the Online Safety Act, the streams of life-sucking content seen by children will soon become torrents: a digital disaster driven by the actions of tech firms, and being left unchallenged by a failing regulatory model. This preventable harm would be happening on your watch.",
      "At the same time as the UK's overdue regulation is falling badly short, the very industry being regulated is ominously changing. The Online Safety Act was developed around a premise that large tech firms would increasingly accept their responsibilities, and we would see safer social networks develop over time.",
      "However, this is a time when platforms readily say they will now 'catch less of the bad stuff'; allow underdeveloped AI to generate and spread disinformation; and promote targeted and polarising content leading to isolation and despair. We have now entered a different era, and we will need a different regulatory approach that can address it.",
      "Put simply, people like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk are at the leading edge of a wholesale recalibration of the industry. We should be in absolutely no doubt that when Zuckerberg speaks about a 'cultural tipping point towards prioritizing speech', he is signalling a profound strategic shift away from fundamental safety measures towards a laissez-faire, anything goes model. In this bonfire of digital ethics and online safety features, all of us will lose, but our children lose the most.",
      "It's on that basis that I now encourage you to act swiftly and decisively to address this coming flood of preventable harm. In the immediate term, that means strengthening the existing framework. Beyond that, it means committing to substantially strengthened regulatory model \u2013 with primary legislation being introduced as soon as possible to enact its provisions.",
      "It is not just a new Online Safety Act that is required, but a wholesale re-imagining of the framework to ensure it is capable of responding to the threats of today and beyond. A new framework must be fundamentally oriented towards tackling the reckless behaviours of social media leadership \u2013 a goal which can best be achieved through establishing an overarching Duty of Care supported by a robust set of conduct-based rules to enforce it.",
      "A bolstered OSA must have harm reduction at its core. That means having a clear harm reduction duty on Ofcom, transparency and safety-by-design as integral components of the regulatory regime, and a regulatory design that puts victims at its core \u2013 a major failure of the current regime, where the asymmetry between the interests of victims and industry has if anything been substantially reinforced. The voices of those with lived experience must be heard clearly if big tech's powerful players are not to shout them down in this debate.",
      "Crucially, this must also mean an extension of the Duty of Candour to extend to tech firms. This vital measure stands to correct the historic injustices faced by so many victims, and the power of this measure to address the cultural issues driving harms in the tech sector \u2013 and the asymmetry between industry and victims which perpetuates further harm \u2013 would be considerable.",

    "story": [
      "When David Lammy is asked about the new government's relations with the incoming US administration, he likes to talk about the dinner he and the prime minister had with Donald Trump in New York last September.",
      "\"We had a very good meal,\" the foreign secretary said on Thursday. \"We had a long time to discuss the issues. He was an extremely gracious host, very affable, very warm indeed about our great country.\"",
      "And throughout a series of media interviews, briefings and a speech at the Foreign Office, Lammy talked up UK-US relations, even daring to speak of a \"special relationship\", a phrase largely avoided by diplomats on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "The UK and the US, he said, were \"required to work very closely together\" on global challenges.",
      "They include challenges such as the wars in Europe and the Middle East and what he called \"the growing problems in Sudan\". He cited the \"close cooperation\" between both countries on military and intelligence matters.",
      "But what was striking was how far the foreign secretary was willing to challenge Trump only days before his inauguration.",
      "The president-elect's refusal to rule out military action against Greenland was, Lammy said, an example of his \"destabilising\" rhetoric.",
      "His language was more measured than that of French and German politicians and he said Trump was focused on Arctic security - but he insisted such an attack by one member of Nato on another was \"simply not going to happen\".",
      "He said Trump was right to ask Europe to do more to defend itself but questioned his call for Nato members to spend 5% of their national income on defence, noting the US was itself spending only 3.38 %.",
      "Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier in the day, Lammy had cast doubt on Trump's campaign promise of a quick ceasefire in Ukraine.",
      "\"I see no evidence that Putin wants to come to the table to negotiate,\" he said.",
      "\"I think the indications are, from what I've seen over the last few days, a slight pushback on this sense that somehow a deal will be achieved on 21 January, I think that's now unlikely. And we're hearing that actually the timetable's moved down somewhat towards Easter.\"",
      "Musk looms large over UK politics as MPs return for 2025",
      "How Elon Musk seized on baseless memo claim to fuel wave of misinformation",
      "Lammy played down the influence of Elon Musk, the wealthy ally of Trump who in recent days has personally attacked British ministers on X. He said the tech boss would have only a \"domestic portfolio\" in the new administration and his role had not come up in talks between British and Trump officials.",
      "The foreign secretary also emphasised the need to engage with China \u2013 on trade, climate, health and artificial intelligence - and urged the country \"not to throw in its lot\" with Russia. This position is at odds with that held by Trump allies who see China already as a key member of an anti-Western axis including Russia, Iran and North Korea.",
      "Lammy calls his approach to foreign policy \"progressive realism\". He said this means seeking progressive ends while accepting the world as it is.",
      "When applying this framework to Trump, he said he will be guided more by the president-elect's actions than his rhetoric. We shall learn in coming days how far the two remain apart.",
      "And as for that dinner with Trump last autumn, Lammy rarely mentions the fact the meal was almost the cause of a diplomatic upset.",
      "He and Sir Keir Starmer were presented with large plates of Guyanese chicken, somewhat to the dismay of the vegetarian prime minister.",
      "In the national interest, the foreign secretary was obliged to eat more chicken that night than he might have expected."

      "Remember too Sir Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves are the duo that best personify the Labour project of the 2020s; the party's revival and return, grounded in being trusted on the economy.",
      "And yet the markets are collectively passing a verdict on Starmer and Reeves's economic plan right now and it isn't exactly a ringing endorsement \u2013 and wobbly markets can prompt political wobbles.",
      "These shouldn't be overstated, but neither should they be ignored.",
      "What we're witnessing is the brutal slog of government playing out; an unforgiving backdrop of economic flatlining, which critics say ministers have made worse.",

      "Cue a number of excitable headlines before Downing Street said it did indeed intend to keep Reeves in post as chancellor for the rest of this parliament.",
      "Folk in No 10 regarded the exchanges as absurd, given how close Starmer and Reeves have been for years and how intertwined their political fates are.",
      "They each have to hope that the markets settle down, that the cost of government borrowing falls and so the prospect of very difficult decisions recede.",

      "Even by the standards of the Reform UK party, it has been an interesting few weeks.",
      "In December, its leader Nigel Farage flew to Florida to meet Elon Musk, the multi-billionaire, where they discussed a possible donation.",
      "On Boxing Day, it announced its membership figures had surpassed those of the Conservatives. There was then a spat with Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch over whether those numbers were correct.",

      "Reform UK members gathering on an icily cold Friday evening at Sandown Racecourse for the party's South East conference weren't disheartened by the possible loss of a rich and influential backer.",

      "Musk hasn't explained his reasoning, but Farage said the pair had a disagreement because Musk wanted Reform to \"come out strongly in support\" of Tommy Robinson.",
      "Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, is currently serving an 18-month prison sentence for contempt of court.",
      "The former head of the far-right English Defence League admitted in court to breaching an injunction against repeating claims about a Syrian refugee schoolboy after losing a 2021 libel case.",

      "She says she is a realist and acknowledges that Reform might \"disappear into the wilderness\" but for now she says it is \"the only party that gives me hope to go out in the morning\".",
      "As the evening progresses, news emerges about the 10 Reform UK councillors in Derbyshire who resigned, arguing the party was being run in an \"increasingly autocratic manner\" and had \"lost its sense of direction\" since Farage took over.",
      "Farage later told BBC Newsnight the group were a \"rogue branch\" of the party who had not \"passed vetting\".",
      "The group's leader, Councillor Alex Stevenson, who was suspended as a member in December, and who stood for Reform UK in Amber Valley in the general election, did not deny that some of the candidates he put forward for local elections had not passed the party's vetting process.",
      "There is no mention of the resignations at the conference, instead members are invited to cheer two councillor defections from the Conservatives to Reform.",
      "And there is little public sign of discontent with Farage, although one member whispers his unease.",
      "Preferring not to be named, (\"I don't want to be thrown out\") he says, \"Farage doesn't necessarily have what is needed\".",
      "\"He's quite egotistical. Rupert Lowe would be my preference. He's been hard at work, asking questions in Parliament. Nigel isn't around as much.\"",
      "On Robinson, he suggests Farage \"shouldn't be quite so critical\".",
      "Rupert Lowe, the MP for Great Yarmouth, isn't a household name but it is one that crops up unprompted throughout the evening.",

      "Reform UK was originally called the Brexit Party but these days Brexit only gets a few mentions.",
      "The big themes include opposition to net-zero policies, support for a national inquiry into grooming gangs, the economy and the possible postponement of local elections in May.",

      "Blogger Liza Martin-Pope says it is why she decided to attend the conference this evening adding: \"I'm missing my dancing for this.\"",

      "They are new members, new to politics and Caroline says she puts the chances of Farage being prime minister after the next election at 10 out of 10.",
      "The party has prospered because of dissatisfaction with the Conservatives and disappointment with the early signs from Labour, says Luke Tryl from the research group More In Common, with ratings up from around 15 to 20%. But a general election is years away.",
      "Whether the party can go from five MPs in 2024 to government remains to be seen, but whatever happens, it's clear there are party members still enthused by Reform's offer."

    "summary": "Why Rachel Reeves needs a more detailed growth strategy - and soon.",
    "story": [
      "It has not been a good week for Chancellor Rachel Reeves.",
      "Government borrowing costs have hit their highest level in 16 years and the pound has fallen to a 14-month low against the dollar.",
      "She has gone on a planned trip to China amid accusations from opposition parties that she is leaving at a moment of economic peril.",
      "Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey is accompanying her on the trip. The 12-hour flight to Beijing is probably the length of the meeting she might have wanted to have with him.",
      "So how serious are the recent movements on the markets and what could happen as a result?",
      "Budget plans need to be tweaked",
      "While the markets stabilised from Thursday lunchtime, the move against UK government debt is already enough to cause a problem for the chancellor's Budget maths.",
      "Reeves has pledged not to borrow to fund day-to-day spending and to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament. The Treasury has said these fiscal rules, set out in the Budget, are \"non-negotiable\".",
      "At times over the past week the markets have looked pretty fragile for Britain, with both government borrowing costs going up and sterling falling back at the same time. That is a key marker.",
      "While it's true that the overall direction for the markets over the past month has been set by an assessment of the inflationary consequences of President-elect Trump's trade and economic policies, the UK has been getting some special attention in addition.",
      "It risks being tarred with both the inflationary stickiness of the US, and the stagnant growth of the eurozone - the worst of both worlds.",
      "That said, it is important to be precise about the extent of the problem. The extra cost of servicing the national debt at these interest rates would be several billion pounds a year - i.e. material enough to require some sort of correction in the Budget maths, but doable, and the clear message this week is that \"it will be done\".",
      "No impact on mortgages so far",
      "The impact on budgetary maths is real, but the wider impact that might be expected - of higher borrowing costs for companies and for households - has not yet materialised.",
      "The mortgage market has yet to see an increase in rates for fixed-term mortgages, as occurred rapidly in the panic after the 2022 mini-Budget. There is a curious calm.",
      "One explanation lies in what is not happening. This time last year the major lenders greatly discounted mortgages in a battle for market share ahead of the key moments for house buying. This has not happened this year, and may yet have a consequence in the property market.",
      "The Bank of England has indicated it will continue with interest rate cuts this year. The markets think there may be far fewer than previously expected, perhaps only one, leaving base interest rates at 4.5%.",
      "Many economists say this is the wrong call, and believe rates will be cut multiple times. There's quite a lot of uncertainty here, and the key Bank of England committee is split. The Bank's words will be very carefully watched.",
      "More positively for the economy, despite a lot of rhetoric from retailers, many have delivered strong results and have not lowered their profits expectations. Are consumers a bit more robust than had been assumed, and could this drive some growth in 2025?",
      "Why are UK borrowing costs rising and what does it mean for me?",
      "Why are UK borrowing costs rising and what does it mean for me?",
      "Growth strategy needs a reboot",
      "The problem of servicing higher interest payments on the national debt increases the likelihood of the Treasury making plans for an adjustment, based on a squeeze on spending. A \u00a310bn cut will hurt, but with a majority of 170 MPs in the House of Commons, and an ongoing spending review already in train, it can be done.",
      "In these circumstances, with the credible threat of a global trade war, for example, it should be noted that Rachel Reeves' new fiscal rules do have an escape hatch.",
      "In the event of \"an emergency or a significant negative economic shock to the economy\" the chancellor may \"temporarily suspend the fiscal mandate\".",
      "While a global trade war could qualify, it would be difficult optics to suspend a \"non-negotiable\" and \"iron-clad\" set of rules before they had really bitten. The rules have not yet formally passed into law yet either, and remain a \"draft\" until the Commons votes to approve them.",
      "It seems very unlikely that this route will be taken unless there is a very clear economic shock in the coming weeks.",
      "The bigger point here is what matters in the markets, which is whether the UK is pursuing a credible set of policies, a convincing overall strategy.",
      "Labour's focus on stability at all costs was understandable after the humiliation of Liz Truss's mini-Budget. But \"stability\" is not a growth strategy.",
      "Pursuing green growth by borrowing for long-term capital investment is a potential strategy, and it underpinned \"Bidenomics\" in the US. The incoming government embraced the rhetoric of US policy under the outgoing president, without the same firepower. \"Bidenomics without the money\", you might say.",
      "But now the new Trump administration is jettisoning this approach, rightly or wrongly, and the markets are less convinced that such a strategy will pay for itself. It will cost more to fund such a strategy, and require harsher trade-offs than expected.",

      "Why is this happening and how does it affect you?",
      "What's happening in the bond markets?",
      "A bond is a bit like an IOU that can be traded in the financial markets.",
      "Governments generally spend more than they raise in tax so they borrow money to fill the gap, usually by selling bonds to investors.",
      "As well as eventually paying back the value of the bond, governments pay interest at regular intervals so investors receive a stream of future payments.",
      "UK government bonds - known as \"gilts\" - are normally considered very safe, with little risk the money will not be repaid. They are mainly bought by financial institutions, such as pension funds.",
      "Interest rates - known as the yield -  on government bonds have been going up since around August.",
      "The yield on a 10-year bond has surged to its highest level since 2008, while the yield on a 30-year bond is at its highest since 1998, meaning it costs the government more to borrow over the long term.",
      "The pound has also fallen in value against the dollar over the past few days. On 7 January it was worth $1.25 but it has now fallen to just above $1.21.",
      "Why are bond yields rising?",
      "Yields are rising not just in the UK. Borrowing costs have also been going up in the US, Japan, Germany and France, for instance.",
      "There is a great deal of uncertainty around what will happen when President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House later this month. He has pledged to bring in tariffs on goods entering the US and to cut taxes.",

      "However, the dollar is also rising against all currencies - not just the pound.",
      "The US economy created more jobs than forecast last month which has added to expectations that US rates will remain higher than previously forecast, and this has helped to push up the value of the dollar.",
      "How does it affect me?",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has pledged that all day-to-day spending should be  funded from taxes, not from borrowing.",
      "But if she needs more money to pay back higher borrowing costs, that uses up more tax revenue, leaving less money to spend on other things.",
      "Economists have warned that this could mean spending cuts which would affect public services, and tax rises that could hit people's pay or businesses' ability to grow and hire more people.",
      "The government has committed to having only one fiscal event a year, where it can raise taxes, and this is not expected until the autumn.",

      "With that in mind, the BBC has created a new online tool for tracking the government's progress towards this key goal.",
      "Type in your postcode and see the house building situation in your own area.",
      "The government has also set annual housing targets for each local authority in England, based on what it judges their contribution to the overall total should be.",

      "It did, however, approve 89% of planning applications for housing in the year to June 2024, considerably higher than the national rate of 71%.",
      "Portsmouth, on the south coast, also has a very stretching target. The local council is being asked to deliver 1,021 new homes per year, almost nine times the 120 it delivered on average over the most recent three years.",
      "Hastings has been tasked with a smaller total: 710. But this is still five times the 142 it has delivered on average in recent years.",
      "Portsmouth approved 74% of residential planning applications in the year to June 2024 and Hastings 75%.",
      "Councils were consulted on the targets last summer, with many expressing concerns they were \"unrealistic\", and the numbers were revised.",

      "Councillor Darren Sanders, cabinet member for housing at Portsmouth City Council, said the target \"does not work\" because \"most of the city is an island\" with a dense population and \"important heritage and natural assets\".",
      "\"Portsmouth has approved more than 4,000 new homes in 2023 and 2024. Any lack of delivery is down to the rising cost of development,\" he said, \"not whether the council approves them.\"",
      "Sevenoaks councillor Julia Thornton said it was a \"top priority\" to protect greenbelt land, but added: \"We will have a duty to do everything possible to meet the government's new housing targets.\"",

      "The Construction Industry Training Board estimates the sector needs to attract the equivalent of 50,300 extra workers per year to meet the levels of work expected.",
      "There are also concerns about the availability of basic building materials including bricks and timber.",
      "The Construction Leadership Council has warned a shortage of these could hinder the government's ability to get near its target.",
      "Finally, many housing experts doubt private housebuilders are capable of delivering enough new homes each year to reach the targets.",
      "This is because private housebuilders have a commercial interest in not building so many new homes that their average price declines.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority concluded in February 2024  \"private developers produce houses at a rate at which they can be sold without needing to reduce their prices\".",
      "A sharp decline in residential planning permissions in England in the year to June 2024 - hitting a new record low - was due to a collapse in applications from private builders, not a decline in the share of applications being approved by local authorities.",
      "This collapse in applications probably reflected the impact of still-high mortgage interest rates and high house prices relative to average incomes, undermining the ability of people to afford newly built houses.",
      "That's why some argue meeting the government's targets will also require a major increase in Whitehall grants to not-for-profit local housing associations, enabling them to build tens of thousands of new social and affordable homes, mainly to be rented out, in the coming years.",
      "Interactive tool developed by Allison Shultes, Scott Jarvis and Steven Connor",
      "About the data",

      "The targets are the government's new \"local housing need\" calculations, released following a public consultation.",
      "Planning statistics are taken from quarterly data and combine applications decided for \"minor\" housing developments (fewer than 10 homes) and \"major\" schemes (10 homes or more).",
      "The planning data for England is at local authority level. Applications decided by special authorities, such as those in charge of national parks, are not included.",

    "published": "Wed, 08 Jan 2025 13:33:31 GMT",
    "summary": "The Chancellor may face the prospect of breaking her own Budget rules",
    "story": [
      "Economists have warned that the government is \"on course\" to miss its own Budget borrowing targets after interest rates for UK long-term borrowing rose to their highest levels this century.",
      "The official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), will start the process of updating its forecast next month to be presented to parliament in late March.",
      "The rising cost of borrowing means \"there is a significant chance that the OBR will judge that the Chancellor Rachel Reeves is on course to miss her main fiscal rule\", according to Ruth Gregory from Capital Economics.",
      "The yield on the 30-year gilt reached 5.35% on Wednesday, surpassing a previous high in August 1998.",
      "Meanwhile, the yield on a 10 year bond surged on Wednesday to its highest since October 2008, to reach 4.784%.",
      "The government generally spends more than it raises in tax. To fill this gap it borrows money, but that has to be paid back - with interest.",
      "One of the ways it can borrow money is by selling financial products called bonds.",
      "A bond is a promise to pay money in the future. Most require the borrower to make regular interest payments.",
      "UK government bonds - known as \"gilts\" - are normally considered very safe, with little risk the money will not be repaid.",
      "Gilts are mainly bought by financial institutions in the UK and abroad, such as pension funds, investment funds, banks and insurance companies.",
      "How does the government borrow money?",
      "Servicing the current national debt in the UK is forecast to take up 7% of total public spending, but that forecast was based on lower government borrowing rates.",
      "No.10 said there was \"no doubt about the government's commitment to economic stability\" and \"meeting our fiscal rules is non-negotiable\" saying that only the OBR's forecast is an accurate predication of the government's room for manoeuvre.",
      "The clear indication from the government is that although they will not hold another Budget in March, any necessary adjustment would have to come in terms of some new spending cuts.",
      "On Tuesday morning, a \u00a32bn auction of 30 year UK government debt sold at an effective interest rate of 5.18%.",
      "The Debt Management Office, a part of Treasury, effectively paid the highest interest rates for these very long term loans that have been since 1998.",
      "Eyebrows raised over issuance",
      "The markets are raising their eyebrows about debts around the world, and in particular the level of issuance of bonds from countries such as the UK and the US, and additionally, the likelihood of sticky, above target inflation.",
      "Thirty-year debt such as this does not have a direct pass through into borrowing rates for households and companies. This type of debt is more of a specialist instrument used by pension funds. But today's auction shines a light on an uptick of borrowing rates over the past month.",
      "The more general gilt market move, has not yet significantly changed fixed mortgage rates for example. But if it continues, as is plausible, for the next month or so it will impact the OBR's new forecast.",
      "The rise in rates has affected the US and the UK more, and less so continental Europe. The tick-up in UK market rates after the Budget, initially faded by early December. But now British borrowing rates are moving up alongside US ones.",
      "Stagnant growth and sticky inflation have raised concerns about so-called \"stagflation\". Markets are starting to question the inflationary impacts of incoming President Donald Trump's trade and tax policies.",
      "So while this is not a crisis, it is a new reality. Markets are questioning if the UK really can sustain higher growth and restrained inflation. And those questions are now occurring against the backdrop of the Trump trade tumult affecting global markets for borrowing. It's a bumpy start to 2025."

    "story": [
      "Norway is the world leader when it comes to the take up of electric cars, which last year accounted for nine out of 10 new vehicles sold in the country. Can other nations learn from it?",
      "For more than 75 years Oslo-based car dealership Harald A M\u00f8ller has been importing Volkswagens, but early in 2024 it bid farewell to fossil fuel cars.",
      "Now all the passenger vehicles for sale in its showroom are electric (EV).",
      "\"We think it's wrong to advise a customer coming in here today to buy an ICE [internal combustion engine] car, because the future is electric,\" says chief executive Ulf Tore Hekneby, as he walks around the cars on display. \"Long-range, high-charging speed. It's hard to go back.\"",
      "On the streets of Norway's capital, Oslo, battery-powered cars aren't a novelty, they're the norm. Take a look around and you'll soon notice that almost every other car has an \"E\" for \"electric\" on its licence plate.",
      "The Nordic nation of 5.5 million people has adopted EVs faster than any other country, and is on the cusp of becoming the first to phase out the sale of new fossil fuel cars.",
      "Last year, the number of electric cars on Norway's roads outnumbered those powered by petrol for the first time. When diesel vehicles are included, electric cars account for almost a third of all on Norwegian roads.",
      "And 88.9% of new cars sold in the country last year were EVs, up from 82.4% in 2023, data from the Norwegian Road Federation (OFV) showed.",
      "In some months sales of fully electric cars were as high as 98%, as new petrol or diesel car purchases almost fizzled out.",
      "By contrast, in the UK electric cars made up only 20% of new car registrations in 2024. Although this was a record high, and up from 16.5% in 2023.",
      "In the US, the figure was just 8% last year, up from 7.6%.",
      "Norway is undoubtedly an EV pioneer, but this electric revolution has been three decades in the making.",
      "\"It started already in the early 1990s,\" says Christina Bu, the secretary general of the Norwegian EV Association, as she took me for a spin around Oslo in an electric minivan.",
      "\"Little by little taxing petrol and diesel engine cars more, so they have become a lot more expensive to purchase, whereas electric cars have been exempted from taxes.\"",
      "The support for electric vehicles was first introduced to help two Norwegian manufacturers of early EVs, the Buddy (previously Kewet) and TH!NK City. While they went out of business, the incentives for greener vehicles remained.",
      "\"It's our goal to see that it's always a good and viable choice, to choose zero emission,\" says Norway's Deputy Transport Minister, Cecilie Knibe Kroglund.",
      "Even though it's a major oil and gas producer, Norway aims for all new cars sold to be \"zero emission\", starting at some point in 2025. A non-binding goal was set back in 2017, and that milestone now lies within reach.",
      "\"We are closing up on the target, and I think that we will reach that goal,\" adds Kroglund. \"I think we have already made the transition for passengers cars.\"",
      "Key to Norway's success has been long-term and predictable policies, she explains.",
      "Rather than banning combustion engine vehicles, the government has steered consumer choices. In addition to penalising fuel fossil vehicles with higher taxes and registration fees, VAT and import duties were scrapped for low-emission cars.",
      "A string of perks, like free parking, discounted road tolls and access to bus lanes, then followed.",
      "By comparison, the European Union plans to ban sales of new fossil-fuel cars by 2035, and the UK's current government wants to prohibit their sale in 2030.",
      "Petrol and diesel car sales are still permitted in Norway. But few are choosing to buy them.",
      "For many locals, like St\u00e5le Fyen, who bought his first EV 15 months ago, going electric made economic sense.",
      "\"With all the incentives we have in Norway, with no taxes on EVs, that was quite important to us money wise,\" he says while plugging in his car at a charging station in the capital.",
      "\"In the cold, the range is maybe 20% shorter, but still, with the expansive charging network we have here in Norway, that isn't a big issue really,\" Mr Fyen adds. \"You just have to change your mindset and charge when you can, not when you need to.\"",
      "Another driver, Merete Eggesb\u00f8, says that back in 2014 she was one of the first people in Norway to own a Tesla. \"I really wanted a car that didn't pollute. It gave me a better conscience driving.\"",
      "At Norwegian petrol stations many fuel pumps have been replaced by fast-charging points, and across Norway there are now more than 27,000 public chargers.",
      "This compares with 73,699 in the UK - a country 12 times bigger in terms of population.",
      "That means that, per 100,000 people, Norway has 447 chargers while the UK has just 89, according to a recent report.",
      "Tesla, VW and Toyota, were Norway's top-selling EV brands last year. Meanwhile, Chinese-owned marques - such as MG, BYD, Polestar and XPeng - now make up a combined 10% of the market, according to the Norwegian Road Federation.",
      "Norway, unlike the US and EU, has not imposed tariffs on Chinese EV imports.",
      "Ms Bu says there's \"not really any reason why other countries can not copy Norway\". However, she adds that it is \"all about doing it in a way that can work in each country or market\".",
      "Norwegians aren't more environmentally-minded than people elsewhere, she reckons. \"I don't think a green mindset has much to do with it. It has to do with strong policies, and people gradually understanding that driving an electric car is possible.\"",
      "Yet Norway is also a very wealthy nation, which thanks to its huge oil and gas exports, has a sovereign wealth fund worth more than $1.7tn (\u00a31.3tn). This means it can more easily afford big infrastructure-build projects, and absorb the loss of tax revenue from the sale of petrol and diesel cars and their fuel.",
      "The country also has an abundance of renewable hydro electricity, which accounts for 88% of its production capacity.",
      "\"A third of cars are now electric, and it will pass 50% in a few years,\" says Kjell Werner Johansen from the Norwegian Centre for Transport Research. \"I think the government accepts that a few new petrol or hybrid cars will still be on the market, but I don't know anybody who wants to buy a diesel car these days.\"",

    "story": [
      "The planet has moved a major step closer to warming more than 1.5C, new data shows, despite world leaders vowing a decade ago they would try to avoid this.",
      "The European Copernicus climate service, one of the main global data providers, said on Friday that 2024 was the first calendar year to pass the symbolic threshold, as well as the world's hottest on record.",
      "This does not mean the international 1.5C target has been broken, because that refers to a long-term average over decades, but does bring us nearer to doing so as fossil fuel emissions continue to heat the atmosphere.",
      "Last week UN chief Ant\u00f3nio Guterres described the recent run of temperature records as \"climate breakdown\".",
      "\"We must exit this road to ruin - and we have no time to lose,\" he said in his New Year message, calling for countries to slash emissions of planet-warming gases in 2025.",
      "Global average temperatures for 2024 were around 1.6C above those of the pre-industrial period - the time before humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels - according to Copernicus data.",
      "This breaks the record set in 2023 by just over 0.1C, and means the last 10 years are now the 10 warmest years on record.",
      "The Met Office, Nasa and other climate groups are due to release their own data later on Friday. All are expected to agree that 2024 was the warmest on record, although precise figures vary slightly.",
      "Last year's heat is predominantly due to humanity's emissions of planet-warming gases, such as carbon dioxide, which are still at record highs.",
      "Natural weather patterns such as El Ni\u00f1o - where surface waters in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean become unusually warm - played a smaller role.",
      "\"By far and away the largest contribution impacting our climate is greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere,\" Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus, tells the BBC.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "Why does keeping global warming to 1.5C matter?",
      "What is El Ni\u00f1o and how does it change the weather?",
      "The 1.5C figure has become a powerful symbol in international climate negotiations ever since it was agreed in Paris in 2015, with many of the most vulnerable countries considering it a matter of survival.",
      "The risks from climate change, such as intense heatwaves, rising sea-levels and loss of wildlife, would be much higher at 2C of warming than at 1.5C, according to a landmark UN report from 2018.",
      "Yet the world has been moving closer and closer to breaching the 1.5C barrier.",
      "\"When exactly we will cross the long-term 1.5C threshold is hard to predict, but we're obviously very close now,\" says Myles Allen of the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, and an author of the UN report.",
      "The current trajectory would likely see the world pass 1.5C of long-term warming by the early 2030s. This would be politically significant, but it wouldn't mean game over for climate action.",
      "\"It's not like 1.49C is fine, and 1.51C is the apocalypse - every tenth of a degree matters and climate impacts get progressively worse the more warming we have,\" explains Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at Berkeley Earth, a research group in the US.",
      "Even fractions of a degree of global warming can bring more frequent and intense extreme weather, such as heatwaves and heavy rainfall.",
      "In 2024, the world saw blistering temperatures in west Africa, prolonged drought in parts of South America, intense rainfall in central Europe and some particularly strong tropical storms hitting north America and south Asia.",
      "These events were just some of those made more intense by climate change over the last year, according to the World Weather Attribution group.",
      "Even this week, as the new figures are released, Los Angeles has been overwhelmed with destructive wildfires fuelled by high winds and a lack of rain.",
      "While there are many contributing factors to this week's events, experts say conditions conducive to fires in California are becoming more likely in a warming world.",
      "It wasn't only air temperatures that set new marks in 2024. The world's sea surface also reached a new daily high, while the total amount of moisture in the atmosphere reached record levels.",
      "That the world is breaking new records is not a surprise: 2024 was always expected to be hot, because of the effect of the El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern - which ended around April last year - on top of human-caused warming.",
      "But the margin of several records in recent years has been less expected, with some scientists fearing it could represent an acceleration of warming.",
      "\"I think it's safe to say that both 2023 and 2024 temperatures surprised most climate scientists - we didn't think we'd be seeing a year above 1.5C this early,\" says Dr Hausfather.",
      "\"Since 2023 we've had around 0.2C of extra warming that we can't fully explain, on top of what we had expected from climate change and El Ni\u00f1o,\" agrees Helge G\u00f6\u00dfling, a climate physicist at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany.",
      "Various theories have been suggested to explain this 'extra' warmth, such as an apparent reduction in the low-level cloud cover that tends to cool the planet, and prolonged ocean heat following the end of El Ni\u00f1o.",
      "\"The question is whether this acceleration is something persistent linked to human activities that means we will have steeper warming in the future, or whether it is a part of natural variability,\" Dr G\u00f6\u00dfling adds.",
      "\"At the moment it's very hard to say.\"",
      "Despite this uncertainty, scientists stress that humans still have control over the future climate, and sharp reductions in emissions can lessen the consequences of warming.",
      "\"Even if 1.5 degrees is out the window, we still can probably limit warming to 1.6C, 1.7C or 1.8C this century,\" says Dr Hausfather.",

      "Christine Kionga, who lives about a kilometre from the crash site, showed us cracks in the concrete of some of the buildings in her home compound. She said they had appeared after the crash.",
      "Other neighbours alleged the structural integrity of their homes had also been affected - allegations that are yet to be substantiated.",
      "\"The government needs to find the owners of this object, and get compensation for those affected by it,\" Mukuku resident Benson Mutuku told the BBC.",
      "There were reports in the local media that some residents had begun to complain of feeling unwell after exposure to the metallic ring though there was no confirmation from those we spoke to when we visited - nor from the authorities or the KSA.",
      "Nonetheless Mr Mutuku said there were concerns about the long-term effects of possible space radiation.",
      "\"This is a space object and we have heard in other similar incidents that there have been effects of radiation affecting even future generations and there is that fear in this community.\"",
      "However tests run later by the Kenya Nuclear Regulatory Authority revealed that while the metal ring did have higher radiation levels than the area in which it was found, they were not at a level harmful to humans.",
      "Engineers from the KSA, which was established in 2017 to promote, co-ordinate and regulate space-related activities in the East African nation, are continuing to run other tests to find out more about the object.",
      "The KSA director general said it was lucky that no significant damage was done when the object hurtled to Earth.",
      "\"The ultimate responsibility for any damage or injury caused by that space object is on the state in whose jurisdiction that operator may have launched the object,\" Brigadier Hillary Kipkosgey told the BBC.",
      "According to the Outer Space Treaty, overseen by the UN Office for Outer Space Affairs, \"states shall be liable for damage caused by their space objects\".",
      "\"[The ring] is a common item in many rockets and many space objects so it difficult to attribute it to a specific rocket or space object but we have leads but as I said our investigations are not conclusive,\" Brigadier Kipkosgey said.",
      "The BBC showed pictures of the object to the UK Space Agency to get the thoughts of its experts.",
      "\"The most plausible object it could be is the upper stage separation ring from an Ariane rocket in 2008,\" its launch director, Matt Archer, said.",
      "\"The satellites are fine, but the actual rocket body has come through and de-orbited.\"",
      "The Ariane was Europe's main rocket launch vehicle, helping more than 230 satellites into orbit, before it was retired in 2023.",
      "It seems the separation ring may have been orbiting Earth for 16 years before making its unexpected appearance in Mukuku.",
      "This is not the first incident of space junk appearing in East Africa.",
      "Just over a year and a half ago some suspected space debris fell over several villages in western Uganda.",
      "And a few days ago, on 8 January, there were unconfirmed reports of what was believed to be space debris burning brightly in the skies above northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia.",
      "As the space industry grows, it is predicted that such incidents will become more frequent - and African governments may need to invest in ways to better detect this speeding space rubbish.",
      "Nasa estimates there are more than 6,000 tonnes of space debris in orbit at the moment.",
      "There are many different estimates about the chances of such junk hitting someone, but most are in the one-in-10,000 range.",
      "Such statistics are little comfort for Mukuku's residents, who cannot help thinking of what damage the ring could have caused had it landed in the centre of the village instead of on farmland.",

      "The charity Buglife said active worker bumblebees, which do most of the work in a nest, were spotted in Aberdeen during mild weather over the Christmas break.",
      "It said a previous survey had recorded bumblebees and honeybees between Christmas and New Year at locations across the UK, including the Highlands.",

      "The insects, an important pollinator, normally hibernate through winter into spring.",
      "The Christmas period was unseasonably mild, but since then there have been days of cold and snowy weather.",
      "Buglife said at least two of the UK's 25 species of bumblebee were believed to have started nest-building early.",
      "The charity's Paul Hetherington said: \"In 2019 Buglife ran a bee survey over the Christmas to New Year break and were amazed at the results with honeybees and bumblebees found from Jersey through to Thurso.",
      "\"This year one of my colleagues based in Aberdeen spotted active worker bumblebees over the Christmas break.",
      "\"The fact that there are active workers means not only have the queens awakened from hibernation but they have gone to the extent of starting new nests.\"",
      "Mr Hetherington said a lack of flowers and wintry weather left the nests at risk of collapse and could kill the bees.",
      "He added: \"If this happens there will be no new queens produced meaning far fewer to emerge in spring further feeding the known decline in bumblebees.\"",
      "The milder conditions also led to people encountering a far less welcome invertebrate - ticks.",

      "Over winter, adult ticks do not hibernate and instead shelter from low temperatures in long vegetation.",
      "Mr Hetherington said: \"This means that they are still potentially active and the period around 28 December was relatively warm for the time of year, a likely consequence of climate change is increased periods of tick activity in the same way that bumblebees have been spotted on the wing across Scotland this December.\"",
      "The charity Lyme Disease Action said it was concerning situation.",

    "story": [
      "UK laws on internet safety are \"very uneven\" and \"unsatisfactory\", Technology Secretary Peter Kyle has said, following calls from campaigners to tighten the rules.",
      "On Saturday, Ian Russell, the father of Molly Russell, who took her own life at 14 after seeing harmful content online, said the UK was \"going backwards\" on the issue.",
      "In a letter to the PM, Mr Russell argued that the Online Safety Act, which aims to force tech giants to take more responsibility for their sites' content, needed fixing and said a \"duty of care\" should be imposed on the firms.",
      "Speaking to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, Kyle expressed his \"frustration\" with the Act, which was passed by the previous Conservative government in 2023.",
      "The Conservative government had originally included in the legislation plans to compel social media companies to remove some \"legal-but-harmful\" content, such as posts promoting eating disorders.",
      "However the proposal triggered a backlash from critics, including the current Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who were concerned it could lead to censorship.",
      "In July 2022, Badenoch, who was not then a minister, said the bill was in \"no fit state to become law\" adding: \"We should not be legislating for hurt feelings.\"",
      "Another Conservative MP, David Davis, said it risked \"the biggest accidental curtailment of free speech in modern history\".",
      "The plan was dropped for adult social media users and instead companies were required to give users more control to filter out content they did not want to see. The law still expects companies to protect children from legal-but-harmful content.",
      "Kyle said the section on legal-but-harmful content had been taken out of the bill adding: \"So I inherited a landscape where we have a very uneven, unsatisfactory legislative settlement.\"",
      "He did not commit to making changes to the current legislation but said he was \"very open-minded\" on the subject.",
      "He also said the act contained some \"very good powers\" he was using to \"assertively\" tackle new safety concerns and that in the coming months ministers would get the powers to make sure online platforms were providing age-appropriate content.",
      "Companies that did not comply with the law would face \"very strident\" sanctions, he said.",
      "Following the interview, a Whitehall source told the BBC the government was not planning to repeal the Online Safety Act, or pass a second act, but to work within what ministers believe are its limitations.",
      "Ministers are not ruling out further legislation but wanted \"to be agile and quick\" to keep up with fast-moving trends, a source said.",
      "How can you keep children safe online?",
      "Molly Russell's dad warns UK 'going backwards' on online safety and urges PM to act",
      "Facebook and Instagram get rid of fact checkers",
      "In his letter, Ian Russell argued that \"ominous\" changes in the tech industry put greater pressure on the government to act.",
      "He said Mark Zuckerberg, the boss of Meta which owns Facebook and Instagram, and Elon Musk, owner of the social media site X, were \"at the leading edge of a wholesale recalibration of the industry\".",
      "He accused Zuckerberg of moving away from safety towards a \"laissez-faire, anything-goes model\" and \"back towards the harmful content that Molly was exposed to\".",
      "Earlier this week, Zuckerberg said Meta would be getting rid of fact checkers, and instead adopt a system \u2013 already introduced by X - of allowing users to add \"community notes\" to social media posts they deemed to be untrue.",
      "This marked a change from Meta's previous approach, introduced in 2016, whereby third party moderators would check posts on Facebook and Instagram that appeared to be false or misleading.",
      "Content flagged as inaccurate would be moved lower in users' feeds and accompanied by labels offering viewers more information on the subject.",
      "Defending the new system, Zuckerberg said moderators were \"too politically biased\" and it was \"time to get back to our roots around free expression\".",
      "The step comes as Meta seeks to improve relations with incoming US President Donald Trump who has previously accused the company of censoring right-wing voices.",
      "Zuckerberg said the change - which only applies in the US - would mean content moderators would \"catch less bad stuff\" but would also reduce the number of \"innocent\" posts being removed.",
      "Responding to Russell's criticism, a Meta spokesperson told the BBC there was \"no change to how we treat content that encourages suicide, self-injury, and eating disorders\" and said the company would \"continue to use our automated systems to scan for that high-severity content\".",
      "Asked about the change, Kyle said the announcement was \"an American statement for American service users\" adding: \"There is one thing that has not changed and that is the law of this land.\"",
      "\"If you come and operate in this country you abide by the law, and the law says illegal content must be taken down,\" he said.",
      "Rules in the Online Safety Act, due to come into force later this year, compel social media firms to show that they are removing illegal content - such as child sexual abuse, material inciting violence and posts promoting or facilitating suicide.",
      "The law also says companies have to protect children from harmful material including pornography, material promoting self-harm, bullying and content encouraging dangerous stunts.",
      "Platforms will be expected to adopt \"age assurance technologies\" to prevent children from seeing harmful content.",
      "The law also requires companies to take action against illegal, state-sponsored disinformation. If their services are likely to be accessed by children they should also take steps to protect users against misinformation."

    "story": [
      "The Supreme Court appears poised to uphold a law that bans TikTok in the US over national security concerns unless its China-based parent company sells the platform ahead of a 19 January deadline.",
      "The Court's nine justices heard from lawyers representing TikTok, and content creators that the ban would be a  violation of free speech protections for the platform's more than 170 million users in the US.",
      "The US government argued that without a sale, TikTok could be used by China as a tool for spying and political manipulation.",
      "A decision by the top court has to be made within days. President-elect Donald Trump - who returns to the White House in just over a week - now argues against the ban.",
      "The law requires TikTok's parent company ByteDance to sell it in the US or cease operations on 19 January. The company has said it will not sell the short-form video platform.",
      "Congress passed the law with support from both the Democratic and Republican parties - a moment that marked the culmination of years of concern about the widely popular platform, which is known for its viral videos and traction among young people.",
      "The legislation does not forbid use of the app, but would require tech giants such as Apple and Google to stop offering it and inhibit updates, which analysts suggest would kill it over time.",
      "TikTok has repeatedly denied any potential influence by the Chinese Communist Party and has said the law violates the First Amendment free speech rights of its users.",
      "Noel Francisco, a former US solicitor general appearing for the platform, stressed the ban on the most popular speech platform for Americans could also open the door to a dangerous form of censorship.",
      "He argued that  \"the government cannot restrict speech in order to protect us from speech\".",
      "\"That's precisely what this law does from beginning to end.\"",
      "A representative for platform creators argued they should be free to use the publisher of their choice.",
      "Jeffrey L Fisher, a Stanford University law professor representing creators who sued over the law, told the court on Friday that the country has historically faced \"ideological campaigns by foreign adversaries\".",
      "But he said that under the First Amendment, mere ideas do not represent a national security threat.",
      "Justice department lawyer Elizabeth B Prelogar told  the court that ByteDance's ties to the Chinese government made it a national security risk.",
      "She told the court that Beijing \"could weaponise TikTok at any time to harm the United States\".",
      "During nearly three hours of arguments, the nine justices  returned time and again to the national security concerns that gave rise to the law in the first place,  while also probing free speech questions.",
      "\"Are we supposed to ignore the fact that the ultimate parent is, in fact, subject to doing intelligence work for the Chinese government?\" conservative Chief Justice John Roberts asked TikTok lawyer Mr Francisco.",

      "The Trump question",
      "In December, US President-elect Donald Trump urged the court to delay its decision until he returns to the White House to enable him to seek a \"political solution\" to resolve the issues at hand.",
      "TikTok's lawyer told the court on Friday that, as he saw it, the platform would \"go dark\" on 19 January without intervention.",
      "Ms Prelogar, arguing for the US justice department, said \"nothing permanent\" had to happen on that day and there was still time for a sale.",
      "Forcing the app to go dark could be just the \"jolt\" ByteDance needs to seriously consider a sale, she said.",
      "\"It will fundamentally change the landscape with respect to what ByteDance might consider,\" she said, comparing the situation to \"game of chicken\" and one in which the US should not \"blink first\".",
      "After the hearing, legal observers predicted that the Supreme Court's justices appeared to be swayed by the government's concerns.",
      "\"Traditionally the Supreme Court has been willing to defer somewhat when national security is at stake,\" said University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias.",
      "\"I expect that the justices by a majority will side with the government,\" he added.",
      "Jacob Hubert, a lawyer and the president of the Liberty Justice Center - which represents BASED Politics, an internet content creator - said it was still difficult to predict how the court would rule.",
      "But he says  the ban would violate the freedom of speech of millions of Americans - a point he believes was effectively made by TikTok's lawyers.",
      "\"It's not about China's rights, or the Communist Party's rights,\" he said. \"It is about the rights of Americans who use TikTok to, largely, speak with other Americans.\"",
      "More than a hundred people braved freezing conditions in Washington DC to attend the hearing in person.",
      "Chloe Joy Sexton - one of the TikTok creators named in the suit - said that the platform brought many creators \"financial independence\", including many mothers.",
      "\"A TikTok ban would place these women, myself included, in true financial jeopardy,\" she told reporters. \"It would destroy both my business and the community that means so much to me.\"",
      "Danielle Ballesteros, a student at UC San Diego, said had been waiting outside the court since 06:30 local time.",
      "\"I feel like TikTok doesn't deserve to be banned,\" she told BBC News.",

      "Dr Mirsa-Sharp started using Heidi Health, a free AI-assisted medical transcription tool that listens and transcribes patient appointments, about four months ago and says it has made a big difference.",
      "\u201cUsually when I\u2019m with a patient, I am writing things down and it takes away from the consultation,\u201d she says. \u201cThis now means I can spend my entire time locking eyes with the patient and actively listening. It makes for a more quality consultation.\u201d",
      "She says the tech reduces her workflow, saving her \u201ctwo to three minutes per consultation, if not more\u201d. She reels off other benefits: \u201cIt reduces the risk of errors and omissions in my medical note taking.\"",
      "With a workforce in decline while the number of patients continues to grow, GPs face immense pressure.",
      "A single full-time GP is now responsible for 2,273 patients, up 17% since September 2015, according to the British Medical Association (BMA).",
      "Could AI be the solution to help GP\u2019s cut back on administrative tasks and alleviate burnout?",
      "Some research suggests it could. A 2019 report prepared by Health Education England estimated a minimal saving of one minute per patient from new technologies such as AI, equating to 5.7 million hours of GP time.",
      "Meanwhile, research by Oxford University in 2020, found that 44% of all administrative work in General Practice can now be either mostly or completely automated, freeing up time to spend with patients.",
      "One company working on that is Denmark's Corti, which has developed AI that can listen to healthcare consultations, either over the phone or in person, and suggest follow-up questions, prompts, treatment options, as well as automating note taking.",
      "Corti says its technology processes about 150,000 patient interactions per day across hospitals, GP surgeries and healthcare institutions across Europe and the US, totalling about 100 million encounters per year.",
      "\u201cThe idea is the physician can spend more time with a patient,\u201d says Lars Maal\u00f8e, co-founder and chief technology officer at Corti. He says the technology can suggest questions based on previous conversations it has heard in other healthcare situations.",
      "\u201cThe AI has access to related conversations and then it might think, well, in 10,000 similar conversations, most questions asked X and that has not been asked,\u201d says Mr Maal\u00f8e.",
      "\u201cI imagine GPs have one consultation after another and so have little time to consult with colleagues. It\u2019s giving that colleague advice.\u201d",
      "He also says it can look at the historical data of a patient. \u201cIt could ask, for example, did you remember to ask if the patient is still suffering from pain in the right knee?\u201d",
      "But do patients want technology listening to and recording their conversations?",
      "Mr Maal\u00f8e says \u201cthe data is not leaving system\u201d. He does say it is good practice to inform the patient, though.",
      "\u201cIf the patient contests it, the doctor cannot record. We see few examples of that as the patient can see better documentation.\u201d",
      "Dr Misra-Sharp says she lets patients know she has a listening device to help her take notes. \u201cI haven\u2019t had anyone have a problem with that yet, but if they did, I wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, currently, 1,400 GP practices across England are using the C the Signs, a platform which uses AI to analyse patients\u2019 medical records and check different signs, symptoms and risk factors of cancer, and recommend what action should be taken.",
      "\u201cIt can capture symptoms, such as cough, cold, bloating, and essentially in a minute it can see if there\u2019s any relevant information from their medical history,\u201d says C the Signs chief executive and co-founder Dr Bea Bakshi, who is also a GP.",
      "The AI is trained on published medical research papers.",
      "\u201cFor example, it might say the patient is at risk of pancreatic cancer and would benefit from a pancreatic scan, and then the doctor will decide to refer to those pathways,\u201d says Dr Bakshi. \u201cIt won\u2019t diagnose, but it can facilitate.\u201d",
      "She says they have conducted more than 400,000 cancer risk assessments in a real-world setting, detecting more than 30,000 patients with cancer across more than 50 different cancer types.",
      "An AI report published by the BMA this year found that \u201cAI should be expected to transform, rather than replace, healthcare jobs by automating routine tasks and improving efficiency\u201d.",
      "In a statement, Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, chair of General Practice Committee UK at the BMA, said: \"We recognise that AI has the potential to transform NHS care completely - but if not enacted safely, it could also cause considerable harm. AI is subject to bias and error, can potentially compromise patient privacy and is still very much a work-in-progress.",
      "\"Whilst AI can be used to enhance and supplement what a GP can offer as another tool in their arsenal, it's not a silver bullet. We cannot wait on the promise of AI tomorrow, to deliver the much-needed productivity, consistency and safety improvements needed today.\u201d",

      "Could AI help prevent diabetes-related sight loss?",
      "Alison Dennis, partner and co-head of law firm Taylor Wessing's international life sciences team, warns that GPs need to tread carefully when using AI.",
      "\"There is the very high risk of generative AI tools not providing full and complete, or correct diagnoses or treatment pathways, and even giving wrong diagnoses or treatment pathways i.e. producing hallucinations or basing outputs on clinically incorrect training data,\u201d says Ms Dennis.",
      "\u201cAI tools that have been trained on reliable data sets and then fully validated for clinical use \u2013 which will almost certainly be a specific clinical use, are more suitable in clinical practice.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe NHS would also want to ensure that all data that is inputted into the tool is retained securely within the NHS system infrastructure, and is not absorbed for further use by the provider of the tool as training data without the appropriate GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation] safeguards in place.\"",
      "For now, for GPs like Misra-Sharp, it has transformed their work. \u201cIt has made me go back to enjoying my consultations again instead of feeling time pressured.\u201d"

      "This is the fourth feature in a six-part series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments.",
      "Over a video call, Alex Zhavoronkov holds up a small, green, diamond-shaped pill.",
      "It has been developed by his company to treat a rare progressive lung disease for which there is no known cause or cure.",
      "The new drug has yet to be approved, but in small clinical trials has shown impressive efficacy in treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).",
      "It's one of a new wave of drugs where artificial intelligence (AI) has been integral to its discovery.",
      "\"We can't say we have the first AI discovered and designed molecule approved,\" says Dr Zhavoronkov, the co-founder and CEO of US-based start-up Insilico Medicine. \"But we may be the furthest along the path.\"",
      "Welcome to the great AI drug race, where a host of companies are employing the power of AI to do what has traditionally been the job of medicinal chemists.",
      "That includes both smaller, specialist AI-driven biotech companies, which have sprung up over the past decade, and larger pharmaceutical firms who are either doing the research themselves, or in partnership with smaller firms.",
      "Among the newer players is Alphabet, the parent company of Google, which launched UK-based AI drug discovery company Isomorphic Labs, in late 2021.",
      "Its CEO, Demis Hassabis, shared this year's Nobel prize in chemistry for an AI model that is expected to be useful for AI drug design.",
      "Using AI to do drug discovery could make an \"enormous difference\" for patients, says Chris Meier, of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG).",
      "Bringing a new drug to market takes on average 10 to 15 years, and costs more than $2bn (\u00a31.6bn).",
      "It's also risky: about 90% of drugs that go into clinical trials fail. The hope is that using AI for the drug discovery part of that process could cut the time and cost, and result in more success.",
      "A new era, where AI is at the centre of the drug discovery process is emerging, says Charlotte Deane, a professor of structural bioinformatics at Oxford University, who develops freely available AI tools to help pharmaceutical companies and others improve their drug discovery.",
      "\"We are at the beginning of just how good that might be,\" she says.",
      "It is unlikely to lead to fewer pharmaceutical scientists, say experts - the real savings will come if there are fewer failures - but it will mean working in partnership with AI.",
      "A recently published analysis by BCG found at least 75 \"AI-discovered molecules\" have entered clinical trials with many more expected.",
      "\"That they are now routinely going into clinical trials is a major milestone,\" says Dr Meier. The next \u2013 and \"even bigger milestone\" \u2013 will be when they start to come out the other end.",
      "However, Prof Deane notes that there is no definition yet of what exactly counts as an \"AI discovered\" drug and, in all the examples to date, there has still been lots of human involvement.",
      "There are two steps within the drug discovery process where AI is being most heavily deployed explains Dr Meier.",
      "The first is in identifying, at the molecular level, the therapeutic target that it is intended the drug will act to correct, such as a certain gene or protein being altered by the disease in a way it shouldn't.",
      "While traditionally scientists test potential targets in the lab experimentally, based on what they understand of a disease, AI can be trained to mine large databases to make connections between the underlying molecular biology and the disease and make suggestions.",
      "The second, and more common, is in designing the drug to correct the target.",
      "This employs generative AI, also the basis of ChatGPT, to imagine molecules that might bind to the target and work, replacing the expensive manual process of chemists synthesising many hundreds of variations of the same molecule and trying them to find the optimal one.",
      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "Insilico Medicine, founded in 2014 and which has received more than $425m in funding, used AI for both steps, as well as to predict the probability of success in clinical trials which it then feeds back into its drug discovery work.",
      "Currently the firm has six molecules in clinical trials, including to treat IPF for which the next phase of trials is being planned.",
      "In addition four molecules have been cleared to enter trials, and nearly 30 others are showing promise.",
      "All have been \"discovered from scratch using generative AI\", says Dr Zhavoronkov. \"Our machines dream until they come up with a perfect drug that fits all our criteria.\"",
      "The novel molecule to treat IPF was designed by the company's generative AI software after it was given the objective of inhibiting a protein called TNIK, which has never been targeted before for treating IPF, but was suggested by another set of the company's AI software as the most likely regulator of the disease.",
      "Possibilities suggested by the system were then synthesised and tested.",
      "The discovery process was far quicker and leaner than standard for the industry, notes Dr Zhavoronkov.",
      "It took 18 months and required synthesis and testing of 79 molecules, where usually it would be expected to take about four years and at least the synthesis of 500. Other of Insilco's molecules have even lower numbers, he says.",
      "The lack of data from which AI can learn remains the biggest challenge for the field generally, say experts.",
      "That cuts across both target identification and molecule design, and can potentially introduce biases.",
      "US-based Recursion Pharmaceuticals says its approach mitigates the problems of limited data.",
      "Through automated experiments, it generates massive quantities of data related to the entire collection of molecules that makes up the human body. It then trains AI tools to understand that data and find unexpected relationships.",
      "To help to do that, last year it installed what it says is the fastest supercomputer owned and operated by any pharmaceutical company.",
      "It has had some success. A molecule developed by the company to treat both lymphoma and solid tumours is now being tested on cancer patients in early-stage clinical trials.",
      "It was developed after the AI spotted a new way of targeting a gene which is thought to be important in driving these cancers, but which nobody had previously cracked how to target on its own.",
      "Recursion co-founder and CEO Chris Gibson says what matters most in the field is something neither Recursion nor anyone else has yet shown: that these AI-discovered molecules can make it through clinical trials and that, over time, they deliver an increased probability of success over traditional methods.",
      "When that happens, says Dr Gibson, \"it'll be obvious to the world that this is the way to go\"."

They also say the Egyptian authorities were slow to react, something which may have cost lives. We have put questions to Dive Pro Liveaboard - based in Hurghada - and the Egyptian government, but not received any reply.",
      "This, for the first time, is the inside story of how the Sea Story sank, as told by those who made it out alive.",
      "The luxury dive boat set off from Port Ghaleb on Egypt's Red Sea Coast on 24 November. On board were 31 international guests - mostly experienced divers - and three dive guides, along with 12 Egyptian crew. They were on a six-day trip, with their first destination being Sataya Reef, a popular diving spot.",
      "Like many of those on board, Lucianna's first impressions of the Sea Story were positive. \"It looked like a really nice boat, very big, very clean,\" she says, speaking from her home in Belgium.",
      "The company had transferred over Lucianna and others at the last minute from another boat, which had hundreds of good online reviews. Several guests were told they were getting an \"upgrade\" but some were frustrated because it was not going to the destination they had booked.",
      "Conditions that night were quite rough, although the survivors we spoke to, including experienced sailors, say the boat seemed more unstable than they would have expected.",
      "At one point, a few hours before the capsizing, a small inflatable boat slipped off the back of the Sea Story. A passenger filmed as the crew battled to bring it back on board - the oceanographer the BBC spoke to says the video shows conditions which were not unusual and consistent with 1.5m (5ft) waves.",
      "\"Looking out at the waves, the weather wasn't terrible,\" says Sarah Martin, an NHS doctor from Lancaster who was on the trip. But, she says, \"furniture was sliding around the deck - we asked the crew if it was normal and they just shrugged, so we didn't realise the danger we were in\".",
      "\"I didn't sleep that night because the boat was rocking so much,\" says Hissora Gonzalez, a diver from Spain, whose cabin was on the lower deck.",
      "She describes how the boat rolled sharply several times until, just before 03:00, it flipped onto its side with a loud bang, followed by silence as the engines died - and total darkness.",
      "Shouting could soon be heard coming from other cabins, as people were thrown from their beds. Possessions were scattered around, blocking exits and making escape difficult. One survivor - who had been sleeping outside on deck - described being trapped under heavy furniture which had shifted as the boat rolled.",
      "\"We couldn't see anything. I didn't know if I was walking on the floor, on the ceiling, on the side,\" says Hissora. Disoriented, she started looking around for life jackets. Before she could find one, her friend Cristhian Cercos shouted at her to run.",
      "That call may well have saved her life. Their cabin was on the starboard (right) of the boat, the side that hit the sea. Nearly all of the dead or missing had cabins on that side of the boat.",
      "\"I could hear the water coming in, but I could not see it,\" says Hissora. Their cabin door was now on the ceiling - she only escaped because Cristhian pulled her up on the fifth attempt.",
      "Across the hall from Hissora, also in complete darkness, were Sarah and her cabin mate Natalia Sanchez Fuster, a dive guide. They couldn't find the handle to the cabin door. When Sarah managed to turn on the torch on her phone she realised \"everything was at 90 degrees - the door was on the floor and all our things were blocking it\".",
      "After clearing the doorway, they joined about 10 others heading for an emergency exit towards the bow (front) of the boat.",
      "With the boat on its side, the group had to crawl along the emergency staircase for two floors, past the restaurant and dining room on the main deck. It was hard to find their way and it seemed the contents of the kitchen cupboards had spilled out over the floors.",
      "\"We had to climb along door frames and beams to make our way out,\" says Sarah. \"It was quite disorienting in the dark and it was very slippery. There was cooking oil and broken eggs everywhere.\"",
      "Hissora, just ahead of Sarah, managed to make it to the upper deck. She could hear people screaming behind her but did not turn around. \"I was afraid of looking back and seeing all the water coming in,\" she says.",
      "By this time, the Sea Story was sinking fast. Those who had reached the top deck knew they would have to jump into the water - a 2-3m (7-10ft) drop.",
      "\"I was paralysed because Cristhian kept saying to me 'don't jump' because he could see someone was trying to release the life raft,\" Hissora recalls.",
      "Sarah was behind Hissora and desperate to get out. \"There were other guests holding on to the side, blocking the exit,\" she remembers. \"We were shouting at them to move out of the way.\"",
      "With the water rising fast, Hissora, Sarah and the dozen or so people who had reached the top deck jumped into the water. They knew the danger was not over yet. \"If the boat was going down, we needed to get away so it wouldn't pull us down with it,\" says Sarah.",
      "Natalia, who had also jumped in, swam around the boat - she heard people screaming from inside the cabins and tried to use floating debris to break the windows, but didn't succeed.",
      "Sarah and Natalia were among the few who had grabbed a life jacket before escaping, but Sarah says they were not functioning as they should have.",
      "\"We noticed the lights weren't working. Looking back, I don't think there were any batteries in there.\"",
      "It is just one of several safety failings reported by the people we interviewed.",
      "In total, we have spoken to seven of the survivors who had been staying on the lower deck. They all tell a near-identical story of the moment the boat went over - but not all of them escaped the same way.",
      "Lucianna Galetta was in a cabin towards the back of the lower deck with her partner Christophe Lemmens. They were just moments slower than the others in realising the danger. That delay cost them dearly.",
      "\"We started to get up and tried to find the life jackets,\" says Lucianna. \"We opened the door but there was already water in the corridor. I think we panicked as we jumped in and almost drowned.\"",
      "Unable to reach the exit at the front, Lucianna and Christophe ended up in an air pocket in the engine room at the stern (rear) of the boat, which was still sticking out of the water. They did not understand where they were until they were joined in the tiny space, some time later, by one of the dive instructors, Youssef al-Faramawy.",
      "The three of them would stay there, sitting on fuel tanks, for about 35 hours.",
      "Outside the boat, Sarah, Hissora and the others who had jumped off eventually found the two life rafts, which had deployed after the sinking. As they clambered on board, they saw the boat's captain and a number of other crew members were already there.",
      "\"There should be some supplies in here,\" Sarah remembers one of the other guests saying. All the people we spoke to recall a safety briefing mentioning that the life rafts had food and water in them - but they did not, the BBC were told.",
      "\"We found a torch, but again it didn't have any batteries. We didn't have any water or any food,\" Sarah says. \"There were flares, but they had already been used.\"",
      "Sarah also says of the three blankets on board the raft, one had been taken by the captain for himself, leaving one for the rest of the crew and another for the guests. \"We ripped it up and huddled together,\" says Sarah.",
      "The rafts were met by rescue vessels at about 11:00 on the morning of 25 November, about eight hours after the capsizing. Both they, and the boat, had drifted eastwards.",
      "Back on board the Sea Story, Lucianna heard the rescue helicopter - but her ordeal was far from over.",
      "\"At this time we were very happy, but we had to wait 27 hours more,\" she says.",
      "Despite the boat having been located, the rescue effort was slow to reach them. \"We had no communication with the outside, nothing. No-one tried to see if there was someone alive in there,\" Lucianna says.",
      "She tells me there were moments when darkness and despair overtook her. \"I was so ready to die. We didn't think that someone would come.\"",
      "After several hours trapped in the air pocket, the dive guide, Youssef, wanted to try to swim through the boat, but Lucianna and Christophe persuaded him not to. \"Stay with us because they are going to come to get our bodies, so they will find us,\" Lucianna recalls telling him.",
      "Eventually, after nearly a day and a half stuck in the hull of the Sea Story, a light appeared in the darkness.",
      "A local Egyptian diving instructor, Khattab al-Faramawi, who was Youssef's uncle, had braved the wreck, diving through the submerged corridors looking for people. He took Youssef out first, then, after another hour's delay because of issues with the breathing apparatus, returned to lead Lucianna and her partner to safety. \"I hugged him so hard,\" says Lucianna. \"I was very, very happy.\"",
      "In total, five people from the Sea Story were rescued by divers, including a Swiss man and a Finnish man who had survived in another air pocket inside their cabin on the lower deck. Four bodies were recovered.",
      "But Lucianna is critical of the fact the Egyptian navy had to rely on volunteers. \"We waited 35 hours. I don't understand how there are no divers on the Egyptian military boats.\"",
      "Lucianna, Christophe and Youssef were taken on board a waiting naval vessel, before returning to shore. They were the last to be rescued. At least 11 people either died or are missing, presumed dead.",
      "Among them are Jenny Cawson and Tarig Sinada, a couple from Devon who were staying on the main deck, on the side of the boat that hit the water. Their bodies have never been found.",
      "\"It doesn't feel like it's real,\" says Andy Williamson, a friend of the couple. \"We keep expecting them to walk through the door.\" A month and a half after the sinking, hopes of that happening have all but vanished.",
      "The couple were experienced divers who always carefully researched the safety record of boats before their trips. They were also switched on to the Sea Story at the last minute, something that may have ultimately cost them dearly.",
      "The BBC spoke to survivors from nearly every cabin on the vessel in which someone got out alive. They all confirm the boat sank between 02:00 and 03:00. However, according to local authorities, a distress signal was not received until about 05:30 - a further factor which may have cost lives.",
      "Five survivors also reported that the heavy furniture on the top deck was unsecured and moved around before the sinking. The woman who had been sleeping on deck believes it all shifting to one side, as the boat started to overturn, further destabilised the Sea Story.",
      "The narrative put forward by Egyptian officials in the immediate aftermath, reported by news agencies around the world, was that a huge wave hit the boat. Multiple survivors' experiences in the water, just minutes after the capsizing, casts doubt on that.",
      "\"When we were in the water, the waves weren't so big that we weren't able to swim in them,\" says Sarah, \"so it does leave us wondering why that boat sank.\"",
      "Those suspicions are supported by data.",
      "Dr Simon Boxall is a leading oceanographer from the University of Southampton. He has analysed the weather from the day which shows the biggest waves were about 1.5m (5ft) - so he says \"there is no way a 4m (13ft) wave could have occurred in that region, at that time\".",
      "The Egyptian Meteorological Authority had warned of high waves on the Red Sea and advised against maritime activity on 24 and 25 November. But, according to Dr Boxall, \"these were over 200km (120 miles) away to the north of where the vessel went down.\"",
      "He says that leaves only two options, either pilot error or an error in the design of the vessel - or a combination of both.",
      "The UK's Marine Accident Investigation Board (MAIB), which will shortly publish a safety bulletin into the sinking, has recently warned divers of safety issues in the Red Sea after a number of incidents - at least two of which involved the same company, Dive Pro Liveaboard.",
      "The BBC sent all the safety concerns raised in this article to the Egyptian government and the company, Dive Pro Liveaboard, multiple times. We are yet to receive a response from either.",
      "After the disaster, the Egyptian authorities immediately opened an investigation into the sinking. That is yet to report, but for the friends of Jenny and Tarig this is about more than one boat.",
      "\"We've unfortunately had to learn of the dangers of diving in Egypt in the most tragic of circumstances,\" says Andy Williamson. \"I don't know how we will ever get over this.",
      "Lucianna wants to understand exactly what went wrong. \"We are lucky to be alive,\" she says. \"But there are so many people who didn't come back from this and I want their families to be able to grieve.\"",
      "On Wednesday, the survivors tell the BBC about what happened to them after they had been rescued - and the questions they now have about the official investigation.",

    "summary": "There is fresh anticipation about the talks after several shifts, both politically and on the ground.",
    "story": [
      "The outline of the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal currently being discussed by Israel and Hamas at indirect talks in Doha has been on the table since May. So why is there fresh anticipation that it could work, after being frozen for eight months of the war?",
      "There are several things that have shifted - both politically and on the ground.",
      "The first is the election of Donald Trump as the next US president.",
      "He has threatened that \"all hell\" would break loose if the hostages were not released before he took office on 20 January.",
      "Hamas may well read that as a sign that even the flimsy brakes the Biden administration used to try and rein in the Israeli government would be lifted, though it is hard to imagine what that might mean for a territory already so shattered by 15 months of war.",
      "Israel too is feeling the pressure from the incoming president to end the conflict in Gaza, which threatens to interfere with Trump's hopes to secure a wider regional deal, and his desired image as a president who ends wars.",

      "Biden and Netanyahu discuss Gaza ceasefire talks as momentum builds",
      "Israel and the Palestinians: History of the conflict explained",
      "On the other hand, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces continued pressure from his far-right coalition allies to continue the war.",
      "But Trump could also be an asset for him in persuading his allies to swallow the deal and stay in the government; the new US president and the man he picked as Israeli ambassador are seen as supportive of Israel's settlements in the occupied West Bank, which Israel's far-right Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has said he wants to annex.",
      "But after a meeting with the prime minister last night, Smotrich appeared unconvinced, writing on social media that the current deal was \"a catastrophe\" for Israel's national security and that he would not support it.",
      "Some in Israel, though, believe that both Smotrich and his far-right ally, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, see their current role in Israel's government as their best chance to cement control over the West Bank, especially with Trump returning to the White House, and that they are unlikely to follow through with their threats to quit.",
      "The second thing that has shifted is growing pressure on Netanyahu from his own military establishment.",
      "Key figures are widely reported to have challenged him repeatedly on the dwindling military goals in continuing the war, after the killing of the top Hamas leadership, and the decimation of Gaza.",
      "Last week, 10 Israeli soldiers were killed in Gaza, shining a fresh spotlight on the costs of the war to Israel, and on the perennial question of whether the \"total victory\" over Hamas that Netanyahu has promised is achievable.",
      "Some analysts now suggest that Hamas is rebuilding faster than Israel is defeating it, and therefore Israel needs to reconsider its strategy.",
      "And there's a third - regional - shift playing into the shift in expectations here too: the weakening and erosion of Hamas allies in Iran's \"Axis of Resistance\", from Hezbollah in Lebanon to Bashar al-Assad in Syria, along with killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza.",
      "For all these reasons, now is seen as the best chance in months to bridge the gaps between Israel and Hamas and bring an end to the war.",
      "What has not shifted in the eight months since they were last negotiating are the gaps between them.",
      "Key among them is a direct conflict between the key concern of Hamas, which wants to end the war, and that of Israel, which wants to keep the door open to resuming the conflict, whether for political or military reasons.",
      "The deal, as outlined by President Joe Biden in May, is divided into three phases, with a permanent ceasefire only coming into effect in phase two.",
      "Success now will likely depend on whether guarantees can be found to allay Hamas fears that Israel will pull out of the deal after the first phase of hostage releases.",
      "Questions over how to administer territory that Israel pulls back from are also unclear at this stage.",
      "But the web of diplomacy criss-crossing the region over the past week, and the fact that Netanyahu has sent the heads of Israel's security agencies to the talks in Doha, along with a key political adviser, are encouraging signs.",
      "So too is the departure for Doha of the Palestinian detainee co-ordinator, Qadoura Fares.",
      "The deal is not yet done - and talks have fallen apart before.",
      "This old deal is fuelling fresh hopes partly because negotiations are taking place in a new regional context, with growing pressures both internally and from key allies abroad.",

      "Introduction",
      "The first time it hit me that I had reached \"a certain age\" was while strolling through the streets of downtown New York with my daughters. They are, if I may be so bold, stunning girls. Rowan is a strawberry blonde with curves to die for; Grier is six feet tall, all legs, and towers over me. They're also funny, fiercely intelligent, thoughtful, and kind, though I guess those traits are less obvious to the casual observer.",
      "On this particular day, we were walking side by side, me in the middle, and it was impossible not to notice the admiring looks from various passersby. Over the years I've become used to being recognized on the street, but this time was different: the looks weren't cast in my direction, but at the two beauties by my side. I had every single feeling, all at once. What are you doing ogling my babies I will cut you but also aren't they gorgeous but also, wait, no one's gazing at me? When did that happen? Am I over? Protectiveness, pride, melancholy\u2014it all smacked me upside the head in one quintessential New York minute.",
      "There was also the time I was doing a photo shoot, and after a couple shots I took a peek at the monitor. \"I think there's some dust on the camera lens,\" I said to the photographer, pointing to a weird line on my cheek. His response was something to the effect of a pitying \"Awww, you're cute.\" There was no dust. That \"something\" was a wrinkle.",
      "I didn't have my first child until I was thirty-seven. I went through a hard time after I had Rowan, suffering from postpartum depression, which I wrote about in my first book, Down Came the Rain. But with the help of good medical professionals and the right medication, I felt like myself again, more or less, by her first birthday. I had Grier when I was forty, and the ensuing decade felt, in a word, playful. That was a brand-new feeling for me. I remember thinking in my forties, This isn't old at all! This is fun! Keep in mind, I'd been treated like an adult (and was expected to behave like one) since I was a kid. At forty, it was as though my biological age finally aligned with the age I'd felt for decades. I felt mature yet still playful. I was firing on all cylinders, and at the risk of sounding like Maria von Trapp, the world seemed full of possibilities. I felt like I was being primed for a moment when I could finally pat myself on the back and say \"You've earned it!\" if I chose to take a break. Plus, I'd arrived at a place of self-acceptance. I actually liked my body and no longer compared it to the runway models. (I never did runway and believed those girls were \"skinny,\" whereas I was considered \"athletic\"\u2014in my modeling days, a euphemism for \"not skinny.\") At forty, relieving myself of being compared to others felt like freedom. Mine was a body to be proud of. This body gave me babies! This body could dance! I had curves and was okay with that! It wasn't exactly \"I am woman, hear me roar,\" but I certainly felt like, \"I am woman, hear me more.\"",
      "And yet, as my forties progressed into my fifties, I began to notice that external perceptions didn't seem to match up with my internal sense of self. My industry no longer received me with the same enthusiasm I had come to expect. The vibe from casting agents and producers, but also my fans, was more: you need to stop time ... and maybe even reverse it. Case in point: at a routine dermatological appointment (to get a mole checked out), the doctor, unsolicited, waved his hand around my face and said, \"We could fix all that ...\"",
      "\"All what?\" I asked.",
      "\"You know, all the\"\u2014cue more hand waving\u2014\"you know.\"",
      "What the hell? Who asked for your opinion? I thought as I heard myself say, \"Thank you, but not yet.\"",
      "Maybe it took seeing myself through the eyes of other people to fully understand that, in fact, I was entering a new era of life. I mean, I was aware that some things were changing. I get tired now in a way I never did before. I literally can't read the fine print, and I hate it. I used to get mad at my mom for always misplacing her reading glasses, and now it's me saying \"Grier, honey, have you seen my readers?\" I like doing needlepoint and puzzles, which admittedly feels a bit geriatric. Am I in my mahjongg era?? I need 2.5s for these granny activities!",
      "And yes, sometimes I put on a pair of pants that once fit, and think, God, this used to be so much easier. Or I watch my kids, who can sleep until noon without stirring at the garbage trucks or sirens outside, and think, Ah, youth. There was a time when I could go to bed without taking a pill or being up for hours in the middle of the night, what was that like? And though these shockingly beautiful young women spend hours in front of the very mirrors I try to avoid, they still don't realize how fresh and perky and unaffected by gravity their bodies are\u2014just like we didn't at their age. (I mean, the butt and the boobs! How did I not appreciate that when I had it?) They complain that they hate their legs, whereas my knees are now practically lower than my calves. How is that even a thing? We are always chasing, never appreciating, and what runs through my mind is, Ugh, where is the justice?? Why are we forever criticizing ourselves and our bodies while seeking ridiculous perfection? Why do we never see how unique and special we are? And why, when we finally take the pressure off or count our blessings or just enjoy who we are, is it practically too late?",
      "But while I don't feel as invincible as I did in my youth, I also don't feel fifty-nine. When I was a kid, fifty-nine seemed so OLD, but it sure doesn't feel old to me now! When I say my age out loud, I know it may sound old to some people, but I truly don't feel, in any way, aged. Aging is a journey full of contradictions, especially in America. It's humbling and surprising and empowering and daunting and liberating. In plenty of cultures, older people are revered. In Korea, the sixtieth and seventieth birthdays are considered major life events, marked by parties and feasts. In Native American communities, elders are often referred to as \"wisdom-keepers\"\u2014they're considered community leaders. In India, elders have the final word in family disputes. In the Henchy-Shields household, on the other hand, this elder is constantly told, \"Mom, you just don't get it!\"",
      "In fact, a March 2023 cover story of the American Psychological Association's Monitor on Psychology described ageism in America as \"one of the last socially acceptable prejudices.\" Brands trip over themselves to capture the coveted eighteen-to-thirty-four demographic, even though surveys have found it's women over forty who have the most purchasing power: we have accumulated wealth, and we're making 85 percent of the household-buying decisions. The numbers for women over fifty are even more staggering: We control a net worth of $19 trillion, and spend 2.5 times that of the average person. Women in their forties and fifties are treated like we're invisible, even though we're one of the fastest-growing demographics in the country. (One in four Americans is a woman over forty.) We are ignored by brands, and when we are targeted, it's for wrinkle cream or menopause supplements. Talk about shortsighted.",
      "This notion of invisibility is so widespread, so pervasive, that it has become the namesake of a social phenomenon, aptly dubbed \"invisible woman syndrome.\" The gist? When we are no longer deemed sexy or able to contribute to society by birthing and raising young children, our value diminishes. We are overlooked, ignored, or worse, not seen at all.",
      "And the older we get, the more extreme it gets. An analysis of nearly eleven thousand ads featuring over twenty thousand people in 2021 and 2022 found that those featuring women over sixty years old amounted to a whopping 0.93 percent of all advertisements. You read that right: less than one percent of all advertisements feature women over sixty, even though the 2020 census found that one in six people in America is over sixty-five.",
      "According to a survey of women over forty by the advertising agency Fancy (which is specifically focused on marketing to a female audience), most women over forty feel that brands \"underestimate their spending power and intelligence while overestimating their preoccupation with appearance.\" We are, it turns out, more than just a demographic obsessed with looking younger. We embody vitality. We are smart and vibrant and powerful and ambitious. We are experienced, confident, capable, and complicated. We are running s**t.",
      "The truth is, I still can't quite get over that I'm using words like \"aging\" and \"elder\" in the same breath as I talk about myself and my friends. I'm not even sixty! I may not be playing the ing\u00e9nue or the girl next door or even the first love, but I'm not exactly the grandmother in Titanic.",
      "And yet, no one knows what to do with me. After all, Brooke Shields is not allowed to get old. The sixteen-year-old Calvin Klein model? Time magazine's face of the '80s? It's sacrilegious! I remember seeing a picture of what Marilyn Monroe would look like if she were still alive today, and it was truly impossible to wrap my head around. But she died looking like Marilyn Monroe. For me, as my body and face change in all the ways they should (don't get me started on my thinning, graying eyebrows), there is this sense of How dare you? That was never the plan, young lady! And, to be totally honest, there have been times when it's made me feel like a disappointment. Maybe you've felt this way, too\u2014maybe you were an athlete in your youth, singled out for your form and speed, and now you can still swim or run or play tennis or whatever, but not at the same level. You're still strong, but you had the audacity to grow older, to change, to slow down a bit, to not die young or stop aging entirely. You survived, and it should be celebrated, and yet there's a sense that you're not as valuable or exceptional as you once were, and therefore you're letting people down. And these reactions can cause us to feel disappointed in ourselves, too. I look back sometimes and feel like I've done something wrong because I no longer have the body or the face that I used to have. And yet, if I did anything drastic to hold on to my looks from my youth or to stop aging, I'd be judged or chastised for that, too.",
      "Generally speaking, at fifty-nine, I feel more confident than I ever have. I'm more comfortable in my skin and have stopped comparing myself to this ideal or worrying about that expectation. But I'll admit that even as I'm experiencing this newfound sense of satisfaction, I have to remind myself, sometimes daily, that I am good enough. The old negative tapes are lying in wait in the Walkman (remember those!?), ready for me to press play at any moment. But I also realize that if I don't wear makeup or the \"right-sized jeans and someone has a problem with it, that's on them. And yes, I continue to exercise and take care of my skin, but I think of it now as a privilege, because it makes me feel better. Do I sometimes wish that all my bits had remained higher and perkier? Or that I had the same skin that appeared on the cover of Life magazine in 1983? Of course I do! Who doesn't miss the gifts of youth? But this is a body\u2014and soul\u2014that has carried me through a lot, and I'm not ashamed to admit that I think I deserve some credit for this life well lived. We do all this work and get through hard times and suddenly you have a line on your face, and that one little wrinkle carries more weight than decades of accomplishments.",
      "I'll tell you, it took me a long time to have the guts to say that I deserved a bit more respect. Something began to shift in me around age forty. I started to own myself and my narrative in a new way. I'm not sure what it was that finally clicked, though becoming a mother probably had something to do with it. What I do know is that gaining that deeper sense of identity allowed me to speak up when others tried to diminish me. It's allowed me to look within and identify patterns and break cycles. It's allowed me to take on new risks and challenges. I know who I am and what I have to offer, and I've stopped hoping or trying to be different, or something that I'm not.",
      "Of course, as proud as I am of how far I've come ... there is still so much that I want to do. I want to pile into a camper with my daughters and my husband and take a cross-country road trip (although we'd probably end up killing each other, and the romance of the Porta Potti would surely wear off quickly). I want to learn to play an instrument. I want to get back to being fluent in French (it was my college major, after all). I want to travel to places I haven't been. The list goes on.",
      "All of this is doable, because there's a lot of freedom that comes with age. It's more fun to take a dance class when you can truly let yourself dance like no one is watching. It's more fun to go out with friends when you aren't worrying if you said the wrong thing or if people are talking about you behind your back. It's more fun to go to a restaurant alone when you realize that no one is wondering why you don't have a companion ... that no one is looking at you at all, because they're all dealing with their own s**t. And while, yes, my body is a little creakier than it once was, and it's not as easy to lose weight, the truth is I can still do almost everything I used to do. And the things I can't, well, I don't really want to. I don't want to surf ... I don't want to ski, unless it's somewhere sunny and the trail is long and relatively flat\u2014I just don't feel like exposing myself to freezing temperatures, fighting scary moguls, and navigating with the gear. But I don't feel limited. I'm happy that, at least for me, the moment for more intense, competitive activities has passed, and the moment for new emotional beginnings has arrived. I don't have to prove myself anymore. This is it. This is me! And if there is something I want to change, then I can make the decision to do so.",
      "What I've come to realize\u2014not only from my own lived experience but also from conversations with other women my age\u2014is that these \"later\" years are all about coming into your own and pivoting in the directions you've always wanted to go. You can finally live the life you intended to, because you no longer have to act in accordance with external timelines, something that is part and parcel of being a woman. I don't have to get married by this date or have kids by this age or get a certain job before that milestone. My time is my own.",
      "And yet\u2014 this newfound gift has come as a bit of a surprise. After all, the narrative we've been served for years is that it's all downhill for women after a certain age. As I hit my midfifties, I grew increasingly curious about the disconnect between how this age feels and how it's portrayed in our culture and society. I talked to other women my age who felt the same tension I did\u2014 both personally empowered and systemically dismissed. And this idea of being collectively ignored ... it irked me. I started connecting even more with women over forty, online and on social media, because I wanted to dig into what makes aging hard and what makes it great. What began as an online community to discuss health, aging, sexuality, relationships, and just plain living\u2014to dish about all those things you can't say to anyone except your closest girlfriends\u2014evolved into a hair-care brand, Commence, and a new business. So here I am, a first-time CEO in my fifties, inspired to start a business\u2014and write a book!\u2014all because of society's most uninspiring take on women my age.",
      "My first two memoirs, Down Came the Rain and There Was a Little Girl, were at their core about overcoming obstacles: first, postpartum depression, and second, losing my mom. But there is nothing to \"overcome\" about aging. That's the whole point! This time of our lives is something to enjoy and revel in, not something to merely survive. So if those books were about how I persevered through tough moments, this one is about how I took ownership and agency of a moment I'd been told would be tough, but really is rich and complex. But come on, life is complex. This book is about embracing an era that has been billed as an obstacle when, in reality, it's a stimulus. Yes, it has new and difficult challenges, but it doesn't have to be viewed as torture or a time to throw in the towel. I'm not trying to stave off this period, or deny it, or pretend I'm not in it. I'm taking the whole mess of it and reminding myself, and hopefully other women, that we have the elements we need to thrive. The story we've been told is, in a word, bulls**t. We are the narrators of our next chapters.",
      "For too long, women have talked about aging only in whispers and behind closed doors. Maybe it's because we've been embarrassed or ashamed. Maybe it's because we don't think anyone would want to hear what we have to say. These are understandable responses to our treatment by society, but they only serve to keep us isolated and disempowered. Recently, I had the pleasure of attending an intimate \"couch conversation\" with Gloria Steinem where she was talking about the challenges of being a woman today. The younger women in the room were eagerly asking her, \"But how can we fix it? How can we be a force for change?\" And she reminded us that \"every important movement started in a room like this\u2014in a basement, or a living room.\" When we step out from behind those closed doors and use our voices to talk about the misunderstandings, the underestimations, we're already starting to change them. Maybe even fix them.",
      "As far as I can tell, these decades in our lives are a time to be celebrated. Sure, there will be some hot flashes (been there!), but we can wear layers. (Or take hormones, which I have done, but more on that later.) I can tell you that the discomfort of those moments is far outweighed by the delight that comes from making intentional friendships, pursuing new interests, discovering our peak confidence, and giving ourselves permission to make changes to our lives.",
      "In 2023, my dear friend Ali Wentworth produced a documentary, Pretty Baby, about my life. Watching it, and seeing just how much I've been through, I couldn't help but feel proud. I'm not saying everyone should make a documentary about their lives, but I hope you can look back at how far you've come, how much life you've lived in order to get to this moment, and give yourself credit for the feat that it is. And then I hope it gives you the jump start you need to figure out how to enjoy this new stage of your life. Because the time is now! If there is something you want to change, now's the time to change it. If there's something you want to stop, now's the time to stop it. If there's something you want to do, now's the time to do it.",
      "Being relegated to the sidelines, as misguided as it is, also offers us more room to fully be ourselves. There's less pressure. We can push boundaries when we're moving through the world without the watchful eyes of, well, everyone. In Why We Can't Sleep: Women's New Midlife Crisis, author Ada Calhoun reconsiders all the so-called negatives of getting older. \"Could we see ... our newfound midlife invisibility as a source of power?\" she writes. \"There are great advantages to being underestimated. Two of the best reporters I know are women in their fifties. They look so friendly and nonthreatening, if you notice them at all. They can lurk in any room without usually wary people remembering to keep their guard up. Then they write devastating whistle-blowing articles. The world ignores middle-aged women at its peril.\"",
      "At fifty-nine, I'm the one making the calls in my life\u2014not my mother or the media or Hollywood or my family\u2014which is something I've never felt before. And this should be true for all of us. It doesn't matter what you've done, or what you think you've done (good or bad), or even what you always wanted to do. This is a new time. The same rules don't apply. Is that disorienting? Maybe, but I like to give it a different spin: We can make our own rules.",

    "published": "Sun, 12 Jan 2025 10:08:10 -0500",
    "summary": "Now nearly 60, the model and actress was recently elected president of Actors' Equity, and launched Commence, her beauty brand for women over 40. She's also written her fourth book, \"Brooke Shields Is Not Allowed to Get Old,\"",
    "story": [
      "Last Sunday, Demi Moore accepted her first major acting award at the Golden Globes. Watching from home was Brooke Shields \"My kids'll be like, 'Oh, it's Golden Globe night. Get the bottle of wine for Mom! Get the tequila!'\" Shields laughed. \"It's so interesting, these award shows, right? They can be torturous if you sit there and you go like, Why am I not valid enough to get that, do that, whatever?\"",
      "I asked, \"You've felt that?\"",
      "\"I've felt it my entire life.\"",
      "It can be surprising to hear that a veteran actress like Shields yearns for acceptance. Turns out she's totally human. \"I was listening to Demi, 'We've weren't the ones that ever got awards.' Like, no. I got People's Choice Awards! The people loved me.\"",
      "\"So, you get the People's Choice Award, but you wanted the Emmy, the Oscar?\"",
      "\"You just wanted, like, to be part of the group, the cool kids,\" said Shields. \"That's where the little insecure girl comes out.\"",
      "At this point in her career of six decades, the comedienne has earned the right to laugh at herself.",
      "Currently 59, Shields said she feels 38. \"I definitely feel a youthfulness that I didn't feel in my younger years,\" she said.",
      "She started modeling while wearing diapers. Later, she turned heads wearing Calvin Klein jeans. Shields was expected to sell products and say her lines, all while looking gorgeous. She delivered.",
      "But as she approaches 60, she's found a cultural script she's powerfully rejecting.",
      "\"By the time you get to 50, they've just completely written you off,\" she said. \"You are out to pasture. Society says, 'Oh, if you're not the hot twenty-something at the bar, you're an old lady.' There's this whole demo in the middle that gets just overlooked.\"",
      "It's those overlooked women for whom Shields has written her fourth book: \"Brooke Shields Is Not Allowed to Get Old\" (to be published Tuesday by Flatiron). \"When you are someone that has been noted for looking a certain way, by virtue of just growing older, you become a disappointment, in a way,\" she said. \"I've watched people get sort of personally affronted that I dare to be 60!\"",
      "\"And what do you say to them?\"",
      "\"I just sort of feel bad for them,\" Shields said. \"And I'm a part of the problem, because I was that symbol, you know, maybe unwittingly. But I didn't set out to do that.\"",
      "Nearly 44 years after being named the face of a decade, Shields hopes to be a voice for her generation \u2013 empowering women by sharing her personal and at times vulnerable experiences.",
      "In her book, she reveals that a doctor performed a surgery on her that she did not consent to. \"I was asked by my gynecologist if I experienced discomfort, and I said yes.\"",
      "In the late 2000s, Shields went to a surgeon to help reduce some labia discomfort. But after the operation, she says she found out he performed an extra procedure: an unwanted vaginal rejuvenation. \"He literally looked at me and said, like, 'I tightened you up a bit,'\" Shields said. \"And I was like, 'What?' And he just sort of was, like, boasting that he 'threw in a little bonus' for me. And I was in such shock that I just, I became numb. I didn't even know what to do.\"",
      "\"What did you say?\"",
      "\"I didn't say it, I didn't say a thing. because it sounded like he wanted me to thank him,\" Shields replied. \"I didn't say anything then, and this is the first time I've said anything.\"",
      "That so-called bonus surgery has had lasting side effects. The actress and model says sex can be painful.",
      "\"This was, you know, a long time ago. We didn't know what we could fight or complain. I finally had a life and kids, and it was like, 'Dear God, I don't want that kind of attention,'\" she said.",
      "So, why is she speaking out now? \"Because I have daughters. And there's no shame around it. And the more we have those conversations with them, conversations that I never had, the more progress I think we will have as women.\"",
      "Shields is looking to make progress in other ways, too. In May, she was elected president of Actors' Equity Association, the union representing 51,000 actors and stage managers around the country. As a five-time Broadway star, she felt a responsibility to give back to a community that's embraced her.",
      "She's already taken her fight to Washington for more funding and to change tax policy. \u00a0\"It's been a learning curve,\" she said. \"It's trial by fire. I'd never gone on the Hill and met with Congressmen and Senators. But you know, producers need to take care of the people that bleed for them on a daily basis.\"",
      "Besides being a union boss, Shields is now a CEO. She'd founded the beauty brand Commence, after hearing concerns from aging women about their hair. \"They have felt overlooked, and that's just the truth,\" she said. \"They're not being marketed to.\"",
      "Asked what the hardest part of being a CEO is, Shields replied, \"Money raising. Keeping the money flowing, because you have to put it right back into the company. And you know, nobody's getting salaries yet. Least I'm not!\" she laughed.",
      "Don't ask Brooke Shields if she's ready to slow down. Age has brought wisdom, and she's just getting started.",
      "\"I'm, you know, going to be 60 years old,\" she said. \"I'm still here. I feel like I'm at the beginning of a new, really exciting stage. The more confident you get \u2013 isn't it interesting \u2013 the more opportunity you get. And yet, you couldn't have arrived at said confidence without going through all the time to get here.\"",

    "title": "Wendell Pierce: An actor's journey",
    "published": "Sun, 12 Jan 2025 09:40:16 -0500",
    "summary": "With standout roles in \"The Wire,\" \"Death of a Salesman,\" and the CBS drama \"Elsbeth,\" the acclaimed actor talks about his childhood in New Orleans, training at New York's Juilliard School, and tackling the character of Willy Loman.",
    "story": [
      "It's been a few years since Wendell Pierce attended a drama class at the Juilliard School in Manhattan. Forty years, to be exact. \"I remember it well. High windows and gray floors!\" he laughed.",
      "He's said that nothing in his career gave him as much anxiety as training at Juilliard: \"Yes, the anxiety of, you know, am I doing the right thing? I'm going into an unknown world. Will I have what it takes to be just a working actor? And so, I was reminded looking in that class, it was very touching to see these young people at a point in the journey that I recall with fondness \u2013 and with a lot of anxiety, too! But I knew I was exactly where I wanted to be.\"",
      "And it's where he belongs. At 61, Pierce is among the most prolific and respected actors of his generation, with standout roles in \"The Wire,\" \"Treme,\" \"Suits,\" \"Selma,\" and now, the quirky CBS drama, \"Elsbeth.\" Later this year, he'll play editor-in-chief Perry White in the newest Superman movie. He'll also take on Othello at the Shakespeare Theater Company in Washington, D.C.",
      "No matter the part, Pierce brings his own humanity to it. He said, \"In every role, there's a little part of Wendell in it. At the end of the run, I turn the lights down low in the dressing room and I just see the silhouette in the mirror. And I have a good cry and say goodbye. Right? I say, 'Man, you taught me so much about myself. I've learned so much from you. I hope I see you again. And I know there'll be times where I will see you again.'\"",
      "That sense of self-discovery began in his hometown of New Orleans, and the historical Black neighborhood of Pontchatrain Park. \"It was like a Black Mayberry,\" he said. \"The first Black mayor came out of there, the first Black DA. Lawyers, doctors, postal workers, maintenance men. That was the community I grew up in. It was absolutely wonderful. And it was totally destroyed. We were destroyed by Katrina. We were part of the deepest flooding. And we brought it back, and now we're on the National Register of Historic Places.\"",
      "His mother, Althea, was a beloved schoolteacher. \"She taught everybody in the neighborhood. And I just remember how, everywhere I went, I knew that I had to live up to being her son,\" Pierce said.",
      "His father, Amos Pierce, Jr., was a World War II veteran. \"He was Army unit attached to the 3rd Marines in the invasion of Saipan. And after that, his unit received medals of commendation. And because he was there with the Black unit, the officer didn't believe him when he told him. He said, 'Listen, I think we received medals.' And it was a woman who said, 'Yeah, right. You? You didn't receive anything.'\"",
      "It would take 65 years for the injustice to be corrected. \"We gave him his medals on Veteran's Day 2010,\" Pierce said. \"I tell that story to say that he was a man who loved this country even when the country didn't love him back. And even after receiving the medals, there was a great pride. He didn't let the anger destroy him. And that was a great lesson.\"",
      "Pierce sees his own life as a series of lessons \u2013 and acting is part of that journey. He said, \"Every audition for me is an opening and closing night, where you get to perform: This is what I would do with this material. You do whatever you like from this point on. And then you leave the room.\"",
      "And he says his best work \u2013 be it as Detective Bunk Moreland on \"The Wire,\" or in Spike Lee's \"Malcolm X,\" comes from the writing. He said, \"The really good material is the thing that will define it, you know, and make it classic. Something that speaks to people across time and place no matter where you are, that's gonna speak to people years from now.\"",
      "A career highlight was in 2022, when Pierce became the first Black actor to play Willy Loman on Broadway, in Arthur Miller's \"Death of a Salesman.\"",
      "Why does he think it took so long? \"The ignorance of biases and bigotry, and when people just don't have the ability to see others' humanity,\" Pierce said. \"And it's something that people are very conscious of at times, and then sometimes they're not very conscious of it.\"",
      "Actor Wendell Pierce discusses historic role in Broadway's \"Death of a Salesman\" (\"CBS Saturday Morning\")",
      "Actor Wendell Pierce discusses historic role in Broadway's \"Death of a Salesman\" (\"CBS Saturday Morning\")",
      "And it's Pierce's own compassion that draws people towards him, like Carrie Preston, his co-star on \"Elsbeth.\" She said, \"This kind of connection isn't always guaranteed. We've got it here. I'm grateful for it.\"",
      "And it's what his fellow Juilliard classmate Bradley Whitford recalled when he surprised Pierce with a message during our interview: \"Wendell, I miss you. I love you. I am so proud of you, not only for the great actor that you are and the dear friend, but what an amazing citizen you are. I love you!\"",
      "\"That's very special,\" said Pierce. \"Brad and I, we're part of a very special group here at Juilliard, our class. You know, when you go through the fire together, you're connected forever.\"",
      "Pierce has said he wants to make his mark. I asked, \"Do you think that you have? And what is that mark? What do you want to leave for people?\"",
      "\"I was afraid that I may not have the opportunity to leave my mark, that my best days were behind me,\" he replied. \"I had that fear, and I tapped into that fear when I did 'Death of a Salesman.' And while I still have the fear, now I have courage.",
      "\"I hope I can have an impact on someone else that way, the way they have an impact on me.\"",

    "summary": "Sam Moore, who influenced musicians including Michael Jackson, Al Green and Bruce Springsteen, was inducted with Dave Prater into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.",
    "story": [
      "Sam Moore, the surviving half and higher voice of the 1960s duo Sam & Dave that was known for such definitive hits of the era as \"Soul Man\" and \"Hold On, I'm Comin,'\" has died. He was 89.",
      "Publicist Jeremy Westby said Moore died Friday morning in Coral Gables, Florida, due to complications while recovering from surgery. No additional details were immediately available.",
      "Moore, who influenced musicians including Michael Jackson, Al Green and Bruce Springsteen, was inducted with Dave Prater into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.",
      "At the Memphis, Tennessee-based Stax Records, Moore and Prater were second only to Otis Redding. They transformed the \"call and response\" of gospel music into a frenzied stage show and recorded some of soul music's most enduring hits, which also included \"You Don't Know Like I Know,\" \"When Something is Wrong With My Baby\" and \"I Thank You.\"",
      "Most of their hits were written and produced by the team of Isaac Hayes and David Porter and featured the Stax house band Booker T. & the MGs, whose guitarist Steve Cropper received one of music's most famous shoutouts when Sam & Dave called \"Play it, Steve\" midway through \"Soul Man.\"",
      "Like many '60s soul acts, Sam & Dave faded after the 1960s. But \"Soul Man\" hit the charts again in the late 1970s when the Blues Brothers, John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd recorded it with many of the same musicians. Moore had mixed feelings about the hit becoming associated with the \"Saturday Night Live\" stars, remembering how young people believed it originated with the Blues Brothers.",
      "In 2008, the movie \"Soul Men\" depicted a pair of aging, estranged singers who bore more than a little resemblance to Sam & Dave. Moore lost a lawsuit claiming the resemblance was too close.",
      "He also spent years suing Prater after Prater hired a substitute and toured as the New Sam & Dave. Prater died in a 1988 car crash in Georgia.",
      "Moore also pressed legal claims that the record industry had cheated him out of retirement benefits. Moore and other artists sued multiple record companies and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists in 1993.",
      "Moore told The Associated Press in 1994 that he joined the legal effort after learning that, despite his million-selling records, his pension amounted to just $2,285, which he could take as a lump sum or in payments of $73 monthly.",
      "\"Two thousand dollars for my lifetime?\" Moore said then. \"If you're making a profit off of me, give me some too. Don't give me cornbread and tell me it's biscuits.\"",
      "Moore wrote the song \"Dole Man,\" modeled on \"Soul Man,\" for Republican Bob Dole's presidential campaign in 1996. In 2017, he was among the few entertainers who performed for Republican President Donald Trump's inaugural festivities. Eight years earlier, Moore had objected when Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama's campaign used the song \"Hold On, I'm Comin'.\"",
      "Moore was born Oct. 12, 1935, in Miami and got his start singing in church.",
      "He and Prater performed in soul and R&B clubs in the 1950s but didn't meet until 1961 in Miami. Moore helped coach Prater on the lyrics of a song and they quickly became a popular local duo. In 1965, after signing with Atlantic Records, producer Jerry Wexler sent them to the label's Stax subsidiary in Memphis.",
      "Moore and Prater argued often and Moore told the AP in 2006 that a drug habit, which he kicked in 1981, played a part in the band's troubles and later made entertainment executives leery of giving him a fresh start. The duo broke up in 1970 and neither had another major hit.",
      "He married his wife, Joyce, in 1982, and she helped him get treatment for his addiction which he credited with saving his life.",
      "\"I did a lot of cruise ships, I did a lot of oldies shows,\" during those struggles, he said, adding that he once opened for a group of Elvis impersonators.",
      "\"That's funny to think back to it now. And I did a lot of shows where if I did a show with an oldie show, I had to actually audition,\" he said. \"But you know what? You keep your mouth shut and you get up there and you sing as hard and perform as hard as you can, and get the little money and go on about your business and try and pay those bills. I'm laughing about it now, but at that time, man, it was really serious.\"",
      "Moore kept recording and singing. He was a frequent performer at the Kennedy Center Honors and performed for presidents, including Obama.",

    "summary": "Court to hear arguments Friday on law forcing TikTok sale by Chinese parent company that takes effect in Jan. 19.",
    "story": [
      "In one of the most important cases of the social media age, free speech and national security collide at the Supreme Court on Friday in arguments over the fate of TikTok, a wildly popular digital platform that roughly half the people in the United States use for entertainment and information.",
      "TikTok could shut down the social media site in the U.S. by Jan. 19 unless the Supreme Court strikes down or otherwise delays the effective date of a law aimed at forcing TikTok's sale by its Chinese parent company.",
      "\"Absent such relief, the Act will take effect on January 19, 2025,\" TikTok said in a Dec. 9 legal filing. \"That would shut down TikTok\u2014one of the Nation's most popular speech platforms \u2014 for its more than 170 million domestic monthly users on the eve of a presidential inauguration.\"",
      "The TikTok ban heads to the Supreme Court tomorrow. Here's what to know about the case.",
      "The TikTok ban heads to the Supreme Court tomorrow. Here's what to know about the case.",
      "Working on a tight deadline, the justices also have before them a plea from President-elect Donald Trump, who has dropped his earlier support for a ban, to give him and his new administration time to reach a \"political resolution\" and avoid deciding the case. It's unclear if the court will take the Republican president-elect's views \u2014 a highly unusual attempt to influence a case \u2014 into account.",
      "TikTok and China-based ByteDance, as well as content creators and users, argue the law is a dramatic violation of the Constitution's free speech guarantee.",
      "\"Rarely if ever has the court confronted a free-speech case that matters to so many people,\" lawyers for the users and content creators wrote. Content creators are anxiously awaiting a decision that could upend their livelihoods and are eyeing other platforms.",
      "The case represents another example of the court being asked to rule about a medium with which the justices have acknowledged they have little familiarity or expertise, though they often weigh in on meaty issues involving restrictions on speech.",
      "How TikTok could avoid a ban",
      "TikTok has several pathways to avoid a ban outside of Supreme Court intervention,\u00a0experts told CBS News.",
      "Trump could take action once he's in office and ask the Justice Department not to enforce the law or prosecute tech companies, like Apple and Google, who host TikTok in their app stores. Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law after Jan. 19, though he would have to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "TikTok won't disappear from Americans' phones on Jan. 19 if the law takes effect. However, users would not be able to update the app and those who don't already have it would not be able to download it.",
      "The Biden administration, defending the law that President Joe Biden signed in April after it was approved by wide bipartisan majorities in Congress, contends that \"no one can seriously dispute that (China's) control of TikTok through ByteDance represents a grave threat to national security.\"",
      "Officials say Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok's U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread or suppress information.",
      "But the government \"concedes that it has no evidence China has ever attempted to do so,\" TikTok told the justices, adding that limits on speech should not be sustained when they stem from fears that are predicated on future risks.",
      "In December, a panel of three appellate judges, two appointed by Republicans and one by a Democrat, unanimously upheld the law and rejected the First Amendment speech claims.",
      "Trump urges court to pause",
      "Adding to the tension, the court is hearing arguments just nine days before the law is supposed to take effect and 10 days before a new administration takes office.",
      "In language typically seen in a campaign ad rather than a legal brief, lawyers for Trump have called on the court to temporarily prevent the TikTok ban from going into effect but refrain from a definitive resolution.",
      "\"President Trump alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns expressed by the Government \u2014 concerns which President Trump himself has acknowledged,\" D. John Sauer, Trump's choice to be his administration's top Supreme Court lawyer, wrote in a legal brief filed with the court.",
      "Trump took no position on the underlying merits of the case, Sauer wrote. Trump's campaign team used TikTok to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, and Trump met with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, in December. He has 14.7 million followers on TikTok.",
      "The justices have set aside two hours for arguments, and the session likely will extend well beyond that. Three highly experienced Supreme Court lawyers will be making arguments. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar will present the Biden administration's defense of the law, while Trump's solicitor general in his first administration, Noel Francisco, will argue on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance. Stanford Law professor Jeffrey Fisher, representing content creators and users, will be making his 50th high court argument.",
      "If the law takes effect, Trump's Justice Department will be charged with enforcing it. Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance have argued that the new administration could seek to mitigate the law's most severe consequences.",
      "But they also said that a shutdown of just a month would cause TikTok to lose about one-third of its daily users in the U.S. and significant advertising revenue.",
      "As it weighs the case, the court will have to decide what level of review it applies to the law. Under the most searching review, strict scrutiny, laws almost always fail. But two judges on the appellate court that upheld the law said it would be the rare exception that could withstand strict scrutiny.",
      "TikTok, the app's users and many briefs supporting them urge the court to apply strict scrutiny to strike down the law.",
      "But the Democratic administration and some of its supporters cite restrictions on foreign ownership of radio stations and other sectors of the economy to justify the effort to counter Chinese influence in the TikTok ban.",
      "A decision could come within days.",
      "Editor's note: This story has been changed to clarify that TikTok could shut down on Jan. 19 if the Supreme Court rules against its request for a temporary injunction that would overturn or delay a law that could lead to a U.S. ban.",

Hall shared her story on \"CBS Mornings,\" explaining how Munn's advocacy for early detection, along with a breast cancer risk assessment tool, led to her life-saving diagnosis.",
      "Munn credited the risk assessment test, which uses various factors to evaluate lifetime breast cancer risk, for her early diagnosis. After hearing Munn's story, Hall decided to take the same test. To her surprise, a doctor revealed that Hall's lifetime risk for breast cancer was 36%.",
      "\"Wow, OK, that feels high,\" Hall said, after hearing the news.",
      "Hall, whose mother had breast cancer at age 50, had already undergone genetic testing for the BRCA gene in her 20s, which came back negative. She also had never had a mammogram until this year, after taking the risk assessment test.",
      "Following the assessment, Hall was placed on a regular screening schedule, including mammograms and MRIs every six months. After an MRI revealed some abnormalities, Hall underwent biopsies, which confirmed she had breast cancer.",
      "\"This is actually good news,\" her doctor told her. \"It's stage zero, the earliest it could possibly be caught.\"",
      "Hall was preparing to report on Munn's battle with breast cancer when she received her diagnosis. Hall described it as \"surreal\" to become part of the news.",
      "\"I was prepared to do the test in order to promote awareness for breast cancer, especially with it being a subject so close to my heart,\" she said. \"I didn't expect it to happen so soon, especially.\"",
      "Hall has chosen to undergo a double mastectomy next week to remove the current cancer and lower her risk of future diagnoses.",
      "\"I want to do whatever I can to prevent that for my future self and my future family,\" Hall said.",

      "Hall expressed deep gratitude for Munn's words and emphasized how sharing her story could help others.",
      "\"By Olivia sharing her story, she had a direct impact on my life,\" Hall said.",

      "More than 20 million egg-laying chickens in the U.S. died last quarter because of bird flu, data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture shows, marking the worst toll inflicted on America's egg supply since the outbreak began.",
      "The record number of chicken deaths, which includes those birds culled when infection is discovered in a flock, come as figures show egg prices have soared to the highest they have been in years, driven in large part by the virus.",
      "\"Unlike in past years, in 2024, all major production systems experienced significant losses including conventional caged, cage-free, and certified organic types,\" a USDA report said this month.",
      "Taxpayers will pick up the tab for the lost birds. To incentivize farmers to quickly report and stomp out the virus, a USDA program pays producers for the eggs and poultry they cull.",
      "Last year, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said it had spent $1.25 billion on payments to farmers since the outbreak started in 2022.",
      "Why are bird flu cases high right now in poultry?",
      "U.S. officials brace every winter for upticks in bird flu because migrating wild birds that spread the virus fly south during the colder months.",
      "It's also easier for the virus to spread in the winter. Heat and sunlight degrade the virus on surfaces, the USDA says.",
      "This winter has been different because a strain of the bird flu virus has spilled over into dairy herds too, leading to hundreds of infected herds.",
      "Authorities suspect the virus has been hitching a ride in droplets of contaminated raw milk. Those are ferried between farms by workers' clothing, equipment and animals shared between farms.",
      "California has been hit especially hard in recent months, forcing the state to declare a state of emergency to try to respond to the bird flu outbreak.",
      "This winter's surge of bird flu is from a different virus than the uptick of seasonal flu infections that also drives humans to emergency rooms every winter.",
      "While bird flu led to millions of dead poultry over the past year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has tallied only 66 confirmed human cases in the U.S. from bird flu viruses.",
      "Most American cases of bird flu have been mild. A majority were farm workers who were infected after close contact with animals infected by a bird flu strain that spilled over into dairy cows in late 2023.",
      "Researchers think\u00a0this bird flu strain mutated to be milder to humans than other variants spreading in the wild. Those other strains usually cause more severe disease when they jump into humans.",
      "Can animals be vaccinated for bird flu?",
      "The USDA announced this week it is drawing up a new stockpile of poultry vaccines. That vaccine will target the D1.1 strain of the virus, which has been spreading in wild birds and was recently to blame for a fatal human case in Louisiana.",
      "But officials said it's unlikely the vaccine will be used. The Biden administration has been weighing the possibility of vaccinating poultry for bird flu for years.",
      "That is different from plans to potentially vaccinate cows for bird flu, which the USDA says appears \"more feasible and more likely to be successful\" in battling the virus. Seven potential vaccines are now being tested in field safety trials, the department said.",
      "One major hurdle has been the fear that vaccines will only hide the symptoms of the otherwise highly lethal disease in birds. That could result in export restrictions from countries afraid the virus could spread to them through poultry products.",
      "In 2023, the USDA banned imports of some products from Europe after authorities announced they would start vaccinating some poultry for bird flu.",
      "Spread of the virus through contaminated meat in the U.S. has already happened during this year's outbreak at least twice: raw pet food made from sick animals was linked to an outbreak that killed cats in California and Oregon.",
      "A Food and Drug Administration spokesperson told CBS News that the agency is now urging the animal food supply chain to take steps to curb the threat of the virus spreading, including heat treatment to kill off the virus and avoiding using infected animals.",
      "\"All recent detections of H5N1 in cats had these things in common: the infected cats ate wild birds, unpasteurized milk, raw poultry, and/or raw poultry pet food,\" the spokesperson said.",

    "story": [
      "Food and Drug Administration officials turned up dozens of violations at a McDonald's supplier linked to a deadly outbreak of E. coli that led to more than a hundred infections and a sweeping recall of onions used in the fast food chain's products, including its Quarter Pounder burgers.",
      "The violations, detailed in an inspection report released to CBS News in response to a Freedom of Information Act request, were seen during an inspection of a food production facility in Colorado run by Taylor Farms.",
      "Their findings amounted to the FDA issuing the McDonald's supplier a so-called Form 483, a list of citations over conditions inspectors worried could be \"injurious to health.\"",
      "That facility had been tasked with supplying \"slivered onions\" to McDonald's restaurants across a broad swath of states. Taylor Farms also produces a number of other products, including salads it sells in grocery stores as safe and ready to eat.",
      "For restaurants, Taylor Farms\u00a0bills its products\u00a0as a \"prep-less kitchen solution,\" allowing food service workers to skip the usual preparation steps they would need to use with ordinary produce that should be washed and cut before eating.",
      "\"We hold our suppliers to the highest expectations and standards of food safety. Prior to this inspection, and unrelated to its findings, McDonald's stopped sourcing from Taylor Farms' Colorado Springs facility,\" McDonald's said in a statement.",
      "The company pointed to its October announcement\u00a0following the outbreak that it would stop buying onions from Taylor Farms in Colorado \"indefinitely,\" switching suppliers for some 900 restaurants that had relied on the plant.",
      "\"Taylor Farms is confident in our best-in-class food safety processes, and in turn, the quality and safety of our products. As is common following an inspection, FDA issued observations of conditions that could be improved at one of our facilities,\" Taylor Farms said in a statement.",
      "The company \"immediately took steps to address\" the issues, the statement said, and added that the FDA classified\u00a0the inspection as not resulting in \"administrative or regulatory action\" against the company.",
      "\"This is consistent with the fact that no illnesses or public health threat has been linked to these observations,\" Taylor Farms said.",
      "Taylor Farms ultimately recalled thousands of cases of ready-to-eat onions that it had distributed to food service facilities in six states following the outbreak.",
      "At least 104 cases of E. coli infections were linked to the outbreak, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including 34 hospitalizations and one death.",
      "\"Should have been marked as a 'fail'\"",
      "FDA inspectors said they discovered \"numerous equipment with apparent biofilm and large amounts of food debris\" around the Taylor Farms facility in Colorado Springs, even after workers had supposedly completed their required cleaning procedures.",
      "The FDA said that Taylor Farms quality control officials had signed off on cleaning at the facility as passing, even when agency inspectors said they could still see \"several food contact surfaces that were not visually clean and should have been marked as a 'Fail'.\"",
      "Food debris building up on the company's equipment was so bad that it was leading to cross-contamination, the FDA's inspectors worried. A company that had been buying green peppers from Taylor Farms complained that onions had found their way into their ready-to-eat product.",
      "Workers were also cutting corners on required sanitation steps for themselves, the FDA's inspectors alleged.",

    "summary": "Abortion bans enacted since Roe v. Wade was overturned may be driving Americans to leave restrictive states, researchers find.",
    "story": [
      "When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, the majority of justices decided that the right to an abortion should be left up to individual states. Two years later, thousands of Americans in parts of the U.S. with strict abortion bans are deciding to leave those states, new research finds.",
      "Following the Dobbs decision, the 13 states with strict abortion bans, from Alabama to West Virginia, collectively lost a net 36,000 residents per quarter, meaning the difference between the number of people leaving the states versus those migrating in, according to the analysis from economists at Georgia Institute of Technology and The College of Wooster and published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research.",
      "The analysis, which is based on change-of-address data from the U.S. Postal Service, found that the state impact is larger among single-person households, which may suggest that younger people are moving out of abortion-banning states at a higher rate than families. That could be due to the greater challenges for families in trying to move, given the need to change schools or uproot careers for parents.",
      "A problem for states that ban abortion?",
      "While often framed as a cultural or religious issue, access to abortion also has far-reaching economic implications both for individuals and society at large. For instance, the financial toll on women without access to abortion services has been well documented, with the Turnaround Study finding that those denied the procedure had higher rates of financial problems and were more likely to rely on government aid like food stamps.",
      "The new research indicates that states with abortion bans could face long-term economic consequences if they lose significant numbers of residents \u2014 especially younger workers who are typically vital to a state's workforce.",
      "\"In terms of the implications for states' economies, our results suggest that employers in states with bans may face challenges in attracting and retaining workers, especially younger workers, which could impact economic growth and development,\" the researchers, Georgia Institute of Technology's Daniel L. Dench, Jason M. Lindo and Kelly Lifchez and The College of Wooster's Jancy Ling Liu, wrote in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The study didn't discern whether those moving out of states with abortion bans were men or women, or where they landed, including in states that have protected abortion. But the impact is significant enough that, over a five-year period, abortion-banning states could lose almost 1% of their population, the researchers said.",
      "Abortion bans and a weak safety net",
      "Separately, many of the states with strict abortion bans are failing to provide adequate safety nets, an analysis by the Associated Press found. These range from difficulty accessing programs such as food stamps to a lack of access to doctors due to maternal care deserts.",
      "Republican state leaders in Tennessee \u2014 one of the 13 states with a total abortion ban \u2014 argue that they are bolstering services for families. For instance, Tennessee boosted its Medicaid coverage for mothers in 2022 from 60 days postpartum to a year, which enabled an additional 3,000 moms to use the program each year.",
      "But Tennessee fared poorly at enrollment in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, Medicaid, and in having enough maternal care and requirements for paid family and medical leave, according to an October study\u00a0published in the American Journal of Public Health. Other states with abortion bans, including Alabama, Georgia and Missouri, also ranked poorly on a number of measures, the analysis found.",
      "Women with young children in states where abortion is banned or limited to early weeks of pregnancy said it can be tough to obtain social services, according to a\u00a0survey\u00a0by the health policy research organization KFF. Nearly half said it's difficult for women in their state to get food stamps, for example, compared with 3 in 10 in states where abortion is generally available.",
      "\"People who claim to be pro-life, who advocated for these abortion bans, often suggest that these policies are designed to protect children, women and families,\" said Dr. Nigel Madden, lead author of the\u00a0study. But weakness in the safety net shows \"the hypocrisy of that argument.\"",
      "Meanwhile, many younger Americans are paying attention to a state's access to reproductive care. In a 2022 Axios poll, about 6 in 10 people 18- to 29-years-old said a state's abortion laws would sway their decision on where to live from \"somewhat\" to \"a lot.\"",
      "To be sure, there are many reasons why people opt to move out of a particular state, the Georgia Institute of Technology and College of Wooster researchers noted. \"And abortion-ban states are different from states protecting or maintaining abortion access in other ways besides their policies on abortion,\" they added.",
      "But a lack of access to reproductive choice, social services and medical care may make abortion-strict states less attractive to some residents, particularly young Americans, the study concluded.",

    "summary": "Lower immunity to the new GII.17 strain could be leading to more infections.",
    "story": [
      "A new strain of norovirus now makes up a majority of outbreaks nationwide, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The new strain's emergence, found spreading throughout the country and on cruise ships, offers a possible explanation for the past month's steep wave of infections from the stomach bug.",
      "Scientists call this winter's dominant norovirus strain GII.17[P17]. Samples from patients in nearly 7 in 10 norovirus outbreaks have tested positive for the new strain so far this season, according to data from a network of public health laboratories called CaliciNet.",
      "\"It is too early to tell if this strain is associated with more severe norovirus disease but likely lower population immunity is the reason for the early surge of an otherwise seasonal increase of this virus,\" Jan Vinj\u00e9, head of the CDC's CaliciNet system, told CBS News in an email.",
      "All previous waves of norovirus in the U.S. since 2012 have been dominated by a different strain that scientists call GII.4, said Vinj\u00e9. This season, only around 7% of norovirus outbreaks have been linked to that GII.4 strain.",
      "Vinj\u00e9 said that the GII.17 strain is behind outbreaks \"everywhere\" across the country this season of the highly contagious virus, including on cruise ship outbreaks.",
      "The CDC tracked at least six norovirus outbreaks on vessels last month, marking the most reported in the month for over a decade.",
      "Norovirus is the most common cause of foodborne illness in the U.S. and almost always climbs around the country starting during the winter months.",
      "Many cases resolve on their own without needing to be tested or treated by doctors, making it impossible to know exactly how many Americans are sickened. However, virtually all data tracking the virus suggest norovirus is at peak levels throughout the country.",
      "Rates of positive norovirus tests from a different CDC network of laboratories have reached the highest weekly levels on record in years. Norovirus rates in figures from testing company BioFire Diagnostics are also now above previous seasonal peaks.",
      "In wastewater, samples collected by WastewaterSCAN have been \"high\" for norovirus across nearly all sites monitored by the firm across the country.",
      "While versions of GII.17 have been circulating for several decades, only in recent years has the strain driven large waves of infections. Some parts of Europe last year reported a \"sudden rise\" in GII.17. Japan and China reported their first waves from the strain after 2014.",
      "The CDC reported it had seen a rise in GII.17 cases last season, though it remained a minority of all norovirus outbreaks at the time in the U.S.",
      "Is GII.17 causing more or worse norovirus cases?",
      "Additional studies will also be needed to tease out whether GII.17 is leading to a difference in the severity of norovirus infections. Some previous changes to the virus have emerged without causing new or significantly worse symptoms.",
      "\"What we are seeing has happened before for noroviruses. Noroviruses are very diverse,\" said Marion Koopmans, head of the Erasmus MC Department of Viroscience.",
      "Koopmans, who oversees a global consortium of norovirus researchers, cautioned that data tracking norovirus cases still has gaps around the world. More studies are also needed to prove if there is an actual increase in illnesses being driven by the strain.",
      "\"There is insufficient surveillance (in my view) to really make the case that this is causing an increase in the number of cases, as we have a lot of norovirus infections each winter and the surveillance is rather patchy,\" said Koopmans.",
      "When the latest GII.4 strain, called the Sydney variant, emerged in 2012, initial data suggested it had driven an increase in outbreaks. The CDC later reported data from hospitals suggesting it had not actually led to significantly more or worse norovirus infections.",
      "\"Thus, the observed increase in outbreak activity during the 2012\u201313 season likely represents random seasonal and state variation rather than a direct result of the emergence of GII.4 Sydney,\" CDC scientists concluded at the time.",
      "Health officials in Wisconsin said earlier this month that they had seen a record-high number of norovirus outbreaks, but told CBS News they do not believe it is driving a major difference in symptoms or length of illness.",
      "\"It does not change any recommendations about prevention or spread. It just means we have a robust outbreak season and therefore an opportunity to really emphasize the importance of handwashing, staying home while sick and until at least 48 hours after recovery,\" said Elizabeth Goodsitt, spokesperson for the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, in an email.",

      "Specifically, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act would\u00a0make it illegal\u00a0for app stores from Google or Apple, as well as web-hosting services, to distribute or service TikTok. If ByteDance had started the process to sell TikTok, the president also could push pause on adoption of the law for 90 days.",
      "The Supreme Court on Jan. 11 heard arguments from government attorneys, who say TikTok poses a threat to U.S. national security, and from lawyers for the social media platform. Experts said the justices seemed receptive to the government's case, increasing the likelihood of a ban. Here's what that would mean for TikTok users in the U.S.",
      "Could I use TikTok after the ban?",
      "If the law goes into force on Jan. 19, people in the U.S. who have not already downloaded the TikTok app would no longer be able to access it. It will no longer be available for download in app stores, including Apple's and Google's.",
      "For TikTok users who already have the short-form video app on their devices, it remains to be seen what will happen to the app. In one scenario, it will go dark, and users will receive a notice indicating that it's not functional or available to them.",
      "\"They will get a notice that says, 'This service is not available in your country. That's most likely what will happen based on what we've seen in other countries that have banned certain platforms,\" Timothy Edgar, a professor of cybersecurity at Brown University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This generation may be in for a very rude awakening if the law goes into effect and they find a major social media platform that they came to rely on as creators, or just users, is suddenly not available.\"",
      "While such an action would be unprecedented in the U.S., that's been the experience of users of banned apps in other countries, added Edgar, who thinks this is most likely outcome in the U.S.",
      "Other cybersecurity experts say TikTok might not become inaccessible overnight, but rather that the user experience in the U.S. will degrade over time.",
      "\"If you already have TikTok on your phone you can still use it, but over time you will not receive any updates, so the app will become obsolete,\" said Qi Liao, a professor of computer and network security at Central Michigan University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Various issues could arise because TikTok may introduce new features or security patches, and the app in the U.S. will have a sluggish performance as well as security issues. So eventually TikTok users will probably stop using the vulnerable version.\"",
      "Could I access TikTok through a VPN?",
      "Edgar notes that the new law doesn't target users, meaning that even if the ban takes effect it wouldn't be illegal for people to have TikTok on their phones or to try to access the platform.",
      "Indeed, U.S.-based users would likely be able to work around the ban by using a virtual private network to access TikTok. VPNs offer privacy and can make U.S.-based computers appear to internet service providers to be based outside of the country.",
      "Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit focused on digital rights, told CBS MoneyWatch that U.S. TikTok users would likely be able to circumvent the ban via VPN, though that approach does carry risks.",
      "\"Presumably, it would work just fine,\" she said, while warning that \"a lot of free VPNs make money by selling user data.\"",
      "Galperin added that some providers of free VPN services have been known to install malware on users' devices. \"So I would advise people to be very careful about the VPN they choose,\" she said.",

The share of the science and engineering workforce that is foreign-born has grown over the past three decades, according to the National Science Foundation, while STEM workers have experienced some of the highest employment rates of any occupation over the past five years.",
      "Companies with the most H-1B workers",
      "Tech companies are some of the biggest beneficiaries of the H-1B program, which is intended to allow highly skilled foreigners to work in the U.S. Amazon received the most H1-B visas of any company in 2024, Department of Labor data shows. Microsoft, Google and Meta were also in the top 10, while Tesla now ranks No. 16, according to the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan think tank focused on trade and immigration issues.",
      "More H-1Bs visas were granted to software developers last year than for any other position.",
      "\"The H-1B visa is like the Swiss Army knife of visas. It's used for a lot of different purposes,\" said John Skrentny, a sociology professor at U.C. San Diego who wrote a book on why STEM graduates choose careers outside of the fields they studied. \"If you hear people say that the H-1B visa is very important for attracting the best and brightest to the United States, they are correct. At the same time, the H-1B visa is used for cheap labor.\"",
      "Investigations including by 60 Minutes and The New York Times have found that some companies have laid off American workers and then replaced them with H-1B hires, sometimes even requiring displaced employees to train their replacements in order to receive their severance packages.",
      "Some of the roles H-1B workers are hired to fill also involve less complicated jobs, like product testing, said Ronil Hira, an associate political science professor at Howard University and a research associate with the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. These roles don't necessarily meet the visa program's intended goal of outsourcing roles that require unique skills.",
      "In addition to Big Tech companies, consulting firms like Cognizant, Tata and Infosys are also among the largest recipients of H-1B visas, providing tech companies with a steady pipeline of highly educated, well-trained employees willing to work on contract.",
      "These companies are incentivized to find employees that will accept lower pay, Hira said.",
      "\"Their business model is to resell labor. If you're reselling labor, the way you become competitive is by having lower labor costs.\"",
      "A boost to innovation?",
      "Still, evidence of the H-1B program's broader impact on employment in the U.S. is mixed. One\u00a0study from the IZA Institute of Labor Economics found that the average employer that receives H-1B visas isn't displacing American workers. The research firm found that while companies that received the visas initially did hire more foreign-born workers in response, they also typically experienced growing revenue and were eventually able to hire additional workers.",
      "The effects were greater for smaller employers that only applied for a few visas, the study showed.",
      "\"Most of our results are driven by smaller firms because they're the ones for whom the lottery really matters,\" said Parag Mahajan, one of the study's authors and an assistant economics professor at the University of Delaware. For those companies, he said, \"There is a lot of value to looking elsewhere for talent.\"",
      "Mahajan's study also found that for some companies, hiring a foreign worker on an H-1B visa eventually created jobs for American-born workers because the person's skills can help the company grow.",
      "But some economists, including Hira, take issue with the claim that foreign workers are needed to fill a nationwide shortage in talented engineers.",
      "When there's a shortage of workers for a particular role, wages in that sector rise, Hira said, the same way gas prices go up when oil supplies drop. But labor market data shows that wages in the tech industry have remained relatively stable.",
      "Median weekly earnings in computer and mathematics roles have grown by 0.27% from 2019 to 2023, after being adjusted for inflation, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows. In engineering and architecture roles, wages have declined by 3.53% over the same timeframe.",
      "More firing than hiring",
      "Tech companies have also laid off hundreds of employees in recent years while continuing to sponsor new H-1B visas. An analysis by the Economic Policy Institute found that the top 30 companies hiring the most H-1B workers hired 34,000 new H-1B employees in 2022 but laid off at least 85,000 workers that year and in early 2023.",
      "The layoffs mirror a decline in available jobs in the industry. Job postings in software development on Indeed.com are 67% of what they were in February 2020, according to the job board platform.",
      "How the debate around H-1Bs will translate to policy after Trump takes office is unclear. In his first term, he issued an executive order, dubbed \"Buy American and Hire American,\" aimed at supporting U.S. manufacturing. The order also directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to the H-1B program to restrict it only to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants.",
      "But in an interview with The New York Post last month, Trump called H-1B visas a \"great program.\" Musk, who has become a close adviser to the president-elect, said he would \"go to war on this issue\" in one X post.",
      "\"I've always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas,\" Trump said. \"That's why we have them.\"",

    "summary": "About 1,600 policies for Pacific Palisades homeowners were dropped by State Farm in July, the state insurance office says.",
    "story": [
      "Pacific Palisades, the Los Angeles neighborhood that's been devastated by the Palisades Fire, is emblematic of the insurance nightmare increasingly facing homeowners residing in regions prone to climate disasters.",
      "About 1,600 policies in Pacific Palisades were dropped by State Farm in July, California Department of Insurance spokesman Michael Soller said in an Thursday email to CBS MoneyWatch. An\u00a0analysis of insurance data by CBS San Francisco last year found that State Farm also dropped more than 2,000 policies in two other Los Angeles ZIP codes, which include the Brentwood, Calabasas, Hidden Hills and Monte Nido neighborhoods.",
      "In an email to CBS MoneyWatch, State Farm said, \"Our No. 1 priority right now is the safety of our customers, agents and employees impacted by the fires and assisting our customers in the midst of this tragedy.\"",
      "State Farm's decision reflects a trend of private insurers, including\u00a0Allstate\u00a0and Farmers Insurance, of dropping California policies or halting underwriting, leaving homeowners with the choice of getting coverage through the insurer of last resort, the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan, or FAIR Plan, or forgo insurance altogether. The FAIR Plan provides basic fire insurance coverage for properties in high-risk areas when traditional insurance companies will not.",
      "As a result, homeowners in Pacific Palisades had increasingly shifted to the FAIR Plan, with roughly 1,400 of the town's 9,000 homes covered by the plan in 2024, more than quadruple the number in 2020, according to data from the insurer. In other words, prior to the disaster, about 1 in 7 homeowners were reliant on the FAIR Plan.",
      "The Palisades Fire could become the costliest wildfire in history because of the number of buildings that have been destroyed and as the structures rank among the nation's most expensive homes, said Daniel Swain, a University of California Los Angeles climatologist, on a Wednesday webcast about the disaster. The neighborhood's 9,000 residential units have a median home value of $3.1 million,\u00a0according to real estate data firm ATTOM Data.",
      "While personally and financially devastating to homeowners, the Los Angeles fires \u2014 which include the Eaton Fire and several other wildfires \u2014 are likely to place added stress on the state's already fragile insurance market, experts and lawmakers say. It's an issue that extends beyond California, with similar issues facing homeowners in Florida, Louisiana and other states.",
      "\"We will be watching to see whether the collapse of a trembling home insurance market accelerates after this added shock,\" Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, wrote on X Thursday. Whitehouse serves on the Senate Budget Committee, which last month issued a report\u00a0about climate change's impact on the insurance market.",
      "Rep. Maxine Waters, a Democrat from California whose district includes parts of Los Angeles, told CBS MoneyWatch she will soon re-introduce a bill called the Wildfire Insurance Coverage Study Act, which would require the Government Accountability Office to analyze the dangers posed by wildfires to communities, and how insurance companies are responding.",
      "\"It will help us determine what the best federal response is to these issues,\" Waters said. \"We have to know more about climate change,\" such as determining which areas or types of vegetation are more susceptible to wildfires, and the risk of building in those areas.",
      "She added that the higher risks are \"leaving homeowners and business owners and families without insurance coverage because some of the insurance companies are canceling; they are aren't writing any new insurance. People continue to pay higher prices for even less coverage.\"",
      "With the fires continuing to rage across the Los Angeles area, the estimated cost of the disaster is surging. The potential property damage and economic losses could amount to as much as $150 billion, according to a Thursday estimate from AccuWeather. That would make these wildfires by far the most destructive in U.S. history.",
      "In California, State Farm last year said it was discontinuing coverage for 72,000 houses and apartments in the state. Since 2019, more than 100,000 Californians have lost their insurance, according to a San Francisco Chronicle\u00a0analysis of insurance data.",
      "\"A full-scale financial crisis\"",
      "With climate disasters increasing in frequency, the insurance industry is grappling with a new calculus amid rising costs and risks. That's prompting some insurers to decide not to renew insurance policies in counties that are most at risk from climate risks \u2014 and it's not only within California and the other usual suspects, the Senate report found.",
      "\"The data confirm that it is climate change that is driving increasing non-renewal rates,\" it noted. \"Second, the data reveal that Florida, Louisiana, California, and Texas are not the only places experiencing spiking non-renewal rates and increasing premiums.\"",
      "Other regions facing rising non-renewal rates are Southern New England, the Carolinas, New Mexico and counties in the Northern Rockies, Oklahoma, and Hawaii, the report found.",
      "The issue isn't just local. \"This is predicted to cascade into plunging property values in communities where insurance becomes impossible to find or prohibitively expensive \u2014 a collapse in property values with the potential to trigger a full-scale financial crisis similar to what occurred in 2008,\" the report stressed.",
      "\"Here's how it works: Climate change makes risk unpredictable; risk makes insurance unaffordable or unavailable; no insurance makes mortgages unavailable; without mortgages property values crash; cascading like 2008 into general economy,\" Whitehouse wrote Thursday on X.",
      "FAIR Plan",
      "Still, there's some potential for near-term relief. Homeowners in California could get help from a new state regulation, announced Monday, that will require insurers to offer coverage in wildfire-prone areas.",
      "The ultimate goal of the new rules is to get homeowners out of the FAIR Plan, California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara's office said. The average cost of insurance on the FAIR Plan is about $3,200, or more than double the typical homeowner's cost in California, according to Bankrate.",
      "The rule will require home insurers to offer coverage in high-risk areas, something the state has never done, Lara's office said in a statement. Insurers will have to start increasing their coverage by 5% every two years until they hit the equivalent of 85% of their market share. That means if an insurer writes 20 out of every 100 state policies, they'd need to write 17 in a high-risk area, Lara's office said.",
      "In exchange for increasing coverage, the state will let insurance companies pass on the costs of reinsurance to California consumers. Insurance companies typically buy reinsurance to avoid huge payouts in case of natural disasters or catastrophic loss. California is the only state that doesn't already allow the cost of reinsurance to be borne by policyholders, according to Lara's office.",
      "Opponents of the rule say that could hike premiums by 40% and doesn't require new policies to be written at a fast enough pace. The state did not provide a cost analysis for potential impact on consumers.",
      "\"Californians deserve a reliable insurance market that doesn't retreat from communities most vulnerable to wildfires and climate change,\" Lara said in a statement.",

    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 08:13:05 -0500",
    "summary": "The proposal is raising concerns with the chip industry, with artificial intelligence leader Nvidia calling it \"misguided.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Biden administration is proposing new restrictions that would limit the export of advanced computer chips used to develop artificial intelligence, part of an effort to preserve America's six- to 18-month advantage on AI over rivals such as China.",
      "Proposed Monday, the framework is raising concerns of chip industry executives who say the rules would limit access to existing chips used for video games and restrict in 120 countries the chips used for data centers and AI products. Mexico, Portugal, Israel and Switzerland are among the nations that could have limited access.",
      "Chip giant Nvidia on Monday called\u00a0the proposal \"misguided,\" and said that it \"threatens to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide.\"",
      "On a call with reporters previewing the framework, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said that it's \"critical\" to preserve America's leadership in AI and the development of AI-related computer chips. The fast-evolving AI technology enables computers to produce novels, make scientific research breakthroughs, automate driving and foster a range of other transformations that could reshape economies and warfare.",
      "\"As AI becomes more powerful, the risks to our national security become even more intense,\" Raimondo said. The framework \"is designed to safeguard the most advanced AI technology and ensure that it stays out of the hands of our foreign adversaries but also enabling the broad diffusion and sharing of the benefits with partner countries.\"",
      "White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan stressed that the framework would ensure that the most cutting-edge aspects of AI would be developed within the United States and with its closest allies, instead of possibly getting offshored such as the battery and renewable energy sectors.",
      "Government officials said they felt they needed to act quickly to preserve U.S. companies' advantage over China and other nations, an edge that could be easily eroded if competitors could stockpile chips and make further gains.",
      "AI-enhanced technology is forecast to help fuel growth and boost corporate productivity, with Wedbush analyst Dan Ives calling the tech developments a \"once in a generation 4th Industrial Revolution\" in a recent research note.",
      "Risks to AI leadership?",
      "A tech industry group, the Information Technology Industry Council, warned Raimondo in a letter last week that a hastily implemented new rule from the Democratic administration could fragment global supply chains and put U.S. companies at a disadvantage.",
      "\"While we share the U.S. government's commitment to national and economic security, the rule's potential risks to U.S. global leadership in AI cannot be emphasized enough,\" said a statement from Naomi Wilson, the group's senior vice president for Asia and global trade policy. She called for a more extensive consultation with the tech industry.",
      "One industry executive, who is familiar with the framework and insisted on anonymity to discuss it, said the proposed restrictions would limit access to chips already used for video games, despite claims made otherwise by the government. The executive said it would also limit which companies could build data centers abroad.",
      "Nvidia bashes proposal",
      "Because the framework includes a 120-day comment period, the incoming Republican administration of President-elect Donald Trump could ultimately determine the rules for the sales abroad of advanced computer chips. This sets up a scenario in which Trump will have to balance economic interests with the need to keep the United States and its allies safe.",
      "Ned Finkle, vice president of external affairs at Nvidia, said in a statement that the prior Trump administration had helped create the foundation for AI's development and that the proposed framework would hurt innovation without achieving the stated national security goals.",
      "\"While cloaked in the guise of an 'anti-China' measure, these rules would do nothing to enhance U.S. security,\" he said. \"The new rules would control technology worldwide, including technology that is already widely available in mainstream gaming PCs and consumer hardware.\"",
      "Under the framework, roughly 20 key allies and partners would face no restrictions on accessing chips, but other countries would face caps on the chips they could import, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House.",
      "Nations without restrictions",
      "The allies without restrictions include Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Republic of Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.",
      "Users outside of these close allies could purchase up to 50,000 graphics processing units per country. There would also be government-to-government deals which could bump up the cap to 100,000 if their renewable energy and technological security goals are aligned with the U.S.",
      "Institutions in certain countries could also apply for a legal status that would let them purchase up to 320,000 advanced graphics processing units over two years. Still, there would be limits as to how much AI computational capacity could be placed abroad by companies and other institutions.",
      "Also, computer chip orders equivalent to 1,700 advanced graphics processing units would not need a license to import or count against the national chip cap, among the other standards set by the framework. The exception for the 1,700 graphics processing units would likely help to meet the orders for universities and medical institutions, as opposed to data centers.",

    "summary": "The first congestion pricing plan in the U.S. has begun, charging most drivers $9 a day to enter the lower half of Manhattan. The long-debated plan is projected to raise up to $800 million a year for the city's aging public transit system. Will it work?",
    "story": [
      "By some measures, New York City's traffic is more congested than it's ever been. Enter: Congestion pricing. Since last Sunday, during most hours, cars crossing into the lower half of Manhattan are charged nine dollars. There's a higher toll for trucks.",
      "Fourteen hundred cameras keep tabs on the roughly 150,000 commuters entering the zone by car.",
      "\"If we can just impact on a proportion of those people, we can make a difference and make it a much better place for everybody,\" said Janno Lieber, who heads the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs New York's sprawling subway, bus and commuter rail systems. \"We're wasting a ton of money, literally billions of dollars, according to our business leaders, having people stuck in traffic.\"",
      "The haul from congestion pricing will go largely to the MTA, to improve mass transit. According to Lieber, it will raise between $500 and $800 million a year.",
      "The pricing idea began in 1952, and gained traction in the early 2000s. But there've been a lot of bumps in the road. There were lawsuits and protests, for and against.",
      "New Jersey drivers were none too happy; they already pay more than $15 in bridge and tunnel tolls to get into the city.",
      "Singapore began congestion pricing in 1975, and Stockholm in 2006. But New York based its plan on London's, which rolled out in 2003.",
      "Opponents in New York say this is just a cash grab \u2013 another tax that will hurt mainly working people.",

      "What to know about New York City's new congestion pricing program",
      "\"Congestion Pricing\" passes in New York as other states consider the plan for themselves",
      "John McDonagh has driven a cab for more than 40 years. He's also a playwright and radio host, and is not a fan of the plan. \"It will not reduce congestion here,\" McDonagh said. \"The street designs of New York now, we have a bus lane on one side, we got a bike lane on the other, concrete barriers. So, 10 cars gives you congestion.\"",
      "But with the money going to improve public transport, that will help everybody, right?",
      "McDonagh replied, \"Oh, it does? We had a woman that was burned on the subway. We had people being pushed onto the tracks. There's robberies. And if you take the subway in New York, jumping the turnstile now is an Olympic sport.\"",
      "It's called turnstile jumping \u2013 or more politely, \"fare evasion\" \u2013 and the MTA projects it will lose $800 million a year because of it, around the same figure congestion pricing may bring in.",
      "And then there is fare evasion on buses. According to the MTA, 47 percent of riders aren't paying.",
      "\"The MTA has now installed cameras so that they can catch people,\" said Kathy Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, which mobilizes business leaders to help the city thrive. \"They are providing police, even the National Guard is in our system to make sure the people pay their fare.\"",
      "Wylde is a longtime advocate for congestion pricing, and has advice for other American cities: \"You have to explain the benefits clearly,\" she said. \"You have to have transit options in most cases. Otherwise, it's just another tax, because if somebody has no choice, they're gonna resist.",
      "\"The lesson from London [is], they put in 200 new bus routes before they turned on congestion pricing,\" Wylde said. \"And that was how they got the public to accept it. They had a choice.\"",
      "It's hard to tell how it's working in New York City after a week, but according to Wylde, \"We're very excited that, in just a few days of congestion pricing, we're seeing a significant reduction in traffic already.\"",
      "Yet, the battle may not be over in New York. Among its opponents: once and future president Donald Trump. Wylde isn't worried, though. \"President Trump has property in New York,\" she said. \"He, I'm sure, has been stuck in traffic more than a few times here. And I think having New York be a more productive city, I think he'll appreciate it.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 12 Jan 2025 09:21:39 -0500",
    "summary": "The chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase explains why he's referred to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as a Ponzi scheme; his bank's efforts to improve the lives of lower-income Americans; and his recent near-death experience.",
    "story": [
      "Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, says he was not surprised that Donald Trump won the election: \"People were angry at whatever they called the state \u2013 the 'swamp.' Ineffective government. That people wanted kind of more pro-growth and pro-business policies, that they didn't want to be lectured to on social policies continuously. I think it's the lecturing part of it. It's social superiority, it's the 'My way or the highway.' I traveled all over the country; I felt it wherever I went.\"",
      "I asked, \"There's a sense of gloom out there about the economy. Do you understand that?\"",
      "\"I do understand it, 'cause I think there are a lot of legitimate concerns that Americans have. For example, ineffective government, they're angry about it. They're angry about immigration. There're people with legitimate issues.\"",
      "Despite lower unemployment, a calming of inflation, and a soaring stock marker, even he says he's \"cautiously pessimistic\" about the economy. And as head of the largest bank in America, it matters what Dimon has to say about things.",
      "Listen to him on Bitcoin, which he's referred to as \"a Ponzi scheme\" and \"as useless as a pet rock\": \"We are going to have some kind of digital currency at some point. I'm not against crypto. You know, Bitcoin itself has no intrinsic value. It's used heavily by sex traffickers, money launderers, ransomware. I just don't feel great about Bitcoin. I applaud your ability to wanna buy or sell it. Just like I think you have the right to smoke, but I don't think you should smoke!\"",
      "Since he took charge of the bank 20 years ago, the company has doubled its number of employees to 320,000, and grown its assets by nearly $3 trillion. Which probably would surprise his grandparents, who came to the U.S. from Greece with little money in the early 1900s.",
      "Dimon spent much of his childhood in an apartment building in a middle-class neighborhood in Queens, New York, sharing a room with his two brothers. Revisiting the street where he grew up, Dimon noted, \"I broke my arm on those monkey bars over there.\"",
      "I asked, \"Did you ever dream when you were growing up, in a million years that you'd be running one of the biggest banks in the world?\"",
      "\"No,\" he replied. \"My dad was a stockbroker. So, I was sometimes conscious of that part of the world. But I had never met a CEO until I was in college or something like that.\"",
      "He grew up to be one of most successful CEOs in the country, processing $10 trillion a day.",
      "His bank is thriving and healthy, but Dimon, now 68, has had two major health scares. The first was throat cancer a decade ago.",
      "He says it's in remission: \"But I know a little bit more,\" he said. \"People who have been told they have cancer know a little bit more than other people. That's staring you right in the face and it may actually happen. You become a little more deliberate, a little more thoughtful. You don't want to have regrets.\"",
      "He also had a heart scare in March 2020, at the beginning of COVID. \"My heart, I just, I mean, the pain was extraordinary. I thought I heard it rip. It was an aortic dissection. I had a tear in the aorta.\" He was told he might not make it.",
      "I asked, \"Going in for surgery, you know, at least you think in your mind, 'I've lived the life I should've lived so far'?\"",
      "\"Yeah. Not enough of it, but yeah,\" Dimon laughed.",
      "He woke up after seven or eight hours on the operating table: \"The doctor told me I was one of the only people he's ever seen wake up immediately after surgery like that. I waved at my kids, who had been sitting there the whole time. And then, I was back asleep in the ICU.",
      "\"Waking up in the ICU, I mean, like, when you're a man who's never had to rely on other people really, and all of a sudden you have tubes everywhere and you can't do anything yourself, and you know, you got tubes in your heart and tubes in your lungs and tubes down your jugular\u2026\"",
      "He was in the hospital for a week, back at work a month later, and soon traveling the world, which he does, he says, 40 percent of his time.",
      "We met him in the executive suite on the 43rd floor of the bank's Manhattan headquarters. From there, he can see where he grew up \u2013 and to the left, the nearly-twice-as-high, dazzling new JPMorgan headquarters going up next door, which he says will be taller than the Empire State Building.",
      "With all the big things he deals with, it's interesting that one of the things Dimon is most proud of is opening branches in lower-income and underserved communities around the country. Visiting one branch in Harlem, he noted, \"Mortgage documentation is really hard to do. So, in one of these community branches, a guy stood up and he said he finally bought a home that he'd lived in for 30 years. He said there's no way he could have gotten that mortgage if one of our mortgage loan officers didn't call him every day for months, taking him through it, making him feel comfortable, getting the forms. He got our homeowner's grant. And it works.\"",
      "This isn't a not-for-profit; these local branches make money for the bank.",
      "But what about the other end of the spectrum? Asked about the increasing wealth of the very rich and what might be \"out of whack\" with the system, Dimon replied, \"I think you have to be very careful to say, 'What's outta whack?' You want a healthy economy, and a really healthy economy lifts up all citizens. You want to help all Americans? Grow the economy. You can wail at the moon. That's not going to grow the economy. And if there are unfair things that created some of that wealth, they should be fixed.\"",
      "\"But I'm not hearing you say, 'There's something wrong here that there are these billionaires growing like poppy.' I mean, what is it? The tax laws?\"",
      "\"If I was king for a day, I would probably change a bunch of the tax laws, too, which I'm not gonna give you specifics on. It won't reduce it as much as you seem to think it should be reduced.\"",
      "\"No. But I'm interested that you're not saying, 'This is wrong. This is not working.'\"",
      "\"I think the wrong part is that the bottom 30% didn't do better, not that the top 0.1% did so well.\"",
      "\"Why not?\"",
      "\"They may be unrelated. What we need to do to fix it for everybody \u2026\"",
      "\"But you haven't said what's wrong at the other end?\"",
      "\"I don't know what's wrong at the other end,\" Dimon replied.",
      "Dimon himself is a billionaire. We asked him about the richest person in the world, Elon Musk. \"He's clearly an extraordinary talent,\" Dimon said. \"I mean, to look at Tesla and SpaceX, yeah, well, we should make government more efficient. Is this the way to do it? I don't know. Do I want them to succeed? Absolutely.\"",
      "\"But it's odd to have a man who's so wealthy, with so many important companies that matter to our economy and even to our national security, now sort of insinuating that he can influence right-wing politics in Europe. It doesn't sound right, does it?\"",
      "Dimon said, \"I'm not responsible for his behavior, so let him do it. But when you say it's odd, it's not that odd. It's been going on in this country for a long time. If you go back to Lindbergh, there's been more interfering in cross-Atlantic politics than you would think.\"",
      "\"Are you distressed by it?\"",
      "\"No.\"",
      "\"Take it in stride?\"",
      "\"Take it in stride.\"",
      "\"Somebody called him an oligarch, an American oligarch.\"",
      "\"Yeah, that's name-calling.\"",
      "Dimon has been in banking for more than 40 years, which leads to the inevitable question: When will he retire? \"Last time I was asked, I said, less than five years. But when you say retire, I'm not going to retire like that. I may write a book. I may teach. I may work with my kids, if they want. I would never pressure them to work with me.\"",
      "\"I didn't hear you say, 'I might become chairman and, you know, just give up the CEO part.'\"",
      "\"Oh, that's likely. That's likely to happen. Again, that is up to the board, not up to me. But if it makes sense, I may be chairing for a couple years.\"",
      "He says he does not know whom his successor might be. But one thing he does know: \"I love my job. I love what it does. I like our people. It motivates me. Like a lotta people, by Friday I'm exhausted. I want to go home, I want to have my martini and go to sleep! But I do love my job. I think it's great to have a purpose in life.

The program, implemented in 2016, will be replaced with Meta's own version of Community Notes, a crowdsourced approach to reviewing online content employed by\u00a0 X, the social media platform previously known as Twitter.",
      "So what exactly is Community Notes, and how does it work?",
      "How Community Notes works",
      "Meta hasn't released specifics about how it will empower users of Facebook, Instagram and other social platforms to monitor content, said Melissa Mahtani, executive producer at CBS News Confirmed.",
      "On X, Community Notes works by leaving fact-checking up to the community. Approved contributors call out content deemed false or misleading by attaching notes providing more context. Here's an example of a community note provided by X on its site:",
      "Becoming an approved contributor on X \"doesn't take much,\" Mahtani said. Any X user with an active phone number and who's been on the platform for at least six months with no violations is qualified to volunteer to be a contributor, she said. Contributors are protected by anonymity.",
      "When a post is deemed false or misleading by an approved contributor, the person will post a note that provides users with additional context. The note appears beneath the original post.",
      "Once a note is added by an approved contributor, it is still not visible to regular users on X. Before that happens, other approved contributors must vote on whether the note is helpful. This is where \"things get tricky\" said Mahtani.",
      "Is the note helpful?",
      "Once a note is added to a post on X, other approved contributors rate it on its utility.",
      "Explained Mahtani, \"Other contributors need to take a look at the sourcing, the accuracy of that note, and vote on whether or not it's helpful. If they vote that it's helpful \u2014 this is the tricky part \u2014 the company says that an algorithm takes a look at the ideological spectrum of all those contributors who voted. If they deem that those voters are diverse, it gets published.\"",
      "The algorithm decides",
      "According to X's website, the purpose of its so-called\u00a0bridging-based algorithm\u00a0is to \"identify notes that are helpful to a broad audience across perspectives.\"",
      "In other words, if the algorithm finds that contributors who voted on a given note represent an ideologically diverse group, then the note becomes visible on the platform. But if the algorithm finds that the voting contributors are too uniform in their political views \u2014 a possible sign of bias \u2014 \"the public never sees it,\" Mahtani said.",
      "Problems with X's system of crowd-based fact-checking arise when a valid note calling out misinformation isn't rated as helpful by a diverse enough group of contributors to satisfy the algorithm, and is therefore never seen by readers. The speed at which a note is made public is also important, so that false or misleading information isn't given the opportunity to spread unchallenged.",
      "A report in October\u00a0by the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate analyzed the Community Notes feature and found that accurate notes correcting false and misleading claims about the U.S. elections were not displayed on 209 out of a sample of 283 posts deemed misleading \u2014 or 74%.",

      "The robust jobs report may also ease pressure on the Fed to continue to cut rates, given the Fed Chair Jerome Powell had cited some earlier signs of weakness in the labor market as one reason why the central bank began cutting rates in September.",
      "\"The solid December employment report will solidify the Fed's intentions to proceed with the slower pace of interest rate cuts it signaled at its December meeting,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a report. \"Officials have been a bit disappointed at the uneven pace of progress in lowering inflation, and the data should ease any fears that keeping rates on hold will pose a significant risk to the labor market.\"",
      "The Fed in December trimmed its benchmark for a third straight month amid signs that the economy was gearing down. The central bank is now penciling in only two rate cuts in 2025, down from the four it had forecast in September when it last issued economic projections.",
      "Some economists think the Fed could lower borrowing costs one once in 2025, while others expect more cuts.",
      "\"Our own baseline continues to assume three rate cuts this year, one more than signaled by the Fed, with the first to come in March,\"Vanden Houten said. \"The December report increases the risk that the Fed will remain on hold in March and that we only see two cuts this year, particularly if policies on tariffs and immigration implemented by the incoming Trump administration are more inflationary than currently incorporated in our baseline.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments Friday morning on whether to overturn or delay a law that could lead to a ban on TikTok in the U.S. in the coming days.",
      "The law is set to take effect on Jan. 19, nine months after it swiftly passed Congress with bipartisan support and was signed into law by President Biden. It requires the widely popular app to cut ties with its China-based parent company, ByteDance, or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The law also gives the president the ability to grant a 90-day delay in its implementation if a sale is in progress.",
      "The case pits the First Amendment's right to free speech against what the federal government and lawmakers say are threats to national security posed by TikTok. The Supreme Court moved with extraordinary speed in considering the case, agreeing to take up the dispute just two days after lawyers for the platform sought its intervention on an emergency basis.",
      "The question before the court is whether the law targeting TikTok violates the First Amendment. Here's what to know about the case:",
      "The law at the center of the case",
      "The legal battle arose from a law passed by Congress as part of a foreign aid package in April. Called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, the measure makes it unlawful for third-party service providers like Google or Apple to \"distribute, maintain or update\" an app controlled by a foreign adversary by providing certain services, such as offering it in app stores.",
      "Under the law, any app operated by ByteDance, TikTok, or its subsidiaries is considered a \"foreign adversary controlled application.\" The designation also covers apps operated by a \"covered company\" controlled by a foreign adversary \u2014 China, Russia, North Korea or Iran.",
      "The prohibitions are set to take effect 270 days after the law was enacted, on Jan. 19. Under the law, TikTok can remain available, however, if it divests from ByteDance. The measure also allows the president to grant a single, 90-day extension if a sale is underway.",
      "What are the arguments?",
      "In a brief laying out its arguments to the Supreme Court, the U.S. government said the vast amount of information TikTok collects on its users could be wielded by the Chinese government for \"espionage or blackmail\" purposes or to \"advance its geopolitical interests\" by \"sowing discord and disinformation during a crisis.\"",
      "\"In response to those grave national-security threats, Congress did not impose any restriction on speech, much less one based on viewpoint or content. Instead, Congress restricted only foreign adversary control: TikTok may continue operating in the United States and presenting the same content from the same users in the same manner if its current owner executes a divestiture that frees the platform from the [People's Republic of China's] control,\" the Justice Department said.",
      "Lawyers for TikTok have argued that shuttering the app in the U.S. will silence not only its speech, but also that of the 170 million Americans who regularly use it. In its filing, lawyers for the platform called the potential shutdown \"unprecedented\" and said the government's justification is \"at war with the First Amendment.\"",
      "Additionally, TikTok has argued that divesture from ByteDance is not possible, and the parent company said in April that it will not sell the platform.",
      "A group of eight TikTok users also challenged the law on First Amendment grounds and have argued that outlawing the platform will deprive them of access to a \"vital communications forum,\" through which they can earn a living and spread ideas.",
      "The legislation, lawyers for the creators wrote in a filing with the court, \"violates the First Amendment because it suppresses the speech of American creators based primarily on an asserted government interest \u2014 policing the ideas Americans hear \u2014 that is anathema to our nation's history and tradition and irreconcilable with this court's precedents.\"",
      "But an appeals court disagreed with TikTok and the users' First Amendment claims. In a December ruling, a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was sympathetic to the government's argument that TikTok poses a national security risk. The appeals court later rejected TikTok's bid for a temporary pause on the ban while it sought the Supreme Court's review.",
      "Thomas Berry, an expert in constitutional law at the Cato Institute, said it would be \"unprecedented\" for the Supreme Court to uphold a law that restricts such a popular and widely used platform in the U.S., but said its reasoning if it sides with the government is significant.",
      "\"If the court relies on notions of disinformation or content manipulation as a justification, that would be extremely harmful to the First Amendment doctrine because it would essentially give a greenlight to the government targeting a speech platform for the content it carries,\" he said. Berry filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of TikTok and the users.",
      "But if the court upholds the law based on the data collection concerns, he said \"that would still be unfortunate deference shown to government arguments that haven't been backed up by a public record, but that would potentially be more of a good-for-this-case-only type of ruling.\"",
      "Additionally, Berry said the impact of a ban on users is an important perspective for the court to consider.",
      "\"It humanizes the speech happening on this platform and emphasizes, especially to justices who might not be familiar with it, that this isn't just speech being broadcast in from foreign countries,\" he said. \"This is primarily Americans speaking to other Americans, and lots of totally apolitical speech is happening and being found through the TikTok discovery algorithm.\"",
      "Jennifer Safstrom, who directs the Stanton Foundation First Amendment Clinic at Vanderbilt Law School, said TikTok may have more of an uphill battle in making its case because \"one of the strengths of the government's position is that the executive and legislative branches are given a lot of deference with respect to national security.\"",
      "\"So there's often a hesitancy for courts to second-guess the political branches on those kinds of national security questions,\" Safstrom told CBS News.",
      "Patrick Toomey, the deputy director of ACLU's National Security Project, said the government has not supported its claims against TikTok with concrete public evidence. The ACLU has urged the Supreme Court to block the ban in a friend-of-the-court brief.",
      "\"The government can't impose this type of total ban unless it's the only way to prevent extremely serious and imminent harm to national security,\" Toomey told CBS News. \"That means not just gesturing at the possibility that these types of harms could come from exploitation of TikTok, but providing evidence that either those harms are ongoing and widespread or are imminent, and we haven't seen that kind of evidence.\"",
      "Trump opposes TikTok ban",
      "The Supreme Court is hearing the case in the final days of the Biden administration. President-elect Donald Trump, who in recent months has expressed support for TikTok, takes office a day after the law is set to go into effect.",
      "A lawyer for Trump filed a friend-of-the-court brief asking the Supreme Court to pause the law's implementation, saying the incoming president opposes banning TikTok at this time and wants the ability to resolve the dispute through \"political means.\"",
      "\"President Trump takes no position on the merits of the dispute. Instead, he urges the Court to stay the statute's effective date to allow his incoming Administration to pursue a negotiated resolution that could prevent a nationwide shutdown of TikTok, thus preserving the First Amendment rights of tens of millions of Americans, while also addressing the government's national security concerns,\" Trump's attorney D. John Sauer wrote.",
      "The president-elect intends to nominate Sauer for solicitor general in his second term. If confirmed by the Senate, Sauer will argue on behalf of the federal government before the Supreme Court.",
      "Trump recently met with TikTok's chief executive at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and has praised the platform for helping him win over younger voters in the November election.",
      "The president-elect's support for the widely popular app is an about-face from his first term in office. In August 2021, he took unilateral action that would have effectively banned TikTok in the U.S. after finding that its data collection posed a risk that China would use Americans' data for malign purposes. The ban, however, never took effect after it was blocked by a federal court and the executive order rescinded by Mr. Biden.",
      "Though Trump is pushing for a delay, members of his incoming administration have firmly backed restricting TikTok, including his nominee to be secretary of state, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, and his national security adviser pick, Republican Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida.",
      "Leaders of the House China Committee and Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky also submitted friend-of-the-court briefs to the Supreme Court, both arguing that the law should be upheld.",
      "Lawmakers and intelligence agencies have long had suspicions about the app's ties to China and have argued that the concerns are warranted because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering. FBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers last year that the Chinese government could compromise Americans' devices through the software.",
      "In response to the national security concerns, Congress prohibited TikTok on federal government devices in 2022, and a majority of states have barred the app on state government devices.",
      "TikTok has argued that several issues would arise if the platform is forced to cut all ties to ByteDance. Because the Chinese government is opposed to selling the algorithm that tailors video recommendations to each user, a new buyer would have to rebuild it from scratch. The platform would also become a \"content island\" in the U.S. \u2014 if it cannot share data with ByteDance, \"American users would be unable to access global content, and American creators would be unable to reach global audiences,\" its lawyers said.",
      "How TikTok could avoid a ban",
      "Still, TikTok has several pathways to avoid a ban outside of Supreme Court intervention, experts told CBS News.",
      "Trump could take action once he's in office and ask the Justice Department not to enforce the law or prosecute tech companies, like Apple and Google, who host TikTok in their app stores. Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law after Jan. 19, though he would have to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "TikTok won't disappear from Americans' phones on Jan. 19 if the law takes effect. However, users would not be able to update the app and those who don't already have it would not be able to download it.",

    "summary": "Abortion bans enacted since Roe v. Wade was overturned may be driving Americans to leave restrictive states, researchers find.",
    "story": [
      "When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, the majority of justices decided that the right to an abortion should be left up to individual states. Two years later, thousands of Americans in parts of the U.S. with strict abortion bans are deciding to leave those states, new research finds.",
      "Following the Dobbs decision, the 13 states with strict abortion bans, from Alabama to West Virginia, collectively lost a net 36,000 residents per quarter, meaning the difference between the number of people leaving the states versus those migrating in, according to the analysis from economists at Georgia Institute of Technology and The College of Wooster and published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research.",
      "The analysis, which is based on change-of-address data from the U.S. Postal Service, found that the state impact is larger among single-person households, which may suggest that younger people are moving out of abortion-banning states at a higher rate than families. That could be due to the greater challenges for families in trying to move, given the need to change schools or uproot careers for parents.",
      "A problem for states that ban abortion?",
      "While often framed as a cultural or religious issue, access to abortion also has far-reaching economic implications both for individuals and society at large. For instance, the financial toll on women without access to abortion services has been well documented, with the Turnaround Study finding that those denied the procedure had higher rates of financial problems and were more likely to rely on government aid like food stamps.",
      "The new research indicates that states with abortion bans could face long-term economic consequences if they lose significant numbers of residents \u2014 especially younger workers who are typically vital to a state's workforce.",
      "\"In terms of the implications for states' economies, our results suggest that employers in states with bans may face challenges in attracting and retaining workers, especially younger workers, which could impact economic growth and development,\" the researchers, Georgia Institute of Technology's Daniel L. Dench, Jason M. Lindo and Kelly Lifchez and The College of Wooster's Jancy Ling Liu, wrote in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The study didn't discern whether those moving out of states with abortion bans were men or women, or where they landed, including in states that have protected abortion. But the impact is significant enough that, over a five-year period, abortion-banning states could lose almost 1% of their population, the researchers said.",
      "Abortion bans and a weak safety net",
      "Separately, many of the states with strict abortion bans are failing to provide adequate safety nets, an analysis by the Associated Press found. These range from difficulty accessing programs such as food stamps to a lack of access to doctors due to maternal care deserts.",
      "Republican state leaders in Tennessee \u2014 one of the 13 states with a total abortion ban \u2014 argue that they are bolstering services for families. For instance, Tennessee boosted its Medicaid coverage for mothers in 2022 from 60 days postpartum to a year, which enabled an additional 3,000 moms to use the program each year.",
      "But Tennessee fared poorly at enrollment in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, Medicaid, and in having enough maternal care and requirements for paid family and medical leave, according to an October study\u00a0published in the American Journal of Public Health. Other states with abortion bans, including Alabama, Georgia and Missouri, also ranked poorly on a number of measures, the analysis found.",
      "Women with young children in states where abortion is banned or limited to early weeks of pregnancy said it can be tough to obtain social services, according to a\u00a0survey\u00a0by the health policy research organization KFF. Nearly half said it's difficult for women in their state to get food stamps, for example, compared with 3 in 10 in states where abortion is generally available.",
      "\"People who claim to be pro-life, who advocated for these abortion bans, often suggest that these policies are designed to protect children, women and families,\" said Dr. Nigel Madden, lead author of the\u00a0study. But weakness in the safety net shows \"the hypocrisy of that argument.\"",
      "Meanwhile, many younger Americans are paying attention to a state's access to reproductive care. In a 2022 Axios poll, about 6 in 10 people 18- to 29-years-old said a state's abortion laws would sway their decision on where to live from \"somewhat\" to \"a lot.\"",
      "To be sure, there are many reasons why people opt to move out of a particular state, the Georgia Institute of Technology and College of Wooster researchers noted. \"And abortion-ban states are different from states protecting or maintaining abortion access in other ways besides their policies on abortion,\" they added.",
      "But a lack of access to reproductive choice, social services and medical care may make abortion-strict states less attractive to some residents, particularly young Americans, the study concluded.",

If a dispute arises, it's worth finding and paying for your own inspection by an independent reputable specialist,\" United Policyholders said.",
      "Smoke damage is a covered peril in most policies, with disputes often arising over cleaning or replacing exposed items.",
      "Extreme heat and smoke kills most plants and may contaminate soil. Keep your claim open for at least six months and file supplemental claims if necessary, as damaged plants may not die right away.

    "story": [
      "Billy Long, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to run the IRS, is facing questions about his qualifications to lead the tax agency from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts who serves on the Senate's Finance Committee.",
      "While serving as a representative, Long, a Republican from Missouri and a former auctioneer,\u00a0co-sponsored legislation\u00a0that aimed to wipe out much of the tax code. After leaving office, he served as a tax adviser to businesses seeking to employ a controversial tax credit, the Employee Retention Tax Credit, or ERTC.",
      "In her Jan. 9 letter to Long, Warren raises questions about Long's tax expertise as well as his promotion of the ERTC, which has been\u00a0flagged\u00a0by the IRS for its high rate of fraud. Unlike other recent IRS tax commissioners, Long doesn't have a depth of experience in the tax industry, nor does he have a degree in accounting or tax law.",
      "\"[Y]our lack of significant management or tax experience \u2014 and your promotion of credits that have been \"magnet[s] for fraud\" \u2014 raise serious questions about your qualifications to lead the IRS,\" Warren wrote in the letter, noting that the Senate Finance Committee will hold his confirmation hearing early this year.",
      "The Trump campaign and Long didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "In a 2023 podcast, Long talked about his work with a firm called Lifetime Advisors, where he helped promote the ERTC to businesses, although Warren's letter notes that the podcast appears to have been \"pulled down from multiple podcast platforms, including the Listen Notes website, Apple, Spotify and YouTube.\"",
      "In the podcast, which CBS MoneyWatch listened to in December before it was taken down, Long said qualifying for credit was difficult during its first iteration, but that he helped make it easier for businesses to be eligible while he was in Congress.",
      "\"We went from having to say COVID adversely affected your business definitely, to taking that away, and you don't have to prove that you had any downturn,\" he said. \"We're doing recoveries for folks that had their best two years ever during COVID.\"",
      "In the letter, Warren asks Long to provide information about his work with the ERTC, including whether any returns he had worked on claiming the credit have been challenged by the IRS. Among the senator's other queries are whether Long directed anyone to pull down the 2023 podcast, and how he earned the designation of \"certified tax & business adviser,\" a term that he has used to describe himself on his X profile.",
      "\"Although you bill yourself as a 'Certified Business and Tax Adviser,' this certification appears to only require a three-day training,\" Warren noted. \"There is no record of you on the IRS' database of tax return preparers \u2014 a searchable directory that lists individuals who hold credentials recognized by the IRS \u2014 nor do you appear in the Missouri Board of Accountancy database.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2025 05:26:56 -0500",
    "summary": "The fast-moving legal battle over the release of the special counsel's final report played out days before Trump's second-term inauguration.",
    "story": [
      "Attorney General Merrick Garland has submitted to Congress a portion of former special counsel Jack Smith's final report on his investigations into President-elect Donald Trump after a court order blocking its release expired at midnight Tuesday, according to a source familiar with the matter.",
      "In his report, Smith wrote that his office began its prosecution of Trump because it had enough evidence against him, saying that \"[b]ut for Mr. Trump's election and imminent return to the Presidency, the Office assessed that the admissible evidence was sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction at trial.\"",
      "The report was sent to Congress and made public shortly afterward, following days of legal wrangling over whether it should partially or fully be disclosed to the public. U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon on Monday declined a request from Walt Nauta, an aide to Trump, and Carlos de Oliveira, former property manager at Mar-a-Lago, to block volume one of Smith's final report from becoming public.",
      "That portion pertains to Trump's alleged efforts to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election. Volume two delves into allegations that Trump unlawfully held onto classified documents after the end of his first term in 2021 and obstructed the Justice Department's investigation.",
      "In a letter to Garland accompanying the report, Smith defended his decision to pursue charges against the president-elect and rejected Trump's accusations that his actions were influenced by the top ranks of the Justice Department.",
      "\"To all who know me well, the claim from Mr. Trump that my decisions as a prosecutor were influenced or directed by the Biden administration or other political actors is, in a word, laughable,\" Smith wrote, adding later in the report his office had \"no interest in affecting the presidential election.\"",
      "Following the release of the section of the report on the 2020 election probe, he president-elect attacked the former special counsel on social media, calling him a \"a lamebrain prosecutor who was unable to get his case tried before the Election, which I won in a landslide.\"",
      "\"To show you how desperate Deranged Jack Smith is, he released his Fake findings at 1:00 A.M. in the morning,\" Trump said early Tuesday.",
      "Smith used the first volume of his report to defend his work and investigative findings, alleging, \"The throughline of all of Mr. Trump's criminal efforts was deceit \u2014 knowingly false claims of election.\"",
      "Much of the 137-page volume recounts information that has already been made public through court filings during the course of the now-dismissed case against Trump filed in Washington, D.C. It also includes images of the violence that transpired at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of Trump's supporters breached the building in an effort to stop Congress from reaffirming President Biden's win.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that the rioters who descended on the Capitol \"had been motivated and directed by Trump,\" a claim Trump has denied. The former special counsel wrote that his office was \"prepared\" to prove \"Trump willfully caused his supporters to obstruct and attempt to obstruct the proceeding by summoning them to Washington, D.C.\"",
      "Still, Smith wrote that his office \"did not develop direct evidence \u2014 such as an explicit admission or communication with co-conspirators \u2014 of Mr. Trump's subjective intent to cause the full scope of the violence that occurred on January 6.\"",
      "Now, four years since the Jan. 6 attack, more than 1,500 people have been charged as a result of their conduct at the Capitol. The former special counsel wrote that \"with that in mind, Mr. Trump's relative culpability weighed heavily in favor of charging him, as the individual most responsible for what occurred at the Capitol on January 6.\"",
      "Smith revealed that through voluntary interviews of more than 250 individuals and the grand-jury testimony of 55 people, his office was able to gather evidence that pointed to Trump's alleged crime, including allegations that he sought to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence into delaying the vote certification on Jan. 6, 2021, and he supported the organization of a false slate of electors.",
      "Pence sat for a grand-jury interview with prosecutors during the investigation, CBS News reported at the time.",
      "The former special counsel also detailed ways in which he alleged Trump sought to pressure the Justice Department at the time to investigate the false claims of fraud. At one point, according to the report, Trump allegedly told his acting attorney general to \"just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.\"",
      "A federal grand jury returned an indictment charging Trump with four counts in the summer of 2023. He pleaded not guilty to all of the counts. But Smith wrote that his office considered \u2014 and ultimately decided against \u2014 bringing other charges. One potential charge was under the Insurrection Act, a Civil War-era law that bars those who incite an insurrection against the U.S. from holding federal office.",
      "But Smith said that while courts have described the Jan. 6 attack as an \"insurrection,\" his office was \"aware of the litigation risk that would be presented by employing this long-dormant statute.\"",
      "Trump was charged with allegedly participating in crimes with at least six unnamed co-conspirators, and Smith wrote that his office determined some shared criminal culpability with the president-elect. Smith said that after Trump was indicted in August 2023, his office continued to look into whether any of the other alleged participants should face charges. He said that he referred to a U.S. attorney's office for further investigation evidence that one individual may have committed unrelated crimes.",
      "Smith's office made a \"preliminary determination\" that admissible evidence could justify pursuing charges against some of Trump's co-conspirators and had started to look into how to proceed. But because his team did not reach a conclusion or seek any further indictments, Smith wrote that the report \"should not be read to allege that any particular person other than Mr. Trump committed a crime, nor should it be read to exonerate any particular person.\"",
      "Ahead of the report's release, Trump's defense attorneys asked Garland to remove Smith from his post and either decline to release the special counsel's report or hand the matter over to Trump's incoming administration, according to a letter released last week.",
      "The letter, addressed to Garland and a top career official at the Justice Department, alleged the special counsel did not have the legal authority to submit a final report summarizing his investigations into Trump and urged the attorney general to \"put an end to this weaponization of the justice system and move forward constructively.\"",
      "The correspondence was written in part by defense attorneys Todd Blanche and Emile Bove, Trump's picks to serve as deputy attorney general and principal deputy attorney general in his new administration.",
      "Trump has slammed Smith's investigation as politically motivated and denied all wrongdoing in the case.",
      "The legal battle over Smith's report on Trump",
      "The Justice Department's publication of the first volume of Smith's report marked the culmination of a fast-moving legal battle that transpired over the past week and played out days before Trump is to be sworn in for a second term. If the battle had continued until the president-elect's return to the White House on Jan. 20, it's not likely the special counsel's report would have been publicly released.",
      "Cannon, who was assigned to oversee the documents case, issued a temporary order last week that temporarily blocked the Justice Department from making the report public, after which a federal appeals court declined to stop its release. The district judge's order expired at 12 a.m. Tuesday.",
      "Garland has said he wouldn't publicly release the second part of the report because proceedings involving Nauta and de Oliveira are ongoing.",
      "Smith resigned his position as special counsel last Friday, and Justice Department prosecutors have taken over the ongoing matters arising from his investigations. Smith's two probes led to separate prosecutions of Trump, but they came to a close because of his victory in the November presidential election.",
      "As is required for special counsels, Smith drafted and submitted a final report to the attorney general last week. Garland has vowed to make public all special counsel reports completed while he is attorney general, and has so far followed through on that pledge, including after the investigation into Mr. Biden's handling of classified documents. He released the special counsel's final report on the investigation into Hunter Biden's tax evasion and gun possession cases Monday night.",
      "Last week, Garland informed Congress that Smith had finished his investigation and submitted the two-volume report. It's unclear whether the second volume, related to the classified documents case, will ever be disclosed to the American people.",
      "Smith's tenure as special counsel began in November 2022, when Garland tapped him to take over the ongoing investigations involving Trump. The president-elect repeatedly vowed to fire the special counsel when he returned to the White House.",
      "Federal grand juries returned two indictments against the president-elect, marking the first time a former president was accused of federal crimes. In the 2020 election case, brought in Washington, D.C., Trump faced four charges, including conspiracy to defraud the U.S. and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding. In the documents case, the president-elect was charged with 40 counts, including willfully retaining national defense information and conspiracy to obstruct justice.",
      "Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges and accused Smith of mounting a politically charged investigation against him because he was Mr. Biden's political rival.",
      "The 2020 election case landed before the Supreme Court with Trump's claim he was entitled to presidential immunity that shielded him from prosecution, since the conduct that gave rise to the charges occurred during his first term in office.",
      "In July, the high court issued a landmark ruling finding that former presidents cannot face charges for official acts, but were not immune from prosecution for unofficial actions. The decision led to further proceedings before the federal district court overseeing the case.",
      "But the charges were dismissed in November following Trump's election to a second term, as longstanding Justice Department policy forbids the prosecution of a sitting president.",

      "In November, Montana voters safeguarded the right to abortion in the state's constitution. They also elected a new chief justice to the Montana Supreme Court who was endorsed by anti-abortion advocates.",
      "That seeming contradiction is slated to come to a head this year. People on polar sides of the abortion debate are preparing to fight over how far the protection for abortion extends, and the final say will likely come from the seven-person state Supreme Court. With the arrival of new Chief Justice Cory Swanson, who ran as a judicial conservative for the nonpartisan seat and was sworn in Jan. 6, the court now leans more conservative than before the election.",
      "A similar dynamic is at play elsewhere. Abortion rights supporters prevailed on ballot measures in seven of the 10 states where abortion was up for a vote in November. But even with new voter-approved constitutional protections, courts will have to untangle a web of existing state laws on abortion and square them with any new ones legislators approve. The new makeup of supreme courts in several states indicates that the results of the legal fights to come aren't clear-cut.",
      "Activists have been working to reshape high courts, which in recent years have become the final arbiters of a patchwork of laws regulating abortions. That's because the 2022 U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization overturned federal abortion protections, leaving rulemaking to the states.",
      "How abortion is affecting state supreme court races",
      "Since then, the politics of state supreme court elections have been \"supercharged\" as fights around abortion shifted to states' top courts, according to Douglas Keith, a senior counsel at the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice.",
      "\"Because we're human, you can't scrub these races of any political connotations at all,\" said former Montana Supreme Court Justice Jim Nelson. \"But it's getting worse.\"",
      "The wave of abortion litigation in state courts has spawned some of the most expensive state supreme court races in history, including more than $42 million spent on the nonpartisan 2023 Supreme Court race in Wisconsin, where abortion access was among the issues facing the court. Janet Protasiewicz won the seat, flipping the balance of the court to a liberal majority.",
      "In many states, judicial elections are nonpartisan but political parties and ideological groups still lobby for candidates. In 2024, abortion surfaced as a top issue in these races.",
      "In Michigan, spending by non-candidate groups alone topped $7.6 million for the two open seats on the state Supreme Court. The Michigan races are officially labeled as nonpartisan, although candidates are nominated by political parties.",
      "An ad for the two candidates backed by Democrats cautioned that \"the Michigan state Supreme Court can still take abortion rights away\" even after voters added abortion protections to the state constitution in 2022. The ad continued, \"Kyra Harris Bolden and Kimberly Thomas are the only Supreme Court candidates who will protect access to abortion.\" Both won their races.",
      "Abortion opponent Kelsey Pritchard, director of state public affairs for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, decried the influence of abortion politics on state court elections. \"Pro-abortion activists know they cannot win through the legislatures, so they have turned to state courts to override state laws,\" Pritchard said.",
      "Some abortion opponents now support changes to the way state supreme courts are selected.",
      "In Missouri, where voters passed a constitutional amendment in November to protect abortion access, the new leader of the state Senate, Cindy O'Laughlin, a Republican, has proposed switching to nonpartisan elections from the state's current model, in which the governor appoints a judge from a list of three finalists selected by a nonpartisan commission. Although Republicans have held the governor's mansion since 2017, she pointed to the Missouri Supreme Court's 4-3 ruling in September that allowed the abortion amendment to remain on the ballot and said courts \"have undermined legislative efforts to protect life.\"",
      "In a case widely expected to reach the Missouri Supreme Court, the state's Planned Parenthood clinics are trying to use the passage of the new amendment to strike down Missouri's abortion restrictions, including a near-total ban. O'Laughlin said her proposal, which would need approval from the legislature and voters, was unlikely to influence that current litigation but would affect future cases.",
      "\"A judiciary accountable to the people would provide a fairer venue for addressing legal challenges to pro-life laws,\" she said.",
      "A push for partisan elections for state judges",
      "Nonpartisan judicial elections can buck broader electoral trends. In Michigan, for example, voters elected both Supreme Court candidates nominated by Democrats last year even as Donald Trump won the state and Republicans regained control of the state House.",
      "In Kentucky's nonpartisan race, Judge Pamela Goodwine, who was endorsed by Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, outperformed her opponent even in counties that went for Trump, who won the state. She'll be serving on the bench as a woman's challenge to the state's two abortion bans makes its way through state courts.",
      "Partisan judicial elections, however, tend to track with other partisan election results, according to Keith of the Brennan Center. So some state legislatures have sought to turn nonpartisan state supreme court elections into fully partisan affairs.",
      "In Ohio, Republicans have won every state Supreme Court seat since lawmakers passed a bill in 2021 requiring party affiliation to appear on the ballot for those races. That includes three seats up for grabs in November that solidified the Republican majority on the court from 4-3 to 6-1.",
      "\"These justices who got elected in 2024 have been pretty open about being anti-abortion,\" said Jessie Hill, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio, who has been litigating a challenge to Ohio's abortion restrictions since voters added protections to the state constitution in 2023.",
      "Until the recent ballot measure vote in Montana, the only obstacle blocking Republican-passed abortion restrictions from taking effect had been a nearly 26-year-old decision that determined Montana's right to privacy extends to abortion.",
      "Nelson, the former justice who was the lead author of the decision, said the court has since gradually leaned more conservative. He noted the state's other incoming justice, Katherine Bidegaray, was backed by abortion rights advocates.",
      "\"The dynamic of the court is going to change,\" Nelson said after the election. \"But the chief justice has one vote, just like everybody else.\"",
      "Swanson, Montana's new chief justice, had said throughout his campaign that he'll make decisions case by case. He also rebuked his opponent, Jerry Lynch, for saying he'd respect the court's ruling that protected abortion. Swanson called such statements a signal to liberal groups.",
      "At least eight cases are pending in Montana courts challenging state laws to restrict abortion access. Martha Fuller, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Montana, said that the new constitutional language, which takes effect in July, could further strengthen those cases but that the court's election outcome leaves room for uncertainty.",
      "The state's two outgoing justices had past ties to the Democratic Party. Fuller said they also consistently supported abortion as a right to privacy. \"One of those folks is replaced by somebody who we don't know will uphold that,\" she said. \"There will be this period where we're trying to see where the different justices fall on these issues.\"",
      "Those cases likely won't end the abortion debate in Montana.",
      "As of the legislative session's start in early January, Republican lawmakers, who have for years called the state Supreme Court liberal, had already proposed eight bills regarding abortion and dozens of others aimed at reshaping judicial power. Among them is a bill to make judicial elections partisan.",

      "In her five-page decision, Cannon wrote that her \"authority to enforce\" rulings is \"confined\" to the classified documents case. The case involving the 2020 election was brought in Washington, D.C., and was overseen by a different judge.",
      "Still, Cannon said there are outstanding legal issues over the Justice Department's proposed plan to give certain members of Congress access to the second volume of the report. The defense teams have argued against that limited release, writing that doing so could risk leaks.",
      "She set a hearing for Friday in her courtroom in Fort Pierce, Florida, to go over that proposal.",
      "Cannon wrote that the release of the report's second volume, even on a limited basis, \"risks irreversibly and substantially impairing the legal rights of defendants in this criminal proceeding. The court is not willing to make that gamble on the basis of generalized interest by members of Congress, at least not without full briefing and a hearing on the subject.\"",
      "She said the government has not \"presented any justification to support the suggestion\" that the second volume must be released to Congress now instead of \"after a reasonable period for an expedited hearing and judicial deliberation on the subject.\"",
      "Jack Smith's report",
      "Cannon's decision is the latest in a fast-moving legal battle over Smith's report that is playing out just days before Trump will be sworn in for a second term. Once the president-elect returns to the White House on Jan. 20, it's highly unlikely the special counsel's report would be publicly released.",
      "Smith resigned his position as special counsel last Friday, and Justice Department prosecutors are now overseeing all ongoing matters arising from his investigations. Smith's two investigations and prosecutions of Trump have since been dropped because of his victory in the November presidential election.",
      "As is required for special counsels, the special counsel drafted and submitted a final report to the attorney general last week. Garland has vowed to make public all special counsel reports completed while he is attorney general, and has so far followed through on that pledge, including after the investigation into President Biden's handling of classified documents.",
      "But Nauta and de Oliveira are fighting to keep the report shielded from the public. The two were charged for allegedly obstructing the investigation into Trump's handling of classified documents. While Cannon dismissed the case against them on the grounds the special counsel was unconstitutionally appointed, federal prosecutors are appealing her decision as it relates to Nauta and de Oliveira.",
      "Defense lawyers argued that disclosing the report to the public would unfairly prejudice potential future criminal proceedings against them. Defense attorneys simultaneously asked the 11th Circuit and Cannon last week to block the Justice Department from releasing the report.",
      "Cannon\u00a0temporarily stopped the report's release until the 11th Circuit resolved the issue. The appeals court then denied Nauta and de Oliveira's request to keep Smith's report under wraps, but Cannon's order remained in place. Just hours before the district court judge's temporary restraining order was set to expire, Trump unsuccessfully asked her to extend it to allow consideration of an earlier request to intervene.",
      "\"This sensible course will ensure full ventilation of these important issues, which are not changed by the government's representations of what is in Volume I,\" Trump's lawyers wrote in their request, which Cannon denied. \"These issues are weighty, serious, and ultimately establish that President Trump is entitled to full relief.\"",
      "The president-elect is no longer a party to the proceedings since he was dropped from the case in late November, and he accused the Justice Department of attempting to \"interfere with an incoming presidential administration in this manner, let alone on the very eve of inauguration.\"",
      "Federal prosecutors told the 11th Circuit that Garland would not release the portion of Smith's report that deals with the documents case while proceedings involving the two co-defendants are ongoing, but did plan to disclose the first volume involving the 2020 election case. They said he would make a redacted version of the second volume available for review only by top lawmakers on the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, and only if they agreed not to share information from it.",
      "\"This limited disclosure will further the public interest in keeping congressional leadership apprised of a significant matter within the department while safeguarding defendants' interests,\" prosecutors wrote.",
      "The Justice Department further told the district court in a filing Sunday that \"without referencing defendants Nauta or De Oliveira, any conduct by them, any evidence against them, or the charges against them, Volume One does makes two references to the Classified Documents Case.\"",
      "Last week, Garland\u00a0informed lawmakers that Smith had finished his investigation and submitted the two-volume report. The attorney general reiterated his intent to make public the first volume \"in furtherance of the public interest in informing a co-equal branch and the public regarding this significant matter,\" but would not release the second volume \"to avoid any risk of prejudice\" to Nauta and de Oliveira.",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's surprising pick to lead the Pentagon \u2014 former Fox News personality Pete Hegseth \u2014 will have to publicly address scrutiny by Democrats over allegations from his past, controversial comments and his qualifications to run the largest government employer in the country during his confirmation hearing Tuesday.",
      "When Trump announced in November over social media his intention to nominate Hegseth, it caught nearly everyone off guard. Shortly afterward, reports surfaced of an alleged sexual assault, excessive drinking and financial mismanagement of veterans' organizations Hegseth ran. To control the damage and prove his mettle, Hegseth barnstormed the Capitol for meetings with mostly Republican senators.",
      "According to his lawyer, Hegseth paid a confidential settlement to the woman who accused him of sexual assault in 2017, though he denies committing the crime. Hegseth has also denied he mismanaged finances at veterans' organizations.",
      "Some Republicans who initially seemed to be less supportive of Hegseth's nomination after the reports surfaced have since rallied around him, and sources told CBS News last week that Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune has privately told Trump he believes Hegseth will have enough votes to get confirmed.",
      "Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso said when asked whether Hegseth has the votes to be confirmed that he \"certainly has the qualities that we need to lead the Pentagon.\" But Barrasso added that \"every senator gets to speak for themselves.\"",
      "\"The meetings have gone very well. Things are heading in the right direction. The hearings start Tuesday, and they're going to be consequential,\" Barraso said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"People will listen and make their own decision.\"",
      "Hegseth's attorney Tim Parlatore confirmed to CBS News that he met with the FBI for a background check interview \"a few weeks ago\" and the meeting lasted about two hours. Parlatore said in the interview with Hegseth, they \"went through everything,\" and Parlatore called it a \"very thorough investigation.\"",
      "Parlatore said the FBI \"interviewed a whole bunch of other people to follow up and corroborate. They pulled a bunch of records and just like we predicted in the beginning, the FBI background check would clear him, and you know, they found nothing remarkable.\"",
      "The FBI did not brief senators on its background check findings, according to a source familiar with the matter. In keeping with its customary practice, the FBI performed the check, and then passed the information along to the leaders of the Senate Armed Services Committee.",
      "Because Republicans control the Senate, Hegseth can afford to lose three Republican votes, with Vice President-elect JD Vance breaking any tie in his capacity as president of the Senate. But first, the clearest path to advancing to the Senate floor is via a majority on the comittee. The committee has a one-seat Republican majority, so if all Democrats oppose him, it would only take one Republican to defect to complicate his nomination to the floor.",
      "Democrats on the committee have signaled they'll use their time during Tuesday's hearing to ask Hegseth about not only the allegations but also about his lack of senior leader experience.",
      "Hegseth served in the Army National Guard and deployed to Afghanistan, Iraq and Guantanamo Bay. He retired in 2021 at the rank of major.",
      "\"I want to ask him, what's the largest organization that you've ever run? How big a budget have you ever planned and executed?\" Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois told CBS News in an interview last week.",
      "\"I mean, the secretary of defense is going to be going to NATO and negotiating with allies and going to be managing 3 million personnel, going to be managing a budget of over $800 billion dollars,\" Duckworth said. \"Is he capable of doing that?\"",
      "If Hegseth is confirmed, he will replace Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who was a four-star general and commanded U.S. Forces in the Middle East before retiring from the Army in 2016. Other recent Secretaries of Defense were James Mattis, who was a retired four-star general in the Marines, and Mark Esper, who right before becoming Secretary of Defense was the Secretary of the Army \u2014 and both of whom served under Trump in his first term.",
      "Duckworth, who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee and is an Iraq War combat veteran, said Hegseth has refused to meet with her and that the dates his team proposed would be after his confirmation hearing, instead of before.",
      "A transition official told CBS News that Hegseth's team intended to meet with the Democratic leadership of the Armed Services Committee before the committee's other Democrats. In this case, that meant meeting with Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking member, which occurred on Jan. 8. Hegseth's team is working to schedule meetings with more senators before and after the confirmation hearing.",
      "Reed said in a statement after the meeting, \"Today's meeting did not relieve my concerns about Mr. Hegseth's lack of qualifications and raised more questions than answers.\"",
      "One Republican senator on the Armed Services Committee who has not yet voiced her support for Hegseth is Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa. Ernst, who served in the Army National Guard, has moved closer to supporting Hegseth after meeting with him. After her first meeting, she declined in a Fox News interview to say whether she would support him, though she did say she supported the vetting process.",
      "But after another meeting, she said in a statement that she had \"encouraging conversations\" with Hegseth. She added that as she supports \"Pete through this process, I look forward to a fair hearing based on truth, not anonymous sources.\"",
      "On \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, Barrasso called Ernst a \"warrior\" and a \"patriot\" and said she had met with Hegseth at least twice.",
      "\"She's going to ask additional questions at the hearing on Tuesday and ultimately make her decision,\" Barrasso said. \"With regard to the FBI report, reported today that the chairman and the ranking member of the committee have seen the report already.\"",

Elizabeth Warren released a list of 72 questions she has for Hegseth covering the allegations and Hegseth's stances on issues like women should not be in combat roles and whether senior military officers, like Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen.

This is a fierce competition underway. The future of the global economy, technology, human values and so much else. Right now, in my view, thanks to our administration, the United States is winning the world-wide competition.\"",

      "Specifically, Mr. Biden said Russian President Vladimir Putin has \"failed\" to subjugate Ukraine and weaken NATO. The president touted his work to rally the world around Ukraine, another central piece of his foreign policy.",
      "\"As I saw it, when Putin launched his invasion, I had two jobs \u2014 one to rally the world to defend Ukraine, and the other is to avoid war between two nuclear powers,\" Mr. Biden said. \"We did both those things. Today, Ukraine is still a free, independent country, with a potential, a potential for a bright future.\"",
      "He also argued that Iran is weaker than it's been in \"decades,\" saying Iran's main proxy Hezbollah is \"badly wounded\" and Iran's economy is in \"desperate straits.\"",
      "Something that has remained elusive for the Biden administration is the freeing of the hostages Hamas captured in Israel, which has been a top priority for the president and his aides. National security adviser Jake Sullivan said before Mr. Biden's speech on Monday the parties are \"close to a deal and it can get done this week,\" but also said he couldn't make a promise or a prediction.",
      "In his speech, the president briefly mentioned the soldiers who died during the chaotic and deadly withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, while emphasizing that he has been the president to end United States' involvement in its longest war.",
      "\"We grieve all 2,461 Americans who made the ultimate sacrifice in the longest war in American history,\" he said. \"And I grieve those brave service members whose lives were lost during the withdrawal.\"",

      "Mr. Biden also laid out the challenges ahead for the incoming Trump administration, which will have to deal with a chaotic Middle East, Russia's nearly three-year war on Ukraine and a tenuous situation in the Red Sea.",
      "\"Make no mistake, there are serious challenges the United States must continue to deal with, in Ukraine, in the Middle East, in the Indo-Pacific,\" he said. \"Must keep the pressure on the Houthis who are attacking ships in the Red Sea, launching missiles at Israel, and firing at American forces. Must deter North Korea as they rattle their saber and draw closer to Russia. And new challenges will certainly emerge in the months and years ahead.\"",
      "\"But even \u2014 but even so, it's clear,\" he continued. \"My administration is leaving the next administration with a very strong hand to play. And we're leaving an America with more friends and stronger alliances, whose adversaries are weaker and under pressure. An America that once again is leading, uniting countries, setting the agenda, bringing others together behind our plans and visions.\"",
      "The president recently told USA Today that he had helped reset ties that had frayed during the Trump administration, saying he had managed an \"inflection point\" in history. He credited his long history in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with helping him \"navigate some of the fundamental changes taking place, whether it's in Europe, in Latin America, in the Middle East, in the Far East.\"",
      "\"The only advantage of being an old guy is that I've known every major world leader for a long time,\" he told USA Today's Susan Page. \"And so I had a perspective on each of them and their interests.\"",
      "Jake Sullivan said the president will argue \"America is winning that contest for the future.\"",
      "In his first foreign policy speech as president, in 2021, Mr. Biden aimed to tie foreign and domestic policy interests by arguing for a foreign policy for the middle class. The focus was meant to be on China and repairing alliances but was disrupted by crises in Ukraine and the Middle East.",
      "\"The United States is in a worse geopolitical position today than it was four years ago,\" says Stephen Wertheim, historian and senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"The United States is immersed in a massive war on the European continent with serious escalation risks; it's back to bombing the Middle East with no end in sight; and it has entered into a full-spectrum strategic rivalry with China.\"",
      "A look at the major foreign policy issues of his presidency:",
      "Ukraine, Russia and NATO",
      "Mr. Biden has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine, becoming the first president to go to a conflict zone where U.S. troops were not involved and directing over $183 billion dollars in military aid since Russia's invasion in 2021. He played a key role in getting NATO to spend more on collective defense.",
      "Yet the fierce battle continues on the frontlines with no clear plan for a peace deal. Washington deferred to Kyiv on when and how negotiations should take place with the tagline \"nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.\"",
      "The administration was criticized early in the conflict for holding back on sending the most lethal weapons and later by some Republicans for spending too much money on Ukraine aid.",
      "Mr. Biden is expected to argue that his policies have ensured the survival of Ukraine as an independent state and thwarted Putin's ambitions, a senior administration official tells CBS News.",
      "Israel-Hamas war",
      "After Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that killed over 1,200 civilians, Mr. Biden made it clear that Israel has the right to defend itself with his administration sending over billions of dollars worth of military assistance.",
      "As Israel launched a war on Gaza that has killed more than 45,000 people according to the Hamas-run Gazan Health Ministry and led to a humanitarian crisis, the administration did not change its stance.",
      "In April 2023, Mr. Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanhayu that future U.S. support of his country was dependent on Israel protecting civilians and aid workers in Gaza.",
      "\"Biden willingly threw away his leverage by immediately pledging military support for Israel; then he criticized the Israeli government's decisions from the self-imposed sidelines,\" Wertheim said.",
      "The State Department informed Congress earlier this month of a planned $8 billion weapons transfer to Israel. Ceasefire negotiations are still underway between Israel and Hamas as pressure mounts for a deal to be reached prior to Trump's inauguration on January 20.",
      "Chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal",
      "The most glaring foreign policy failure was the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.",
      "Mr. Biden had promised to end America's longest war and assured Americans that the Afghan military was capable of holding off a Taliban takeover. Instead the Taliban expanded its control of territory across the country more quickly than the U.S. expected and seized Kabul as the Afghan government collapsed. The U.S. hastily evacuated about 125,000 people, including 6,000 Americans, over the course of its frenzied withdrawal, but dozens of Afghans and 13 U.S. service members were\u00a0killed in a suicide bombing\u00a0outside Hamid Karzai airport in Kabul as thousands sought to flee the country.",
      "U.S. citizens and Afghan allies who supported American troops throughout the war were left behind. Thousands feared retribution from the Taliban and felt abandoned by an American government that had promised to take care of them.",
      "Images of Afghans clinging onto military planes in hopes of escape, and U.S. military weapons left behind and paraded about by the Taliban became emblematic of the missteps leading up to the evacuation.",
      "In the three years since the Taliban returned to power, al Qaeda and other terrorist groups have established a presence in the country, and\u00a0Afghan women and girls have been deprived of basic freedoms\u00a0they enjoyed during two decades of Western-backed government following the U.S.-led invasion in 2001.",
      "China",
      "Trump began a trade war with China\u00a0and other countries during his first term, imposing tariffs that were aimed at deterring what he saw as unfair trade practices and to encourage American consumers and businesses to buy and sell more goods made at home. While the rhetoric changed under Mr Biden, he nonetheless continued the tariff policy. And as was the case during the Trump administration, both have viewed China as a security threat, not just an economic one.",
      "The Biden administration put safeguards in place to help protect industries like chip production from relying on China. Global alliances such as the Quad \u2014\u00a0 U.S., India, Japan and Australia \u2014\u00a0 and AUKUS \u2013 Australia, the U.S. and U.K. \u2013 made diplomatic and military headway in deterrence against China. And the Biden administration has also enhanced its military alliance with Japan.",
      "Mr. Biden was vice president when former President Barack Obama delivered his \"pivot to Asia\" speech. American policymakers have been attempting to shift foreign policy focus ever since, but there has been a world of distractions along the way.",
      "\"The United States cannot expect to prioritize China while remaining the leading military power in Europe and the Middle East. If the United States truly wants to prioritize China, it needs to pull back elsewhere,\"\u00a0 Wertheim said.",

    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 19:10:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed David Weiss to be special counsel, giving him expanded powers to continue his investigation of Hunter Biden.",
    "story": [
      "The Justice Department on Monday released the final report of special counsel David Weiss, the Trump-appointed federal prosecutor elevated to special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland to investigate Hunter Biden, the son of President Biden.",
      "In the report, which Garland submitted to Congress on Monday, Weiss wrote that he stood by his decisions to prosecute the president's son on tax and gun charges after agreements with Hunter's legal team collapsed. And Weiss pushed back on Mr. Biden's criticism of the probe.",
      "Weiss led a yearslong investigation into Hunter Biden that ultimately led to a jury conviction on felony gun charges in Delaware federal court and a guilty plea to tax evasion charges in California. In December, the president pardoned his son and claimed the charges against Hunter Biden were \"raw politics,\" a comment that was met with bipartisan criticism.",
      "\"The President's statements unfairly impugn the integrity not only of Department of Justice personnel, but all of the public servants making these difficult decisions in good faith,\" Weiss wrote in his report. \"The President's characterizations are incorrect based on the facts in this case, and, on a more fundamental level, they are wrong.\"",
      "\"Calling those rulings into question and injecting partisanship into the independent administration of the law undermines the very foundation of what makes America's justice system fair and equitable,\" Weiss wrote. \"It erodes public confidence in an institution that is essential to preserving the rule of law.\"",
      "In the report, Weiss defended his charging decisions, which many Republicans in Congress alleged favored the president's son.",
      "\"I concluded that the Principles of Federal Prosecution were satisfied as to both the tax offenses and the gun offenses,\" Weiss wrote.",
      "In 2023, Hunter Biden was charged with lying on a gun application about his drug use and in a separate case, he faced three felony tax offenses and six misdemeanor offenses, including failure to file and pay his taxes, tax evasion and filing a false return.",
      "Prosecutors alleged he failed to pay at least $1.4 million in federal taxes while living an \"extravagant lifestyle.\"",
      "\"Not only were both cases proven beyond a reasonable doubt, but they resulted in a verdict lawfully rendered by a jury and an admission of guilt. In making my decisions, I remained impervious to political influence at all times,\" Weiss wrote.",
      "During the special counsel's probe, IRS agents who worked on the Hunter Biden tax case with Weiss' team came forward in an interview with CBS News to raise questions about what they alleged was special treatment in the probe of the president's son. The said that dating back to the Trump administration, they had repeatedly been prevented from taking steps in the IRS investigation that would have been considered routine in other cases.",
      "\"We have to make sure as a special agent for IRS Criminal Investigation that we treat every single person exactly the same,\" Gary Shapley, a 14-year veteran of the agency, told CBS News at the time. \"And that just simply didn't happen here.\"",
      "The Justice Department and Weiss denied that Hunter Biden received favorable treatment.",
      "In a letter to Garland included in the report, Hunter Biden's legal team pointed out its criticism of the probe and told the attorney general, \"you likely are aware of the arguments we have made about the initiation and conduct of the prosecutions against our client.\"",
      "\"These are not 'inconsequential' or 'technical' tax code violations,\" Weiss wrote. \"The prosecution of Mr. Biden was warranted given the nature and seriousness of his tax crimes.\"",
      "Answering criticism of the gun charges, Weiss argued, \"An analysis of Justice Department data from 2008 to 2017 shows that these charges are brought more frequently than over 90 percent of the other available firearm offenses.\"",
      "According to Garland's letter to Congress, Weiss submitted the report a few days ago, on Friday. The attorney general noted there had been no instances during the probe when Garland had to intervene because of policy violations.",
      "The report also detailed Weiss' investigation into a former FBI informant, Alexander Smirnov, who pleaded guilty earlier this year to lying to FBI agents and providing them a fake story about the Bidens. Smirnov was sentenced to six years in prison earlier this month.",

    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 17:34:33 -0500",
    "summary": "President Biden spoke by phone Sunday with the families of three Americans held by the Taliban, Ryan Corbett, George Glezmann and Mahmood Habibi.",
    "story": [
      "In a roughly 30-minute phone call Sunday afternoon, President Biden delivered difficult news to the families of three Americans held by the Taliban. He did not have a deal with the Taliban to free their loved ones from captivity, despite what U.S. officials described to CBS News as a significant offer the U.S. had extended in Doha days earlier. The U.S. considers Ryan Corbett and George Glezmann to be wrongfully detained by the Taliban, and describes Mahmood Habibi, who holds dual American and Afghan citizenship, as \"unjustly held\" since 2022.",
      "Ahmad Shah Habibi, the brother of Mahmood Habibi, told CBS News that during the conversation, Mr. Biden clarified that he would not agree to the Taliban's demand that the U.S. release Muhammed Rahim al Afghani, a detainee at Guantanamo Bay, unless the Taliban, now the government of Afghanistan, also releases Mahmood. An NSC spokesman declined to respond to a CBS inquiry about that specific claim.",
      "Mahmood Habibi disappeared in Afghanistan in 2022, and the Taliban denied abducting him. In a public notice posted by the FBI in August 2024, the agency said it \"believed\" that Habibi was taken by Taliban military or security forces and \"has not been heard from since his disappearance.\" The FBI said in its notice that Habibi was working as a contractor for a Kabul-based telecom company when he disappeared.",
      "The Taliban still say they do not have Habibi in custody.",
      "\"No, we don't have him,\" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told CBS News Monday.",
      "Asked whether Mahmoud had disappeared in Afghanistan, Mujahid said, \"It's not clear either, because we didn't know him before.\"",
      "Ahmad Habibi told CBS News, \"My family has every confidence that my brother is alive. There are things that neither we nor the U.S. government can say publicly, but Mahmood's case is different from the other two Americans.\"",
      "\"We know the other families are desperate to get their loved ones home and I told the president we want them home, too,\" Ahmad Habibi added. \"But anyone speculating that my brother is dead is just feeding into Taliban claims. We are grateful that President Biden committed to not leave Mahmood behind,\" and he said that national security adviser Jake Sullivan had also made similar assurances.",
      "The FBI declined to comment.",
      "Corbett, who is fluent in Pashto, was working for local nongovernmental organizations before starting a microloan and consulting business in Kabul when he was arrested with three associates \u2014 one German and two Afghans \u2014 during a business trip to northern Afghanistan in 2022.",
      "Glezmann is an Atlanta native who was detained while on a tourist visit in December 2022.",
      "The family of Ryan Corbett is publicly calling on Mr. Biden to consider a deal to bring him and Glezmann home.",
      "\"We hope that President Biden will have the courage to take the deal in front of him, given that the lives of several Americans rest on his shoulders,\" Erin Pelton, a spokesperson for the Corbett family, told CBS News.",
      "Corbett's wife, Anna Corbett, described the call with the president during an appearance on Fox News on Monday.",
      "\"He was very kind and empathetic, but what I heard him say is he's not bringing Ryan home, and that was just devastating,\" Anna Corbett said. She blasted Mr. Biden for refusing to agree to the Taliban's terms for a deal. \"It is not being taken and it is incredibly crushing to our family.\"",
      "She has launched a public campaign in recent days to urge the incoming administration to press for her husband's release, and she traveled to President-elect Donald Trump's Mar-A-Lago residence in hopes of making an in-person plea to Trump. Neither Mr. Biden nor Trump have met with her yet.",
      "Anna Corbett did tell Fox News that Trump sent incoming national security adviser and current Florida Rep. Mike Waltz to meet with her. She said he spent more than an hour listening to her family's story. She expressed frustration that it took more than a year to get a similar meeting with the current national security adviser, Jake Sullivan.",
      "The Taliban have been demanding that the U.S. release Muhammed Rahim al-Afghani, who is being held in indefinite law-of-war detention at Guantanamo Bay. A source familiar with his case said the U.S. intelligence community and Pentagon oppose Rahim's release and could not guarantee that he no longer represented a threat to the U.S. However, the president could waive that if he determined it were in the U.S. interest to finalize a prisoner swap.",
      "Rahim was captured in Pakistan in 2007 by the CIA and was the last detainee sent to the Guantanamo prison facility by the Bush administration in 2008. He has never been charged with war crimes, but the periodic review board has deemed his continued detention a national security necessity. His 2016 intelligence profile describes him as a courier for al Qaeda.",
      "In its statement acknowledging the phone call, the White House also noted that Mr. Biden had been able to bring home U.S. citizens who had been detained before the U.S. exit from Afghanistan in 2021. Corbett, Glezmann and Habibi were detained after traveling to Afghanistan following the Taliban's return to power. That ascendance of the Taliban followed a diplomatic deal negotiated by the Trump administration for U.S. troops to withdraw and a surprisingly strong Taliban military offensive that caught the Biden administration off guard, leading to a hasty and chaotic U.S. evacuation. Unwilling to remain without U.S. troops, NATO forces also pulled out.",
      "The U.S. does not officially recognize the Taliban, with its horrific human rights record, as the legitimate government of Afghanistan but has been in contact with its leaders through U.S. agencies as well as via the Qatari government. Last weekend in Doha, Special Presidential Envoy Roger Carstens and NSC official Jen Daskal pressed for a deal with the Taliban to free the Americans.",
      "A U.S. official described the Doha meetings as unsuccessful but declined to detail which other individuals the Biden administration was willing to offer to the Taliban as part of a potential trade. The White House described the Biden efforts as continuing through the end of his term.",
      "Mr. Biden has dedicated much of his career to foreign policy, and that portion of his legacy is extremely important to him. In a speech Monday at the State Department, the president will describe the chaotic U.S. exit from Afghanistan, arguably his biggest foreign policy failure, as having successfully ended America's longest war.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday said it will not consider whether to quash lawsuits brought by Honolulu seeking billions of dollars from oil and gas companies for the damage caused by the effects of climate change, clearing the way for the cases to move forward.",
      "The legal battle pursued in Hawaii state court is similar to others filed against the nation's largest energy companies by state and local governments in their courts. The suits claim that the oil and gas industry engaged in a deceptive campaign and misled the public about the dangers of their fossil fuel products and the environmental impacts.",
      "A group of 15 energy companies asked the Supreme Court to review a decision from the Hawaii Supreme Court that allowed a lawsuit brought by the city and county of Honolulu, as well as its Board of Water Supply, to proceed. The suit was brought in Hawaii state court in March 2020, and Honolulu raised several claims under state law, including creating a public nuisance and failure to warn the public of the risks posed by their fossil fuel products.",
      "The city accused the oil and gas industry of contributing to global climate change, leading to flooding, erosion and more frequent and intense extreme weather events. These changes, they said, have led to property damage and a drop in tax revenue as a result of less tourism.",
      "The energy companies unsuccessfully sought to have the case moved to federal court, arguing that the claims raised by Honolulu under state law were overridden by federal law and the Clean Air Act. A state trial court denied their efforts to dismiss the case.",
      "The oil and gas industry has argued that greenhouse-gas emissions \"flow from billions of daily choices, over more than a century, by governments, companies and individuals about what types of fuels to use, and how to use them.\" Honolulu, the companies said, was seeking damages for the \"cumulative effect of worldwide emissions leading to global climate change.\"",

The state's highest court determined that the Clean Air Act displaced federal common law governing suits seeking damages for interstate pollution. It also rejected the oil companies' argument that Honolulu was seeking to regulate emissions through its lawsuit, finding that the city instead wanted to challenge the promotion and sale of fossil fuel products \"without warning and abetted by a sophisticated disinformation campaign.\"",
      "\"Plaintiffs' state tort law claims do not seek to regulate emissions, and there is thus no 'actual conflict' between Hawaii tort law and the [Clean Air Act],\" the Hawaii Supreme Court ruled. \"These claims potentially regulate marketing conduct while the CAA regulates pollution.\"",
      "The oil companies asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the ruling from the Hawaii high court and urged it to stop Honolulu's lawsuit from going forward. Regulation of interstate pollution is a federal area governed by federal law, lawyers for the energy industry argued.",
      "\"Rarely does a case of such extraordinary importance to one of the nation's most vital industries come before this court,\" lawyers for the companies said in a filing. \"Energy companies that produce, sell, and market fossil fuels are facing numerous lawsuits in state courts across the nation seeking billions of dollars in damages for injuries allegedly caused by global climate change.\"",
      "The oil and gas companies argued the case raises a \"recurring question of extraordinary importance to the energy industry,\" and one they urged the Supreme Court to address.",
      "\"In these cases, state and local governments are attempting to assert control over the nation's energy policies by holding energy companies liable for worldwide conduct in ways that starkly conflict with the policies and priorities of the federal government,\" they said. \"That flouts this court's precedents and basic principles of federalism, and the court should put a stop to it.\"",
      "Lawyers for Honolulu said in a filing that the case seeks to hold the oil and gas industry accountable under Hawaii law for \"deliberately concealing and misrepresenting the climate-change impacts of their fossil-fuel products.\"",
      "Its lawsuit, the city continued, does not interfere with the Environmental Protection Agency's authority to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions. Honolulu's legal team accused the oil and gas companies of pushing a theory in the case that \"improperly attempts to cloak the former federal common law of interstate pollution in constitutional garb, with no foundation in the Constitution's text or history.\"",
      "The Supreme Court in June asked the Biden administration to weigh in on the cases and whether it should step into the dispute. In a filing submitted to the Supreme Court before the transfer of presidential power, the Biden administration urged the justices to turn away the appeals, in part because it said it is too soon for them to intervene.",

    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 08:13:05 -0500",
    "summary": "The proposal is raising concerns with the chip industry, with artificial intelligence leader Nvidia calling it \"misguided.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Biden administration is proposing new restrictions that would limit the export of advanced computer chips used to develop artificial intelligence, part of an effort to preserve America's six- to 18-month advantage on AI over rivals such as China.",
      "Proposed Monday, the framework is raising concerns of chip industry executives who say the rules would limit access to existing chips used for video games and restrict in 120 countries the chips used for data centers and AI products. Mexico, Portugal, Israel and Switzerland are among the nations that could have limited access.",
      "Chip giant Nvidia on Monday called\u00a0the proposal \"misguided,\" and said that it \"threatens to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide.\"",
      "On a call with reporters previewing the framework, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said that it's \"critical\" to preserve America's leadership in AI and the development of AI-related computer chips. The fast-evolving AI technology enables computers to produce novels, make scientific research breakthroughs, automate driving and foster a range of other transformations that could reshape economies and warfare.",
      "\"As AI becomes more powerful, the risks to our national security become even more intense,\" Raimondo said. The framework \"is designed to safeguard the most advanced AI technology and ensure that it stays out of the hands of our foreign adversaries but also enabling the broad diffusion and sharing of the benefits with partner countries.\"",
      "White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan stressed that the framework would ensure that the most cutting-edge aspects of AI would be developed within the United States and with its closest allies, instead of possibly getting offshored such as the battery and renewable energy sectors.",
      "Government officials said they felt they needed to act quickly to preserve U.S. companies' advantage over China and other nations, an edge that could be easily eroded if competitors could stockpile chips and make further gains.",
      "AI-enhanced technology is forecast to help fuel growth and boost corporate productivity, with Wedbush analyst Dan Ives calling the tech developments a \"once in a generation 4th Industrial Revolution\" in a recent research note.",
      "Risks to AI leadership?",
      "A tech industry group, the Information Technology Industry Council, warned Raimondo in a letter last week that a hastily implemented new rule from the Democratic administration could fragment global supply chains and put U.S. companies at a disadvantage.",
      "\"While we share the U.S. government's commitment to national and economic security, the rule's potential risks to U.S. global leadership in AI cannot be emphasized enough,\" said a statement from Naomi Wilson, the group's senior vice president for Asia and global trade policy. She called for a more extensive consultation with the tech industry.",
      "One industry executive, who is familiar with the framework and insisted on anonymity to discuss it, said the proposed restrictions would limit access to chips already used for video games, despite claims made otherwise by the government. The executive said it would also limit which companies could build data centers abroad.",
      "Nvidia bashes proposal",
      "Because the framework includes a 120-day comment period, the incoming Republican administration of President-elect Donald Trump could ultimately determine the rules for the sales abroad of advanced computer chips. This sets up a scenario in which Trump will have to balance economic interests with the need to keep the United States and its allies safe.",
      "Ned Finkle, vice president of external affairs at Nvidia, said in a statement that the prior Trump administration had helped create the foundation for AI's development and that the proposed framework would hurt innovation without achieving the stated national security goals.",
      "\"While cloaked in the guise of an 'anti-China' measure, these rules would do nothing to enhance U.S. security,\" he said. \"The new rules would control technology worldwide, including technology that is already widely available in mainstream gaming PCs and consumer hardware.\"",
      "Under the framework, roughly 20 key allies and partners would face no restrictions on accessing chips, but other countries would face caps on the chips they could import, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House.",
      "Nations without restrictions",
      "The allies without restrictions include Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Republic of Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.",
      "Users outside of these close allies could purchase up to 50,000 graphics processing units per country. There would also be government-to-government deals which could bump up the cap to 100,000 if their renewable energy and technological security goals are aligned with the U.S.",
      "Institutions in certain countries could also apply for a legal status that would let them purchase up to 320,000 advanced graphics processing units over two years. Still, there would be limits as to how much AI computational capacity could be placed abroad by companies and other institutions.",
      "Also, computer chip orders equivalent to 1,700 advanced graphics processing units would not need a license to import or count against the national chip cap, among the other standards set by the framework. The exception for the 1,700 graphics processing units would likely help to meet the orders for universities and medical institutions, as opposed to data centers.",

    "story": [
      "Under President Biden, enrollment in Medicaid hit a record high and the uninsured rate reached a record low.",
      "Donald Trump's return\u00a0to the White House \u2014 along with a GOP-controlled Senate and House of Representatives \u2014 is expected to change that.",
      "Republicans in Washington say they plan to use funding cuts and regulatory changes to dramatically shrink Medicaid, the nearly $900-billion-a-year government health insurance program that, along with the related Children's Health Insurance Program, serves about 79 million mostly low-income or disabled Americans.",
      "The proposals include rolling back the Affordable Care Act's expansion of Medicaid, which over the last 11 years added about 20 million low-income adults to its rolls. Trump has said he wants to drastically cut government spending, which may be necessary for Republicans to extend 2017 tax cuts that expire at the end of this year.",
      "Trump made little mention of Medicaid during the 2024 campaign. The first Trump administration approved work requirements in several states, though only Arkansas implemented theirs before a federal judge said it violated the law. The first Trump administration also sought to block grant funding to states.",
      "House Budget Committee Chair Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, told KFF Health News that Medicaid and other federal entitlement programs need major changes to help cut the federal debt. \"Without them, we will watch this country sadly enter into fiscal collapse.\"",
      "Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, a member of the Budget Committee, said Congress needs to explore cutting federal spending on Medicaid.",
      "\"You need wholesale reform on the health care front, which can include undoing a lot of the damage being done by the ACA and Obamacare,\" Roy said. \"Frankly, we could end up providing better service if we do it the right way.\"",
      "Advocates for poor people fear GOP funding cuts will leave more Americans without insurance, making it harder for them to get care.",
      "\"Medicaid is an obvious target for huge cuts,\" said Joan Alker, executive director of Georgetown University's Center for Children and Families. \"An existential fight about Medicaid's future likely lies ahead.\"",
      "Medicaid, which turns 60 in July, is nearing the end of a disruptive period, after COVID pandemic-era coverage protections expired in 2023 and all enrollees had to prove they still qualified. More than 25 million people lost coverage over the 18 months after the \"unwinding\" began, though it has not notably increased the number of people without insurance, according to the latest census data.",
      "The unwinding's disruptions could pale in comparison to what happens in the next four years, said Matt Salo, former executive director and founder of the National Association of Medicaid Directors. \"What we are going to see is an even bigger seismic shift in who Medicaid covers and how it operates,\" he said.",
      "But Salo said any efforts to shrink the program will face pushback.",
      "\"A lot of powerful entities \u2014 state governments, managed-care organizations, long-term care providers, and everyone under the sun who wants to do well by doing good \u2014 wants to see Medicaid work efficiently and be adequately funded,\" he said. \"And they will be highly motivated to push back on something they see as draconian cuts, because it could affect their business model.\"",
      "The GOP is looking at several tactics to reduce the size of Medicaid:",
      "Shifting to block grants. Switching to annual block grants could lower federal funding for states to operate the program while giving states more discretion over how to spend the money. Currently, the government matches a certain percentage of state spending each year with no cap. Republican presidents since Ronald Reagan have sought to block-grant Medicaid with no success. Arrington said he favors ending the open-ended federal funding to states and replacing it with a set annual amount based on how many people each state has in the program.Cutting ACA Medicaid funding. The ACA provided financing to cover, through Medicaid, Americans with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level, or $20,783 for an individual last year. The federal government pays 90% of the cost for adults covered through the law's Medicaid expansion, which 40 states and Washington, D.C., have adopted. The GOP may try to lower that funding to the same match rate the feds pay states for everyone else in the program, which averages about 60%. \"We should absolutely note that we are subsidizing the healthy, able-bodied Medicaid expansion population at a higher rate than we do the poorest and sickest among us, which was the original intent of the program,\" Arrington said. \"That's not right.\"Lowering federal matching funds. Since Medicaid began, the federal match rate has been based on the relative wealth of a state's population, with poorer states receiving a higher rate and no state receiving less than a 50% match. Ten states get the base rate \u2014 all but two are Democratic-run states, including New York and California. The GOP may seek to cut the base rate to 40% or less.Adding work requirements. During the first Trump term, federal courts ruled that Medicaid law doesn't allow coverage to be conditioned on enrollees' working or seeking jobs. But the GOP may try again. \"If we can get strict work requirements on able-bodied adults, that can be a huge cost savings by itself,\" Rep. Tom McClintock, R-California, told KFF Health News. Because most Medicaid enrollees already work, go to school or serve as caregivers, critics say such a requirement would simply add red tape to obtaining coverage, with little impact on employment.Placing enrollment hurdles. About 10 states offer some populations what's called continuous eligibility, whereby people stay enrolled for years without having to renew their coverage. That policy's been shown to prevent enrollees from falling out of the program for short periods because of hardships or paperwork problems, which can lead to surprise medical bills and debt. The Trump administration could seek to repeal waivers that allow states to grant multiyear continuous eligibility, which would require people in those states to reapply for coverage annually.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Naples, Florida and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who has a new documentary airing on PBS, \"Coming to America.\" It examines how nine remarkable American immigrants have shaped our country's history. Welcome to \"Face the Nation.\"",
      "FORMER SPEAKER NEWT GINGRICH: Good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In this documentary, you tell the stories of these individuals who immigrated to the US, and they were very successful, people like Albert Einstein. You know, when you look at Einstein and you look at Henry Kissinger, they were refugees to this country. Donald Trump set refugee admissions at very low levels first term. He's talking about blocking refugee admissions this term. Is that a mistake?",
      "FORMER SPEAKER GINGRICH: Well, I think, I think we're going through a period of, frankly, reacting to an extraordinarily disastrous immigration policy. So you're going to have some twists and turns. In the long run, we do want to have an ability to allow legitimate refugees to come here. We also, and part of the reason Calista and I made this documentary for PBS, is- we really believe strongly that legal immigrants are a major contribution to America's success and to its exceptional nature. And we want to make sure that, you know, as many Americans favor legal immigration as opposed to illegal immigration\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Right.",
      "FORMER SPEAKER GINGRICH: It's very important to distinguish the two, and we want to strongly communicate that legal immigration in a variety of forms, refugees is one, and another is various work permits. But we want people to be able to come to America if they do so legally.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You said immigrants inhabit the very soul of what it is to be an American. When you say legitimate refugees, what do you mean?",
      "FORMER SPEAKER GINGRICH: Well, I think people can- can stand up and say, I've now decided I'm a refugee. I feel threatened. The question is, is that true or not? Are they really threatened\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Claim asylum, you mean?",
      "FORMER SPEAKER GINGRICH: \u2013or is that just their way of getting into the United States? To claim asylum, I think there's a big- there's a big difference between somebody who genuinely faces a potential loss of life or freedom and somebody who simply wants to come to America and decides to claim that status",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Economic migrants, there. Let me ask you, someone else you feature in here, Zalmay Khalilzad. Very prominent Afghan American who brokered Trump's deal with the Taliban to exit Afghanistan. As you know, with that chaotic exit, there were tens of thousands of Afghans scattered, some of them still separated from their families. Many of them worked for the U.S. government. Should Mr. Trump extend the legal process of this program and bring those Afghans here, and would you ask Congress to raise the current cap they have on the number of them coming?",
      "FORMER SPEAKER GINGRICH: You know, I think the Afghan refugees who actively fought on the side of Americans, saved American lives, tried to help win against the Taliban- I think they deserve an unusual level of support and treatment. And I worked all during the period of President Biden's insanely disastrous withdrawal. I tried to work with various people and did podcasts with people who were trying to get folks out of Afghanistan who should legitimately have been helped by the U.S. government. So, when somebody is totally your ally- and this happened with the Vietnamese and the Vietnamese War, when somebody is totally your ally and they risk their lives side by side with you, you shouldn't abandon them. That's a pretty straightforward rule.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one of the things that Biden administration blamed the Trump administration for was the difficulty in making those fast arrangements to bring those Afghans here, and that's a story for another day, but the person they put their finger on as making it more difficult is Stephen Miller, who is now the top policy adviser to Mr. Trump. He did add new requirements to visas, other things that made it harder to legally come here. Have you spoken to him about some of your concerns?",
      "FORMER SPEAKER GINGRICH: No, I know Stephen very well. Look, Stephen was responding to a disastrous level of immigration that's not sustainable. And I think that's- I think virtually every American agrees you can't have an open border. You can't have Venezuelan gangs, for example, or El Salvadorian gangs. I mean, there are a lot of good reasons, and you're going to get some overreaction, but it's an overreaction, frankly, caused by people like President Biden, who were totally irresponsible in allowing people into this country by the millions in a way that was totally illegal. It was outside the law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay- Pardon me, I don't know if our viewers heard that there was an alarm that went off here, so it interrupted some of- of what you said there. Donald Trump has chosen your wife, Callista, who helped make this documentary with you, to be the next ambassador to Switzerland. Are you advising the President-elect in any capacity right now?",
      "FORMER SPEAKER GINGRICH: Well, I chat with him, and I certainly chat with members of the team. I've had a long experience as a Republican activist\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Okay\u2013",
      "FORMER SPEAKER GINGRICH: \u2013On some things, like getting through the tax cut bill\u2013",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington.",
      "And this week on Face the Nation: As we begin what's now day six of the catastrophic fires in Southern California, the situation is still extremely volatile and therefore still very dangerous. The death toll stands at 16, with 150,000 residents under evacuation orders.",
      "The long-term impact on Californians' health and damage done to the environment are incalculable. The cost to rebuild in California, which boasts the largest economy in America, are impossible to tally at this point.",
      "The causes for the individual fires are under investigation, but scientists say there's no question that climate change exacerbated the factors leading to these cataclysmic events.",
      "The two big fires, the coastal Palisades Fire and the inland Eaton Fires, are still raging and the National Weather Service has cited red flag wind warnings in the Southern California area through at least Wednesday.",
      "We begin with the very latest from our Jonathan Vigliotti.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "JONATHAN VIGLIOTTI (voice-over): More than 14,000 personnel from all over California, nine states, as well as Canada and Mexico, have mobilized to the bone-dry hills of Los Angeles, battling four active and sprawling wildfires menacing millions of people across the region.",
      "The massive Palisades Fire, the largest in the city, has grown to nearly 25,000 acres, destroying an estimated 75 percent of Pacific Palisades. Officials say that one-third of the eastern edge of Malibu has been destroyed too. The Palisades Fired now threatens nearby Brentwood and Encino, where additional evacuation orders have been issued.",
      "A brief break in the wind allowed aircraft to gain 11 percent containment Saturday as the region was bombarded with water and flame retarded. But planes were briefly grounded after drones were spotted in the airspace.",
      "In Altadena, the Eaton Fire has destroyed more than 14,000 acres and reduced thousands of homes to ash. That fire is now 27 percent contained. Officials say the rash of fires have burned through more than 40,000 acres and more than 12,000 structures have been destroyed, a city under siege.",
      "L.A. Mayor Karen Bass is now facing calls to resign from a growing number of people who say the city's response was inadequate.",
      "My question to you is, what explains this lack of preparation and rapid response?",
      "KAREN BASS (D-Mayor of Los Angeles, California): When we are safe, when lives have been saved and homes have been saved, we will absolutely do an evaluation.",
      "JONATHAN VIGLIOTTI: Her own fire chief has said budget cuts hampered firefighting efforts.",
      "KRISTIN CROWLEY (Los Angeles City, California, Fire Chief): We are screaming to be properly funded to make sure that our firefighters can do their jobs.",
      "JONATHAN VIGLIOTTI: The cause of the fires are still under investigation, and the National Guard is on scene to prevent looting and enforce a nightly curfew.",
      "(End VT)",
      "JONATHAN VIGLIOTTI: And red flag warnings are back in effect.",
      "Wind gusts could exceed 50 miles per hour. Meanwhile, officials are preemptively cutting power in some neighborhoods to prevent more fires from sparking, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Jonathan Vigliotti reporting from Pacific Palisades, stay safe, and thank you.",
      "We turn now to FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell.",
      "Welcome back to Face the Nation.",
      "DEANNE CRISWELL (FEMA Administrator): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: These Santa Ana winds are forecast to continue into the next week, and that could fuel some of the blazes. What is your biggest area of concern right now?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR DEANNE CRISWELL: You know, with these winds coming back, and them issuing the red flag warnings, you know, these winds change the \u2013 the dynamics of this fire.",
      "And so I'm concerned for the safety of our firefighters, concerned for their ability continue to contain this fire. And I want people to make sure that they are listening closely to what local officials are saying, so they can stay safe and they can stay out of harm's way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I know the winds themselves are rare for this particular time of year, but Los Angeles and the area, they have got a lot of experience with wildfires. They have a lot of regulation and a large firefighting force.",
      "Do you have a sense at this point why the area was so unprepared?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR DEANNE CRISWELL: I think that they were very prepared. This is something that they are very used to. They fight fires all the time.",
      "But they have never seen 100-mile-an-hour winds that are fueling the fire, and those winds and that weather condition is what really impacts, you know, where this fire is going to go, but, more importantly, how they're able to try to contain it in those first few hours and days.",
      "And because it was in such a populated area, it just makes it that much more challenging to be able to get in there and secure the perimeter, but as well try to save as many homes as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of the federal response and the support you're giving to local authorities, President Biden spoke a few times from the Oval Office this week, and he did mention the need to move power lines underground.",
      "Do you know, were the power lines a cause of any of these blazes?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR DEANNE CRISWELL: Yes, I don't have any information on the cause, and I think that's certainly going to be something that's going to be, you know, under investigation.",
      "But I think, when we think about moving the power lines underground, it's not just from the cause, but it's also, how do you keep the power on when we have these severe weather incidents? When you underground them, you create a more resilient community, and it can withstand the impacts of all of these different types of storms, whether it's fires or hurricanes. And we want to be able to keep these communities energized.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Will that be a requirement for any federal support for the rebuild?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR DEANNE CRISWELL: It's not going to be a requirement for us unless it's part of their local code, right? And we want to be able to enforce the local codes that they have, and so we'll work closely with California, also using this as an opportunity.",
      "You know, even if it's not a requirement, is this something that they want to be able to do? We have additional ways that we can fund that through our programs as they begin the rebuilding.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The governor has indicated he's looking at a number of executive orders. If local environmental regulations are loosened here in order to help quickly rebuild, does that concern you at all? And will it make it more complicated for people to obtain insurance, which we already know is quite expensive and hard for many Californians to get?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR DEANNE CRISWELL: You know, the insurance piece is a real concern.",
      "We've, you know, heard the stories of so many people that have lost their insurance prior to this event. And that's the number one resource that families have to help with their rebuilding process.",
      "And so what I think we want to be able to do is, we want to be able to work with the governor's team to rebuild in a way that makes communities more resilient, that keeps insurance companies there, right, that we rebuild in a way that makes them stronger, and reducing the impact, so they want to stay in these communities, and they don't have to lose the insurance carriers.",
      "We have to be able to work together with the insurance industry to help find ways to \u2013 to keep this really valuable resource in place for so many families.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But many of these policies were already canceled months ago, as we've been reporting.",
      "So, should the government, though, be in the business of stepping in and helping people rebuild if the private market has deemed these areas just too risky?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR DEANNE CRISWELL: You know, our programs really help jump- start the recovery process. But, without insurance, families are going to have to find other means to be able to rebuild.",
      "But, again, it's not necessarily just where you rebuild. It's going to be how. And we want to be able to do things that can encourage families to rebuild their homes in a way that make them more fire-resistant. You know, we have a lot of science and technology out there that shows ways that we can make these homes stronger and more resistant against these fires. That's really where we need to focus our efforts as we move into the rebuilding phase.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: President Biden said that 100 percent of the firefighting costs will be picked up for six months on the federal tab, but there is the separate issue of individual assistance to victims who lost their homes.",
      "We checked, and Congress set the maximum FEMA grant level at just short of $44,000. It's very expensive living in California. Does that need to be raised? Should Congress do that?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR DEANNE CRISWELL: So, again, our programs aren't designed to replace insurance. Our programs are designed to jump-start the recovery process.",
      "And we know that in \u2013 in many areas, not just California, that, you know, that is not going to be enough to rebuild a home, which is why insurance is so important. We'll work with other partners. And one of our greatest partners is the Small Business Administration that can do low-interest loans to these families to give them another resource to help rebuild.",
      "We'll also work with our nonprofit partners, philanthropic partners, bringing the whole society together, so we can work with each family to help them figure out the right tools that they're going to need and the decisions that they're going to have to make as they go down this recovery journey.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're describing a really costly enterprise here. I have seen estimates on damages that range from $60 billion to $130 billion. Do you have any ballpark figure at this point?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR DEANNE CRISWELL: No.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it would seem, according to President Biden, that Congress is going to have to do more.",
      "ADMINISTRATOR DEANNE CRISWELL: Yes, I don't have any good estimates right now.",
      "And I think it's important to remember that these fires are still burning, which means damage is still happening. But the cost for this disaster, both from just the physical infrastructure, but also the economic losses, they're going to be significant. There's going to be other programs that congress can work through, like HUD's Community Development Block Grant for Disaster program, that can also help cover some of the things that FEMA's programs don't cover, or other parts of the insurance industry.",
      "There's a wide variety of different tools and resources that can be used that need to be authorized by Congress to really help this community on this road to recovery.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we appreciate you joining us today to get the message out.",
      "Administrator Criswell, good luck to you.",
      "ADMINISTRATOR DEANNE CRISWELL: Yes, thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we turn now to California Democratic Congresswoman Judy Chu.",
      "Part of her district has been affected by the Eaton Fire, and she joins us from the Pasadena Convention Center, currently sheltering more than 500 local residents.",
      "Good morning to you, Congresswoman.",
      "I know 11 of these reported deaths were in your community. How are you, and do you know if the community is out of the danger zone at this point?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JUDY CHU (D-California): It is not out of the danger zone.",
      "We have another Santa Ana gust of winds that will happen Monday or Tuesday. They will be around 50 miles per hour. That is less than what caused this whole terrible catastrophe. Last week, the winds were between 80 to 100 miles per hour. Nonetheless, they could spread the fire.",
      "And I urge all residents to pay attention to the evacuation warnings and orders, and most of all to make sure that they are safe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I understand that there were water pressure issues in the Altadena area. There was no local police or fire department. You all rely on the county for that kind of resource.",
      "Do you think, going forward, does this need to change? Have you talked to the governor?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JUDY CHU: We have been in touch with the governor.",
      "But what I want to do is to assure people that there is enough water. And, in fact, the fire department agencies have assured me that there is enough. But when the fires first happened, there was a combination of drastic winds and the fire. And, as a result, they were overwhelmed. This \u2013 this is not an ordinary incident.",
      "And many fire hydrants were going on at the same time, and also the electricity used to pump the water had been turned off, so that there would not spark anymore fires. So, that happened at that point, but I believe that we're in a good place right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I imagine a lot of the people in that shelter behind you are just wondering when they'll be able to go and see what's left of their neighborhoods.",
      "The state of California, as we understand it, put a moratorium Thursday on insurers dropping Californians from \u2013 from coverage. But it raises these questions of, are these communities going to be rebuilt and should they be rebuilt?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JUDY CHU: These communities have to be rebuilt.",
      "I have the beautiful areas of Altadena and Pasadena, and these were vibrant communities, diverse communities with so much historic value behind them. People love these areas. And we need to make sure that there are the resources possible for them to rebuild their homes, as well as the incredible small businesses that are here.",
      "So, this is why, after I took the tour of the devastated areas witness \u2013 with our FEMA administrator, I decided to arrange for a tour of our California congressmembers, which took place just yesterday, so that they could see the devastation for themselves. We need to make sure that Congress is ready to provide the help that's needed to rebuild these areas like Altadena and Pasadena.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: One of your Republican colleagues went on FOX, Congressman Warren Davidson, and said he'd oppose having an open checkbook approach to a place that, no matter how bad your policies are, would be crazy.",
      "He said it sounds like he wants strings attached to further aid. Have you talked to Republican leadership? Have you talked to Speaker Johnson yet about coming to California?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JUDY CHU: We are planning to invite Speaker Johnson, as well as President Trump, to come to this area and to witness the devastation for themselves.",
      "We have already been in touch with Republican congressmembers, and they have expressed that they are very open to coming and seeing what is going on. You know, these wildfires don't have any political affiliation. They don't belong to any political party.",
      "This devastation has affected thousands upon thousands of people who just ran out of their homes with nothing in their hands and are trying to rebuild. And they need help.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, in terms of that help, first, they have to figure out if their insurance covers anything. Then they can go to the federal government for help. But FEMA has a grant limit of $44,000.",
      "It's Congress that set that limit. Does that need to be raised? And are you hearing from your constituents that they are getting help, they're able to access these resources?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JUDY CHU: Well, first of all, I want to say that FEMA is opening a local assistance center on Tuesday, and anybody can walk in or call and get the assistance that they need.",
      "Actually, there are temporary locations too happening even today and tomorrow at the local libraries. FEMA is also here at this Pasadena Convention Center. And so there are many ways in which people can get help. They \u2013 of course, what we are encouraging everybody to do is to sign up on DisasterAssistance.gov immediately to get the process going.",
      "Of course, they will have to have their insurance information available.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will see if raising the amount of assistance or what changes to assistance are made in the coming weeks and months.",
      "Congresswoman Chu, thank you, and we wish you and your community the best of luck.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JUDY CHU: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And if you at home want to help those affected by the wildfires, CBS is partnering with the American Red Cross, which is staffing evacuation centers and providing supplies to people forced out of their homes. To donate, go to RedCross.org/CBS.",
      "And we will be back in one minute with a lot more Face the Nation.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On Tuesday, the Senate begins consideration of several of the president-elect's national security nominees.",
      "Our Scott Pelley sat down with outgoing FBI Director Christopher Wray for tonight's 60 Minutes and talked to him about the challenges facing the new national security team.",
      "Here's a preview of Scott's interview and one threat that's been of particular concern to Director Wray.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "CHRISTOPHER WRAY (FBI Director): China's cyber program is by far and away the world's largest, bigger than that of every major nation combined and has stolen more of Americans' personal and corporate data than that of every nation, big or small, combined.",
      "But even beyond the cyber theft, there's another part of the Chinese cyber threat that I think has not gotten the attention publicly that it, I think, desperately deserves. And that is Chinese government's prepositioning on American civilian critical infrastructure to lie in wait on those networks to be in a position to wreak havoc, and can inflict real-world harm at a time and place of their choosing.",
      "SCOTT PELLEY: The Chinese have already insinuated malware into critical American infrastructure?",
      "DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER WRAY: That's correct.",
      "SCOTT PELLEY: Like what?",
      "DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER WRAY: Things like water treatment plants. We're talking about transportation systems. We're talking about targeting of our energy sector, the electric grid, natural gas pipelines.",
      "And, recently, we have seen targeting of our telecommunications system.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you can see more from Scott Pelley's interview with Director Wray tonight on 60 Minutes at 7:00 p.m. Eastern.",
      "We turn now to the number two Republican in the Senate, Wyoming's John Barrasso. He joins us this morning from Casper, Wyoming.",
      "Welcome back to Face the Nation.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO (R-Wyoming): Thank you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's a busy week ahead in the Senate.",
      "But, before I get to that business, I do want to ask you about these fires in California. Do you expect that Congress will have to provide an additional aid package? And, if so, when?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: What we're seeing is heartbreaking. It's horrible, affecting people, you know, old and young, rich and poor.",
      "Everyone in the Wyoming National Guard is there on the scene helping with manpower as well as equipment. When you see what's being shown on television, in addition to the tragedy on the ground, you're also seeing gross mismanagement in California by elected officials.",
      "And it's heartbreaking to hear the fire chief say that they've diverted all of this money away from the fire department to be used for social programs, when they were already stretched too thin. So, yes, I expect there's going to be hearings. There's going to be requests of Congress.",
      "There can't be a blank check on this, however, because people want to make sure that, as rebuilding occurs, as things go on in California, they have to be resilient, so that these sorts of things can't happen again. And the policies of the liberal administration out there, I believe, have made these fires worse.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you expect, though, that Congress and Republicans will still help these Americans in need, even if they don't like their local politics in the party?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: I expect that there will be strings attached to money that is ultimately approved, and it has to do with being ready the next time, because this was a gross failure this time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, let me move on to what's happening this week, because you are the whip. You are the vote-counter. You are watching very closely what these hearings for these picks made by Donald Trump will be like.",
      "Starting Tuesday, 13 of the picks are going to be up for questioning. Leader Thune told us last Sunday he suspects a lot we'll get through, but we'll see about all of them.",
      "Which nominees are you certain will be confirmed by January 20?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, let's start with, we were elected, Republicans are now in the House, the Senate and the White House because Americans wanted safety and prosperity.",
      "So you're right. The rubber hits the road this week with all of these hearings on the Cabinet. And then, when President Trump takes office next Monday, there is going to be shock and awe with executive orders, a blizzard of executive orders, on the economy, as well as on the border.",
      "So, when we met with President Trump just this \u2013 earlier this past week, what President Trump said, the number one goal for the Senate needs to be to get his team in place. I have met with just about all of them. I support every one of these nominees. As the whip, my job is to make sure they get across the finish line, get on the job.",
      "And President Trump deserves a team early. Chuck Schumer said he wants to make fireworks at the hearings. If that happens, we are going to work around the clock through the night through weekends to make sure we get that Cabinet confirmed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to ask you about some of those picks on the other side of this commercial break, and how many of them will sail through, since you do have the Republican majority and enough votes to do this without Democratic help.",
      "We'll talk about those specifics in a moment. Stay with us through this break.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Coming up in our next half-hour, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.",
      "His new project is Journey to America, a PBS documentary profiling several famous immigrants and their contributions to America, like the late diplomat Henry Kissinger, who fled Germany in 1938.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "HENRY KISSINGER (Former U.S. Secretary of State): And the circumstances that I had known were a dictatorship that was persecuting people of my ethnic background.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will talk with the former speaker about that, politics, and get his thoughts on president-elect Trump's plans for immigration reform.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation, including the Senate Republican whip, John Barrasso, Arizona Democratic Senator Mark Kelly, and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.",
      "Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We return to our conversation now with Wyoming Republican Senator John Barrasso.",
      "Senator, you are the whip. You count the votes. Does Pete Hegseth, the pick to run the Pentagon, have them?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO (R-WY): Well, he certainly has the qualities that we need to lead the Pentagon. He knows about a fit fighting force. He is very qualified. In my opinion, he has a record - a distinguished record of service in the military.",
      "Every senator gets to speak for themselves, and they will do that. The meetings have gone very well. Things are heading in the right direction. The hearings start Tuesday, and they're going to be consequential. People will listen and make their own decision. People have already had chances to ask questions, and they're going to continue to do so. I expect he's going to have quality answers to the questions that they ask.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, your colleague, Senator Joni Ernst, who is a sexual assault survivor herself, did say last month that she wanted the FBI to vet the claims against Mr. Hegseth that were made by an accuser who said that he raped her. He denies that that assault happened. He claims it was consensual sex despite her filing of that police report.",
      "She also asked that the results be presented to the committee. Is that FBI vetting being shared with members of the Armed Services Committee?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, Joni is a warrior. She is a patriot. I know she's had a chance to meet with the nominee at least twice. And advise and consent is about giving advice, as well as asking consent. She's going to ask additional questions at the hearing on Tuesday. And she'll ultimately make her decision.",
      "With regard to the FBI report, it's reported today that the chairman and the ranking member of the committee have seen the report already. Traditionally, those reports do not get shared with the other members of the committee. That goes back four decades -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Back when, you know, John McCain was chairman of the committee. And I support the chairman in that decision.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's why it is so notable that such a prominent member and other senators are asking to see FBI vetting.",
      "Do you prefer that the details of that sexual assault be disclosed in a public hearing, or would you support that those private investigative details be shared with members at the discretion of the chairman?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, the chairman is going to make that decision, and I support the chairman. I also support Pete Hegseth.",
      "If you take a look at the current nominee compared to who's been in the Pentagon the last four years where they had a woke military, where recruitment went down, morale went down, I think Pete is going to be terrific in terms of recruitment, in terms of morale, in terms of returning America to a fighting force, which is what the American people really want. They want to make sure, if our military is called upon, they're ready to go, that they are ready to fight, and that with intimidating power.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Just to correct myself, alleged sexual assault.",
      "So, let me ask you about another nominee, or nominee to be. One to run the intelligence community and oversee all the agencies. It appears the only member of Mr. Trump's national security team that doesn't have a real scheduled hearing is Tulsi Gabbard. Is it the FBI background check that's holding things up, or is it the ethics disclosure that's a problem?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Yes, I support Tulsi Gabbard. She is amazing in that she has been a member of Congress and a combat veteran, a decorated combat veteran for work under fire in Iraq.",
      "You're right, it's a paperwork problem right now with the Office of Government Ethics. We had hoped to have the hearing later this week. It looks like it's going to be the following week. But she continues to have promotions in the military. She's a lieutenant colonel. She now has top- level security clearances. She is the right person to keep America secure and safe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: She took the unusual measure of releasing a public statement reversing some past policy positions she'd taken when it came to surveillance.",
      "Are you concerned that you don't have enough Republicans who are willing to vote for her?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: I'm not concerned at all about that. Senator Tom Cotton, who's chairman of the Intelligence Committee, has met with her on numerous occasions. She will have a hearing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: She has to raise her right hand, take an oath at the time. She will be telling the truth.",
      "And the issue that you just raised, which is foreign surveillance, she is now of the mind and the position that is consistent with the chairman of the committee and Republican members of the committee.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned shock and awe on day one of Mr. Trump's new term with executive orders, but some of this action is also going to require congressional help.",
      "This week, President Biden banned new offshore oil and gas drilling in 625 meters of the - of the ocean - excuse me, miles. Are you going to reverse that in the first reconciliation bill that Leader Thune told us about?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, what President Biden just did by executive order, I expect that President Trump will eliminate with executive orders as well.",
      "In terms of the reconciliation bill, we need results. The results are what matters. We were sent here - and President Trump says he doesn't care if it's one bill, two bills, three bills, he wants results that we are united, on securing the border, on bringing down costs for American citizens.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He wanted -",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: He - across what - we want to make sure that tax cuts don't - don't expire. We want to make sure that the country is safe and strong. Those are the issues that the American people elected us to do. That's what we're here to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just to follow up there, Mr. Trump has said one big, beautiful bill is what he wants. It seems procedural, but we know from - from the Senate side you would prefer two different reconciliation bills at two different times to tackle some of these big agenda items.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Again -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When you hear that the speaker of the House says it's got to be one, because he can only get one thing through, doesn't that underscore just how difficult unified Republican leadership is actually going to be?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: No. Results matter. And we're united with the results.",
      "And when President Trump met with us for a couple of hours, the senators, this past week, he said, I don't care how many bills, we just want to get it done. There are urgent needs that I'd like to get addressed immediately.",
      "You - you take a look at what happened this week in the Senate. There was actually bipartisanship because the first bill that we brought to the Senate floor, the Laken Riley bill, was about a wonderful young woman, 22, a nursing student in Georgia who was out for a jog, brutally murdered by an illegal immigrant.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Somebody who was a criminal in this country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Should have either been in jail or deported. But he was done - neither of those were done under the Biden administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: We have bipartisan support now even though Chuck Schumer blocked the bill last year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're going to talk about that with one of the Democratic senators who supported it later on in the program.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Great.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Barrasso, thank you for your time this morning.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Arizona Democratic Senator Mark Kelly, who joins us from Tuscan, Arizona.",
      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY (D-AZ): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's going to be a very busy week in the Senate.",
      "Before I get to those confirmation hearings, I want to follow up on what the FBI director told our Scott Pelley there in describing some of the Chinese hacking and what incoming national security adviser Mike Waltz called cyber time bombs throughout U.S. infrastructure.",
      "What needs to happen? What do the consequences need to be for China having done this and remaining in our infrastructure?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Well, we've got to be strong in standing up to them and explaining to them and, in some cases, I think, consequences need to be serious. There are things that we can do. We have the tools. But I would say, even beyond that, we've got to figure out a way to get them off of the infrastructure.",
      "With regards to the telecom system, multiple companies, you know, Chinese, cyber, software, are currently on those systems. And we're working to try to fix this. Some of this is going to require that the - the telecom companies upgrade their infrastructure that could be costly. We're currently working with them to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's pretty incredible that this espionage happened in the first place and expelling them is so hard to do.",
      "I want to also ask you about another Chinese question, and that has to do with TikTok, because the attorney for the company said they will go dark next Sunday unless the Supreme Court intervenes and stops this national security law from taking effect or delays it, as Mr. Trump has asked the court to do. What do you think is going to happen here?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Well, based on the oral argument in the case two days ago, it looks like the Supreme Court - I mean I don't really want to speculate, but it does look like they're going to uphold the law that we pass.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: So, I think on the 19th, so one day before - before the inauguration, you know, TikTok, on our systems, on our servers, become something that's now been banned by Congress. So, I imagine there's going to be a disruption in the service here, you know, starting on the 19th.",
      "I know this is controversial. I know there are folks out there that earn a living, you know, on TikTok. But it has a national security risk to it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: You know, one is the data. One of the risks. The thing that I'm more concerned about is their ability to manipulate the population of the United States, especially in time of a conflict.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: So, it was the right decision. I voted for it. And it looks like the Supreme Court is going to uphold the legislation that we passed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll track that story.",
      "I want to follow up on something Senator Barrasso brought up, which was the Laken Riley Act. You say you support this. It's a bill that would require federal authorities to detain undocumented immigrants charged with theft- related crimes rather than releasing them on parole. This bill was introduced last Congress. It didn't go anywhere. Was it wrong for Democrats not to take it up? Was it election year politics that made Democrats concerned about bringing it forward?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Well, in the last year we've been working with Republicans on bipartisan border security, legislation, with the hope of getting that passed, and then moving on to comprehensive immigration reform.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: I think we could do that. I think there's a lot of - you know, there's - you know, there's an effort. I think that's going to continue. You know, right now, this is certainly bipartisan. I voted for cloture on the, you know, motion to start talking about it. And, ultimately, I'll vote to - to pass it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. But do you regret not doing that - taking that position earlier?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Well -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: If Democrats were more muscular on this issue, which was such a live issue during the campaign.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Well, I mean, the Laken Riley Act is very specific.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: I mean it does one specific thing. We were working on something that was much more comprehensive, money for border patrol agents and hiring and infrastructure, policy changes. And policy changes, you know, you really have to do in a bipartisan way. We can't do that through the reconciliation process you were talking about.",
      "So, there is - you know, I think there's - there's going to be an effort ongoing. This is bipartisan. You're right, we didn't do this a year ago. You know, maybe we should have. But we were working on bipartisan border security legislation. We weren't able to get that across the finish line. I hope we can do that in this Congress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get to two of the - two of the picks here. You sit on the Armed Services Committee. Typically, only the ranking and chairs of the committees get to see the FBI background check on a nominee. But as you know, many senators are asking for more information on Pete Hegseth here.",
      "Do you have any information from the ranking member of the committee, from Senator Reid, that you will get access or get any information from that FBI background check?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Margaret, let me just start by saying, there is not a job that's more serious and more critical to our national security than secretary of defense. And we need a qualified individual in that job. And he just does not seem to have the qualifications.",
      "And then on top of that, you look at his personal conduct, especially when he was managing Veterans for Freedom and Concerned Veterans of America. You know, these two organizations were financially mismanaged. There was reports of being intoxicated on the job and creating an environment, you know, where there was, you know, some issues with, you know, sexual harassment.",
      "So, I think it's in the nominee, Mr. Hegseth's best interests, if he wants to be confirmed for this job, for us to have all the information. You know, the information from these organizations, but also the FBI background check. Right now, as you say, the chairman and the ranking member are going to get it. That's an agreement with the White House.",
      "But there has been exceptions made in the past for certain nominees. This clearly - because it is bipartisan. Like a - you know, across the aisle, folks want to see the FBI background check. I think we should get an opportunity to take a look at it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "\"The New York Times\" is reporting that your - that the ranking member had been briefed as of Friday. Are - you're saying no information has been shared?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Do you think it will be before Tuesday when the hearing -",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Not yet. I don't know.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: I think, you know, we will have an opportunity. You know, I'll talk to the ranking member. And I also talked to the chairman about this, about his nomination in general. More so the discussion I had with Roger Wicker was about just meeting with Mr. Hegseth.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Y Es.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: We've reached out to him multiple times, have not been able to schedule a meeting in my office, and he's not meeting with any other Democrats on the committee other than the ranking member.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Right.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: More information is better. If - if he wants to be confirmed for this job -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: I think it's in our best interest to have everything put out on the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're on the Intelligence Committee. Former Democrat Tulsi Gabbard, she is controversial as well. Republican Senator Capito was on Fox today and said, when she privately met with Tulsi Gabbard, she pressed her on that 2017 trip to Syria that came in the wake of a chemical weapons attack carried out by dictator Bashar al Assad against civilians. Gabbard told her, she said, that she didn't even know she was going to Syria, that she intended to go to Lebanon on the scheduled visit and ended up in Syria. Is that a credible answer?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: I talked to Congresswoman Gabbard this week, met with her in my office. We talked about the trip to Syria. She didn't tell me that part. I mean I think it's kind of unusual that you wind up in one place that wasn't part of the plan.",
      "But what concerns me more, especially about that trip, is, it was common knowledge that Assad was gassing the civilian population, using chemical weapons against the population multiple times. And she didn't argue about those. But she took the time and the effort to make a case that there were two cases. And she used, you know, experts that were not credible to try to - try to prove that he was not using chemical weapons in those two instances.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: And I have a hard time understanding why you would want to do that, to use your political capital to try to prove something when there are multiple cases.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. OK.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: And, you know, on top of that, when you look at, you know, what's - what, in Russia, with misinformation -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: She does seem to have a predilection for misinformation.",

      "NEWT GINGRICH (Former U.S. House Speaker): Good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In this documentary, you tell the stories of these individuals who immigrated to the U.S. And they were very successful people, like Albert Einstein.",
      "You know, when you look at Einstein and you look at Henry Kissinger, they were refugees to this country. Donald Trump set refugee admissions at very low levels first term. He's talking about block refugee admissions this term. Is that a mistake?",
      "NEWT GINGRICH: Well, I think - I think we're going through a period of, frankly, reacting to an extraordinarily disastrous immigration policy, so you're going to have some twists and turns. In the long run, we do want to have an ability to allow legitimate refugees to come here. We also, and part of the reason Callista and I made this documentary for PBS is, we really believe strongly that legal immigrants are a major contribution to America's success and to its exceptional nature. And we want to make sure that, you know, as many Americans favor legal immigration as oppose to illegal immigration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "NEWT GINGRICH: It's very important to distinguish the two. And we want to strongly communicate that legal immigration in a variety of forms, refugees is one, another is various work permits, but we want people to be able to come to America if they do so legally.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You said immigrants inhabit the very soul of what it is to be an American. When you say legitimate refugees, what do you mean?",
      "NEWT GINGRICH: Well, I think people can stand up and say, I have now decided I'm a refugee, I feel threatened. The question is, is it true or not? Are they really threatened? Or, in fact, is that just their way of getting into the United States?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Claim asylum, you mean?",
      "NEWT GINGRICH: To claim asylum.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're -",
      "NEWT GINGRICH: I think there's a big - there's a big difference between somebody who genuinely faces a potential loss of life or freedom and somebody who simply wants to come to America and decides to claim that status.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Economic migrants there.",
      "Let me ask you, someone else you feature in here, Zalmay Khalilzad, a very prominent Afghan American who brokered Trump's deal with the Taliban to exit Afghanistan. As you know with that chaotic exit, there were tens of thousands of Afghans scattered, some of them still separated from their families. Many of them worked for the U.S. government.",
      "Should Mr. Trump extend the legal process of this program and bring those Afghans here? And would you ask Congress to raise the current cap they have on the number of them coming?",
      "NEWT GINGRICH: You know, I think the Afghan refugees who actively fought on the side of Americans, saved American lives, tried to help win against the Taliban, I think they deserve an unusual level of support and treatment. And I worked all during the period of President Biden's insanely disastrous withdrawal. I tried to work with various people and did podcasts with people who were trying to get folks out of Afghanistan who should legitimately have been helped by the U.S. government.",
      "So, you know, when somebody's totally your ally, and this happened with the Vietnamese in the Vietnamese war. When somebody's totally your ally and they risk their lives side-by-side with you, you shouldn't abandon them. All right, that's a pretty straightforward rule.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one of the things the Biden administration blamed the Trump administration for was the difficulty in making those fast arrangements to bring those Afghans here. And that's a story for another day. But the person they put their finger on as making it more difficult is Steven Miller, who is now the top policy adviser to Mr. Trump. He did add new requirements to visas, other things that made it harder to legally come here. Have you spoken to him about some of your concerns?",
      "NEWT GINGRICH: No. I know Steven very well.",
      "Look, so Steven was responding to a disastrous level of immigration that's not sustainable. And I think that's - I think virtually every American agrees, you can't have an open border, you can't have Venezuelan gangs, for example, or El Salvadorans gangs. I mean there are a lot of good reasons. And you're going to get some overreaction, but it's an overreaction, frankly, caused by people like President Biden who were totally irresponsible in allowing people into this country by the millions in a way that was totally illegal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "NEWT GINGRICH: I mean it was outside the law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Pardon me, I don't know if our viewers heard that there was an alarm that went off here so it interrupted some of what you said there.",

    "story": [
      "Rep. Judy Chu, who represents areas that were devastated by the Los Angeles wildfires, said fire agencies have assured her there is \"enough water\" to continue fighting fires amid concerns over water pressure in the area.",
      "Chu, a California Democrat whose district includes the area of Altadena that was decimated by the Eaton Fire, explained on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that when the fires first started amid \"drastic winds,\" fire departments were overwhelmed.",
      "\"This is not an ordinary incident, and many fire hydrants were going on at the same time, and also the electricity used to pump the water had been turned off so that there would not spark anymore fire,\" Chu said. \"So that happened at that point, but I believe that we're in a good place right now.\"",
      "Officials said the wildfires ripping through communities in Los Angeles in recent days have killed at least 16 people, destroyed more than 12,000 structures, and displaced thousands. And the high winds are expected to pick up again this week. Meanwhile, questions are swirling around how Californians can rebuild when the wildfires cease.",
      "\"These communities have to be rebuilt,\" Chu said. \"I have the beautiful areas of Altadena and Pasadena and these were vibrant communities, diverse communities with so much historic value behind them. People love these areas, and we need to make sure that there are the resources possible for them to rebuild their homes, as well as the incredible small businesses that are here.\"",
      "Chu, who toured the devastation with FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell in recent days and said she arranged for other members of California's congressional delegation to see the damage as well, urged that \"we need to make sure that Congress is ready to provide the help that's needed to rebuild these areas like Altadena and Pasadena.\"",
      "The California Democrats said there are plans to invite House Speaker Mike Johnson, as well as President-elect Donald Trump, to visit the area to see the damage firsthand, adding that Republicans in Congress have expressed that \"they are very open to coming and seeing what is going on.\"",
      "\"These wildfires don't have any political affiliation,\" Chu said. \"They don't belong to any political party. This devastation has affected thousands upon thousands of people who just ran out of their homes with nothing in their hands and are trying to rebuild, and they need help.\"",
      "Chu urged people who have been affected by the fires to sign up on disasterassistance.gov\u00a0to kickstart the relief process, noting that they must have their insurance information available. She also said FEMA has temporary locations open in the area and will be opening a local assistance center on Tuesday.",
      "Still, Chu stressed that her community \"is not out of the danger zone,\" with winds expected to pick up early this week.",
      "\"They will be around 50 miles per hour. That is less than what caused this whole terrible catastrophe,\" Chu said. \"Nonetheless, they could spread the fire. And I urge all residents to pay attention to the evacuation warnings and orders, and most of all to make sure that they are safe.\"",

    "summary": "Aircraft battling fires raging through the Los Angeles area are dropping hundreds of thousands of gallons of hot-pink fire suppressant in a desperate effort to stop the flames.",
    "story": [
      "Aircraft battling fires raging through the Los Angeles area are dousing the area with more than water: Hundreds of thousands of gallons of hot-pink fire suppressant have been dropped ahead of the flames in a desperate effort to stop them before they destroy more neighborhoods.",
      "The deadly fires have displaced thousands of residents and destroyed more than 12,000 structures since they began last Tuesday, Jan. 7. Four major fires driven by strong Santa Ana winds have charred about 62 square miles, according to Cal Fire.",
      "Fire agencies say the suppressants \u2014 most often used to fight forest fires \u2014 are an invaluable tool. But what is in them and are they safe?",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "When are fire suppressants used?",
      "The fires are burning quickly through canyons and other rugged areas that are difficult for firefighters on the ground to reach, Cal Fire said.",
      "While fire suppressants can be very effective, they do have limitations, the agency said. Strong winds can make it too dangerous to fly at the low altitudes needed for drops and can dissipate the retardant before it hits the ground.",
      "Besides Cal Fire, multiple agencies have dropped fire retardant and water, including the U.S. Forest Service, the Los Angeles and Ventura county fire departments, the city and the National Guard.",
      "What is in aerial fire suppressants?",
      "Aerial fire suppressants are generally a mixture of water, ammonium phosphate \u2014 essentially fertilizer \u2014 and iron oxide, which is added to make the retardant visible, said Daniel McCurry, a civil and environmental engineering professor at the University of Southern California.",
      "The Forest Service, which has used 13 aircraft to dump suppressants on the Los Angeles fires, says they help starve a fire of oxygen and slow the rate of burn by cooling and coating vegetation and other surfaces.",
      "Perimeter, the company that supplies fire retardant to the Forest Service and other agencies, says the phosphate changes the way cellulose in plants decomposes and makes them non-flammable.",
      "The fire suppressants are generally considered safe for people, but many worry about their potential effects on wildlife.",
      "The Forest Service bans use of aerial suppressants over waterways and endangered species habitats, \"except when human life or public safety are threatened,\" due to potential health effects on fish and other wildlife.",
      "McCurry, from USC, said he and other researchers tested several suppressants and found heavy metals, including chromium and cadmium, in one commonly used by the U.S. Forest Service.",
      "McCurry said the study's findings suggest that it's \"plausible\" that fire suppressants could contribute to spikes of chromium and other heavy metals in waterways downstream of wildfires.",
      "\"We don't quite have a smoking gun yet because it's difficult, although not impossible, to prove where a heavy metal came from,\" McCurry said. \"We're working on that.\"",
      "Perimeter, the manufacturer of the Forest Service's fire retardant, said McCurry's research was on a formulation that wasn't used in California and is no longer used by the Forest Service. The company also says it doesn't add metals, which it says are naturally present in all ammonium phosphate fertilizers, and that its aerial suppressants \"are exhaustively tested by the USDA Forest Service and meet or exceed all health and safety standards.\"",
      "Using flame retardants to protect the power grid",
      "Several Los Angeles area power companies are also using flame retardants to try to help protect power poles and lines, CBS Los Angeles reported.",
      "Crews have been working for days, stopping at as many power poles as possible along the edges of the wildfires \u2014the Palisades Fire along the Los Angeles coast and the Eaton Fire in the mountains above Pasadena and Altadena.",
      "First, they clear dry shrubbery from the area surrounding the poles, then they use their trucks to douse each power pole with fire retardant \u2014 the same substance that's dropped by firefighting aircraft from above. They try to spray it as far up the pole as possible and into all the cracks, so embers can't get a foothold.",
      "\"That way, if or when the fire does make it this way, we don't have to worry about embers catching it,\" said Connor Norton, one of the PG&E employees working in North Hollywood on Sunday.",
      "\"The best way to save lives\"",
      "The use of fire retardants is imperative to putting out wildfires that expose millions of people to health risks, including from a toxic mix of microscopic particles that can cause breathing and heart problems by penetrating deep into the lungs and bloodstream.",
      "Studies have shown that wildfire smoke accounted for up to half of all health-damaging particle air pollution in the western U.S. in recent years as warming temperatures fueled more destructive blazes.",
      "And research released last year by the Alzheimer's Association found that wildfire smoke may be worse for brain health than other types of air pollution, raising the risk of dementia.",
      "\"The use of wildland fire retardant is the best way to save lives, protect communities and keep fires small,\" said Edward Goldberg, vice chairman of solutions at Perimeter.",
      "McCurry, the USC researcher, said more study is needed on fire suppressants \u2014 including in Los Angeles once the fires are out \u2014 but he understands their value: \"If there was a brush fire coming for my house, I'd still rather than paint a lot of (fire retardant) in front of it.\"",

      "Here's what we know about the cicadas in 2025:",
      "When will cicadas come back?",
      "For most of their lives, cicadas live underground, and then they emerge after a specific number of years once the soil reaches 64 degrees. Brood XIV emerges every 17 years.",
      "Though it's not known exactly when they will show up in 2025, they typically appear in May and last through June. During those weeks, the cicadas mature, mate and lay eggs before dying off, and then their offspring begin the cycle anew.",
      "Climate change is also affecting the timing of the insects' arrival. Last year, the cicadas' return started in Georgia nearly two weeks ahead of schedule.",
      "Where will Brood XIV cicadas emerge?",
      "Known as the \"Great(er) Eastern Brood,\" this group is historically found in areas of north Georgia, Kentucky, Tennessee, southern Indiana and Ohio, North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, and parts of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and Massachusetts.",
      "However, UConn researchers note that Brood XIV cicadas population are declining on Long Island and their distributions are shifting in southwestern Ohio and southeastern Indiana. The researchers said they will map and study the cicadas' 2025 emergence to address gaps in knowledge about the patterns.",
      "How many cicadas will there be in 2025?",
      "It's difficult to estimate the population of any insects, and cicadas are no exception.",
      "Hundreds of trillions, or even quadrillions, of cicadas were expected in 2024 when two massive broods emerged at the same time, UConn cicada expert John Cooley said.",
      "There will be fewer cicadas this spring, but more than a trillion of the insects could emerge. The number may sound extreme, but the cicadas won't all be at the same place at the same time.",

      "\"We still need to implement it in mosquitoes and conduct rigorous safety testing to ensure there are no risks to humans or other non-target species,\" he said.",
      "The mosquitoes would need to be genetically modified so they only expressed the toxic semen once they were released into the wild, the researchers said.",

      "TikTok faces a\u00a0possible ban in the U.S.\u00a0later this month if a law that could require the social media app's Chinese owner, ByteDance, to part ways with the platform takes effect as scheduled on Jan. 19.",
      "Specifically, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act would\u00a0make it illegal\u00a0for app stores from Google or Apple, as well as web-hosting services, to distribute or service TikTok. If ByteDance had started the process to sell TikTok, the president also could push pause on adoption of the law for 90 days.",
      "The Supreme Court on Jan. 11 heard arguments from government attorneys, who say TikTok poses a threat to U.S. national security, and from lawyers for the social media platform. Experts said the justices seemed receptive to the government's case, increasing the likelihood of a ban. Here's what that would mean for TikTok users in the U.S.",
      "Could I use TikTok after the ban?",
      "If the law goes into force on Jan. 19, people in the U.S. who have not already downloaded the TikTok app would no longer be able to access it. It will no longer be available for download in app stores, including Apple's and Google's.",
      "For TikTok users who already have the short-form video app on their devices, it remains to be seen what will happen to the app. In one scenario, it will go dark, and users will receive a notice indicating that it's not functional or available to them.",
      "\"They will get a notice that says, 'This service is not available in your country. That's most likely what will happen based on what we've seen in other countries that have banned certain platforms,\" Timothy Edgar, a professor of cybersecurity at Brown University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This generation may be in for a very rude awakening if the law goes into effect and they find a major social media platform that they came to rely on as creators, or just users, is suddenly not available.\"",

      "\"If you already have TikTok on your phone you can still use it, but over time you will not receive any updates, so the app will become obsolete,\" said Qi Liao, a professor of computer and network security at Central Michigan University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Various issues could arise because TikTok may introduce new features or security patches, and the app in the U.S. will have a sluggish performance as well as security issues.

    "summary": "Elon Musk claims the U.S. needs a pipeline of foreign employees working on H-1B visas because the country lacks skilled engineers. Here's what the data shows.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk sparked fierce online debate recently when the billionaire said on social media that the U.S. lacks enough top engineers, pointing to immigration as the solution to what he characterized as a dearth of technical expertise.",
      "\"There is a dire shortage of extremely talented and motivated engineers in America,\" Musk posted on his social media platform, X, comparing tech companies to a pro sports team scouting players. \"If you force the world's best talent to play for the other side, America will LOSE.\"",
      "The claims are at the center of a divide between supporters of President-elect Donald Trump, who tend to take a hard line against immigration, and technology entrepreneurs like Musk, who along with X runs exploration company SpaceX and electric vehicle maker Tesla, both of which employ many foreign workers hired with H-1B visas.",
      "Yet labor market data suggests that American tech workers aren't in short supply, and critics of the H-1B program say it displaces Americans in favor of foreign-born employees hired at lower salaries. Proponents of recruiting skilled workers from abroad say tech jobs aren't zero-sum, while hiring foreigners with specialized skills can spur innovation and ultimately create more jobs for U.S.-born workers.",
      "Data from the National Center for Education Statistics shows that the number of bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in computer science and in engineering conferred in the U.S. reached their highest levels in the 2020-21 and 2021-22 academic years since 1970-71.",
      "Meanwhile, tech and engineering jobs in the U.S. are expected to grow by 7% by 2033, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The share of the science and engineering workforce that is foreign-born has grown over the past three decades, according to the National Science Foundation, while STEM workers have experienced some of the highest employment rates of any occupation over the past five years.",
      "Companies with the most H-1B workers",
      "Tech companies are some of the biggest beneficiaries of the H-1B program, which is intended to allow highly skilled foreigners to work in the U.S. Amazon received the most H1-B visas of any company in 2024, Department of Labor data shows. Microsoft, Google and Meta were also in the top 10, while Tesla now ranks No. 16, according to the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan think tank focused on trade and immigration issues.",
      "More H-1Bs visas were granted to software developers last year than for any other position.",
      "\"The H-1B visa is like the Swiss Army knife of visas. It's used for a lot of different purposes,\" said John Skrentny, a sociology professor at U.C. San Diego who wrote a book on why STEM graduates choose careers outside of the fields they studied. \"If you hear people say that the H-1B visa is very important for attracting the best and brightest to the United States, they are correct. At the same time, the H-1B visa is used for cheap labor.\"",
      "Investigations including by 60 Minutes and The New York Times have found that some companies have laid off American workers and then replaced them with H-1B hires, sometimes even requiring displaced employees to train their replacements in order to receive their severance packages.",
      "Some of the roles H-1B workers are hired to fill also involve less complicated jobs, like product testing, said Ronil Hira, an associate political science professor at Howard University and a research associate with the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. These roles don't necessarily meet the visa program's intended goal of outsourcing roles that require unique skills.",
      "In addition to Big Tech companies, consulting firms like Cognizant, Tata and Infosys are also among the largest recipients of H-1B visas, providing tech companies with a steady pipeline of highly educated, well-trained employees willing to work on contract.",
      "These companies are incentivized to find employees that will accept lower pay, Hira said.",
      "\"Their business model is to resell labor. If you're reselling labor, the way you become competitive is by having lower labor costs.\"",
      "A boost to innovation?",
      "Still, evidence of the H-1B program's broader impact on employment in the U.S. is mixed. One\u00a0study from the IZA Institute of Labor Economics found that the average employer that receives H-1B visas isn't displacing American workers. The research firm found that while companies that received the visas initially did hire more foreign-born workers in response, they also typically experienced growing revenue and were eventually able to hire additional workers.",
      "The effects were greater for smaller employers that only applied for a few visas, the study showed.",
      "\"Most of our results are driven by smaller firms because they're the ones for whom the lottery really matters,\" said Parag Mahajan, one of the study's authors and an assistant economics professor at the University of Delaware. For those companies, he said, \"There is a lot of value to looking elsewhere for talent.\"",
      "Mahajan's study also found that for some companies, hiring a foreign worker on an H-1B visa eventually created jobs for American-born workers because the person's skills can help the company grow.",
      "But some economists, including Hira, take issue with the claim that foreign workers are needed to fill a nationwide shortage in talented engineers.",
      "When there's a shortage of workers for a particular role, wages in that sector rise, Hira said, the same way gas prices go up when oil supplies drop. But labor market data shows that wages in the tech industry have remained relatively stable.",
      "Median weekly earnings in computer and mathematics roles have grown by 0.27% from 2019 to 2023, after being adjusted for inflation, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows. In engineering and architecture roles, wages have declined by 3.53% over the same timeframe.",
      "More firing than hiring",
      "Tech companies have also laid off hundreds of employees in recent years while continuing to sponsor new H-1B visas. An analysis by the Economic Policy Institute found that the top 30 companies hiring the most H-1B workers hired 34,000 new H-1B employees in 2022 but laid off at least 85,000 workers that year and in early 2023.",
      "The layoffs mirror a decline in available jobs in the industry. Job postings in software development on Indeed.com are 67% of what they were in February 2020, according to the job board platform.",
      "How the debate around H-1Bs will translate to policy after Trump takes office is unclear. In his first term, he issued an executive order, dubbed \"Buy American and Hire American,\" aimed at supporting U.S. manufacturing. The order also directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to the H-1B program to restrict it only to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants.",
      "But in an interview with The New York Post last month, Trump called H-1B visas a \"great program.\" Musk, who has become a close adviser to the president-elect, said he would \"go to war on this issue\" in one X post.",
      "\"I've always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas,\" Trump said. \"That's why we have them.\"",

      "The Biden administration is proposing new restrictions that would limit the export of advanced computer chips used to develop artificial intelligence, part of an effort to preserve America's six- to 18-month advantage on AI over rivals such as China.",
      "Proposed Monday, the framework is raising concerns of chip industry executives who say the rules would limit access to existing chips used for video games and restrict in 120 countries the chips used for data centers and AI products. Mexico, Portugal, Israel and Switzerland are among the nations that could have limited access.",
      "Chip giant Nvidia on Monday called\u00a0the proposal \"misguided,\" and said that it \"threatens to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide.\"",
      "On a call with reporters previewing the framework, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said that it's \"critical\" to preserve America's leadership in AI and the development of AI-related computer chips. The fast-evolving AI technology enables computers to produce novels, make scientific research breakthroughs, automate driving and foster a range of other transformations that could reshape economies and warfare.",
      "\"As AI becomes more powerful, the risks to our national security become even more intense,\" Raimondo said. The framework \"is designed to safeguard the most advanced AI technology and ensure that it stays out of the hands of our foreign adversaries but also enabling the broad diffusion and sharing of the benefits with partner countries.\"",
      "White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan stressed that the framework would ensure that the most cutting-edge aspects of AI would be developed within the United States and with its closest allies, instead of possibly getting offshored such as the battery and renewable energy sectors.",
      "Government officials said they felt they needed to act quickly to preserve U.S. companies' advantage over China and other nations, an edge that could be easily eroded if competitors could stockpile chips and make further gains.",
      "AI-enhanced technology is forecast to help fuel growth and boost corporate productivity, with Wedbush analyst Dan Ives calling the tech developments a \"once in a generation 4th Industrial Revolution\" in a recent research note.",
      "Risks to AI leadership?",
      "A tech industry group, the Information Technology Industry Council, warned Raimondo in a letter last week that a hastily implemented new rule from the Democratic administration could fragment global supply chains and put U.S. companies at a disadvantage.",
      "\"While we share the U.S. government's commitment to national and economic security, the rule's potential risks to U.S. global leadership in AI cannot be emphasized enough,\" said a statement from Naomi Wilson, the group's senior vice president for Asia and global trade policy. She called for a more extensive consultation with the tech industry.",
      "One industry executive, who is familiar with the framework and insisted on anonymity to discuss it, said the proposed restrictions would limit access to chips already used for video games, despite claims made otherwise by the government. The executive said it would also limit which companies could build data centers abroad.",
      "Nvidia bashes proposal",
      "Because the framework includes a 120-day comment period, the incoming Republican administration of President-elect Donald Trump could ultimately determine the rules for the sales abroad of advanced computer chips. This sets up a scenario in which Trump will have to balance economic interests with the need to keep the United States and its allies safe.",
      "Ned Finkle, vice president of external affairs at Nvidia, said in a statement that the prior Trump administration had helped create the foundation for AI's development and that the proposed framework would hurt innovation without achieving the stated national security goals.",
      "\"While cloaked in the guise of an 'anti-China' measure, these rules would do nothing to enhance U.S. security,\" he said. \"The new rules would control technology worldwide, including technology that is already widely available in mainstream gaming PCs and consumer hardware.\"",
      "Under the framework, roughly 20 key allies and partners would face no restrictions on accessing chips, but other countries would face caps on the chips they could import, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House.",
      "Nations without restrictions",
      "The allies without restrictions include Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Republic of Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.",
      "Users outside of these close allies could purchase up to 50,000 graphics processing units per country. There would also be government-to-government deals which could bump up the cap to 100,000 if their renewable energy and technological security goals are aligned with the U.S.",
      "Institutions in certain countries could also apply for a legal status that would let them purchase up to 320,000 advanced graphics processing units over two years. Still, there would be limits as to how much AI computational capacity could be placed abroad by companies and other institutions.",
      "Also, computer chip orders equivalent to 1,700 advanced graphics processing units would not need a license to import or count against the national chip cap, among the other standards set by the framework. The exception for the 1,700 graphics processing units would likely help to meet the orders for universities and medical institutions, as opposed to data centers.",

Axios was the first to report that Meta is terminating DEI programs geared to hiring, training and choosing suppliers, citing an internal employee memo.",
      "A Meta spokesperson confirmed to CBS News that it was eliminating its DEI efforts.",
      "In explaining the policy shift, Janelle Gale, vice president of human resources at Meta, said the \"legal and policy landscape surrounding diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in the United States is changing,\"",
      "The retreat from DEI policies by Meta and others follows a 2023 Supreme Court decision banning affirmative action in college admissions, as well as pressure from conservatives political activists. Other large companies to unwind their DEI programs include motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson, hardware chain Lowe's, and farm equipment manufacturers John Deere and actor Supply.",
      "More recently, the shift away from DEI has coincided with President-elect Donald Trump's startling political comeback.",
      "\"Many global businesses will be using the second Trump presidency to finally kill off the DEI agenda, if they haven't done so already,\" Daniel Snell, co-founder of Arrival, a UK-based consulting firm focused on corporate leadership and culture, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"Those attempting to curry favor with Trump are doing it publicly, while other organizations, not wishing to suffer any potential public backlash or fallout, will do so quietly and over time.\"",
      "Under fire by \"anti-woke\" factions that have targeted companies, universities and other organizations in court and on social media, a number of corporations have backtracked on diversity efforts that intensified after the May 2020 murder of George Floyd sparked the largest racial justice protests in the U.S. since the civil rights movement.",
      "Some corporate leaders have also questioned the value of diversity and its contribution to a company's bottom line, with DEI \"seen by many leaders as distracting to business performance and growth,\" Snell said.",

      "Other companies, including Apple, Costco and Target, continue to maintain and defend their DEI policies.",
      "Costco's board is recommending that shareholders vote against\u00a0proposal to dismantle its DEI program ahead of January 23 investor meeting amid calls by activists such as Robby Starbuck urging boycotts and membership cancellations of the warehouse club.",
      "\"Among other things, a diverse group of employees helps bring orginality and creativity to our merchandise offerings, promoting the 'treasure hunt' that our customers value,\" the retailer stated.",
      "The proposal, submitted by the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank, argues that DEI poses litigation, reputational and financial risks to the company, and therefore to shareholders.",

    "summary": "Meta shocked the tech world this week by moving to overhaul its approach to fact checking. Here's what the changes mean for social media users.",
    "story": [
      "Mark Zuckerberg set the internet abuzz this week when the Meta CEO announced that the tech giant would no longer conduct independent fact-checking. The program, implemented in 2016, will be replaced with Meta's own version of Community Notes, a crowdsourced approach to reviewing online content employed by\u00a0 X, the social media platform previously known as Twitter.",
      "So what exactly is Community Notes, and how does it work?",
      "How Community Notes works",
      "Meta hasn't released specifics about how it will empower users of Facebook, Instagram and other social platforms to monitor content, said Melissa Mahtani, executive producer at CBS News Confirmed.",
      "On X, Community Notes works by leaving fact-checking up to the community. Approved contributors call out content deemed false or misleading by attaching notes providing more context. Here's an example of a community note provided by X on its site:",
      "Becoming an approved contributor on X \"doesn't take much,\" Mahtani said. Any X user with an active phone number and who's been on the platform for at least six months with no violations is qualified to volunteer to be a contributor, she said. Contributors are protected by anonymity.",
      "When a post is deemed false or misleading by an approved contributor, the person will post a note that provides users with additional context. The note appears beneath the original post.",
      "Once a note is added by an approved contributor, it is still not visible to regular users on X. Before that happens, other approved contributors must vote on whether the note is helpful. This is where \"things get tricky\" said Mahtani.",
      "Is the note helpful?",
      "Once a note is added to a post on X, other approved contributors rate it on its utility.",
      "Explained Mahtani, \"Other contributors need to take a look at the sourcing, the accuracy of that note, and vote on whether or not it's helpful. If they vote that it's helpful \u2014 this is the tricky part \u2014 the company says that an algorithm takes a look at the ideological spectrum of all those contributors who voted. If they deem that those voters are diverse, it gets published.\"",
      "The algorithm decides",
      "According to X's website, the purpose of its so-called\u00a0bridging-based algorithm\u00a0is to \"identify notes that are helpful to a broad audience across perspectives.\"",
      "In other words, if the algorithm finds that contributors who voted on a given note represent an ideologically diverse group, then the note becomes visible on the platform. But if the algorithm finds that the voting contributors are too uniform in their political views \u2014 a possible sign of bias \u2014 \"the public never sees it,\" Mahtani said.",
      "Problems with X's system of crowd-based fact-checking arise when a valid note calling out misinformation isn't rated as helpful by a diverse enough group of contributors to satisfy the algorithm, and is therefore never seen by readers. The speed at which a note is made public is also important, so that false or misleading information isn't given the opportunity to spread unchallenged.",
      "A report in October\u00a0by the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate analyzed the Community Notes feature and found that accurate notes correcting false and misleading claims about the U.S. elections were not displayed on 209 out of a sample of 283 posts deemed misleading \u2014 or 74%.",
      "More information on how X's Community Notes works can be found on X's Community Notes page.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments Friday morning on whether to overturn or delay a law that could lead to a ban on TikTok in the U.S. in the coming days.",
      "The law is set to take effect on Jan. 19, nine months after it swiftly passed Congress with bipartisan support and was signed into law by President Biden. It requires the widely popular app to cut ties with its China-based parent company, ByteDance, or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The law also gives the president the ability to grant a 90-day delay in its implementation if a sale is in progress.",
      "The case pits the First Amendment's right to free speech against what the federal government and lawmakers say are threats to national security posed by TikTok. The Supreme Court moved with extraordinary speed in considering the case, agreeing to take up the dispute just two days after lawyers for the platform sought its intervention on an emergency basis.",
      "The question before the court is whether the law targeting TikTok violates the First Amendment. Here's what to know about the case:",
      "The law at the center of the case",
      "The legal battle arose from a law passed by Congress as part of a foreign aid package in April. Called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, the measure makes it unlawful for third-party service providers like Google or Apple to \"distribute, maintain or update\" an app controlled by a foreign adversary by providing certain services, such as offering it in app stores.",
      "Under the law, any app operated by ByteDance, TikTok, or its subsidiaries is considered a \"foreign adversary controlled application.\" The designation also covers apps operated by a \"covered company\" controlled by a foreign adversary \u2014 China, Russia, North Korea or Iran.",
      "The prohibitions are set to take effect 270 days after the law was enacted, on Jan. 19. Under the law, TikTok can remain available, however, if it divests from ByteDance. The measure also allows the president to grant a single, 90-day extension if a sale is underway.",
      "What are the arguments?",
      "In a brief laying out its arguments to the Supreme Court, the U.S. government said the vast amount of information TikTok collects on its users could be wielded by the Chinese government for \"espionage or blackmail\" purposes or to \"advance its geopolitical interests\" by \"sowing discord and disinformation during a crisis.\"",
      "\"In response to those grave national-security threats, Congress did not impose any restriction on speech, much less one based on viewpoint or content. Instead, Congress restricted only foreign adversary control: TikTok may continue operating in the United States and presenting the same content from the same users in the same manner if its current owner executes a divestiture that frees the platform from the [People's Republic of China's] control,\" the Justice Department said.",
      "Lawyers for TikTok have argued that shuttering the app in the U.S. will silence not only its speech, but also that of the 170 million Americans who regularly use it. In its filing, lawyers for the platform called the potential shutdown \"unprecedented\" and said the government's justification is \"at war with the First Amendment.\"",
      "Additionally, TikTok has argued that divesture from ByteDance is not possible, and the parent company said in April that it will not sell the platform.",
      "A group of eight TikTok users also challenged the law on First Amendment grounds and have argued that outlawing the platform will deprive them of access to a \"vital communications forum,\" through which they can earn a living and spread ideas.",
      "The legislation, lawyers for the creators wrote in a filing with the court, \"violates the First Amendment because it suppresses the speech of American creators based primarily on an asserted government interest \u2014 policing the ideas Americans hear \u2014 that is anathema to our nation's history and tradition and irreconcilable with this court's precedents.\"",
      "But an appeals court disagreed with TikTok and the users' First Amendment claims. In a December ruling, a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was sympathetic to the government's argument that TikTok poses a national security risk. The appeals court later rejected TikTok's bid for a temporary pause on the ban while it sought the Supreme Court's review.",
      "Thomas Berry, an expert in constitutional law at the Cato Institute, said it would be \"unprecedented\" for the Supreme Court to uphold a law that restricts such a popular and widely used platform in the U.S., but said its reasoning if it sides with the government is significant.",
      "\"If the court relies on notions of disinformation or content manipulation as a justification, that would be extremely harmful to the First Amendment doctrine because it would essentially give a greenlight to the government targeting a speech platform for the content it carries,\" he said. Berry filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of TikTok and the users.",
      "But if the court upholds the law based on the data collection concerns, he said \"that would still be unfortunate deference shown to government arguments that haven't been backed up by a public record, but that would potentially be more of a good-for-this-case-only type of ruling.\"",
      "Additionally, Berry said the impact of a ban on users is an important perspective for the court to consider.",
      "\"It humanizes the speech happening on this platform and emphasizes, especially to justices who might not be familiar with it, that this isn't just speech being broadcast in from foreign countries,\" he said. \"This is primarily Americans speaking to other Americans, and lots of totally apolitical speech is happening and being found through the TikTok discovery algorithm.\"",
      "Jennifer Safstrom, who directs the Stanton Foundation First Amendment Clinic at Vanderbilt Law School, said TikTok may have more of an uphill battle in making its case because \"one of the strengths of the government's position is that the executive and legislative branches are given a lot of deference with respect to national security.\"",
      "\"So there's often a hesitancy for courts to second-guess the political branches on those kinds of national security questions,\" Safstrom told CBS News.",
      "Patrick Toomey, the deputy director of ACLU's National Security Project, said the government has not supported its claims against TikTok with concrete public evidence. The ACLU has urged the Supreme Court to block the ban in a friend-of-the-court brief.",
      "\"The government can't impose this type of total ban unless it's the only way to prevent extremely serious and imminent harm to national security,\" Toomey told CBS News. \"That means not just gesturing at the possibility that these types of harms could come from exploitation of TikTok, but providing evidence that either those harms are ongoing and widespread or are imminent, and we haven't seen that kind of evidence.\"",
      "Trump opposes TikTok ban",
      "The Supreme Court is hearing the case in the final days of the Biden administration. President-elect Donald Trump, who in recent months has expressed support for TikTok, takes office a day after the law is set to go into effect.",
      "A lawyer for Trump filed a friend-of-the-court brief asking the Supreme Court to pause the law's implementation, saying the incoming president opposes banning TikTok at this time and wants the ability to resolve the dispute through \"political means.\"",
      "\"President Trump takes no position on the merits of the dispute. Instead, he urges the Court to stay the statute's effective date to allow his incoming Administration to pursue a negotiated resolution that could prevent a nationwide shutdown of TikTok, thus preserving the First Amendment rights of tens of millions of Americans, while also addressing the government's national security concerns,\" Trump's attorney D. John Sauer wrote.",
      "The president-elect intends to nominate Sauer for solicitor general in his second term. If confirmed by the Senate, Sauer will argue on behalf of the federal government before the Supreme Court.",
      "Trump recently met with TikTok's chief executive at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and has praised the platform for helping him win over younger voters in the November election.",
      "The president-elect's support for the widely popular app is an about-face from his first term in office. In August 2021, he took unilateral action that would have effectively banned TikTok in the U.S. after finding that its data collection posed a risk that China would use Americans' data for malign purposes. The ban, however, never took effect after it was blocked by a federal court and the executive order rescinded by Mr. Biden.",
      "Though Trump is pushing for a delay, members of his incoming administration have firmly backed restricting TikTok, including his nominee to be secretary of state, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, and his national security adviser pick, Republican Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida.",
      "Leaders of the House China Committee and Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky also submitted friend-of-the-court briefs to the Supreme Court, both arguing that the law should be upheld.",
      "Lawmakers and intelligence agencies have long had suspicions about the app's ties to China and have argued that the concerns are warranted because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering. FBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers last year that the Chinese government could compromise Americans' devices through the software.",
      "In response to the national security concerns, Congress prohibited TikTok on federal government devices in 2022, and a majority of states have barred the app on state government devices.",
      "TikTok has argued that several issues would arise if the platform is forced to cut all ties to ByteDance. Because the Chinese government is opposed to selling the algorithm that tailors video recommendations to each user, a new buyer would have to rebuild it from scratch. The platform would also become a \"content island\" in the U.S. \u2014 if it cannot share data with ByteDance, \"American users would be unable to access global content, and American creators would be unable to reach global audiences,\" its lawyers said.",
      "How TikTok could avoid a ban",
      "Still, TikTok has several pathways to avoid a ban outside of Supreme Court intervention, experts told CBS News.",
      "Trump could take action once he's in office and ask the Justice Department not to enforce the law or prosecute tech companies, like Apple and Google, who host TikTok in their app stores. Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law after Jan. 19, though he would have to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",

    "story": [
      "Meta's fact-checking partners are rebutting Mark Zuckerberg's suggestion on Tuesday that their work is tantamount to censorship.",
      "In announcing the social media giant's decision to end fact-checking\u00a0in the U.S. on Facebook, Instagram and other Meta platforms, Zuckerberg said the move would \"dramatically reduce the amount of censorship on our platforms.\" In a Facebook post explaining the company's shift to a community-driven moderation approach, Meta Chief Global Affairs Officer Joel Kaplan also said that \"Too much harmless content gets censored, too many people find themselves wrongly locked up in 'Facebook jail'.\"",
      "As Meta abandons fact-checking, here's how to tell what's real online",
      "As Meta abandons fact-checking, here's how to tell what's real online",
      "But those running the nonpartisan entities behind Meta's third-party fact-checking efforts said they had nothing to do with whether a post was removed from a platform, noting that the company was the final arbiter of what content it published.",
      "\"Facts are not censorship. Fact-checkers never censored anything,\" Neil Brown, president of the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, a nonprofit devoted to media literacy, said in a statement. Poynter's PolitiFact is among the entities that had teamed with Meta on fact-checking.",
      "Meta's official fact-check program launched in 2016 with a number of third-party partners.vFact-checked posts were labeled and then demoted, reducing their distribution. But the posts weren't removed outright, according to Meta. What does get removed are severe content violations like posts supporting terrorism or promoting child sexual exploitation.",
      "The sheer volume of content across Facebook, Instagram and other Meta apps means that most posts were not fact-checked. Further, fact checks were not allowed on politicians' posts.",
      "Fact-checked posts were labeled and then were demoted, reducing their distribution. Fact-checked posts were not removed outright. What does get removed are severe content violations like terrorism or child sexual exploitation.",
      "\"To my knowledge they didn't take anything down just because it was false \u2014 their takedowns were only with false information that could cause harm,\" Angie Holan, director of the International Fact-Checking Network, which also works with Meta, told CBS News. \"My goal is for an internet where people can go on and find information that's accurate and reliable and this is a step back, there's no other way to put it.\"",
      "\"Fact-checking journalism has never censored or removed posts; it's added information and context to controversial claims, and it's debunked hoax content and conspiracy theories,\" Holan added in a\u00a0statement\u00a0posted on social media.",
      "\"Nothing to do with free speech\"",
      "Among Meta's fact-check partners, Poynter's PolitiFact said it offered independent reviews and disclosed its sources, while Meta set the rules about what content was removed.",

      "Lori Robertson, director of the nonpartisan website FactCheck.org, which also partnered with Meta, also refuted Zuckerberg's notion that fact-checking contributed to a suppression of opinion.",
      "\"Our work isn't about censorship. We provide accurate information to help social media users as they navigate their news feeds. We did not, and could not, remove content. Any decisions to do that were Meta's,\" she said.",
      "Another fact-checking outfit that works with Meta also questioned if shifting to a \"Community Notes\" model in which the technology giant relies on social media users to monitor posts, similar to the approach in use at Elon Musk's X platform (formerly known as Twitter), will reduce bias and improve the quality of content.",
      "\"In our experience and that of others, Community Notes on X are often slow to appear, sometimes downright inaccurate and unlikely to appear on controversial posts because of an inability to reach agreement or consensus among users,\" Maarten Schenk, co-founder and chief operating officer at Lead Stories, said in a post Tuesday on the fact-checking site. \"Ultimately, the truth doesn't care about consensus or agreement: the shape of the Earth stays the same even if social media users can't agree on it.\"",

      "Zuckerberg cited the outcome of the 2024 U.S. presidential election as underlying the decision, calling it a \"cultural tipping point towards, once again, prioritizing speech.\" Zuckerberg made the announcement in a video. \"We're going to get rid of fact-checkers and replace them with community notes similar to X, starting in the U.S.\"",
      "The changes will impact Meta platforms Facebook and Instagram \u2014 which have billions of users \u2014 as well as Threads.",
      "The systems put in place to moderate its platforms make too many mistakes, Zuckerberg stated.",
      "Meta introduced its fact-checking program in\u00a02016\u00a0as part of an effort to curb misinformation. The initiative was launched in response to criticism over Facebook's role in spreading false claims during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. A 2023\u00a0statement\u00a0from Meta said the fact-checking program had \"expanded to include nearly 100 organizations working in more than 60 languages globally.\"",

      "Meta does plan to continue to moderate content related to drugs, terrorism, child exploitation, frauds and scams, Joel Kaplan, Meta's chief global affairs officer and Clegg's successor, wrote in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on the Meta site. Facebook's trust and safety content moderation team is also moving from California to Texas and other U.S. locations, according to the note.",
      "Kaplan also said entrusting users to effectively moderate Meta's social media platforms should benefit its content.",
      "\"We've seen this approach work on X \u2014 where they empower their community to decide when posts are potentially misleading and need more context, and people across a diverse range of perspectives decide what sort of context is helpful for other users to see,\" he wrote. \"We think this could be a better way of achieving our original intention of providing people with information about what they're seeing \u2014 and one that's less prone to bias.\"",
      "Meta said it would roll out its Community Notes approach over the next two month and continue refining it over the rest of the year. That will include no longer demoting content that users have fact-checked and including what Kaplan called \"a much less obtrusive label\" pointing people to additional information.",
      "Preparing for Trump",
      "The announcement came a day after Meta\u00a0said\u00a0former Ultimate Fighting Championship chief executive Dana White, a close ally of President-elect Donald Trump, would join its board, and shortly after former UK deputy prime minister Nick Clegg\u00a0announced\u00a0he was stepping down as president of global affairs.",
      "Musk, a major supporter and financial backer of Trump during his presidential campaign, is thought to have the ear of the president-elect on issues ranging from how to slash federal spending to transportation policy.",
      "Since Trump's November victory at the polls over Kamala Harris, Meta and other major technology companies have also sought to engender goodwill with the incoming administration. In December, for example, Meta donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund, while Zuckerberg dined with him at his Mar-a-Lago estate.",
      "Such gestures seemed aimed at repairing Meta's relations with Trump, which soured after Facebook banned him from Facebook following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol in 2021, when the company ruled that his posts on the platform had helped foster the violence that day.",
      "\"Meta is repositioning the company for the incoming Trump administration,\" Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst at research firm Emarketer, said in an an email. \"The move will elate conservatives, who've often criticized Meta for censoring speech, but it will spook many liberals and advertisers, showing just how far Zuckerberg is willing to go to win Trump's approval.\"",

    "summary": "The fast-moving legal battle over the release of the special counsel's final report played out days before Trump's second-term inauguration.",
    "story": [
      "Attorney General Merrick Garland has submitted to Congress a portion of former special counsel Jack Smith's final report on his investigations into President-elect Donald Trump after a court order blocking its release expired at midnight Tuesday, according to a source familiar with the matter.",
      "In his report, Smith wrote that his office began its prosecution of Trump because it had enough evidence against him, saying that \"[b]ut for Mr. Trump's election and imminent return to the Presidency, the Office assessed that the admissible evidence was sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction at trial.\"",
      "The report was sent to Congress and made public shortly afterward, following days of legal wrangling over whether it should partially or fully be disclosed to the public. U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon on Monday declined a request from Walt Nauta, an aide to Trump, and Carlos de Oliveira, former property manager at Mar-a-Lago, to block volume one of Smith's final report from becoming public.",
      "That portion pertains to Trump's alleged efforts to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election. Volume two delves into allegations that Trump unlawfully held onto classified documents after the end of his first term in 2021 and obstructed the Justice Department's investigation.",
      "In a letter to Garland accompanying the report, Smith defended his decision to pursue charges against the president-elect and rejected Trump's accusations that his actions were influenced by the top ranks of the Justice Department.",
      "\"To all who know me well, the claim from Mr. Trump that my decisions as a prosecutor were influenced or directed by the Biden administration or other political actors is, in a word, laughable,\" Smith wrote, adding later in the report his office had \"no interest in affecting the presidential election.\"",
      "Following the release of the section of the report on the 2020 election probe, he president-elect attacked the former special counsel on social media, calling him a \"a lamebrain prosecutor who was unable to get his case tried before the Election, which I won in a landslide.\"",
      "\"To show you how desperate Deranged Jack Smith is, he released his Fake findings at 1:00 A.M. in the morning,\" Trump said early Tuesday.",
      "Smith used the first volume of his report to defend his work and investigative findings, alleging, \"The throughline of all of Mr. Trump's criminal efforts was deceit \u2014 knowingly false claims of election.\"",
      "Much of the 137-page volume recounts information that has already been made public through court filings during the course of the now-dismissed case against Trump filed in Washington, D.C. It also includes images of the violence that transpired at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of Trump's supporters breached the building in an effort to stop Congress from reaffirming President Biden's win.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that the rioters who descended on the Capitol \"had been motivated and directed by Trump,\" a claim Trump has denied. The former special counsel wrote that his office was \"prepared\" to prove \"Trump willfully caused his supporters to obstruct and attempt to obstruct the proceeding by summoning them to Washington, D.C.\"",
      "Still, Smith wrote that his office \"did not develop direct evidence \u2014 such as an explicit admission or communication with co-conspirators \u2014 of Mr. Trump's subjective intent to cause the full scope of the violence that occurred on January 6.\"",
      "Now, four years since the Jan. 6 attack, more than 1,500 people have been charged as a result of their conduct at the Capitol. The former special counsel wrote that \"with that in mind, Mr. Trump's relative culpability weighed heavily in favor of charging him, as the individual most responsible for what occurred at the Capitol on January 6.\"",
      "Smith revealed that through voluntary interviews of more than 250 individuals and the grand-jury testimony of 55 people, his office was able to gather evidence that pointed to Trump's alleged crime, including allegations that he sought to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence into delaying the vote certification on Jan. 6, 2021, and he supported the organization of a false slate of electors.",
      "Pence sat for a grand-jury interview with prosecutors during the investigation, CBS News reported at the time.",
      "The former special counsel also detailed ways in which he alleged Trump sought to pressure the Justice Department at the time to investigate the false claims of fraud. At one point, according to the report, Trump allegedly told his acting attorney general to \"just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.\"",
      "A federal grand jury returned an indictment charging Trump with four counts in the summer of 2023. He pleaded not guilty to all of the counts. But Smith wrote that his office considered \u2014 and ultimately decided against \u2014 bringing other charges. One potential charge was under the Insurrection Act, a Civil War-era law that bars those who incite an insurrection against the U.S. from holding federal office.",
      "But Smith said that while courts have described the Jan. 6 attack as an \"insurrection,\" his office was \"aware of the litigation risk that would be presented by employing this long-dormant statute.\"",
      "Trump was charged with allegedly participating in crimes with at least six unnamed co-conspirators, and Smith wrote that his office determined some shared criminal culpability with the president-elect. Smith said that after Trump was indicted in August 2023, his office continued to look into whether any of the other alleged participants should face charges. He said that he referred to a U.S. attorney's office for further investigation evidence that one individual may have committed unrelated crimes.",
      "Smith's office made a \"preliminary determination\" that admissible evidence could justify pursuing charges against some of Trump's co-conspirators and had started to look into how to proceed. But because his team did not reach a conclusion or seek any further indictments, Smith wrote that the report \"should not be read to allege that any particular person other than Mr. Trump committed a crime, nor should it be read to exonerate any particular person.\"",
      "Ahead of the report's release, Trump's defense attorneys asked Garland to remove Smith from his post and either decline to release the special counsel's report or hand the matter over to Trump's incoming administration, according to a letter released last week.",
      "The letter, addressed to Garland and a top career official at the Justice Department, alleged the special counsel did not have the legal authority to submit a final report summarizing his investigations into Trump and urged the attorney general to \"put an end to this weaponization of the justice system and move forward constructively.\"",
      "The correspondence was written in part by defense attorneys Todd Blanche and Emile Bove, Trump's picks to serve as deputy attorney general and principal deputy attorney general in his new administration.",
      "Trump has slammed Smith's investigation as politically motivated and denied all wrongdoing in the case.",
      "The legal battle over Smith's report on Trump",
      "The Justice Department's publication of the first volume of Smith's report marked the culmination of a fast-moving legal battle that transpired over the past week and played out days before Trump is to be sworn in for a second term. If the battle had continued until the president-elect's return to the White House on Jan. 20, it's not likely the special counsel's report would have been publicly released.",
      "Cannon, who was assigned to oversee the documents case, issued a temporary order last week that temporarily blocked the Justice Department from making the report public, after which a federal appeals court declined to stop its release. The district judge's order expired at 12 a.m. Tuesday.",
      "Garland has said he wouldn't publicly release the second part of the report because proceedings involving Nauta and de Oliveira are ongoing.",
      "Smith resigned his position as special counsel last Friday, and Justice Department prosecutors have taken over the ongoing matters arising from his investigations. Smith's two probes led to separate prosecutions of Trump, but they came to a close because of his victory in the November presidential election.",
      "As is required for special counsels, Smith drafted and submitted a final report to the attorney general last week. Garland has vowed to make public all special counsel reports completed while he is attorney general, and has so far followed through on that pledge, including after the investigation into Mr. Biden's handling of classified documents. He released the special counsel's final report on the investigation into Hunter Biden's tax evasion and gun possession cases Monday night.",
      "Last week, Garland informed Congress that Smith had finished his investigation and submitted the two-volume report. It's unclear whether the second volume, related to the classified documents case, will ever be disclosed to the American people.",
      "Smith's tenure as special counsel began in November 2022, when Garland tapped him to take over the ongoing investigations involving Trump. The president-elect repeatedly vowed to fire the special counsel when he returned to the White House.",
      "Federal grand juries returned two indictments against the president-elect, marking the first time a former president was accused of federal crimes. In the 2020 election case, brought in Washington, D.C., Trump faced four charges, including conspiracy to defraud the U.S. and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding. In the documents case, the president-elect was charged with 40 counts, including willfully retaining national defense information and conspiracy to obstruct justice.",
      "Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges and accused Smith of mounting a politically charged investigation against him because he was Mr. Biden's political rival.",
      "The 2020 election case landed before the Supreme Court with Trump's claim he was entitled to presidential immunity that shielded him from prosecution, since the conduct that gave rise to the charges occurred during his first term in office.",
      "In July, the high court issued a landmark ruling finding that former presidents cannot face charges for official acts, but were not immune from prosecution for unofficial actions. The decision led to further proceedings before the federal district court overseeing the case.",
      "But the charges were dismissed in November following Trump's election to a second term, as longstanding Justice Department policy forbids the prosecution of a sitting president.",

    "summary": "A law that could ban TikTok in the U.S. is set to take effect on Jan. 19. Here's what that would mean for users of the social media platform.",
    "story": [
      "TikTok faces a\u00a0possible ban in the U.S.\u00a0later this month if a law that could require the social media app's Chinese owner, ByteDance, to part ways with the platform takes effect as scheduled on Jan. 19.",
      "Specifically, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act would\u00a0make it illegal\u00a0for app stores from Google or Apple, as well as web-hosting services, to distribute or service TikTok. If ByteDance had started the process to sell TikTok, the president also could push pause on adoption of the law for 90 days.",
      "The Supreme Court on Jan. 11 heard arguments from government attorneys, who say TikTok poses a threat to U.S. national security, and from lawyers for the social media platform. Experts said the justices seemed receptive to the government's case, increasing the likelihood of a ban. Here's what that would mean for TikTok users in the U.S.",
      "Could I use TikTok after the ban?",
      "If the law goes into force on Jan. 19, people in the U.S. who have not already downloaded the TikTok app would no longer be able to access it. It will no longer be available for download in app stores, including Apple's and Google's.",
      "For TikTok users who already have the short-form video app on their devices, it remains to be seen what will happen to the app. In one scenario, it will go dark, and users will receive a notice indicating that it's not functional or available to them.",
      "\"They will get a notice that says, 'This service is not available in your country. That's most likely what will happen based on what we've seen in other countries that have banned certain platforms,\" Timothy Edgar, a professor of cybersecurity at Brown University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This generation may be in for a very rude awakening if the law goes into effect and they find a major social media platform that they came to rely on as creators, or just users, is suddenly not available.\"",
      "While such an action would be unprecedented in the U.S., that's been the experience of users of banned apps in other countries, added Edgar, who thinks this is most likely outcome in the U.S.",
      "Other cybersecurity experts say TikTok might not become inaccessible overnight, but rather that the user experience in the U.S. will degrade over time.",
      "\"If you already have TikTok on your phone you can still use it, but over time you will not receive any updates, so the app will become obsolete,\" said Qi Liao, a professor of computer and network security at Central Michigan University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Various issues could arise because TikTok may introduce new features or security patches, and the app in the U.S. will have a sluggish performance as well as security issues. So eventually TikTok users will probably stop using the vulnerable version.\"",
      "Could I access TikTok through a VPN?",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Monday cleared the way for the Justice Department to release one of the two volumes that make up special counsel Jack Smith's final report detailing his investigations into President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon declined a request from Walt Nauta, an aide to Trump, and Carlos de Oliveira, former property manager at Mar-a-Lago, to block the release of Smith's final report, writing \"the court sees an insufficient basis to grant emergency injunctive relief as to Volume I.\"",
      "A federal appeals court separately declined to stop the report's release after Cannon last week issued a temporary order precluding the Justice Department from making it public. Her order remains intact until 12 a.m. on Tuesday.",
      "Federal prosecutors have said in court filings that the first volume of Smith's report pertains to the investigation into Trump's alleged efforts to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election. The second involves allegations the president-elect held onto classified documents after the end of his first term in 2021.",
      "Attorney General Merrick Garland has said he will not publicly release the second part of the report, on the documents case, because proceedings involving Nauta and de Oliveira are ongoing. John Irving, an attorney for de Oliveira, declined to comment on Cannon's ruling.",
      "In her five-page decision, Cannon wrote that her \"authority to enforce\" rulings is \"confined\" to the classified documents case. The case involving the 2020 election was brought in Washington, D.C., and was overseen by a different judge.",
      "Still, Cannon said there are outstanding legal issues over the Justice Department's proposed plan to give certain members of Congress access to the second volume of the report. The defense teams have argued against that limited release, writing that doing so could risk leaks.",
      "She set a hearing for Friday in her courtroom in Fort Pierce, Florida, to go over that proposal.",
      "Cannon wrote that the release of the report's second volume, even on a limited basis, \"risks irreversibly and substantially impairing the legal rights of defendants in this criminal proceeding. The court is not willing to make that gamble on the basis of generalized interest by members of Congress, at least not without full briefing and a hearing on the subject.\"",
      "She said the government has not \"presented any justification to support the suggestion\" that the second volume must be released to Congress now instead of \"after a reasonable period for an expedited hearing and judicial deliberation on the subject.\"",
      "Jack Smith's report",
      "Cannon's decision is the latest in a fast-moving legal battle over Smith's report that is playing out just days before Trump will be sworn in for a second term. Once the president-elect returns to the White House on Jan. 20, it's highly unlikely the special counsel's report would be publicly released.",
      "Smith resigned his position as special counsel last Friday, and Justice Department prosecutors are now overseeing all ongoing matters arising from his investigations. Smith's two investigations and prosecutions of Trump have since been dropped because of his victory in the November presidential election.",
      "As is required for special counsels, the special counsel drafted and submitted a final report to the attorney general last week. Garland has vowed to make public all special counsel reports completed while he is attorney general, and has so far followed through on that pledge, including after the investigation into President Biden's handling of classified documents.",
      "But Nauta and de Oliveira are fighting to keep the report shielded from the public. The two were charged for allegedly obstructing the investigation into Trump's handling of classified documents. While Cannon dismissed the case against them on the grounds the special counsel was unconstitutionally appointed, federal prosecutors are appealing her decision as it relates to Nauta and de Oliveira.",
      "Defense lawyers argued that disclosing the report to the public would unfairly prejudice potential future criminal proceedings against them. Defense attorneys simultaneously asked the 11th Circuit and Cannon last week to block the Justice Department from releasing the report.",
      "Cannon\u00a0temporarily stopped the report's release until the 11th Circuit resolved the issue. The appeals court then denied Nauta and de Oliveira's request to keep Smith's report under wraps, but Cannon's order remained in place. Just hours before the district court judge's temporary restraining order was set to expire, Trump unsuccessfully asked her to extend it to allow consideration of an earlier request to intervene.",
      "\"This sensible course will ensure full ventilation of these important issues, which are not changed by the government's representations of what is in Volume I,\" Trump's lawyers wrote in their request, which Cannon denied. \"These issues are weighty, serious, and ultimately establish that President Trump is entitled to full relief.\"",
      "The president-elect is no longer a party to the proceedings since he was dropped from the case in late November, and he accused the Justice Department of attempting to \"interfere with an incoming presidential administration in this manner, let alone on the very eve of inauguration.\"",
      "Federal prosecutors told the 11th Circuit that Garland would not release the portion of Smith's report that deals with the documents case while proceedings involving the two co-defendants are ongoing, but did plan to disclose the first volume involving the 2020 election case. They said he would make a redacted version of the second volume available for review only by top lawmakers on the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, and only if they agreed not to share information from it.",
      "\"This limited disclosure will further the public interest in keeping congressional leadership apprised of a significant matter within the department while safeguarding defendants' interests,\" prosecutors wrote.",
      "The Justice Department further told the district court in a filing Sunday that \"without referencing defendants Nauta or De Oliveira, any conduct by them, any evidence against them, or the charges against them, Volume One does makes two references to the Classified Documents Case.\"",
      "Last week, Garland\u00a0informed lawmakers that Smith had finished his investigation and submitted the two-volume report. The attorney general reiterated his intent to make public the first volume \"in furtherance of the public interest in informing a co-equal branch and the public regarding this significant matter,\" but would not release the second volume \"to avoid any risk of prejudice\" to Nauta and de Oliveira.",

    "story": [
      "The Santa Ynez Reservoir, a 117-gallon water resource near the Pacific Palisades, was under renovation and empty when fires tore through the Los Angeles neighborhood last week and firefighters quickly depleted available water resources, city officials said.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Friday he was launching an independent state investigation into the loss of water pressure and unavailability of water from the reservoir. He directed Los Angeles' Department of Water and Power (DWP) to prepare a \"comprehensive review\" of their efforts to ensure available water supply in case of emergencies.",
      "The Palisades Fire erupted on Tuesday, Jan. 7, and by 3 a.m., the three 1-million-gallon water tanks in Pacific Palisades ran dry due to \"extreme demand,\" officials said. Winds gusting over 100 miles per hour prevented air support from helping to douse the flames with other water sources.",
      "\"We had a tremendous demand on our system in the Palisades. We pushed the system to the extreme,\" said Janisse Qui\u00f1ones, the DWP's chief executive and chief engineer, in a press conference Wednesday. \"Four times the normal demand was seen for 15 hours straight, which lowered our water pressure.\"",
      "Here's what we know about the reservoir and its role in the Palisades water supply system.",
      "Why was the Santa Ynez Reservoir empty when the fires broke out?",
      "The reservoir was taken out of service to \"meet safe drinking water regulations,\" the DWP said in a statement. A tear in the reservoir's cover made the water supply subject to contamination, the Los Angeles Times reported, leading the agency to drain it in February.",
      "\"The water system serving the Pacific Palisades area and all of Los Angeles meets all federal and state fire codes for urban development and housing,\" the release said.",
      "DWP representatives did not respond to further questions about the reservoir from CBS News. The agency's statement suggested that the fact the reservoir was empty for nearly a year was in part due to the process of contracting a company to carry out the repairs.",
      "\"To commission the support and resources to implement repairs to Santa Ynez, LADWP is subject to the city charter's competitive bidding process which requires time,\" the statement read.",
      "Some social media users falsely claimed the reservoir sat empty for over a decade, pointing to satellite images as supposed evidence. A floating cover was installed on the reservoir in 2011, changing the appearance of the reservoir in satellite imagery, but the reservoir was returned to service in 2011, according to DWP's website.",
      "Could the reservoir have helped combat the fires?",
      "The reservoir is intended to provide water storage \"for domestic use and fire fighting purposes in the Pacific Palisades area\" according to city documents.",
      "DWP says that the agency is conducting its own investigation on its \"water resiliency.\" But experts and officials agree that the extent of the wildfires would have put a strain on the city's water supply regardless of whether the Santa Ynez Reservoir had been full.",
      "In his letter to DWP, Newsom wrote, \"While water supplies from local fire hydrants are not designed to extinguish wildfires over large areas, losing supplies from fire hydrants likely impaired the effort to protect some homes and evacuation corridors.\"",

      "Aircraft battling fires raging through the Los Angeles area are dousing the area with more than water: Hundreds of thousands of gallons of hot-pink fire suppressant have been dropped ahead of the flames in a desperate effort to stop them before they destroy more neighborhoods.",
      "The deadly fires have displaced thousands of residents and destroyed more than 12,000 structures since they began last Tuesday, Jan. 7. Four major fires driven by strong Santa Ana winds have charred about 62 square miles, according to Cal Fire.",
      "Fire agencies say the suppressants \u2014 most often used to fight forest fires \u2014 are an invaluable tool. But what is in them and are they safe?",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "When are fire suppressants used?",
      "The fires are burning quickly through canyons and other rugged areas that are difficult for firefighters on the ground to reach, Cal Fire said.",
      "While fire suppressants can be very effective, they do have limitations, the agency said. Strong winds can make it too dangerous to fly at the low altitudes needed for drops and can dissipate the retardant before it hits the ground.",
      "Besides Cal Fire, multiple agencies have dropped fire retardant and water, including the U.S. Forest Service, the Los Angeles and Ventura county fire departments, the city and the National Guard.",
      "What is in aerial fire suppressants?",
      "Aerial fire suppressants are generally a mixture of water, ammonium phosphate \u2014 essentially fertilizer \u2014 and iron oxide, which is added to make the retardant visible, said Daniel McCurry, a civil and environmental engineering professor at the University of Southern California.",
      "The Forest Service, which has used 13 aircraft to dump suppressants on the Los Angeles fires, says they help starve a fire of oxygen and slow the rate of burn by cooling and coating vegetation and other surfaces.",
      "Perimeter, the company that supplies fire retardant to the Forest Service and other agencies, says the phosphate changes the way cellulose in plants decomposes and makes them non-flammable.",
      "The fire suppressants are generally considered safe for people, but many worry about their potential effects on wildlife.",
      "The Forest Service bans use of aerial suppressants over waterways and endangered species habitats, \"except when human life or public safety are threatened,\" due to potential health effects on fish and other wildlife.",
      "McCurry, from USC, said he and other researchers tested several suppressants and found heavy metals, including chromium and cadmium, in one commonly used by the U.S. Forest Service.",
      "McCurry said the study's findings suggest that it's \"plausible\" that fire suppressants could contribute to spikes of chromium and other heavy metals in waterways downstream of wildfires.",
      "\"We don't quite have a smoking gun yet because it's difficult, although not impossible, to prove where a heavy metal came from,\" McCurry said. \"We're working on that.\"",
      "Perimeter, the manufacturer of the Forest Service's fire retardant, said McCurry's research was on a formulation that wasn't used in California and is no longer used by the Forest Service. The company also says it doesn't add metals, which it says are naturally present in all ammonium phosphate fertilizers, and that its aerial suppressants \"are exhaustively tested by the USDA Forest Service and meet or exceed all health and safety standards.\"",
      "Using flame retardants to protect the power grid",
      "Several Los Angeles area power companies are also using flame retardants to try to help protect power poles and lines, CBS Los Angeles reported.",
      "Crews have been working for days, stopping at as many power poles as possible along the edges of the wildfires \u2014the Palisades Fire along the Los Angeles coast and the Eaton Fire in the mountains above Pasadena and Altadena.",
      "First, they clear dry shrubbery from the area surrounding the poles, then they use their trucks to douse each power pole with fire retardant \u2014 the same substance that's dropped by firefighting aircraft from above. They try to spray it as far up the pole as possible and into all the cracks, so embers can't get a foothold.",
      "\"That way, if or when the fire does make it this way, we don't have to worry about embers catching it,\" said Connor Norton, one of the PG&E employees working in North Hollywood on Sunday.",
      "\"The best way to save lives\"",
      "The use of fire retardants is imperative to putting out wildfires that expose millions of people to health risks, including from a toxic mix of microscopic particles that can cause breathing and heart problems by penetrating deep into the lungs and bloodstream.",
      "Studies have shown that wildfire smoke accounted for up to half of all health-damaging particle air pollution in the western U.S. in recent years as warming temperatures fueled more destructive blazes.",
      "And research released last year by the Alzheimer's Association found that wildfire smoke may be worse for brain health than other types of air pollution, raising the risk of dementia.",
      "\"The use of wildland fire retardant is the best way to save lives, protect communities and keep fires small,\" said Edward Goldberg, vice chairman of solutions at Perimeter.",
      "McCurry, the USC researcher, said more study is needed on fire suppressants \u2014 including in Los Angeles once the fires are out \u2014 but he understands their value: \"If there was a brush fire coming for my house, I'd still rather than paint a lot of (fire retardant) in front of it.\"",

      "\"Not only were both cases proven beyond a reasonable doubt, but they resulted in a verdict lawfully rendered by a jury and an admission of guilt. In making my decisions, I remained impervious to political influence at all times,\" Weiss wrote.",
      "During the special counsel's probe, IRS agents who worked on the Hunter Biden tax case with Weiss' team came forward in an interview with CBS News to raise questions about what they alleged was special treatment in the probe of the president's son. The said that dating back to the Trump administration, they had repeatedly been prevented from taking steps in the IRS investigation that would have been considered routine in other cases.",
      "\"We have to make sure as a special agent for IRS Criminal Investigation that we treat every single person exactly the same,\" Gary Shapley, a 14-year veteran of the agency, told CBS News at the time. \"And that just simply didn't happen here.\"",
      "The Justice Department and Weiss denied that Hunter Biden received favorable treatment.",
      "In a letter to Garland included in the report, Hunter Biden's legal team pointed out its criticism of the probe and told the attorney general, \"you likely are aware of the arguments we have made about the initiation and conduct of the prosecutions against our client.\"",
      "\"These are not 'inconsequential' or 'technical' tax code violations,\" Weiss wrote. \"The prosecution of Mr. Biden was warranted given the nature and seriousness of his tax crimes.\"",
      "Answering criticism of the gun charges, Weiss argued, \"An analysis of Justice Department data from 2008 to 2017 shows that these charges are brought more frequently than over 90 percent of the other available firearm offenses.\"",
      "According to Garland's letter to Congress, Weiss submitted the report a few days ago, on Friday. The attorney general noted there had been no instances during the probe when Garland had to intervene because of policy violations.",

      "Here's what we know about the cicadas in 2025:",
      "When will cicadas come back?",
      "For most of their lives, cicadas live underground, and then they emerge after a specific number of years once the soil reaches 64 degrees. Brood XIV emerges every 17 years.",
      "Though it's not known exactly when they will show up in 2025, they typically appear in May and last through June. During those weeks, the cicadas mature, mate and lay eggs before dying off, and then their offspring begin the cycle anew.",

    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 17:00:24 -0500",
    "summary": "Elon Musk claims the U.S. needs a pipeline of foreign employees working on H-1B visas because the country lacks skilled engineers. Here's what the data shows.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk sparked fierce online debate recently when the billionaire said on social media that the U.S. lacks enough top engineers, pointing to immigration as the solution to what he characterized as a dearth of technical expertise.",
      "\"There is a dire shortage of extremely talented and motivated engineers in America,\" Musk posted on his social media platform, X, comparing tech companies to a pro sports team scouting players. \"If you force the world's best talent to play for the other side, America will LOSE.\"",
      "The claims are at the center of a divide between supporters of President-elect Donald Trump, who tend to take a hard line against immigration, and technology entrepreneurs like Musk, who along with X runs exploration company SpaceX and electric vehicle maker Tesla, both of which employ many foreign workers hired with H-1B visas.",
      "Yet labor market data suggests that American tech workers aren't in short supply, and critics of the H-1B program say it displaces Americans in favor of foreign-born employees hired at lower salaries. Proponents of recruiting skilled workers from abroad say tech jobs aren't zero-sum, while hiring foreigners with specialized skills can spur innovation and ultimately create more jobs for U.S.-born workers.",
      "Data from the National Center for Education Statistics shows that the number of bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in computer science and in engineering conferred in the U.S. reached their highest levels in the 2020-21 and 2021-22 academic years since 1970-71.",
      "Meanwhile, tech and engineering jobs in the U.S. are expected to grow by 7% by 2033, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The share of the science and engineering workforce that is foreign-born has grown over the past three decades, according to the National Science Foundation, while STEM workers have experienced some of the highest employment rates of any occupation over the past five years.",
      "Companies with the most H-1B workers",
      "Tech companies are some of the biggest beneficiaries of the H-1B program, which is intended to allow highly skilled foreigners to work in the U.S. Amazon received the most H1-B visas of any company in 2024, Department of Labor data shows. Microsoft, Google and Meta were also in the top 10, while Tesla now ranks No. 16, according to the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan think tank focused on trade and immigration issues.",
      "More H-1Bs visas were granted to software developers last year than for any other position.",
      "\"The H-1B visa is like the Swiss Army knife of visas. It's used for a lot of different purposes,\" said John Skrentny, a sociology professor at U.C. San Diego who wrote a book on why STEM graduates choose careers outside of the fields they studied. \"If you hear people say that the H-1B visa is very important for attracting the best and brightest to the United States, they are correct. At the same time, the H-1B visa is used for cheap labor.\"",
      "Investigations including by 60 Minutes and The New York Times have found that some companies have laid off American workers and then replaced them with H-1B hires, sometimes even requiring displaced employees to train their replacements in order to receive their severance packages.",
      "Some of the roles H-1B workers are hired to fill also involve less complicated jobs, like product testing, said Ronil Hira, an associate political science professor at Howard University and a research associate with the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. These roles don't necessarily meet the visa program's intended goal of outsourcing roles that require unique skills.",
      "In addition to Big Tech companies, consulting firms like Cognizant, Tata and Infosys are also among the largest recipients of H-1B visas, providing tech companies with a steady pipeline of highly educated, well-trained employees willing to work on contract.",
      "These companies are incentivized to find employees that will accept lower pay, Hira said.",
      "\"Their business model is to resell labor. If you're reselling labor, the way you become competitive is by having lower labor costs.\"",
      "A boost to innovation?",
      "Still, evidence of the H-1B program's broader impact on employment in the U.S. is mixed. One\u00a0study from the IZA Institute of Labor Economics found that the average employer that receives H-1B visas isn't displacing American workers. The research firm found that while companies that received the visas initially did hire more foreign-born workers in response, they also typically experienced growing revenue and were eventually able to hire additional workers.",
      "The effects were greater for smaller employers that only applied for a few visas, the study showed.",
      "\"Most of our results are driven by smaller firms because they're the ones for whom the lottery really matters,\" said Parag Mahajan, one of the study's authors and an assistant economics professor at the University of Delaware. For those companies, he said, \"There is a lot of value to looking elsewhere for talent.\"",
      "Mahajan's study also found that for some companies, hiring a foreign worker on an H-1B visa eventually created jobs for American-born workers because the person's skills can help the company grow.",
      "But some economists, including Hira, take issue with the claim that foreign workers are needed to fill a nationwide shortage in talented engineers.",
      "When there's a shortage of workers for a particular role, wages in that sector rise, Hira said, the same way gas prices go up when oil supplies drop. But labor market data shows that wages in the tech industry have remained relatively stable.",
      "Median weekly earnings in computer and mathematics roles have grown by 0.27% from 2019 to 2023, after being adjusted for inflation, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows. In engineering and architecture roles, wages have declined by 3.53% over the same timeframe.",
      "More firing than hiring",
      "Tech companies have also laid off hundreds of employees in recent years while continuing to sponsor new H-1B visas. An analysis by the Economic Policy Institute found that the top 30 companies hiring the most H-1B workers hired 34,000 new H-1B employees in 2022 but laid off at least 85,000 workers that year and in early 2023.",
      "The layoffs mirror a decline in available jobs in the industry. Job postings in software development on Indeed.com are 67% of what they were in February 2020, according to the job board platform.",
      "How the debate around H-1Bs will translate to policy after Trump takes office is unclear. In his first term, he issued an executive order, dubbed \"Buy American and Hire American,\" aimed at supporting U.S. manufacturing. The order also directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to the H-1B program to restrict it only to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants.",
      "But in an interview with The New York Post last month, Trump called H-1B visas a \"great program.\" Musk, who has become a close adviser to the president-elect, said he would \"go to war on this issue\" in one X post.",
      "\"I've always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas,\" Trump said. \"That's why we have them.\"",

      "Taxpayers will pick up the tab for the lost birds. To incentivize farmers to quickly report and stomp out the virus, a USDA program pays producers for the eggs and poultry they cull.",
      "Last year, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said it had spent $1.25 billion on payments to farmers since the outbreak started in 2022.",
      "Why are bird flu cases high right now in poultry?",
      "U.S. officials brace every winter for upticks in bird flu because migrating wild birds that spread the virus fly south during the colder months.",
      "It's also easier for the virus to spread in the winter. Heat and sunlight degrade the virus on surfaces, the USDA says.",
      "This winter has been different because a strain of the bird flu virus has spilled over into dairy herds too, leading to hundreds of infected herds.",
      "Authorities suspect the virus has been hitching a ride in droplets of contaminated raw milk. Those are ferried between farms by workers' clothing, equipment and animals shared between farms.",
      "California has been hit especially hard in recent months, forcing the state to declare a state of emergency to try to respond to the bird flu outbreak.",
      "This winter's surge of bird flu is from a different virus than the uptick of seasonal flu infections that also drives humans to emergency rooms every winter.",
      "While bird flu led to millions of dead poultry over the past year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has tallied only 66 confirmed human cases in the U.S. from bird flu viruses.",
      "Most American cases of bird flu have been mild. A majority were farm workers who were infected after close contact with animals infected by a bird flu strain that spilled over into dairy cows in late 2023.",
      "Researchers think\u00a0this bird flu strain mutated to be milder to humans than other variants spreading in the wild. Those other strains usually cause more severe disease when they jump into humans.",
      "Can animals be vaccinated for bird flu?",
      "The USDA announced this week it is drawing up a new stockpile of poultry vaccines. That vaccine will target the D1.1 strain of the virus, which has been spreading in wild birds and was recently to blame for a fatal human case in Louisiana.",
      "But officials said it's unlikely the vaccine will be used. The Biden administration has been weighing the possibility of vaccinating poultry for bird flu for years.",
      "That is different from plans to potentially vaccinate cows for bird flu, which the USDA says appears \"more feasible and more likely to be successful\" in battling the virus. Seven potential vaccines are now being tested in field safety trials, the department said.",
      "One major hurdle has been the fear that vaccines will only hide the symptoms of the otherwise highly lethal disease in birds. That could result in export restrictions from countries afraid the virus could spread to them through poultry products.",
      "In 2023, the USDA banned imports of some products from Europe after authorities announced they would start vaccinating some poultry for bird flu.",
      "Spread of the virus through contaminated meat in the U.S. has already happened during this year's outbreak at least twice: raw pet food made from sick animals was linked to an outbreak that killed cats in California and Oregon.",
      "A Food and Drug Administration spokesperson told CBS News that the agency is now urging the animal food supply chain to take steps to curb the threat of the virus spreading, including heat treatment to kill off the virus and avoiding using infected animals.",
      "\"All recent detections of H5N1 in cats had these things in common: the infected cats ate wild birds, unpasteurized milk, raw poultry, and/or raw poultry pet food,\" the spokesperson said.",

    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 15:19:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Salt water from the ocean is an option for fighting L.A.'s fires, but it's more complicated than simply going to the beach to transport water to the hillsides.",
    "story": [
      "As the Palisades and Eaton fires\u00a0continue to scorch Southern California, helpless spectators are raising questions about whether there are better ways to tame the flames. While some\u00a0fire hydrants in Los Angeles ran dry\u00a0amid the extreme wildfires, people wondered if firefighters could use salt water from the ocean instead of depleting fresh water sources.",
      "The short answer is yes, they can \u2014 but it's more complicated than simply going to the beach to transport water to the hillsides of L.A.",
      "Here are a few key factors to know about how seawater is being used for firefighting \u2014 and some of its limitations:",
      "Salt water's accessibility",
      "With over 60 aircraft, California has the largest civilian aviation fleet for firefighting in the world, according to Cal Fire. However, only a few of them are capable of scooping up water from the Pacific Ocean.",
      "So-called \"Super Scooper\" CL-415 aircraft were spotted doing so last week to help slow the spread the Palisades Fire while firefighters on the ground work to contain the blaze.",
      "These $25 million water-bombing aircraft are capable of hauling 14,000 pounds of water, according to aviation management software company WinAir.\u00a0 Unfortunately, one of the two planes had to be taken out of service temporarily after it was\u00a0damaged by an unauthorized drone.",
      "Strong Santa Ana winds also play a major role in why Super Scoopers and other firefighting aircraft are not always able fly on missions to drop water and fire retardants.",
      "\"Turbulence created over a fire is already incredible, and when you couple that with life-threatening destructive wind events, it makes flying nearly impossible,\" a Cal Fire spokesperson said in a video explainer. \"When winds are above 30 mph, fire retardant and water only end up a mist instead of a steady rain.\"",
      "Salt water is corrosive",
      "Some of the firefighting aircraft are only built to carry and disperse fire retardants, not water. And for those that carry water, salt water isn't often used because its salinity can damage equipment.",
      "Salt water would create similar issues for other firefighting systems. Fire hydrants and many other firefighting tools are made of metal, which is susceptible to rust when exposed to oxygen and water. Experts explain that\u00a0salt speeds up that corrosion process because it acts as an electrolyte that allows iron to lose electrons more easily.",
      "Salt water's long-term effect",
      "One more reason seawater is a last resort in fighting fires is because of its effect on the environment, according to experts.",
      "The long-term effect of seawater on trees and soil is yet to be fully understood, said Patrick Megonigal, an ecosystem ecologist at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center.",
      "Megonigal, who has studied how historically salt-free coastal forests react to saltwater exposures, wrote in an article for The Conversation that dry conditions in Southern California may allow salt to linger in the soil, which some trees may not be able to tolerate.",
      "\"Our lab experiments suggest that salt was causing clay and other particles to disperse and move about in the soil. Such changes in soil chemistry and structure can persist for many years,\" he wrote.",
      "Does Los Angeles have enough water for fighting fires?",
      "With ocean water not being the best option to fight ongoing fires, the question remains whether there's enough water to battle the flames.",
      "Rep. Judy Chu, a Democrat who represents areas devastated by the L.A. wildfires, said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that fire agencies have assured her there is \"enough water\" to continue fighting fires amid concerns over water pressure in the area.",
      "She said that when the fires first started, fanned by \"drastic winds,\" fire departments were overwhelmed.",
      "\"This is not an ordinary incident, and many fire hydrants were going on at the same time, and also the electricity used to pump the water had been turned off so that there would not spark anymore fire,\" Chu said. \"So that happened at that point, but I believe that we're in a good place right now.\"",

In return for information he provided, Blunt was allowed to keep his job, his knighthood and his social standing \u2013 and the queen was apparently kept in the dark.",

As a result of Philby's intervention, Volkov was abducted in Istanbul, taken back to Moscow and executed.",

    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 20:03:59 -0500",
    "summary": "When President Biden took office four years ago, he sought to reassure global allies and reestablish foreign treaties from which the Trump administration had withdrawn.",
    "story": [
      "With a world at war in Ukraine, the Middle East and Sudan, President Biden argued in a speech at the State Department Monday that his administration has strengthened partnerships around the world, bettered the United States' position on the global stage and weakened key adversaries.",
      "When Mr. Biden took office four years ago, he sought to reassure global allies and reestablish foreign treaties from which the Trump administration had withdrawn. The president reestablished strong relationships with leaders of NATO countries in the face of Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine and reentered the Paris climate agreement. But world leaders have been preparing for significant changes with President-elect Donald Trump's impending inauguration.",
      "\"I come here to the State Department to report to the American people on the progress we've made in the last four years, in our foreign policy, in our presidency,\" Mr. Biden said. \"I've said many times, we are at an inflection point. The post Cold-War era is over. A new era has begun. In these four years, we faced crises, we've been tested, we've come through those tests, stronger in my view, than we entered those tests. This is a fierce competition underway. The future of the global economy, technology, human values and so much else. Right now, in my view, thanks to our administration, the United States is winning the world-wide competition.\"",
      "Specifically, the president made the case that the United States' partnerships and transnational institutions are significantly stronger than they were before he took office, a key claim of his presidency.",
      "\"Today, I can report to the American people, our alliances are stronger than they've been in decades,\" he said. \"NATO is more capable than it's ever been. And many more of our allies are paying their fair share.\"",
      "But the president also sought to make the case that the United States' \"adversaries are weaker than they were when we came into this job four years ago.\"",
      "Specifically, Mr. Biden said Russian President Vladimir Putin has \"failed\" to subjugate Ukraine and weaken NATO. The president touted his work to rally the world around Ukraine, another central piece of his foreign policy.",
      "\"As I saw it, when Putin launched his invasion, I had two jobs \u2014 one to rally the world to defend Ukraine, and the other is to avoid war between two nuclear powers,\" Mr. Biden said. \"We did both those things. Today, Ukraine is still a free, independent country, with a potential, a potential for a bright future.\"",
      "He also argued that Iran is weaker than it's been in \"decades,\" saying Iran's main proxy Hezbollah is \"badly wounded\" and Iran's economy is in \"desperate straits.\"",
      "Something that has remained elusive for the Biden administration is the freeing of the hostages Hamas captured in Israel, which has been a top priority for the president and his aides. National security adviser Jake Sullivan said before Mr. Biden's speech on Monday the parties are \"close to a deal and it can get done this week,\" but also said he couldn't make a promise or a prediction.",
      "In his speech, the president briefly mentioned the soldiers who died during the chaotic and deadly withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, while emphasizing that he has been the president to end United States' involvement in its longest war.",
      "\"We grieve all 2,461 Americans who made the ultimate sacrifice in the longest war in American history,\" he said. \"And I grieve those brave service members whose lives were lost during the withdrawal.\"",
      "Thirteen U.S. service members\u00a0died in an attack\u00a0outside of the Kabul airport amid the evacuation as the Taliban took over control of the country faster than the U.S. expected.",
      "Mr. Biden also laid out the challenges ahead for the incoming Trump administration, which will have to deal with a chaotic Middle East, Russia's nearly three-year war on Ukraine and a tenuous situation in the Red Sea.",
      "\"Make no mistake, there are serious challenges the United States must continue to deal with, in Ukraine, in the Middle East, in the Indo-Pacific,\" he said. \"Must keep the pressure on the Houthis who are attacking ships in the Red Sea, launching missiles at Israel, and firing at American forces. Must deter North Korea as they rattle their saber and draw closer to Russia. And new challenges will certainly emerge in the months and years ahead.\"",
      "\"But even \u2014 but even so, it's clear,\" he continued. \"My administration is leaving the next administration with a very strong hand to play. And we're leaving an America with more friends and stronger alliances, whose adversaries are weaker and under pressure. An America that once again is leading, uniting countries, setting the agenda, bringing others together behind our plans and visions.\"",
      "The president recently told USA Today that he had helped reset ties that had frayed during the Trump administration, saying he had managed an \"inflection point\" in history. He credited his long history in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with helping him \"navigate some of the fundamental changes taking place, whether it's in Europe, in Latin America, in the Middle East, in the Far East.\"",
      "\"The only advantage of being an old guy is that I've known every major world leader for a long time,\" he told USA Today's Susan Page. \"And so I had a perspective on each of them and their interests.\"",
      "Jake Sullivan said the president will argue \"America is winning that contest for the future.\"",
      "In his first foreign policy speech as president, in 2021, Mr. Biden aimed to tie foreign and domestic policy interests by arguing for a foreign policy for the middle class. The focus was meant to be on China and repairing alliances but was disrupted by crises in Ukraine and the Middle East.",
      "\"The United States is in a worse geopolitical position today than it was four years ago,\" says Stephen Wertheim, historian and senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"The United States is immersed in a massive war on the European continent with serious escalation risks; it's back to bombing the Middle East with no end in sight; and it has entered into a full-spectrum strategic rivalry with China.\"",
      "A look at the major foreign policy issues of his presidency:",
      "Ukraine, Russia and NATO",
      "Mr. Biden has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine, becoming the first president to go to a conflict zone where U.S. troops were not involved and directing over $183 billion dollars in military aid since Russia's invasion in 2021. He played a key role in getting NATO to spend more on collective defense.",
      "Yet the fierce battle continues on the frontlines with no clear plan for a peace deal. Washington deferred to Kyiv on when and how negotiations should take place with the tagline \"nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.\"",
      "The administration was criticized early in the conflict for holding back on sending the most lethal weapons and later by some Republicans for spending too much money on Ukraine aid.",
      "Mr. Biden is expected to argue that his policies have ensured the survival of Ukraine as an independent state and thwarted Putin's ambitions, a senior administration official tells CBS News.",
      "Israel-Hamas war",
      "After Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that killed over 1,200 civilians, Mr. Biden made it clear that Israel has the right to defend itself with his administration sending over billions of dollars worth of military assistance.",
      "As Israel launched a war on Gaza that has killed more than 45,000 people according to the Hamas-run Gazan Health Ministry and led to a humanitarian crisis, the administration did not change its stance.",
      "In April 2023, Mr. Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanhayu that future U.S. support of his country was dependent on Israel protecting civilians and aid workers in Gaza.",
      "\"Biden willingly threw away his leverage by immediately pledging military support for Israel; then he criticized the Israeli government's decisions from the self-imposed sidelines,\" Wertheim said.",
      "The State Department informed Congress earlier this month of a planned $8 billion weapons transfer to Israel. Ceasefire negotiations are still underway between Israel and Hamas as pressure mounts for a deal to be reached prior to Trump's inauguration on January 20.",
      "Chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal",
      "The most glaring foreign policy failure was the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.",
      "Mr. Biden had promised to end America's longest war and assured Americans that the Afghan military was capable of holding off a Taliban takeover. Instead the Taliban expanded its control of territory across the country more quickly than the U.S. expected and seized Kabul as the Afghan government collapsed. The U.S. hastily evacuated about 125,000 people, including 6,000 Americans, over the course of its frenzied withdrawal, but dozens of Afghans and 13 U.S. service members were\u00a0killed in a suicide bombing\u00a0outside Hamid Karzai airport in Kabul as thousands sought to flee the country.",
      "U.S. citizens and Afghan allies who supported American troops throughout the war were left behind. Thousands feared retribution from the Taliban and felt abandoned by an American government that had promised to take care of them.",
      "Images of Afghans clinging onto military planes in hopes of escape, and U.S. military weapons left behind and paraded about by the Taliban became emblematic of the missteps leading up to the evacuation.",
      "In the three years since the Taliban returned to power, al Qaeda and other terrorist groups have established a presence in the country, and\u00a0Afghan women and girls have been deprived of basic freedoms\u00a0they enjoyed during two decades of Western-backed government following the U.S.-led invasion in 2001.",
      "China",
      "Trump began a trade war with China\u00a0and other countries during his first term, imposing tariffs that were aimed at deterring what he saw as unfair trade practices and to encourage American consumers and businesses to buy and sell more goods made at home. While the rhetoric changed under Mr Biden, he nonetheless continued the tariff policy. And as was the case during the Trump administration, both have viewed China as a security threat, not just an economic one.",
      "The Biden administration put safeguards in place to help protect industries like chip production from relying on China. Global alliances such as the Quad \u2014\u00a0 U.S., India, Japan and Australia \u2014\u00a0 and AUKUS \u2013 Australia, the U.S. and U.K. \u2013 made diplomatic and military headway in deterrence against China. And the Biden administration has also enhanced its military alliance with Japan.",
      "Mr. Biden was vice president when former President Barack Obama delivered his \"pivot to Asia\" speech. American policymakers have been attempting to shift foreign policy focus ever since, but there has been a world of distractions along the way.",
      "\"The United States cannot expect to prioritize China while remaining the leading military power in Europe and the Middle East. If the United States truly wants to prioritize China, it needs to pull back elsewhere,\"\u00a0 Wertheim said.",

    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 17:34:33 -0500",
    "summary": "President Biden spoke by phone Sunday with the families of three Americans held by the Taliban, Ryan Corbett, George Glezmann and Mahmood Habibi.",
    "story": [
      "In a roughly 30-minute phone call Sunday afternoon, President Biden delivered difficult news to the families of three Americans held by the Taliban. He did not have a deal with the Taliban to free their loved ones from captivity, despite what U.S. officials described to CBS News as a significant offer the U.S. had extended in Doha days earlier. The U.S. considers Ryan Corbett and George Glezmann to be wrongfully detained by the Taliban, and describes Mahmood Habibi, who holds dual American and Afghan citizenship, as \"unjustly held\" since 2022.",
      "Ahmad Shah Habibi, the brother of Mahmood Habibi, told CBS News that during the conversation, Mr. Biden clarified that he would not agree to the Taliban's demand that the U.S. release Muhammed Rahim al Afghani, a detainee at Guantanamo Bay, unless the Taliban, now the government of Afghanistan, also releases Mahmood. An NSC spokesman declined to respond to a CBS inquiry about that specific claim.",
      "Mahmood Habibi disappeared in Afghanistan in 2022, and the Taliban denied abducting him. In a public notice posted by the FBI in August 2024, the agency said it \"believed\" that Habibi was taken by Taliban military or security forces and \"has not been heard from since his disappearance.\" The FBI said in its notice that Habibi was working as a contractor for a Kabul-based telecom company when he disappeared.",
      "The Taliban still say they do not have Habibi in custody.",
      "\"No, we don't have him,\" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told CBS News Monday.",
      "Asked whether Mahmoud had disappeared in Afghanistan, Mujahid said, \"It's not clear either, because we didn't know him before.\"",
      "Ahmad Habibi told CBS News, \"My family has every confidence that my brother is alive. There are things that neither we nor the U.S. government can say publicly, but Mahmood's case is different from the other two Americans.\"",
      "\"We know the other families are desperate to get their loved ones home and I told the president we want them home, too,\" Ahmad Habibi added. \"But anyone speculating that my brother is dead is just feeding into Taliban claims. We are grateful that President Biden committed to not leave Mahmood behind,\" and he said that national security adviser Jake Sullivan had also made similar assurances.",
      "The FBI declined to comment.",
      "Corbett, who is fluent in Pashto, was working for local nongovernmental organizations before starting a microloan and consulting business in Kabul when he was arrested with three associates \u2014 one German and two Afghans \u2014 during a business trip to northern Afghanistan in 2022.",
      "Glezmann is an Atlanta native who was detained while on a tourist visit in December 2022.",
      "The family of Ryan Corbett is publicly calling on Mr. Biden to consider a deal to bring him and Glezmann home.",
      "\"We hope that President Biden will have the courage to take the deal in front of him, given that the lives of several Americans rest on his shoulders,\" Erin Pelton, a spokesperson for the Corbett family, told CBS News.",
      "Corbett's wife, Anna Corbett, described the call with the president during an appearance on Fox News on Monday.",
      "\"He was very kind and empathetic, but what I heard him say is he's not bringing Ryan home, and that was just devastating,\" Anna Corbett said. She blasted Mr. Biden for refusing to agree to the Taliban's terms for a deal. \"It is not being taken and it is incredibly crushing to our family.\"",
      "She has launched a public campaign in recent days to urge the incoming administration to press for her husband's release, and she traveled to President-elect Donald Trump's Mar-A-Lago residence in hopes of making an in-person plea to Trump. Neither Mr. Biden nor Trump have met with her yet.",
      "Anna Corbett did tell Fox News that Trump sent incoming national security adviser and current Florida Rep. Mike Waltz to meet with her. She said he spent more than an hour listening to her family's story. She expressed frustration that it took more than a year to get a similar meeting with the current national security adviser, Jake Sullivan.",
      "The Taliban have been demanding that the U.S. release Muhammed Rahim al-Afghani, who is being held in indefinite law-of-war detention at Guantanamo Bay. A source familiar with his case said the U.S. intelligence community and Pentagon oppose Rahim's release and could not guarantee that he no longer represented a threat to the U.S. However, the president could waive that if he determined it were in the U.S. interest to finalize a prisoner swap.",
      "Rahim was captured in Pakistan in 2007 by the CIA and was the last detainee sent to the Guantanamo prison facility by the Bush administration in 2008. He has never been charged with war crimes, but the periodic review board has deemed his continued detention a national security necessity. His 2016 intelligence profile describes him as a courier for al Qaeda.",
      "In its statement acknowledging the phone call, the White House also noted that Mr. Biden had been able to bring home U.S. citizens who had been detained before the U.S. exit from Afghanistan in 2021. Corbett, Glezmann and Habibi were detained after traveling to Afghanistan following the Taliban's return to power. That ascendance of the Taliban followed a diplomatic deal negotiated by the Trump administration for U.S. troops to withdraw and a surprisingly strong Taliban military offensive that caught the Biden administration off guard, leading to a hasty and chaotic U.S. evacuation. Unwilling to remain without U.S. troops, NATO forces also pulled out.",
      "The U.S. does not officially recognize the Taliban, with its horrific human rights record, as the legitimate government of Afghanistan but has been in contact with its leaders through U.S. agencies as well as via the Qatari government. Last weekend in Doha, Special Presidential Envoy Roger Carstens and NSC official Jen Daskal pressed for a deal with the Taliban to free the Americans.",
      "A U.S. official described the Doha meetings as unsuccessful but declined to detail which other individuals the Biden administration was willing to offer to the Taliban as part of a potential trade. The White House described the Biden efforts as continuing through the end of his term.",
      "Mr. Biden has dedicated much of his career to foreign policy, and that portion of his legacy is extremely important to him. In a speech Monday at the State Department, the president will describe the chaotic U.S. exit from Afghanistan, arguably his biggest foreign policy failure, as having successfully ended America's longest war.",

    "summary": "Israel and Hamas have been holding indirect talks for more than a year aimed at ending the war in Gaza and returning the hostages to Israel.",
    "story": [
      "Officials in the U.S. and Israel said that Israel and Hamas were close to agreeing a ceasefire and hostage release deal on Monday, after midnight \"breakthrough\" negotiations.",
      "Qatar, which has been mediating, reportedly gave both Israel and Hamas a draft on Monday of a ceasefire agreement to end the war in Gaza, the Reuters news agency reported, citing an official familiar with the talks.",
      "\"I think the pressure is building for Hamas to come to yes, and I think Israel also has achieved a huge amount of its military objectives in Gaza, and therefore, they are in a position to be able to say 'yes,'\" U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters.",
      "Sullivan said Israel and Hamas had been close to a deal before, and things had fallen through, but on Monday there was a \"general sense that this is moving in the right direction.\"",
      "\"The question is now, can we all collectively seize the moment and make this happen?\" Sullivan said.",
      "\"We are in advanced stages of negotiations,\" an Israeli political source told CBS News, saying a deal could be agreed in hours or days. \"There is progress in all components of the agreement formula.\"",
      "What has been happening with the Israel-Hamas ceasefire talks?",
      "Israel and Hamas have been holding indirect talks for more than a year aimed at ending the war in Gaza and returning scores of hostages in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.",
      "The Biden administration has been pushing for a deal before the end of his term and Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. On Sunday, President Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the phone about the ongoing negotiations. The White House said the two leaders discussed the deal based on the arrangement outlined by Mr. Biden last year.",
      "The deal presented to Israel and Hamas appears similar to that arrangement, according to a copy of the deal from mediator sources seen by CBS News and a senior Israeli official.",
      "The deal consists of three phases, according to the copy viewed by CBS News, each one to be negotiated as things progress.",
      "During the first phase, which would take place over a 42 days ceasefire period, Hamas would release 33 women and children hostages, as well as hostages over 50 years old. For each woman or child hostage returned to Israel, Israel would release 30 Palestinian women and children from its prisons. Hamas would release all hostages over 50 years of age, and Israel would release 30 Palestinian prisoners aged 50 or older.",
      "On the first day of that ceasefire, Hamas would release 3 hostages, according to the document viewed by CBS News. On the seventh day, Hamas would release 4 hostages. Thereafter, Hamas would release 3 hostages taken from Israel every seven days, starting with the living and then moving on to return the bodies of those who have died.",
      "During the exchange of hostages and prisoners, there would be a complete ceasefire in Gaza to allow aid to enter, the draft viewed by CBS News said. International aid groups and the United Nations would resume operation in Gaza, and reconstruction of its infrastructure, like water, electricity and sewage systems, would begin. There would also be negotiations over the next phase of the deal.",
      "The second phase of the deal would involve the release of all the Israeli male hostages and the withdrawal of the IDF from Gaza, according to the document viewed by CBS News.",
      "The third phase, which would be partially negotiated during earlier phases, would include the exchange of bodies of deceased hostages and prisoners, the beginning of the reconstruction of Gaza, and the opening of its borders.",
      "Despite intense mediation by the United States, Qatar and Egypt, the talks have repeatedly stalled over several key issues including the details of the exchange, whether the ceasefire would be permanent and the withdrawal of Israeli forces.",
      "As each side has accused the other of backtracking, the war has ground on.",
      "Dozens of Palestinians have been killed each day in Israeli strikes, and most of Gaza's 2.3 million people are huddled in squalid tent camps, their neighborhoods in ruins. Humanitarian groups struggle to deliver desperately needed aid, and experts have warned of famine.",
      "In Israel, families of the hostages have held weekly rallies demanding a deal for their release, fearing their loved ones will die in the harsh conditions of their captivity the longer the fighting drags on.",
      "What have the main points of contention been in coming up with a ceasefire deal?",
      "Hamas and other groups are still holding around 100 hostages captured in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel that ignited the war, in which militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. The Israeli military has declared a third of the hostages dead but suspects that the true number could be around half.",
      "Hamas is demanding the release of a large number of Palestinian prisoners, including senior militants convicted of orchestrating attacks that killed civilians. Israel is reluctant to free such prisoners, especially since one of the masterminds of the 2023 attack, the Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who was killed by Israel in October, was a former prisoner released in such a deal.",
      "The two sides have exchanged lists of names, with Israel demanding more information about which hostages are alive to ensure they come out first.",
      "Hamas has said it won't release the remaining hostages without assurances that the war will end. Israel's military offensive has killed more than 46,000 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to local health authorities, who don't say how many of the dead were militants.",
      "Hamas likely fears that Israel will resume its offensive \u2014 and step up its intensity \u2014 once the hostages are out and the militants no longer have their most valuable bargaining chip.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to do just that. He has said Israel won't end the war until it has destroyed Hamas' military and governing abilities and ensured that the Palestinian militant group no longer poses a threat.",
      "The lack of trust goes both ways: Israelis fear that Hamas will drag out negotiations over the second phase of the deal, extending the ceasefire indefinitely while the hostages languish.",
      "Talks have almost collapsed over disagreements",
      "The talks nearly collapsed last summer when Netanyahu said Israel would maintain a lasting presence in the Philadelphi corridor, a strip of land along the Gaza-Egypt border.",
      "Israel says Hamas has long smuggled weapons into Gaza through tunnels beneath the corridor and that it must control the area to prevent Hamas from rebuilding. Egypt, a key mediator, says it blocked the tunnels years ago and is opposed to any Israeli presence on the Gaza side of its border.",
      "Israel has also demanded a mechanism for inspecting people returning to their homes in northern Gaza, from which around a million people fled following Israeli evacuation orders at the start of the war. Their return is a key Hamas demand, the details of which are still being worked out.",
      "Israel says people returning to the north should be searched for weapons. That would probably require an Israeli presence in what's known as the Netzarim corridor, a strip of closed roads and military installations stretching from the border to the sea just south of Gaza City.",
      "The Palestinians are opposed to any permanent Israeli occupation, though Hamas has reportedly shown flexibility on the timetable of the Israeli withdrawal.",
      "Israel says Hamas can never again rule Gaza but has yet to endorse a realistic plan for an alternative government. With no internal rivals, Hamas has been able to quickly regroup after Israeli operations, even in the hardest-hit areas, and still controls much of the territory.",
      "The Biden administration has long pushed for a grand bargain in which a reformed Palestinian Authority would govern postwar Gaza with the support of Arab and Muslim countries, including Saudi Arabia, which would also take the historic step of forging ties with Israel.",
      "But Arab and Muslim leaders say they will only sign onto such plans if they include a pathway to a Palestinian state in the occupied West Bank, Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem and Gaza, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war.",
      "Israel's government is opposed to Palestinian statehood and has ruled out any role for the Palestinian Authority in Gaza. Netanyahu says Israel will maintain open-ended security control while delegating governance to politically independent Palestinians. But none appear to have volunteered, and Hamas has threatened anyone who cooperates with Israel in running the territory.",
      "Hamas has said, however, that it's willing to relinquish control of Gaza to other Palestinians. Late last year, it agreed to an Egyptian-brokered plan for a group of independents to govern the territory under the auspices of the Palestinian Authority, which has yet to accept the proposal.",
      "Hamas has also demanded the lifting of a blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt after it seized power in 2007, which experts say is needed for Gaza to be rebuilt.",
      "The lifting of the blockade, however, would allow Hamas to claim a major victory and to eventually rebuild its military capabilities. That's another nonstarter for Israel.",

    "story": [
      "A descendant of one of Jack the Ripper's victims has demanded a new inquest into one of history's most notorious serial killers, after DNA evidence suggested the murderer was a Polish barber.",
      "The true identity of Jack the Ripper, whose grisly murders terrorized the murky slums of Whitechapel in east London in 1888, has been a mystery ever since.",
      "There have been dozens of suspects, from royalty and prime ministers down to bootmakers.",
      "After extracting DNA from a shawl recovered from the scene of one of the killings, Jack the Ripper sleuth Russell Edwards claimed in 2014 that the murderer was Aaron Kosminski, an emigre from Poland, who worked as a barber.",

      "DNA from semen stains on the garment were matched with a descendant of Kosminski.",
      "Edwards has demanded an inquest into the unsolved killing, saying the DNA evidence warrants it.",

      "\"The name Jack the Ripper has become sensationalized. It has gone down in history as this famous character,\" she told the paper. \"People have forgotten about the victims, who did not have justice at the time. Now we need this inquest to legally name the killer.\"",

      "Kosminski's descendants have also supported the inquest, the Daily Mail reported. According to the newspaper, Kosminski's great-great-great-niece Amanda Poulos said: \"I'm more than happy to finally establish what really happened.\"",
      "Some have cast doubt on Edwards' findings.",
      "The research has not been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, meaning the claims cannot be independently verified or the methodology scrutinized.",
      "Under the law, it is up to the attorney general to approve a further inquest.",
      "Two years ago, then the attorney general, Michael Ellis, refused the request, saying there was not sufficient new evidence.",
      "Miller said on Monday the time was right to reopen the case.",
      "\"It would mean a lot to me, to my family, to a lot of people to finally have this crime solved,\" she added.",
      "Kosminski was born in Klodawa in central Poland on September 11, 1865.",
      "His family fled the imperial Russian anti-Jewish pogroms and emigrated to east London in the early 1880s. He lived close to the murder scenes.",
      "Some reports say he was taken in by the police to be identified by a witness who had seen him with one of the victims.",
      "Although a positive identification was made, the witness refused to give incriminating evidence, meaning the police had little option but to release Kosminski.",
      "He entered a workhouse in 1889, where he was described on admission as \"destitute.\" He was discharged later that year but soon ended up in a mental asylum.",
      "He died from gangrene in an asylum on March 24, 1919, and was buried three days later at East Ham Cemetery in east London.",
      "As CBS News previously reported, former FBI agent John Douglas referred to the homicides as \"lust murders,\" which means the killer attacked the genital areas of his victims. In Douglas' opinion, this was a way to act out his fantasy of domination, cruelty and mutilation of women.",

He explained, \"If the United States is not engaged, if we're not leading, then probably either someone else is (and probably not in a way that reflects our interests and our values), or maybe just as bad, no one is. What we've done over the last four years is, we've re-engaged.\"",
      "As for Ukraine, he told the press in Brussels, \"All told, the U.S. has provided $102 billion in assistance to Ukraine, our allies and partners $158 billion. This may be the best example of burden-sharing that I've seen in the 32 years that I've been doing this.\"",
      "President-elect Trump wants to end Russia's war with Ukraine, critics fear not to Ukraine's advantage. Ever the diplomat, Blinken won't say he's trying to Trump-proof the potential outcome. \"For any of us to really speculate at this point, I don't think makes a lot of sense,\" Blinken said. \"What does make sense is to make sure that we give the next administration, we give the incoming Trump administration, the strongest possible hand for it to play around the world, whether it's on Ukraine or anything else.\"",
      "Sixty-two years old, Antony Blinken was practically born to be secretary of state.\u00a0 His father, financier and philanthropist Donald Blinken, served as ambassador to Hungary. His stepfather, international lawyer and humanitarian Samuel Pisar, was a Holocaust survivor from Poland. \"He was on a death march out of the camps, and he and some friends managed to escape the death march itself, hid out in the Bavarian woods,\" Blinken said. \"They saw a tank with a five-pointed white star. And the hatch opened up, and a very large African American GI looked down at him, and he got down on his knees and said the only words that he knew in English that his mother had taught him before the war: 'God bless America.' And the GI lifted him into the tank, into freedom, into the United States. Those are the stories that I grew up hearing, and it made me feel that there was something special about our country.\"",
      "Blinken grew up in Paris. He went to Harvard, Columbia Law School, and in 1993, during President Clinton's first term, began his diplomatic career at the State Department. During one administration after another, Blinken was always in \"the room where it happens.\" There he was (right, background) in the famous picture when President Obama took out Osama bin Laden.",
      "Blinken was national security advisor to then-Vice President Joe Biden. The two are exceptionally close. \"One of the things that's been an immense privilege is to have the kind of relationship where he would seek my counsel,\" said Blinken, \"and I always felt with him the ability to speak my mind.\"",
      "It was reported in Bob Woodward's recent book, \"War,\" that after President Biden's shaky debate performance last July, Blinken met with the president and asked him to consider whether he \"wanted to be doing this another four years?\"... adding, \"I don't want to see your legacy jeopardized.\"",
      "Blinken and Biden's legacies are inevitably linked, for better or worse. Blinken has defended the chaotic U.S. pull-out from Afghanistan on their watch, reminding the world that the first Trump administration made a deal with the Taliban, forcing the withdrawal.",
      "On their rocky relationship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the devastation of Gaza, in response to the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, and the appearance that Netanyahu is not respecting the role that the United States is trying to play (and has helped to finance) in its support of Israel, that calls to protect and feed people have been ignored, Blinken said this: \"The quickest way, the most effective way to get people what they need is actually through what we've been trying to achieve for many months now, and that's a ceasefire, with the hostages coming home, massive assistance going in.\"",
      "Even this late in the game, Blinken is hoping a deal can be reached before Inauguration Day. But if not? He said, \"When that agreement is reached, it will be on the basis of what President Biden put forward.\"",
      "And who will get the credit? \"You know, ultimately, it doesn't matter,\" Blinken said. \"What really matters is whether the United States can bring real change, real change to people's lives.\"",
      "He still sounds idealistic. There's something a bit square about Antony Blinken. After all, he's the guy who promoted music diplomacy by performing the Muddy Waters blues standard, \"Hoochie Coochie Man,\" in a suit and tie:",
      "What will he do now? He's vague on that. As he left NATO headquarters for the last time as secretary of state, I asked, \"You can't not have strong feelings knowing that you're leaving this building?\"",
      "\"Sure,\" Blinken said. \"Look, there'll always be a moment. Someone says something to you, there's some generous recognition, and for about 30 seconds you feel that. You take it to heart. But then, it's back to work. That really is my focus. Now, talk to me on January 21.\"",

      "\"This area particularly, you know, I've lived here for over 20 years and it's just, slowly getting, like, soulless. I would say 50% of the buildings are here just for temporary use, you know, for rentals,\" he said.",

      "Barcelona's City Hall has launched a program to install energy efficient heat pumps and solar panels in all of the city's 170 public schools over six years.

    "summary": "Greenland's prime minister said he hasn't spoken to President-elect Donald Trump, but that he's open to discussions about what \"unites us.\"",
    "story": [
      "Greenland's prime minister said Friday that the mineral-rich Arctic territory's people don't want to be Americans, but that he understands U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's interest in the island given its strategic location and he's open to greater cooperation with Washington.",
      "The comments from the Greenlandic leader, M\u00fate B. Egede, came after Trump said earlier this week that he wouldn't rule out using force or economic pressure in order to make Greenland \u2014 a semiautonomous territory of Denmark \u2014 a part of the United States. Trump said that it was a matter of national security for the U.S. Melting sea ice has\u00a0opened up new shipping routes through the Arctic, and Western powers have\u00a0already voiced concern about\u00a0Russia and China using it to boost their presence in the North Atlantic.",
      "Egede acknowledged that Greenland is part of the North American continent, and \"a place that the Americans see as part of their world.\" He said he hasn't spoken to Trump, but that he's open to discussions about what \"unites us.\"",
      "\"Cooperation is about dialogue. Cooperation means that you will work towards solutions,\" he said.",
      "Egede has been calling for independence for Greenland, casting Denmark as a colonial power that hasn't always treated the Indigenous Inuit population well.",
      "\"Greenland is for the Greenlandic people. We do not want to be Danish, we do not want to be American. We want to be Greenlandic,\" he said at a news conference alongside Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen in Copenhagen.",
      "Trump's desire for Greenland has sparked anxiety in Denmark as well as across Europe. The United States is a strong ally of 27-nation European Union and the leading member of the NATO alliance, and many Europeans were shocked by the suggestion that an incoming U.S. leader could even consider using force against an ally.",
      "But Frederiksen said that she sees a positive aspect in the discussion.",
      "\"The debate on Greenlandic independence and the latest announcements from the U.S. show us the large interest in Greenland,\" she said. \"Events which set in motion a lot of thoughts and feelings with many in Greenland and Denmark.\"",
      "\"The U.S. is our closest ally, and we will do everything to continue a strong cooperation,\" she said.",
      "Frederiksen and Egede spoke to journalists after a biannual assembly of Denmark and two territories of its kingdom, Greenland and the Faroe Islands. The meeting had been previously scheduled and wasn't called in response to Trump's recent remarks. Trump's eldest son also made a visit to Greenland on Tuesday, landing in a plane emblazoned with the word TRUMP and handing out Make America Great Again caps to locals.",
      "The Danish public broadcaster, DR, reported Friday that Trump's team encouraged homeless and socially disadvantaged people in Greenland to appear in a video wearing the MAGA hats after being offered a free meal in a nice restaurant. The report quoted a local resident, Tom Amtof, who recognized some of those in a video broadcast by Trump's team.",
      "\"They are being bribed, and it is deeply distasteful,\" he said.",
      "Greenland has a population of 57,000. But it's a vast territory possessing natural resources that include oil, gas, and rare earth elements, which are expected to become more accessible as ice melts because of climate change. Greenland may have significant reserves of up to 31 different minerals, including lithium and graphite. These rare materials are needed to produce electric vehicle batteries.

      "They found that norepinephrine waves correlate to variations in brain blood volume \u2014 suggesting that norepinephrine triggers a rhythmic pulsation in the blood vessels. The researchers then compared the changes in blood volume to brain fluid flow.",
      "The brain fluid flow fluctuates in correspondence to blood volume changes, suggesting the vessels act as pumps to propel the surrounding brain fluid to flush out waste.",

      "For those who are interested in curbing their alcohol use, here are six tips on how to do so safely.",
      "The surgeon general's advisory noted that alcohol-related cancer deaths even occurred in some moderate drinkers. (iStock)",
      "1. Analyze your alcohol dependence",
      "Alcohol is \"one of the most serious substances\" when it comes to detoxification, sometimes requiring medical hospitalization to manage withdrawal symptoms, according to Dr. Chris Tuell, clinical director at the Lindner Center of HOPE in Mason, Ohio.",
      "\"If you are one of the 40% of Americans who is trying to stop alcohol use, sometimes it may be necessary to seek counseling services.\"",
      "Tuell, who is also an associate professor at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience, recommended speaking to a primary care physician before discontinuing years of extreme alcohol use.",
      "DOES \u2018DRY JANUARY\u2019 ACTUALLY IMPROVE YOUR HEALTH? HERE'S WHAT TO KNOW",
      "Dr. Adi Jaffe, PhD, CEO of addiction recovery platform IGNTD in Los Angeles, noted that in some cases, it may be \"medically inadvisable to just quit\" if alcohol dependence is severe.",
      "People who drink heavily, or consume five to seven drinks a day, should consult their doctor before quitting, one addiction specialist recommended. (iStock)",
      "\"You must consult with a medical professional before stopping,\" said Jaffe, author of the book \"Unhooked.\" \"This is especially true if you get tremors, shaking or sweatiness when you don't drink, even for a day or two.\"",
      "\"Those are markers of somebody who's more likely to have a grand mal seizure if they just stop cold turkey.\"",
      "2. Set clear goals and track patterns",
      "For people who haven\u2019t had a \"necessarily problematic\" relationship with alcohol and are just looking to cut back, Tuell recommended setting clear goals to get there.",
      "DRINKING ALCOHOL IS LINKED TO CANCER, EXPERTS SAY",
      "\"With any behaviors that you plan to change, what are clear, realistic and specific goals on how much or how often you plan to drink?\" he asked.",
      "\"Perhaps you have the goal of only drinking on weekends, or perhaps you limit the amount of alcohol to two drinks per occasion.\"",
      "Writing down your drinking behaviors can help identify triggers, experts say. (iStock)",
      "Tuell suggested tracking your drinking by keeping a journal of when, where and how much you drink.",
      "\"This helps to identify patterns or triggers that may be associated with your mood, such as work stress or family stress and anxieties,\" he said.",
      "Planning alcohol-free days and then gradually increasing the number of those days each week can be effective, the expert added.",
      "3. Avoid triggers and find alternatives",
      "After tracking when, where and how much you drink, it may become clear what triggers you to drink.",
      "Tuell encouraged identifying these situations, emotions and behaviors and finding alternative ways to handle them.",
      "\u2018ALCOHOL GENE\u2019 COULD PREDICT HOW COCKTAILS MAY AFFECT YOU \u2014 AND THERE\u2019S A TEST FOR IT",
      "\"These triggers will frequently lead to behaviors that give us relief and/or a reward, and many times it is not a healthy way of coping,\" he said.",
      "\"Choose non-alcoholic beverages in social settings \u2026 like sparkling water, mocktails or herbal teas, to satisfy the habit of having a drink \u2026 or avoid places where heavy drinking occurs.\"",
      "Social pressure to drink can pose a major temptation, according to experts. (iStock)",
      "Jaffe commented that focusing on less drinking won\u2019t be as effective as drinking something else, like a non-alcoholic drink, or doing a different activity instead.",
      "SEVERE HEALTH RISKS OF VAPING AND E-CIGARETTES, ESPECIALLY FOR YOUTH, SAY EXPERTS",
      "Tuell agreed that finding a healthier alternative to bad behaviors is a good way to stop them.",
      "This could include stress-relieving practices like exercising, reading, journaling or spending more time with supportive friends.",
      "Adding movement as a replacement for drinking can help curb bad habits. (iStock)",
      "Movement, mindfulness exercises and meditation can also be helpful practices throughout the day, according to Jaffe.",
      "\"You can do those practices while you're brushing your teeth or while you're making your coffee,\" he said. \"Meditation practices as short as five or 10 minutes can have an incredible impact on your stress response in life.\"",
      "4. Change your environment",
      "Removing temptations from your environment is a good way to prevent reaching for them, according to experts.",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "Tuell suggested removing alcohol from your home or limiting activities that make it more accessible, such as hanging out at bars.",
      "\"Smell is the strongest of the five senses connected to memory,\" he added.",
      "Jaffe agreed that environment \"plays a massive role\" in how people interact with alcohol.",
      "\"If you're looking to reduce your drinking \u2026 having other people who are participating in the journey with you will go a long way toward helping you meet your goals of reduction.\"",
      "5. Practice saying \u2018no\u2019 and surround yourself with support",
      "The social pressures of drinking can be a trigger, but learning to say \"no\" is powerful. Tuell recommended being prepared with a \"polite but firm\" response in situations where you might feel pressured to drink.",
      "\u2018I\u2019M A PSYCHOLOGIST \u2013 HERE'S HOW TO FINALLY BREAK YOUR BAD HABITS'",
      "This can be as simple as, \"No, thanks, I\u2019m taking a break from drinking\" or \"I\u2019m good, thanks.\"",
      "Tuell advises surrounding yourself with supportive individuals, like trusted friends or family members with whom you can share your goals.",
      "Experts recommend surrounding yourself with supportive individuals with whom you can share your goals. (iStock)",
      "He also suggested joining a support group, \"like Alcoholics Anonymous, SMART Recovery, Celebrate Recovery or Women for Sobriety.\"",

      "For more Health articles, visit\u00a0foxnews.com/health",
      "Tuell also mentioned that methods like cognitive behavioral therapy can be effective.",
      "6. Be kind to yourself",
      "Reflecting on the reasons you're looking to reduce alcohol intake \u2014 whether it's to improve your health, save money, strengthen relationships or another motivating factor \u2014 can help keep you on the right path, according to Tuell.",
      "\"Setbacks are normal. So be kind to yourself and focus on progress, not perfection.\"",
      "He also encouraged celebrating milestones by enjoying something non-alcohol-related, such as a massage, a round of golf, a shopping trip or another fun outing.",
      "\"To make changes, it takes time,\" Tuell said. \"Setbacks are normal. So be kind to yourself and focus on progress, not perfection.\"",
      "\"If you keep moving forward one step at a time, you will get to a point where you're drinking substantially less.\" (iStock)",
      "While about 40% of people quit their New Year\u2019s resolutions before the end of January, according to Jaffe, the specialist said it's important to not be discouraged by slip-ups.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump nominated Hegseth to shake up the Pentagon as his defense secretary, but the former Fox News host has been entangled in controversies that Democrats on the committee can be expected to question him about.",
      "In his opening statement, Hegseth is expected to nod to his war-fighting experience and status as an outsider to the Pentagon establishment, telling committee members it's \"time to give someone with dust on his boots the helm.\"",
      "He intends to \"restore the warrior ethos to the Pentagon,\" provide \"new defense companies\" with a better shot at winning contracts, and rapidly deploy emerging technologies.\"It is true that I don't have a similar biography to Defense secretaries of the last 30 years,\" he is to say, according to a copy of the opening statement obtained by Axios in advance of the hearing. \"But, as President Trump also told me, we've repeatedly placed people atop the Pentagon with supposedly 'the right credentials' \u2014 whether they are retired generals, academics or defense contractor executives \u2014 and where has it gotten us?\"\"He believes, and I humbly agree, that it's time to give someone with dust on his boots the helm,\" Hegseth will say. \"A change agent. Someone with no vested interest in certain companies or specific programs or approved narratives.\"The nominee will say his \"only special interest is \u2014 the warfighter.\"\"[W]e are American warriors,\" Hegseth is expected to say in his opening statement. \"Our standards will be high, and they will be equal (not equitable, that is a very different word).\"\u00a0\"We need to make sure every warrior is fully qualified on their assigned weapon system, every pilot is fully qualified and current on the aircraft they are flying, and every general or flag officer is selected for leadership based purely on performance, readiness and merit,\" Hegseth will continue, adding that he looks \"forward to working with this committee \u2014 senators from both parties \u2014 to secure our nation.\"",
      "Hegseth, who has been married three times, has admitted that he was a \"serial cheater\" before he became a Christian. He acknowledges his faith and current wife in his opening statement.\u00a0\"Thank you to my incredible wife Jennifer, who has changed my life and been with me throughout this entire process,\" his opening statement says. \"I love you, sweetheart, and I thank God for you. And as Jenny and I pray together each morning, all glory \u2014 regardless of the outcome \u2014 belongs to our Lord and savior Jesus Christ. His grace and mercy abound each day. May His will be done.\"Hegseth also recognizes his \"seven wonderful kids,\" adding: \"Their future safety and security is in all our hands.\"",
      "The confirmation process is expected to be contentious.",
      "\"Democrats certainly aren\u2019t going to make this a walk in the park by any means,\" one Republican aide said.",
      "\"You'll see Democrats are pretty organized, they're thinking strategically to make sure everything is covered, and it's not a hearing that gets overly repetitive,\" one senior Democrat aide told Fox News Digital.",
      "HOW THE SUPREME COURT CONFIRMATION PROCESS WORKS",
      "\"I don't think it's going to be particularly hostile, but I do think it will be very tough. It's going to focus a lot just on what we should expect of a nominee for this job and where he falls short,\" the aide went on. \"There are questions about the things he's done, his character and his leadership.\"",
      "Hegseth will be the first of Trump\u2019s controversial change agent picks to face questioning from lawmakers.",
      "Republicans can be expected to play defense, framing Hegseth as a decorated combat veteran who will hold the military accountable after years of failed audits and DEI initiatives.",
      "In his opening statement, Hegseth is expected to outline his three top missions for the Pentagon: \"Restore the warrior ethos;\" \"Rebuild our military;\" and \"Reestablish deterrence.\"\u00a0\"Restore the warrior ethos to the Pentagon and throughout our fighting force; in doing so, we will reestablish trust in our military \u2014 and address the recruiting, retention and readiness crisis in our ranks. The strength of our military is our unity \u2014 our shared purpose \u2014 not our differences,\" he'll tell the committee. \"Rebuild our military, always matching threats to capabilities; this includes reviving our defense industrial base, reforming the acquisition process (no more 'Valley of Death' for new defense companies), modernizing our nuclear triad ... and rapidly fielding emerging technologies.\"\u00a0Hegseth also aims to \"Reestablish deterrence.\" \"First and foremost, we will defend our homeland,\" he'll tell the committee. \"Second, we will work with our partners and allies to deter aggression in the Indo-Pacific from the communist Chinese. Finally, we will responsibly end wars to ensure we can prioritize our resources \u2014 and reorient to larger threats. We can no longer count on 'reputational deterrence' \u2014 we need real deterrence.\"",
      "With little hope of winning any Democrat votes, Hegseth will have to woo moderate Republicans who have previously expressed skepticism about his nomination.",
      "Democrats are expected to hammer him over his past conduct and his qualifications to lead the government\u2019s largest agency, which employs 3 million people.",

      "HUNDREDS OF VETERANS TO DESCEND ON DC TO MARCH IN SUPPORT OF PETE HEGSETH'S CONFIRMATION",
      "The 44-year-old Army National Guard veteran, who did tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, is relatively young and inexperienced compared to defense secretaries past, having retired as a major. But Republicans say they don\u2019t want someone who made it to the top brass, who\u2019s become entrenched in the Pentagon establishment.",
      "Hegseth is sure to face questions about a sexual assault accusation from 2017. He\u2019s acknowledged paying his accuser an undisclosed sum to keep quiet at the time for fear of losing his job, but he denies any non-consensual sex took place.",
      "Former employees at veterans\u2019 groups Hegseth used to run have accused him of financial mismanagement and excessive drinking, according to a New Yorker report, and NBC News reported that his drinking \"concerned\" colleagues at Fox News.",
      "Hegseth denies the accusations and said he would not drink \"a drop of alcohol\" if confirmed to lead the Defense Department.",
      "The hearing, which kicks off at 9:30 a.m., will be packed with veterans who traveled to Washington, D.C., to support Hegseth in the face of attacks.",
      "In his opening statement, Hegseth is expected to acknowledge his supporters who have served, saluting \"all the troops and veterans watching, and in this room \u2014 Navy SEALs, Green Berets, pilots, sailors, Marines, Gold Stars and more. Too many friends to name. Officers and enlisted. Black and white. Young and old. Men and women. All Americans. All warriors.\"",
      "\"This hearing is for you,\" Hegseth will say in front of the committee. \"Thank you for figuratively, and literally, having my back. I pledge to do the same for you. All of you.\"Taking a swipe at the Biden administration, Hegseth says the DoD under Trump's watch \"will achieve peace through strength\" and \"will remain patriotically apolitical and stridently constitutional. Unlike the current administration.\"",
      "\"Leaders \u2014 at all levels \u2014 will be held accountable,\" his opening statement says. \"And warfighting and lethality \u2014 and the readiness of the troops and their families \u2014 will be our only focus.\"",
      "\"That has been my focus ever since I first put on the uniform as a young Army ROTC cadet at Princeton University in 2001,\" Hegseth adds. \"I served with incredible Americans in Guantanamo Bay, Iraq, Afghanistan and in the streets of Washington, D.C.\"",
      "\"This includes enlisted soldiers I helped become American citizens, and Muslim allies I helped immigrate from Iraq and Afghanistan. And when I took off the uniform, my mission never stopped.\"",
      "For weeks, Hegseth has been visiting Capitol Hill to meet with senators, including those who are skeptical of him. Last Wednesday, he met with the top Armed Services Committee Democrat, Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, and the meeting apparently didn\u2019t go well.",
      "\"Today\u2019s meeting did not relieve my concerns about Mr. Hegseth\u2019s lack of qualifications and raised more questions than answers,\" Reed said in a statement.",
      "Hegseth retired from the Army National Guard in 2021. (Fox News)",
      "Hegseth must first win a majority in a vote of the Armed Services Committee, made up of 14 Republicans and 13 Democrats, meaning one Republican defection could tank the vote.",
      "He then needs to win a simple majority on the Senate floor, meaning he can afford to lose no more than three Republican votes.",
      "\"I think he kind of knows that all he needs is Republican votes to get from now into the job,\" said a Democrat aide. \"His job is to just keep his head down and not say something that would create an opening for these [Republicans], many of whom I really don't think want to vote for him, to have a reason to revisit that. So I expect that he's going to try to say very little and say it very calmly and politely.\"",
      "In committee, all eyes will be on Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, a veteran herself who at first seemed hesitant about Hegseth. After two meetings with the nominee, Ernst said she would support him through the confirmation process and looked forward to a fair hearing. She didn\u2019t commit to voting for him.",
      "Senators will also take a fine-toothed comb to Hegseth\u2019s lengthy record of public comments on TV and across the five books he\u2019s written.",
      "One such belief is that women should not fight in combat roles.",
      "\"Dads push us to take risks. Moms put the training wheels on our bikes. We need moms. But not in the military, especially not in combat units,\" he wrote in his most recent book, \"The War on Warriors,\" published in 2024.",
      "Hegseth has been courting votes on Capitol Hill for weeks. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)",
      "\"Men are, gasp, biologically stronger, faster and bigger. Dare I say, physically superior,\" Hegseth added.",
      "PETE HEGSETH SAYS HE HASN'T HEARD FROM WEST POINT SINCE EMPLOYEE 'ERROR' DENYING HIS ACCEPTANCE",
      "On a Nov. 7 episode of the Shawn Ryan podcast, which aired mere days before Hegseth was tapped to serve as Defense Secretary, the nominee said, \"I\u2019m straight up just saying we should not have women in combat roles.\"",
      "Hegseth later told Fox News in December that women are some of the U.S.\u2019 \"greatest warriors.\"",

      "Special Counsel David Weiss' final report on his years-long investigation into Hunter Biden determined the first son's drug abuse could not explain away not paying taxes on millions of dollars of income earned off of his \"last name and connections.\"",
      "\"As a well-educated lawyer and businessman, Mr. Biden consciously and willfully chose not to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes over a four-year period. From 2016 to 2020, Mr. Biden received more than $7 million in total gross income, including approximately $1.5 million in 2016, $2.3 million in 2017, $2.1 million in 2018, $1 million in 2019 and $188,000 from January through October 15, 2020,\" Weiss wrote in his final report, which was released Monday.",
      "\"Mr. Biden made this money by using his last name and connections to secure lucrative business opportunities, such as a board seat at a Ukrainian industrial conglomerate, Burisma Holdings Limited, and a joint venture with individuals associated with a Chinese energy conglomerate. He negotiated and executed contracts and agreements that paid him millions of dollars for limited work,\" Weiss continued.",
      "Hunter Biden, 54, had a busy year in court last year, when he was convicted of two separate federal cases prosecuted by Weiss. He kicked off his first trial in Delaware in June, when he faced three felony firearm offenses involving his drug use, before pleading guilty in a separate\u00a0felony tax case in September.",

As jury selection was about to kick off in Los Angeles federal court for the case, however, Hunter Biden entered a surprise guilty plea.",
      "Weiss continued in his report that Hunter Biden \"spent millions of dollars on an extravagant lifestyle rather than paying his tax bills,\" and that he \"willfully failed to pay his 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 taxes on time, despite having access to funds to pay some or all of these taxes.\"",

      "\"These are not 'inconsequential' or \u2018technical\u2019 tax code violations,\" Weiss wrote. \"Nor can Mr. Biden's conduct be explained away by his drug use-most glaringly, Mr. Biden filed his false 2018 return, in which he deliberately underreported his income to lower his tax liability, in February 2020, approximately eight months after he had regained his sobriety. Therefore, the prosecution of Mr. Biden was warranted given the nature and seriousness of his tax crimes.\"",

      "Hunter has a well-documented\u00a0history of drug abuse, which was most notably documented in his 2021 memoir, \"Beautiful Things.\" The book walked readers through his previous addiction to crack cocaine, before getting sober in 2019.

      "\"The evidence demonstrated that as Mr. Biden held high-paying positions earning him millions of dollars, he chose to keep funding his extravagant lifestyle instead of paying his taxes. He then chose to lie to his accountants in claiming false business deductions when, in fact, he knew they were personal expenses. He did this on his own, and his tax return preparers relied on him, because, among other reasons, only he understood the true nature of his deductions and he failed to give them records that might have revealed that the deductions were bogus,\" Weiss continued.",
      "The tax case charges carried up to 17 years behind bars, but the first son would likely have faced a much shorter sentence under federal sentencing guidelines. His sentencing was scheduled for Dec. 16, but he was pardoned by his father, President Biden, earlier that month.",

      "\"Politicians who attack the decisions of career prosecutors as politically motivated when they disagree with the outcome of a case undermine the public's confidence in our criminal justice system,\" Weiss wrote in another section of the report. \"The President's statements unfairly impugn the integrity not only of Department of Justice personnel, but all of the public servants making these difficult decisions in good faith.\"",

      "Former assistant U.S. attorney Andy McCarthy provides legal analysis on Hunter Biden's pardon and worries over a possible Trump justice department investigation on 'America Reports.'",
      "FIRST ON FOX: Special Counsel David Weiss blasted President Biden in his highly-anticipated report on his years-long investigation into Hunter Biden, saying the commander-in-chief's characterizations of the probe into his son were \"wrong\" and \"unfairly\" maligned Justice Department officials, while admitting that the presidential pardon made it \"inappropriate\" for him to discuss whether any additional charges against the first son were warranted.",
      "Fox News Digital obtained a copy of Weiss's final report after his years-long investigation into Hunter Biden.",
      "The Justice Department transmitted the report to Congress on Monday evening.",
      "Weiss, in his report, chided President Biden for his Dec. 1, 2024 decision to grant his son a \"Full and Unconditional Pardon\" covering nearly eleven years of conduct, including conduct related to both convictions the special counsel obtained.",
      "Hunter Biden was found guilty of three felony firearm offenses stemming from Special Counsel David Weiss\u2019 investigation. The first son was also charged with federal tax crimes regarding the failure to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes. Before his trial, Hunter Biden entered a surprise guilty plea.",
      "HUNTER BIDEN: A LOOK AT HOW THE SAGA SPANNING OVER SIX YEARS UNFOLDED",
      "The charges carried up to 17 years behind bars. His sentencing was scheduled for Dec. 16, but his father, President Biden, pardoned him on all charges in December.",
      "Weiss, in the report, blasted the president's decision to pardon but also the press release that was sent out to the public that \"criticized the prosecution of his son as \u2018selective,\u2019 \u2018unfair,\u2019 \u2018infected\u2019 by \u2018raw politics,\u2019 and a \u2018miscarriage of justice.'\"",
      "\"This statement is gratuitous and wrong,\" Weiss wrote in his report. \"Other presidents have pardoned family members, but in doing so, none have taken the occasion as an opportunity to malign the public servants at the Department of Justice based solely on false accusations.\"",
      "Weiss also pointed to a comment made by Judge Mark C. Scarsi, who said: \"The Constitution provides the President with broad authority to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 1, but nowhere does the Constitution give the President the authority to rewrite history.\"",
      "\"These prosecutions were the culmination of thorough, impartial investigations, not partisan politics,\" Weiss wrote in his report. \"Eight judges across numerous courts have rejected claims that they were the result of selective or vindictive motives.\"",
      "Weiss added: \"Calling those rulings into question and injecting partisanship into the independent administration of the law undermines the very foundation of what makes America's justice system fair and equitable. It erodes public confidence in an institution that is essential to preserving the rule of law.\"",
      "In another section of the report, Weiss notes that, in light of the presidential pardon, he \"cannot make any additional charging decisions\" and said it would be \"inappropriate\" to discuss \"whether additional charges are warranted.\"",
      "\"Politicians who attack the decisions of career prosecutors as politically motivated when they disagree with the outcome of a case undermine the public's confidence in our criminal justice system,\" Weiss wrote. \"The President's statements unfairly impugn the integrity not only of Department of Justice personnel, but all of the public servants making these difficult decisions in good faith.\"",
      "Weiss added: \"The President's characterizations are incorrect based on the facts in this case, and, on a more fundamental level, they are wrong.\"",

      "But last month, the president announced a blanket pardon that applies to any offenses against the U.S. that Hunter Biden \"has committed or may have committed\" from Jan. 1, 2014, to Dec. 1, 2024.",

      "\"From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department\u2019s decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted,\" Biden said. \"There has been an effort to break Hunter \u2014 who has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution. In trying to break Hunter, they\u2019ve tried to break me \u2014 and there\u2019s no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough.\"",
      "Biden added, \"I\u00a0hope Americans will understand why a father and a president would come to this decision.\"",
      "Late Monday, Hunter Biden's attorney, Abbe Lowell, issued a response to Weiss' report to Fox News: \"Like all his court filings, David Weiss\u2019 27-page report continues to ignore some of the major mysteries of his 7-year investigation. Mr. Weiss conveniently omits his proposal to resolve this investigation in 2023 with a pair of misdemeanors and a diverted gun charge recommended by career prosecutors. Mr. Weiss also fails to explain why he reneged on his own agreement, a reversal that came at the 11th hour in court as he and his office faced blistering attacks from Republicans and his then filing unprecedented charges for someone with no aggravating gun factors who had paid his taxes in full years before the charges were filed. Finally, and most curious, Mr. Weiss fails to clarify why he and his prosecutors pursued wild \u2013 and debunked \u2013 conspiracies about Mr. Biden by a Russian agent that prolonged this investigation and ultimately cost taxpayers millions of dollars. What is clear from this report is that the investigation into Hunter Biden is a cautionary tale of the abuse of prosecutorial power.\"",

A leading critic of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in the military, Hegseth has been under scrutiny in recent weeks over his qualifications.",
      "Fox News obtained copies of past performance evaluations describing Hegseth's \"outstanding\" leadership skills over the years of his military service, including deployments to Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, Iraq and Afghanistan.",
      "Hegseth deployed with the New Jersey National Guard to Guant\u00e1namo Bay, where he was leader of a 39-man Air Assault Infantry Rifle platoon capable of deploying anywhere within the world within 36 hours.",
      "In an officer evaluation report covering April 2005 to January 2006, Hegseth received \"outstanding performance\" and was described as \"an incredibly talented, battle-proven leader.\"",

      "Pete Hegseth in uniform. (Fox News)",
      "\"Having taken charge of his platoon mere days before deployment to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, he effectively led his platoon through five months of combat,\" the report read. \"He planned and executed platoon operations ranging from air assault raids to the defense of a forward operating base (FOB).\"",
      "During his tour as platoon leader, his evaluators said Hegseth ensured \"that his platoon remained physically fit and mentally ready to meet the challenges of protracted missions in demanding conditions.\"",
      "While serving at FOB Falcon, Iraq, Hegseth's platoon \"developed and fortified a platoon sector of the company defense and executed their portion of a continuous defense for three months while planning and executing additional offensive operations.\"",
      "Under his leadership, the report detailed, Hegseth's platoon \"cleared areas around FOB Falcon suspected of insurgent activity and denied their use to the Anti-Iraqi Forces\" and \"also conducted an air assault, high-value target raid in which they captured an Al Qaeda in Iraq cell leader.\" Hegseth and his troops moved north to Samarra, Iraq, where \"he effectively transitioned his platoon to continuous offensive operations and conducted nine days of continuous combat outposts, nine days of patrolling and a deliberate cordon and search plus numerous time-sensitive missions,\" the report read.",
      "\"His performance as platoon leader has been solid. He is more than capable to operate independently, controlling not only his squads but also air support, indirect fire support and other external combat support assets,\" his evaluators wrote.",

      "\"The last four years has been an absolute disaster for our military. Again, we have a lot of good people, a lot of good men and women that believe in the United States of America. But we got to go forward and we have to have a leader. It all starts with one person,\" Tuberville added. \"We don't need a general from the Pentagon. We've tried that. We need a drill sergeant, somebody that's been in two wars, somebody that understands camaraderie and team and work ethic and time, restraint and respect.\"",
      "\"I am strongly supporting Pete Hegseth for a couple of reasons. We have the most highly educated and powerful military in the history of the planet. And we haven't won a war in 80 years,\" Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis., said.",
      "In Iraq, Hegseth also served as an assistant civil military operations officer for a 660-man Air Assault Infantry Battalion. According to another report obtained by Fox News Digital, evaluators described him as \"an absolutely outstanding officer,\" who was \"intelligent, mature and extremely gifted\" and had become \"a tremendous asset to his battillion and had contributed immensely to the BN's performance during the past six months.\"",

      "\"His performance as the battalion assistant civil-military operations officer has been superb,\" the company executive officer wrote of Hegseth. \"He is a proven combat leader who is calm under fire and leads from the front.\"",
      "\"Peter is physically and mentally tough, and demonstrates a level of maturity, poise, and confidence usually found in more senior officers,\" the report went on.",
      "\"Peter always accomplishes every mission to high standards with minimal guidance or supervision. He has unlimited potential,\" the evaluator added.",
      "Hegseth similarly received glowing feedback when he later deployed to Afghanistan with the Minnesota Army National Guard, another officer evaluation report from 2012 showed.",
      "\"Outstanding performance. CPT Pete Hegseth is the best CPT in this command (#1 of 12),\" the report says. \"Pete clearly rose to the top of his peer group through his exceptional leadership abilities, initiative, and dedication to mission accomplishment. Pete worked extremely hard to learn as much as he could about counterinsurgency operations, easily developing into one of my best COIN instructors. He always received high marks on the end-of-course critiques.\"",
      "The report referenceed Hegseth's \"personal courage and selfless service\" during an October 2011 attack.",

      "German automaker Volkswagen isn't having a great time. The company is planning to cut capacity at five factories, reducing production by about 700,000 vehicles, while also laying off more than 35,000 workers in its home country. Now, reports suggest the company had a massive data leak at its subsidiary software company Cariad, which exposed personal data, including geolocation data, of around 800,000 EV owners online and accessible for months. Such information could be valuable to criminals for extortion purposes. What's interesting is that a hacker association informed the company about this data leak after receiving a tip from an anonymous hacker.",

      "What you need to know about the data leak",
      "As reported by Germany\u2019s Der Spiegel magazine, Volkswagen is facing a major data security issue after movement data from 800,000 electric cars and the personal contact information of their owners were left exposed on the internet. This data revealed sensitive details, such as the precise locations where cars were parked, including private locations like people\u2019s homes, government buildings and even questionable spots like brothels.",
      "The exposed data includes detailed movement patterns of these vehicles, allowing for the creation of comprehensive profiles of individuals' daily activities. This could be particularly concerning for public figures or anyone with privacy concerns.",
      "Several car brands under the Volkswagen group, including VW, Audi, Seat and Skoda, were affected by the breach, which exposed sensitive data across multiple countries. The information was stored on Amazon cloud servers without adequate protection, leaving it vulnerable for months before the issue was discovered.",
      "For around 466,000 of the 800,000 affected vehicles, the location data was detailed enough to map out drivers\u2019 daily routines. Spiegel reported that the list of affected users included German politicians, business leaders, the entire EV fleet used by Hamburg police and even suspected intelligence agents.",
      "The breach came to light when an anonymous hacker tipped off the Chaos Computer Club. While Volkswagen left the data easily accessible during this time, there is no indication so far that anyone misused or accessed it maliciously.",
      "We reached out to Volkswagen for comment but did not hear back by our deadline.",

      "How can this data leak affect you?",
      "The Volkswagen data leak is more than just a tech issue. It is a real concern for anyone who values their privacy. With precise location data out in the open, someone could figure out where you live, work or spend your free time. This information could be misused in many ways, from targeted scams where hackers pretend to be Volkswagen or its partners to trick you into giving up sensitive information, to more personal threats like stalking or harassment.",
      "Imagine someone knowing your daily routine or identifying places you visit that you would prefer to keep private. Visits to clinics, legal offices or other sensitive locations could expose you to embarrassment or blackmail.",
      "The breach also raises concerns for business leaders, government officials and military personnel as their movements linked to high-security or restricted areas could be exposed, increasing the risk of corporate espionage or national security threats. Moreover, when paired with other vulnerabilities, such as app credentials, hackers could potentially exploit the data to unlock or even control vehicles remotely.",

      "1) Check your app settings:\u00a0Review the permissions and data-sharing settings in your car's companion app. Disable features that track or share your location if they are not essential for your use. Regularly update the app to ensure you have the latest security patches.",
      "2) Be alert to scams:\u00a0Keep an eye out for suspicious emails, messages or calls pretending to be from Volkswagen or related services. Avoid clicking on links or sharing sensitive information without verifying the sender.",
      "3) Consider data opt-out options:\u00a0Many vehicles with online features allow you to limit or disable certain data-sharing functionalities. Check your car\u2019s settings to reduce the amount of personal data being collected.",
      "4) Strengthen your online accounts:\u00a0If you use the same email or password across multiple accounts, update them immediately. Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication wherever possible to add an extra layer of security to your accounts.",
      "5) Beware of snail mail scams: While most people focus on digital threats, physical mail scams can also follow a data breach like this. If your contact information was exposed, you might receive fraudulent letters pretending to be from Volkswagen or related services. These could ask for payments, personal details or even encourage you to visit fake websites.",
      "6) Install strong antivirus software: Ensure that you have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices, especially those connected to your vehicle or its apps. This can help protect you from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Volkswagen data leak is a glaring example of how companies need to take user data security more seriously. Exposing personal details and precise locations is not just a technical mistake. It is a massive breach of trust. While VW has patched the issue, the damage shows how important it is for businesses to be more responsible with the data they collect. People deserve to know their information is safe and used only when necessary. If companies cannot protect their customers\u2019 privacy, they risk losing their confidence altogether. It is time for the industry to step up and do better.",

It works like spyware, keeping an eye on what you do on your Android phone, such as reading your notifications, messages, clipboard content and more.",
      "Hackers are spreading FireScam by pretending it\u2019s a premium version of Telegram. They\u2019ve created a fake website on GitHub that looks like RuStore (a real app store in Russia). When people visit this fake site, they\u2019re tricked into downloading an app that looks like \"Telegram Premium.\" However, this app is actually a trap. Once installed, it downloads the FireScam malware onto your device and starts stealing your personal data.",
      "To avoid detection, the app is heavily disguised using a tool called DexGuard. It asks for permissions to access your storage, check installed apps and install more software. When you open the app, it shows a fake login page that looks like Telegram\u2019s. If you enter your details, it steals your credentials.",
      "The stolen data is first stored in a Firebase Realtime Database, but hackers later move it to private servers. The malware also registers each compromised device with a unique ID so hackers can keep track of their victims.",

      "6 ways to stay safe from fake apps",
      "1. Download apps only from official stores:\u00a0Always use trusted app stores like Google Play or the Apple App Store to download apps. These platforms have security measures to detect and remove fake or harmful apps. Avoid downloading apps from random websites, pop-up ads or unofficial third-party stores as these are common sources of fake apps.",
      "2. Verify the app\u2019s developer:\u00a0Before installing an app, check who created it. Look at the developer's name and ensure it matches the official company behind the app. Fake apps often copy the names of popular apps but use slightly altered spellings or extra characters. For example, a fake might be called \"PayPaal\" instead of \"PayPal.\"",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Pay attention to reviews and ratings:\u00a0Reviews and ratings can give you insight into an app's authenticity. If an app has mostly negative reviews, very few downloads or generic comments like \"Great app,\" it could be fake. Genuine apps typically have a large number of detailed reviews over time. Be cautious of apps with five-star ratings but no specific feedback.",
      "4. Be cautious of app permissions:\u00a0Check the permissions the app requests before installing. A flashlight app, for example, shouldn\u2019t need access to your contacts or messages. If an app is asking for permissions that don\u2019t align with its purpose, it could be a red flag. Always deny permissions that seem excessive or unnecessary.",
      "5. Keep your phone and apps updated:\u00a0Regular updates for your operating system and apps often include important security fixes that protect your device from malware. Turning on automatic updates can ensure you always have the latest protections.",
      "6. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Install strong antivirus software on your Android. These tools can scan apps for malware, detect suspicious activity and block harmful downloads. Strong antivirus software provides an extra layer of defense, especially when browsing or downloading apps. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "The FireScam malware is a powerful tool that can steal everything on your phone, and it\u2019s tough to detect if you're not careful. Such apps can\u2019t be distributed through legitimate app stores like the Play Store or the App Store, so they rely on third-party stores and fake websites to spread. To stay safe, the best approach is to stick to verified app stores and avoid downloading from untrustworthy sources.",

      "A BREAKTHROUGH GADGET COULD HELP YOU DETECT MICROPLASTICS IN YOUR DRINKING WATER",

      "The floating solar still operates through an elegantly simple yet highly effective process. First, ocean water is drawn up to the device's foam surface through a wicking system. Once the water reaches the surface, it is evaporated by solar-heated plasmonic materials. As the water vapor rises, the salt is left behind, ensuring that only purified water is collected. The vapor then recondenses on a clear plastic dome situated above the device. Finally, the purified water is funneled down the sides of the dome and collected in a sealed bag for easy access.",
      "The results of this process are impressive. In real-world tests conducted in Halifax Harbour, the device produced up to 0.97 gallons of clean water daily, which was a record-breaking yield for passive floating solar stills.",

    "published": "Wed, 08 Jan 2025 09:00:06 -0500",
    "summary": "Tech expert Kurt \u201cCyberGuy&quot; Knutsson says business email compromise scams are a serious threat, as shown by Teresa W.&apos;s near loss of thousands of dollars.",
    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says business email compromise scams are a serious threat.",
      "With our lives so intertwined with digital communication these days, the threat of email fraud is something we all need to take seriously. Recently, Teresa W. shared a scary experience that underscores the dangers of business email compromise (BEC).",
      "\"I almost lost many thousands of dollars through an internet fraud scam. I got a call from our personal banker who said she saw nearly all the money in our business account being withdrawn. She said she got an email from me along with the money wiring directions. I told her I didn't send that and she said my email came from me directly to her. I said to stop everything and I will get to the bottom of it.",
      "\"Apparently the thieves got hold of a wiring instruction paper from my email, which they hacked into. They created a rule in Outlook to bypass me if anything came from them and go straight to the banker. They changed the wiring instructions to go into their account but thank goodness our banker alerted me so I could get to the bottom of it. Too close for comfort!\"",
      "This incident highlights a sophisticated scam where cybercriminals gain access to legitimate email accounts and use them to deceive others into transferring funds. Teresa\u2019s quick action, combined with her banker's vigilance, prevented a significant financial loss, but it serves as a wake-up call for many businesses.",

      "\"You\u2019ve been hacked!\" written on a laptop home screen. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is business email compromise (BEC)?",
      "Business email compromise (BEC) is a form of cybercrime that targets companies engaged in wire transfer payments and other financial transactions. The FBI reports that BEC scams have caused billions in losses globally. These scams exploit human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities, making them particularly insidious.",
      "A hacker at work. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HERE\u2019S WHAT RUTHLESS HACKERS STOLE FROM 110 MILLION AT&T CUSTOMERS",
      "How the scam works",
      "Email hacking: Scammers often gain access to email accounts through\u00a0phishing attacks, where they trick users into revealing their login credentials or by deploying malware that captures sensitive information.",
      "Email rule creation: Once inside the account, scammers can create rules in email clients like Outlook that redirect or hide specific emails. This means that any communication related to fraudulent activities may go unnoticed by the victim.",
      "Impersonation: The scammer impersonates the victim and sends emails to contacts, such as banks or vendors, requesting urgent wire transfers or sensitive information.",
      "Execution: The scammer provides convincing details and urgency in their requests, making it appear as though the email is genuinely from the victim. They may use specific language or references only known to the victim and their contacts.",
      "A hacker at work. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "BEWARE OF ENCRYPTED PDFS AS THE LATEST TRICK TO DELIVER MALWARE TO YOU",
      "Real-life implications",
      "The consequences of BEC scams can be devastating for businesses. In addition to direct financial losses, companies may face reputational damage, loss of customer trust and potential legal ramifications. For small businesses like Teresa's, which may not have extensive cybersecurity measures in place, the impact can be particularly severe.",
      "Illustration of security on a computer. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "WHAT TO DO IF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS HACKED",
      "Proactive steps to avoid being a victim of BEC scams",
      "To combat BEC and similar scams, businesses must adopt a proactive approach to cybersecurity.",
      "1) Have strong antivirus software: Use reputable, up-to-date, strong antivirus software to check your system. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Use strong passwords:\u00a0Ensure passwords are complex (a mix of letters, numbers and symbols) and unique for each account.\u00a0Make sure to create strong, unique passwords. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "3) Enable two-factor authentication: Where possible, enable multifactor authentication.\u00a0This adds an extra layer of security to your accounts.",
      "4) Monitor your accounts: Keep an eye on your financial accounts, email accounts and social media for any unusual activity. If you think scammers have stolen your identity, consider identity theft protection here.",
      "Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "One of the best parts of using some services is that they might include identity theft insurance of\u00a0up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white-glove fraud resolution team where a\u00a0U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "5) Invest in personal data removal services: Using a data removal service can be an effective additional step to protect your personal information after a potential BEC scam. These services locate and remove your information from various online platforms, databases and data brokers. By eliminating unnecessary or outdated information, data removal services minimize your online presence, making it harder for scammers to find and exploit your data.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6) Regularly update security questions: Change security questions and answers periodically to enhance protection.",
      "7) Regularly review email rules: Check for unauthorized changes in email settings that could indicate compromise.",
      "8) Disable auto-forwarding: Unless absolutely necessary, turn off auto-forwarding features to prevent sensitive information from being sent elsewhere without your knowledge.",
      "9) Verify requests: Always verify any financial requests through a secondary communication method (e.g., a phone call) before proceeding with transactions.",
      "10) Limit access: Restrict access to financial information and transactions only to those who need it within your organization.",
      "11) Contact professionals: If you\u2019re unsure about any steps or if the situation seems severe, consider reaching out to a professional IT service.",
      "12) Report the incident: Report the scam to your local authorities and the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission in the U.S.",
      "13) Create alias email addresses: My top recommendation to avoid being inundated with spam emails is to use an\u00a0alias email address.\u00a0An alias email address is an additional email address that can be used to receive emails in the same mailbox as the primary email address. It acts as a forwarding address, directing emails to the primary email address.",
      "In addition to creating throwaway email accounts for online sign-ups and other circumstances where you would not want to disclose your primary email address, alias email addresses are helpful for handling and organizing incoming communications.",
      "Sometimes, it's best to create various email aliases so that you don't have to worry about getting tons of spam mail and having your email eventually stolen in a data breach. An alias email address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address.\u00a0See my review of the best secure and private email services here.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The story shared by Teresa W. serves as a crucial reminder of the vulnerabilities inherent in our digital communications.

It charges your devices while you're chilling outdoors. What makes it special? Perovskite solar cells that are seriously impressive. These cells are about 30% more powerful than traditional solar cells in bright sunlight and perform twice as well in low light. The umbrella can pump out 80 watts of power through USB-C and even has an XT-60 connection to power things like Anker's new EverFrost electric cooler. So you could literally keep your drinks cold and your phone charged at the same time. While they haven't announced the price yet, you can expect to see this tech to hit stores sometime in spring or summer.",

      "Artronic just unveiled Komutr, a super-slim set of wireless earbuds with a genius magnetic charging case that attaches right to compatible phones, chargers and accessories. The charging case is just 0.47 inches thick and is designed to stick to the back of your MagSafe-compatible phone. No more digging through bags or forgetting your earbuds at home.

These earbuds pack some serious battery power, up to 10 hours of listening time per charge and a total of 30 hours when you include the charging case. For those without MagSafe phones, Artronic promises \"adjustable options,\" but let's be real: The magnetic attachment is where the magic happens. Want to get your hands on these? Mark your calendar for January 15th when preorders open. The Komutr will start shipping in May and will set you back $129.

Well, Samsung's got your back with Samsung Food, a mind-blowing TV feature that uses AI to recognize dishes on screen and instantly serve up their recipes faster than you can say \"bon app\u00e9tit.\" The tech isn't just about recipes. Samsung Food can track your grocery deliveries, build shopping lists from your fridge contents and even suggest meal plans. Samsung's calling it the \"ultimate AI sous chef,\" and honestly, they might be onto something. Sure, the AI won't actually cook for you (bummer, right?). But for wannabe home chefs who get inspired by every cooking show and movie, this could be a total game-changer. Just don't blame Samsung if you end up spending more time watching cooking shows than actually cooking. Of course, you'll need a 2025 Samsung TV to access this culinary magic. Samsung Food will be available on the QN90F, QN80F and QN70F model TVs.",

      "A 42-year-old Texas consultant named Shamsud-Din Jabbar drove through a crowd of New Year's revelers in New Orleans as they celebrated the beginning of 2025 \u2014 flying an ISIS flag from the hitch of his rented pickup while killing 14 and injuring another 30.",
      "On the 350-mile drive from Houston to the Big Easy, Jabbar recorded selfie videos declaring his allegiance to ISIS and saying he initially planned to kill his own friends and family but decided on attacking innocent members of the public in order to attract more attention to what he called a \"war between the believers and the disbelievers,\" according to the FBI.",
      "He was a U.S. Army veteran and had a lucrative job at a major consulting firm, but he brought a pair of IEDs and two firearms with him to attack civilians \u2014 allegedly radicalized in just weeks. And authorities are warning of similar lone wolf attacks and how deadly they can be, as New Orleans officials work to bolster security following the ramming attack on its iconic, pedestrian-packed Bourbon Street.",
      "\"ISIS and others are back,\" James Jay Carafano, an expert on national security and foreign policy, warned in a recent Fox News op-ed. \"Biden's humiliating withdrawal from Afghanistan reignited the hope that America really was the paper tiger that Usama Bin Laden claimed we were.\"",
      "NEW ORLEANS TERRORIST RADICALIZED BY ISIS ONLINE WITHIN WEEKS, FBI DIRECTOR SAYS",
      "The FBI released photos of surveillance footage that shows Shamsud-Din Jabbar an hour before he drove a truck down Bourbon Street, New Orleans, early Jan. 1, 2025. (Federal Bureau of Investigation via AP)",
      "Although the shockingly violent group's \"territorial caliphate\" was destroyed during the first Trump administration, its propagandists continue to encourage and radicalize potential terrorists. Jabbar, in one of his videos, declared that he had \"joined ISIS before this summer,\" FBI Deputy Assistant Director Christopher Raia told reporters in a news briefing.",
      "\"The threats from international terrorism, domestic terrorism, and state-sponsored terrorism are complex and persistent \u2014 and notably, they are all simultaneously elevated,\" Raia said. \"We continually face threats from foreign terrorist organizations, violent extremists across the ideological spectrum, and criminal actors that aim to bring violence to the United States.\"",

      "Jabbar traveled to Cairo, Egypt, from June 22 to July 3, 2023, then returned to the U.S. In a separate trip on July 10, 2023, he traveled to Ontario, Canada, and returned to the U.S. a few days later, the FBI said during a press conference. It was unclear whether the visit was connected to the attack, but Raia said the Bureau is investigating whether Jabbar had any associates in the U.S. or overseas.",
      "BODY LANGUAGE EXPERT SAYS NEW ORLEANS ATTACKER EXHIBITED \u2018RED FLAGS\u2019 BEFORE ATTACK",
      "Investigators said they are still looking into how and why Jabbar became radicalized. In an interview with \"60 Minutes\" over the weekend, FBI Director Christopher Wray said he believes the killer was inspired by ISIS content he found on the internet.",
      "Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a suspect in the New Orleans attack, is seen in this picture obtained from social media, released in November 2013, in Fort Johnson (formerly Fort Polk), Louisiana, U.S. (1st Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division via Facebook via REUTERS)",
      "\"[Jabbar] appears to have been inspired \u2014 from afar \u2014 by ISIS, and it is, in many ways, the most challenging type of terrorist threat we face,\" Wray told the interviewer, Scott Pelley. \"You're talking about guys like this, who radicalize not in years but in weeks, and whose method of attack is still very deadly but fairly crude. And if you think about that old saying about connecting the dots, there are not a lot of dots out there to connect. And there's very little time in which to connect them.\"",
      "WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT VICTIMS OF NEW ORLEANS TERRORIST ATTACK",
      "Wray is warning that lone wolf attacks are a major priority for the FBI and began warning of an elevated threat more than a year ago.",
      "The New York Times earlier this month noted that the way Jabbar flew his flag, from the trailer hitch in the back of his rented Ford F-150 EV, was the same as in an ISIS propaganda poster uncovered by the Daily Mail, in 2017.",

      "A year earlier, an ISIS-inspired terrorist drove a truck into Bastille Day celebrations in Nice, France, killing 84.",
      "Older terror groups, like Al-Qaeda, focused on highly planned attacks on a global scale, like Sept. 11, 2001, an earlier attack on the World Trade Center with a car bomb in 1993, according to Paul Mauro, a former NYPD inspector. ISIS promoted a shift toward small but brutal attacks that could be perpetrated anywhere around the globe.",
      "\"You didn\u2019t have to take down the Brooklyn Bridge. You were a lion of Islam if you stabbed your neighbor because he was an apostate,\" he said.",

A smaller version of the festival, called Ardh Kumbh, or Half Kumbh, was organized in 2019, when 240 million visitors were recorded, with about 50 million taking a ritual bath on the busiest day.",

That is around 200 times the 2 million pilgrims that arrived in the Muslim holy cities of Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia for the annual Hajj pilgrimage last year.",

      "Risch has held out that the situation in Sudan has been catastrophic for well over a year, and called into question the timing of Blinken\u2019s declaration. In a statement earlier this week, he wrote, \"It has been nearly a year since I introduced a resolution calling the atrocities in Sudan what they are: a genocide.

    "published": "Fri, 10 Jan 2025 06:21:17 -0500",
    "summary": "The Lebanese parliament finally voted on a new president on Thursday following two years of deadlock. Joseph Aoun the head of the country&apos;s armed forces won a majority of the votes.",
    "story": [
      "Israel Defense Forces Spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari says Hezbollah was planning to use bunker to stage attack on Israel. (Credit: IDF)",
      "Lebanon\u2019s political landscape has undergone a dramatic shift with the election of Joseph Aoun as president. After more than two years of political deadlock, the Lebanese Parliament elected the army commander on Thursday with 99 out of 128 votes.",
      "Aoun\u2019s election represents a significant achievement for the anti-Hezbollah camp, reflecting the weakening influence of the powerful Shia terrorist organization within Lebanon\u2019s political system. Despite this, experts say Hezbollah remains a formidable force in the country, and the challenges Aoun faces in balancing Lebanon's internal politics and foreign relations remain immense.",
      "For much of the past two years, Hezbollah worked tirelessly to block any movement toward the election of a new president. The group had strongly opposed Aoun\u2019s candidacy. However, as the political situation evolved and the ousting of Assad from Syria unfolded, Hezbollah was ultimately forced to accept Aoun, who secured the presidency.",
      "\"Hezbollah had been opposed to his election for the last two and a half years and had blocked any process toward electing a president for all that time. Now, they\u2019ve voted for him in the second round, which indicates they are in a bind, that they are weaker, and their leverage is not what it was,\" Vice President for International Engagement at the Middle East Institute Paul Salem told Fox News Digital.",

      "Newly-elected Lebanese President Joseph Aoun reviews the honor guard upon his arrival at the Lebanese Parliament to be sworn in as the new president in Beirut on Thursday, Jan. 9, 2025. (AP Photo/Hussein Malla)",
      "Salem points to the broader shift in regional politics, notably the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria, which has left Hezbollah increasingly isolated. \"They are now not only cut off from Iran, but they're also isolated in the region. They're the only Shiite community between here and Basra, and it\u2019s a Sunni takeover of Damascus, which used to be dominated by a friendly Alawite, pro-Iranian regime. It\u2019s a huge historic shift that leaves the Shiites and Hezbollah deeply isolated. Hezbollah\u2019s future is worse than its present,\" he added.",
      "The U.S. and Israel, along with other Western and Arab powers, have long sought to distance Lebanon from Hezbollah\u2019s influence, and Aoun\u2019s election could be a step in that direction.",
      "Aoun, a Maronite Christian and the commander of the Lebanese army, took office with a strong message focused on Lebanon\u2019s sovereignty. In his inaugural speech, he emphasized the necessity for the state to have a monopoly on the use of force.",
      "David Schenker, former head of the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs at the U.S. State Department under the first Trump administration, remarked that Aoun\u2019s speech was both a positive and pragmatic step for Lebanon. \"He talked about disarming all groups and ensuring that weapons are under the control of the state,\" Schenker said. \"This was a good move, as it shows a commitment to sovereignty and the rule of law.\"",

      "An updated graphic detailing the members of Hezbollah's leadership who have been eliminated by the Israeli Defense Forces. (IDF Spokesman's Unit)",
      "However, Schenker, who is currently the Taube Senior Fellow at The Washington Institute and director of the Linda and Tony Rubin Program on Arab Politics, cautioned that Aoun\u2019s position as president does not grant him absolute power in Lebanon\u2019s political system. \"The president is not the most powerful position in Lebanon. The key position will be the prime minister. It remains to be seen whether Aoun will show the same courage in his new role that he demonstrated as chief of staff,\" Schenker noted.",
      "Though Hezbollah has been militarily weakened by recent Israeli campaigns and the assassination of its leader Hassan Nasrallah, among other key leaders, it still retains significant influence, particularly in southern Lebanon. However, Schenker says the organization\u2019s ability to intimidate Lebanon\u2019s population is diminishing. \"Hezbollah isn\u2019t the force it was. It can still reactivate its killing machine if needed, but it no longer dominates the way it did before,\" he said.",
      "\"Hezbollah has calculated that they\u2019ve lost this battle against Israel, and then they lost another battle in Syria. So their interest now is to lay low, have a president and government that\u2019s acceptable to the U.S. and the region, which, at the end of the day, they hope will protect them from any further Israeli incursions and help their people,\" Salem explained. \"They need a functioning government to secure international aid for the millions displaced by their actions in southern Lebanon. It\u2019s about survival for them, not just politically, but financially.\"",

      "Aoun\u2019s election is not only significant for Hezbollah\u2019s position in Lebanon, but also for the country\u2019s relations with external powers like the U.S. and Israel. Lebanon has faced economic collapse, with its currency devalued by over 99%, and nearly 80% of the population now living below the poverty line. Hezbollah\u2019s previous resistance to international pressure now seems less tenable.",
      "The U.S. has long supported Lebanon\u2019s military and is expected to strengthen its ties with Aoun, given his role in the army and his pro-sovereignty stance. Schenker said that Lebanon\u2019s future alignment with the U.S. and regional allies such as Saudi Arabia could provide the country with much-needed international support.",

      "\"The U.S. military has been close to the Lebanese military for many years,\" Salem told Fox News Digital. \"That has been the strongest link between the U.S. and Lebanon. So to have the head of the military come to power, he\u2019s a known figure in Washington. He\u2019s known to the military, and now, he\u2019s known to the diplomats and politicians, and will be known to President Trump and others over time. This realignment could put Lebanon on a much more natural path of cooperation with the U.S., Saudi Arabia, and other regional allies.\"",
      "Israel will also be closely monitoring Aoun\u2019s presidency. Schenker said that Aoun\u2019s commitment to U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which calls for disarmament in southern Lebanon, could lead to a more cooperative stance from Lebanon toward Israel. \"Israel will be invested in Lebanon\u2019s implementation of 1701,\" Schenker said. \"Aoun\u2019s stance will influence Israel\u2019s position toward Lebanon, as the Trump administration has clearly signaled a desire to end the wars in the region.\"",

      "Aides to Venezuela opposition leader Maria Corina Machado said she was detained Thursday, followed moments later by official denials, in a confusing episode that capped a day of protests seeking to block President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from clinging to power.",
      "It's not clear exactly what transpired after Machado bid farewell to hundreds of supporters, hopped on a motorcycle and raced with her security convoy through the empty streets of eastern Caracas to an undisclosed location.",
      "At 3:21 p.m. local time, Machado\u2019s press team said in a social media post that security forces \"violently intercepted\" her convoy. Her aides later confirmed to The Associated Press that the opposition hardliner had been detained, and international condemnation immediately poured from leaders in Latin America and beyond demanding her release.",
      "But about an hour later, a 20-second video of Machado was posted online by a Maduro supporter in which the opposition leader said she was followed after leaving the rally and that she had dropped her purse. \"I'm good, I'm safe,\" Machado said in a raspy voice, adding \"Venezuela will be free.\"",
      "THOUSANDS OF VENEZUELAN OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS TAKE TO THE STREETS AHEAD OF MADURO'S THIRD INAUGURATION",
      "Her aides later said in a social media post that the proof-of-of-life video message had been coerced, and that after recording it she was freed. They said she would provide details of her \"kidnapping\" later.",
      "Meanwhile, Maduro supporters denied that she was detained and gloated that government opponents were trying to spread fake news to generate an international crisis. \"Nobody should be surprised,\" Communications Minister Freddy Nanez said. \"Especially since it's coming from the fascists, who were the architects of the dirty trick.\"",
      "Earlier Thursday, Machado addressed hundreds of supporters who heeded her call to take to the streets a day before the ruling party-controlled National Assembly was scheduled to swear in Maduro to a third six-year term despite credible evidence that he lost the presidential election.",
      "\"They wanted us to fight each other, but Venezuela is united, we are not afraid,\" Machado shouted from atop a truck in the capital minutes before she was reported detained.",
      "Machado, 57, is a hardliner former lawmaker who stayed and fought against Maduro even after many of her allies in the opposition leadership fled, joining an exodus of some 7 million Venezuelans who\u2019ve abandoned their homeland in recent years.",
      "Loyalists who control the country's judiciary banned her from running against Maduro last year. In a deft move, she backed an unknown outsider \u2014 retired diplomat Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez \u2014 who crushed Maduro by a more than two-to-one margin, according to voting machine records collected by the opposition and validated by international observers.",

      "Gonz\u00e1lez, invoking the title of president-elect recognized by the U.S. and other countries, was among those who demanded Machado's release in the immediate aftermath of what was believed to be her shock arrest.",
      "\"To the security forces, I warn you: don't play with fire,\" he said in a social media post from the Dominican Republic, where he met with President Luis Abinader and a delegation of former presidents from across Latin America.",
      "There was a relatively small turnout for Thursday's protests as riot police were deployed in force. Venezuelans who\u2019ve witnessed Maduro\u2019s security forces round up scores of opponents and regular bystanders since the July election were reluctant to mobilize in the same numbers as they have in the past.",
      "\"Of course, there\u2019s fewer people,\" said empanada vendor Miguel Contrera as National Guard soldiers carrying riot shields buzzed by on motorcycles. \"There\u2019s fear.\"",
      "Those demonstrators that did show up blocked a main avenue in one opposition stronghold. Many were senior citizens and dressed in red, yellow and blue, answering Machado\u2019s call to wear the colors of the Venezuelan flag. All repudiated Maduro and said they would recognize Gonz\u00e1lez as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate president.",
      "The deployment of security forces as well as pro-government armed groups known as \"colectivos\" to intimidate opponents betrays a deep insecurity on the part of Maduro, said Javier Corrales, a Latin America expert at Amherst College.",
      "Since the elections, the government has arrested more than 2,000 people \u2014 including as many as 10 Americans and other foreigners \u2014 who it claims have been plotting to oust Maduro and sow chaos in the oil rich South American nation. This week alone, masked gunmen arrested a former presidential candidate, a prominent free speech activist and even Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s son-in-law as he was taking his young children to school.",
      "\"It\u2019s an impressive show of force but it\u2019s also a sign of weakness,\" said Corrales, who co-authored this month an article, \"How Maduro Stole Venezuela\u2019s Vote,\" in the Journal of Democracy.",
      "\"Maduro is safe in office,\" said Corrales, \"but he and his allies recognize they are moving forward with a big lie and have no other way to justify what they are doing except by relying on the military.\"",
      "Venezuela\u2019s National Electoral Council, also stacked with government loyalists, declared Maduro the winner of the election. But unlike in previous contests, authorities did not provide any access to voting records or precinct-level results.",
      "The opposition, however, collected tally sheets from 85% of electronic voting machines and posted them online. They showed that its candidate, Gonz\u00e1lez, had thrashed Maduro by a more than two-to-one margin. Experts from the United Nations and the Atlanta-based Carter Center, both invited by Maduro\u2019s government to observe the election, have said the tally sheets published by the opposition are legitimate.",
      "The U.S. and other governments have also recognized Gonz\u00e1lez as Venezuela\u2019s president-elect. Even many of Maduro\u2019s former leftist allies in Latin America plan to skip Friday\u2019s swearing-in ceremony.",

      "President Joe Biden, meeting Gonz\u00e1lez at the White House this week, praised the previously unknown retired diplomat for having \"inspired millions.\"",

      "\"Rules are rules and there are no exceptions,\" V\u00e1squez Morales reportedly added. \"We cannot discriminate for the Chinese, or the Americans, or anyone else. This will violate the neutrality treaty, international law, and it will lead to chaos.\"",
      "In the 1970s, then-President Jimmy Carter negotiated what became known as the Torrijos-Carter Treaties, which agreed the U.S. could use military force to defend the waterway against any threat to its \"neutrality.\" That aspect was considered crucial for the U.S. at the time amid the threat of Soviet-aligned states.

We didn't give it to China. And they've abused it. They've abused that gift. It should have never been made.\"",

But if you remember, nobody wants to talk about the Panama Canal because, you know, it's inappropriate, I guess.

    "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2025 07:25:05 GMT",
    "summary": "The Justice Department early Tuesday sent members of Congress a section of special counsel Jack Smith's report summarizing his investigation into President-elect Donald Trump's efforts to maintain power after he lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden that culminated in the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump \"inspired his supporters to commit acts of physical violence\" on Jan. 6 and knowingly spread an objectively false narrative about election fraud in the 2020 election, special counsel Jack Smith said in a report defending his investigation made public early Tuesday.",
      "The 170-page report summarized Smith's investigation into Trump's efforts to maintain power after he lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden, which culminated in the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Smith's office conducted interviews with more than 250 individuals in connection with the investigation and federal grand jurors heard testimony from more than 55 witnesses as part of the probe.",
      "Smith has been the subject of unending criticism by Trump, whose allies have suggested the special counsel should now face criminal charges, and he used the report to deliver a full-throated defense of his decision to bring charges.",
      "\"To all who know me well, the claim from Mr. Trump that my decisions as a prosecutor were influenced or directed by the Biden administration or other political actors is, in a word, laughable,\" Smith wrote.",
      "If it wasn't for Trump's election in November that prevented the prosecution from moving forward, the case would have ended in the president-elect's conviction, he wrote.",
      "\u201cIndeed, but for\u00a0Mr.\u00a0Trump\u2019s election and imminent return to the Presidency, the Office assessed that the admissible evidence was sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction at trial,\" Smith's report stated.",
      "Trump criticized the report on his website Truth Social, pointing out that it was released at 1 a.m. and repeating false claims about the House committee that investigated Jan. 6.",
      "\"Jack is a lamebrain prosecutor who was unable to get his case tried before the Election,\" Trump wrote.",
      "The report brings to an end a chapter in American history in which  a former president was indicted on federal charges for the first time, only to go on and be re-elected and who, in a few days, will return to power. Trump fought to keep the report secret, but his last-minute requests to prohibit the release were refused.",
      "Smith\u2019s report said that Trump\u2019s actions, resulting in the interruption of America\u2019s record of peaceful transfers of power, were without historical comparison and that Trump\u2019s \u201cpolitical and financial status\u201d as well as \u201cthe prospect of his future election to the presidency\u201d made the investigation more challenging.",
      "Trump\u2019s \u201cability and willingness to use his influence and following on social media to target witnesses, courts, and Department employees\u201d was a \u201csignificant challenge\u201d for the office, causing the special counsel to \u201cengage in time-consuming litigation to protect witnesses from threats and harassment,\u201d the report said.",
      "He pointed to Trump's continued praise of Jan. 6 rioters as further evidence that the president-elect had intended to incite the attack.",
      "\"He has called them \u2018patriots\u2019 and \u2018hostages,\u2019 reminisced about January 6 as a \u2018beautiful day,\u2019 and championed the \u2018January 6 Choir,\u2019 a group of January 6 defendants who, because of their dangerousness, are detained at the District of Columbia jail,\" Smith wrote.",
      "The report says that Trump spread voter fraud claims that were \"demonstrably and, in many cases, obviously false\" and that Smith's office determined that \"Trump knew that there was no outcome-determinative fraud in the 2020 election, that many of the specific claims that he made were untrue, and that he had lost the election.\"",
      "Smith pointed to testimony that Trump privately admitted to losing, including telling an aide after watching Biden speak, \"can you believe I lost to this f\u2019ing guy?\u201d",
      "Smith, who resigned Friday, also wrote a second volume focused on separate charges brought against Trump over his handling of classified documents, but that part of the report was not released because charges against two of Trump's co-defendants are still pending.",
      "Smith's report stated that prosecutors would have been able to  show that Trump decided before the election that he would allege fraud whether it occurred or not, and that after he lost he \"adhered to that plan \u2014 repeating false claims that he knew to be untrue.\"",
      "Trump, who was separately convicted of 34 felonies in connection with hush money payments to an adult film star during his 2016 campaign, had denied wrongdoing in connection with the effort to overturn the 2020 election. A federal grand jury indicted Trump on four felony charges \u2014 conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding and conspiracy against rights \u2014 related to Jan. 6 and the efforts leading up to it. Under long-standing Justice Department policy that prevents a sitting president from being prosecuted, the charges were dropped upon Trump's victory in November.",
      "Smith wrote in his report that his office also considered charging Trump under the Insurrection Act, but ultimately concluded that it would be difficult to prove given the complicated legal definitions of \u201cinsurrection\u201d and whether incitement had occurred.",
      "Smith also provided little details about the six unindicted co-conspirators who were included in the original indictment. He did not name them, saying the report should not be seen as exonerating them. He did, however, reveal that while continuing to investigate co-conspirators, the special counsel referred to a U.S. attorney's office that \"an investigative subject may have committed unrelated crimes.\"",
      "While Trump has never publicly conceded that he knew he lost the 2020 election, a federal grand jury said the false claims he spread were \"unsupported, objectively unreasonable, and ever-changing.\"",
      "The delay strategy that Trump's legal team used ultimately allowed him to avoid trial before American voters elected him again last year and resulted in a Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity that will grant him wider latitude when he returns to office.",
      "The report was released as Trump says he is preparing to pardon an untold number of Jan. 6 defendants. More than 1,580 defendants have been charged and more than 1,270 have been convicted on charges ranging from unlawful parading to seditious conspiracy. More than 700 defendants have either already completed their sentences or were never sentenced to any period of incarceration in the first place. Asked whether he could pardon rioters who committed violence against police officers, Trump did not rule it out.",
      "Among those seeking pardons is former Proud Boys chairman Enrique Tarrio, who was found guilty of seditious conspiracy\u00a0in 2023 and sentenced to 22 years in federal prison, the longest sentence given to any Jan. 6 defendant. Vice President-elect JD Vance said over the weekend that those who committed violence should \"obviously\" not be pardoned. The mother of one Jan. 6 rioter who was shot and killed during the attack said she received a call last week from Trump, who told Jan. 6 defendants to \"keep their chins up.\""

      "Special counsel David Weiss said in the report that the president could not \"rewrite history,\" suggesting that Biden's criticism of the case against his last surviving son when he announced his pardon decision had maligned \"the public servants at the Department of Justice based solely on false accusations.\"",
      "Biden described the prosecution of his son as a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d in the official White House statement announcing the pardon, which prosecutors working for Weiss disputed in a later court filing.",
      "\"Politicians who attack the decisions of career prosecutors as politically motivated when they disagree with the outcome of a case undermine the public\u2019s confidence in our criminal justice system,\" Weiss wrote. \"The President\u2019s statements unfairly\u00a0impugn the integrity not only of Department of Justice personnel, but all of the public servants making these difficult decisions in good faith.\"",
      "Biden pardoned his son early last month, not long before Hunter Biden was expected to be sentenced in connection with his conviction for violating a statute rarely used by federal prosecutors, which makes it unlawful for drug users to possess weapons. Biden had repeatedly said during the 2024 campaign, including after he dropped out of the race over the summer, that he would not pardon his son.",
      "In a statement provided to NBC News, Hunter Biden\u2019s attorney Abbe Lowell said that Weiss' report \"conveniently omits his proposal to resolve this investigation in 2023 with a pair of misdemeanors and a diverted gun charge recommended by career prosecutors.\"",
      "Lowell also said Weiss had not explained why prosecutors \"pursued wild \u2014 and debunked \u2014 conspiracies\" that extended the investigation.",
      "\"What is clear from this report is that the\u00a0investigation into Hunter Biden is a cautionary tale of the abuse of prosecutorial power,\" Lowell added.",

    "story": [
      "Los Angeles-area residents who already face warnings about their tap water could be without it for some time, experts told NBC News, owing to concerns about the damage done to local infrastructure and the chemicals released by wildfires.",
      "At least two water departments have told residents not to drink their tap water because of concerns about potential contamination from the ongoing wildfires. And the possibility of chemicals\u2019 and pathogens\u2019 entering the water system has raised concerns about potential risks to human health, though it may take a while for tests to determine the scope of the problem, particularly since the fires are still active.",
      "On Friday, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power instructed people in the Pacific Palisades and adjacent communities to use bottled water for cooking, drinking, brushing teeth and washing dishes. The advisory warns that fire-related contaminants such as benzene \u2014 a chemical with the potential to cause cancer \u2014 may have entered the water system.",
      "The Pasadena Water and Power Department also told many residents last week to switch to bottled water until further notice, citing concerns that debris may have entered the system. The Eaton Fire in the area damaged several reservoirs and pump stations, the department said, which could affect water quality.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s definitely some level of contamination in these damaged systems. How much nobody knows,\u201d said Jackson Webster, an assistant professor of civil engineering at California State University in Chico.",
      "\u201cUntil it\u2019s known what level of contamination is occurring in the system, it should just be assumed that they\u2019re highly contaminated based on previous observations,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s why they\u2019re issuing these \u2018no drink\u2019 notices.\u201d",
      "Webster said it\u2019s common to see drinking water contamination after wildfires in urban areas \u2014 he pointed to the 2023 fires in Maui, Hawaii, the 2018 Camp Fire in Paradise, California, and the 2017 Tubbs Fire in Santa Rosa, California.",
      "One telltale sign that drinking water has been contaminated, he said, is if a water system loses pressure. Excessive demand on the system \u2014 usually from residents running hoses and sprinklers while firefighters pull water from hydrants \u2014 causes water pressure to drop and contaminants to get sucked in like a vacuum.",
      "The Los Angeles water department reported last week that water pressure dropped in Pacific Palisades after the system sustained four times its usual demand.",
      "\u201cThe loss of pressure is concerning, and it should trigger some careful analysis of the water,\u201d said Fernando Rosario-Ortiz, a professor of environmental engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder.",

      "\u201cYou might be upsetting the ecosystem, but you wouldn\u2019t necessarily worry about it from a human health standpoint,\u201d Young said.",
      "A bigger concern is the ash from household materials. The Los Angeles-area fires have destroyed more than 12,300 structures. As the properties burned, materials such as carpeting, furniture and rubber tires were also incinerated. Fires can also melt the plastic pipes or water meters on people\u2019s properties.",
      "Those processes release gaseous chemicals known as volatile organic compounds, which may leach into the water system, where they\u2019re often hard to eliminate. People exposed to the chemicals may experience nausea, difficulty breathing or eye irritation in the short term. Exposure over time has been associated with certain cancers, birth defects and cognitive impairment.",
      "Two chemicals in particular, benzene and vinyl chloride, pose some of the greatest health risks, since they are known carcinogens.",
      "Boiling water doesn\u2019t destroy them, so the Los Angeles water department got rid of an earlier \u201cboil water\u201d advisory that aimed to protect residents from bacteria, viruses or parasites.",
      "Thomas Young, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of California, Davis, said it\u2019s common to test water for the most hazardous chemicals like benzene first, then use that as an overall indicator of whether drinking water is safe to consume.",
      "\u201cWhen we design cleanup for these kinds of things, we focus on the compound of the most intense health concern. We feel like if we\u2019ve addressed that, then the other ones are generally going to come along and be fine, because they\u2019re much less potent,\u201d he said.",
      "The testing process could take weeks, months or more, depending on how much contamination is present. Catherine Carpenter, a research data analyst at Tracking California \u2014 a program that collects and analyzes water quality data \u2014 said testing of people\u2019s homes in Paradise showed ongoing contamination long after the Camp Fire abated.",
      "\u201cIt was almost a year after, but we were still finding high levels of benzene in the tap water,\u201d she said.",
      "If contamination levels are low, it\u2019s possible to remove the hazard by flushing out water pipes, said Andrew Whelton, a professor of environmental and ecological engineering at Purdue University. But high levels of contamination may require replacing the pipes altogether, he added.",
      "Whelton said it\u2019s possible that neighborhoods where homes didn\u2019t burn down could still have contamination in their water supplies \u2014 though it\u2019s too soon to know yet.",
      "\u201cThe highest likelihood of where you find contamination in the water distribution system is around destroyed buildings,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when firefighters are fighting a fire ... sometimes they can suck contaminated water and drag it across the system.\u201d"

Roughly a dozen other hearings are also scheduled this week as senators race to help Trump fill out his administration ahead of his inauguration next Monday.",

    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 23:27:04 GMT",
    "summary": "The requests of two prisoners who have taken the unusual step of asking a federal judge to nullify their death row commutations granted by President Joe Biden should be denied because the act of leniency doesn't violate the Constitution, the Justice Department argued Monday in a court filing.",
    "story": [
      "The requests of two prisoners who have taken the unusual step of asking a federal judge to nullify their death row commutations granted by President Joe Biden should be denied because the act of leniency doesn't violate the Constitution, the Justice Department argued Monday in a court filing.",
      "The inmates \u2014 Shannon Agofsky, 53, and Len Davis, 60 \u2014 are being held in a federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, where the U.S. government puts inmates to death. A week after Biden announced he was commuting the sentences of 37 of the 40 prisoners on federal death row to life without the possibility of parole, Agofsky and Davis filed emergency motions seeking an injunction to block the change, arguing it could affect their appeals amid claims of innocence in their initial convictions.",
      "In responding to Davis' request for an injunction, the U.S. government offered three reasons U.S. District Judge James Sweeney should deny it, writing that not only are commutations legal, but also that the president has the authority to decide them and a prisoner has \"no authority to reject\" one.",
      "\"The President's commutation of a sentence 'is the determination of the ultimate authority that the public welfare will be better served by inflicting less than what the judgment fixed,'\" the U.S. attorneys wrote. \"Allowing Davis to veto this action would encroach on this exclusive and ultimate authority that is 'part of the Constitutional scheme.'\"",
      "The Justice Department said Agofsky has failed to identify a \"jurisdictional basis for his petition.\"",
      "In his filing, Agofsky said he is worried that no longer being a death row inmate would strip him of heightened scrutiny in his case or the process in which courts should examine death penalty cases for errors because of the life and-death consequences of the sentence.",
      "Besides requesting an injunction, the men also asked for co-counsel to be assigned to help them in the latest litigation.",
      "Sweeney agreed last week and assigned the inmates representation through the Indiana Federal Community Defenders.",
      "Sweeney noted in an order granting counsel that federal prisoners are entitled to counsel only when they are under death sentences or for evidentiary hearings in their cases.",
      "\"Here, Mr. Agofsky is no longer under a death sentence,\" Sweeney wrote. \"Therefore, whether to appoint counsel is purely a discretionary matter.\"",
      "He added that the court \"harbors serious doubt that it has any power to block a commutation\" but that \"given the novelty of the legal question, the Court prefers to receive counseled briefing on the motion.\"",
      "Sweeney referred to a\u00a01927 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that maintains that a president has the power to grant reprieves and pardons and that \"the convict's consent is not required.\"",
      "Agofsky, however, believes he has the right to refuse a commutation based on wording in the Constitution, which says a president \"shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.\"",
      "According to Agofsky's wife, Laura, he said at issue is the word \"grant,\" which he believes implies a person needs to have made an initial request. In his case, he said, as well as Davis', the men never requested commutations and refused it when asked multiple times to ask for a reduced sentence.",
      "They contend that sets them apart from the other former death row inmates who did seek commutations.",
      "Davis and Agofsky must reply to the Justice Department's response this week.",
      "Agofsky was convicted in the 1989 murder of a bank president, Dan Short, whose body was\u00a0found in an Oklahoma lake. Federal prosecutors said Agofsky and his brother, Joseph Agofsky, abducted and killed Short and made off with $71,000.",
      "Both brothers were given life sentences. But it was while he was incarcerated in a Texas prison that Shannon Agofsky was convicted in the 2001 stomping death of a fellow inmate, Luther Plant, and was sentenced to death in 2004. (Joseph Agofsky\u00a0died in prison\u00a0in 2013.)",
      "Davis, a former New Orleans police officer, was\u00a0convicted in the 1994 murder\u00a0of Kim Groves, who had filed a complaint accusing him of beating a teenager. Prosecutors said Davis hired a drug dealer to kill Groves, and they charged him with violating Groves' civil rights. Davis' original death sentence was thrown out by a federal appeals court but reinstated in 2005.",
      "Davis \"has always maintained his innocence and argued that federal court had no jurisdiction to try him for civil rights offenses,\" he wrote in his filing last month, requesting an injunction for his commutation.",
      "Biden's sweeping clemency action was praised by anti-death penalty groups but also criticized by some of the victims' families, who say they believe death row prisoners are undeserving of such leniency.",
      "Biden declined to grant commutations to three federal death row prisoners who were involved in mass killings or terrorist attacks.",
      "Still, President-elect Donald Trump said after the announcement that he would \"vigorously pursue the death penalty\" during his second term. He has also said he would expand capital punishment on the federal level to include child rapists,\u00a0migrants who kill U.S. citizens\u00a0and law enforcement officers, and those convicted of drug and human trafficking, although how he would do so remains unclear.",
      "Trump's first term ended with 13 federal inmates having been put to death. The Biden administration announced a moratorium on federal executions\u00a0after he took office and said last month that he granted the death row commutations because \"in good conscience, I cannot stand back and let a new administration resume executions that I halted.\""

      "The night started with a statement drive by Los Angeles, which scored on a seven-play, 70-yard jaunt on the game\u2019s first possession. After a quick three-and-out by Minnesota, the Rams took a two-score lead with a field goal on their next drive.",
      "The Vikings answered with a field goal early in the second quarter, but it didn\u2019t get much better from there. Minnesota\u2019s last two drives of the first half ultimately cost them the game.",

Then, on Minnesota\u2019s next possession, Darnold was sacked on fourth-and-2 from midfield. Los Angeles took advantage of the short field and scored a touchdown five plays later.",
      "The Vikings would finally score a touchdown in the third quarter \u2014 after a Rams field goal \u2014 but it was too little too late. The teams largely traded punts for the final 20 minutes of game time.",

    "summary": "Mississippi, Tennessee and West Virginia have some of the highest childhood vaccination rates. Experts worry a rising tide of vaccine skepticism is causing those bright spots to dim.",
    "story": [
      "Jen Fisher can do only so much to keep her son safe from the types of infections that children can encounter at school. The rest, she said, is up to other students and parents in their hometown of Franklin, Tennessee.",
      "Fisher\u2019s son Raleigh, 12, lives with a congenital heart condition, which has left him with a weakened immune system. For his protection, Raleigh has received all the recommended vaccines for a child his age. But even with his vaccinations, a virus that might only sideline another child could sicken him and land him in the emergency room, Fisher said.",
      "\u201cWe want everyone to be vaccinated so that illnesses like measles and things that have basically been eradicated don\u2019t come back,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cThose can certainly have a very adverse effect on Raleigh.\u201d",
      "For much of Raleigh\u2019s life, Fisher could take comfort in the high childhood vaccination rate in Tennessee \u2014 a public health bright spot in a conservative state with poor health outcomes and one of the shortest life expectancies in the nation.",
      "Mississippi and West Virginia, two similarly conservative states with poor health outcomes and short life expectancies, also have some of the highest vaccination rates for kindergartners in the nation \u2014 a seeming contradiction that stems from the fact that childhood vaccination requirements don\u2019t always align with states\u2019 other characteristics, said James Colgrove, a Columbia University professor who studies factors that influence public health.",
      "\u201cThe kinds of policies that states have don\u2019t map neatly on to \u2018red\u2019 versus \u2018blue\u2019 or one region or another,\u201d Colgrove said.",
      "Advocates, doctors, public health officials, and researchers worry such public health bright spots in some states are fading: Many states have recently reported an increase in people opting out of vaccines for their kids as Americans\u2019 views shift.",
      "During the 2023-24 school year, the percentage of kindergartners exempted from one or more vaccinations rose to 3.3%, the highest ever reported, with increases in 40 states and Washington, D.C., according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. Tennessee and Mississippi were among those with increases. Nearly all exemptions nationally were for nonmedical reasons.",
      "Vaccine proponents worry anti-vaccine messaging could accelerate a growing \u201chealth freedom\u201d movement that has been pushed by leaders in states such as Florida. Momentum against vaccines is likely to continue to grow with the election of Donald Trump as president and his proposed nomination of anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "Pediatricians in states with high exemption rates, such as Florida and Georgia, say they\u2019re concerned by what they see \u2014 declining immunization levels for kindergartners, which could lead to a resurgence in vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles. The Florida Department of Health reported nonmedical exemption rates as high as 50% for children in some areas.",
      "\u201cThe religious exemption is huge,\u201d said Dr. Brandon Chatani, a pediatric infectious disease doctor in Orlando, Florida. \u201cThat has allowed for an easy way for these kids to enter schools without vaccines.\u201d",
      "In many states, it\u2019s easier to get a religious exemption than a medical one, which often requires signoff from a doctor.",
      "Over the past decade, California, Connecticut, Maine, and New York have removed religious and philosophical exemptions from school vaccination requirements. West Virginia has not had them.",
      "Idaho, Alaska, and Utah had the highest exemption rates for the 2023-24 school year, according to the CDC. Those states allow parents or legal guardians to exempt their children for religious reasons by submitting a notarized form or a signed statement.",
      "Florida and Georgia, with some of the lowest reported minimum vaccination rates for kindergartners, allow parents to exempt their children by submitting a form with the child\u2019s school or day care.",
      "Both states have reported declines in uptake of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, which is one of the most common childhood shots. In Georgia, MMR coverage for kindergartners dropped to 88.4% in the 2023-24 school year from 93.1% in 2019-20, according to the CDC. Florida dropped to 88.1% from 93.5% during the same period.",
      "Dr. Andi Shane, a pediatric infectious disease specialist in Atlanta, traces Georgia\u2019s declining rates to families who lack access to a pediatrician. State policies on exemptions are also key, she said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s lots of data to support the fact that when personal belief exemptions are not permitted, that vaccination rates are higher,\u201d she said.",
      "In December, Georgia public health officials put out an advisory saying the state had recorded significantly more whooping cough cases than in the prior year. According to CDC data, Georgia reported 280 cases in 2024 compared with 96 the year before.",
      "Until 2023, Mississippi was one of the few states that allowed parents to opt out of vaccinating their kids only for medical reasons \u2014 and only with the approval of a doctor. That gave it among the highest vaccination rates in the nation as of the 2023-24 school year.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the few things Mississippi has done well,\u201d said Dr. Anita Henderson, a pediatrician who has practiced in the southern part of the state for nearly 30 years. In terms of health, she said, childhood vaccination rates were the state\u2019s one \u201cshining star.\u201d",
      "But that changed in April 2023 when a federal judge ordered state officials to start allowing religious exemptions. The ruling has emboldened many families, Henderson said.",
      "\u201cWe are seeing more and more skepticism, more and more vaccine hesitancy, and a lack of confidence because of this ruling,\u201d she said.",
      "State officials have granted more than 5,000 religious exemptions since the court order allowing them, according to the state health department. Dr. Daniel Edney, the state health officer, said most of the requests have come from \u201cmore affluent\u201d residents in \u201cpockets\u201d of the state.",
      "\u201cMost people listen to the expert opinions of their pediatricians and family medicine doctors to stay on the vaccine schedule, because it\u2019s what is best to protect their children,\u201d he said.",
      "West Virginia\u2019s vaccine law \u2014 which doesn\u2019t allow nonmedical exemptions \u2014 also could soon change, said Dr. Matthew Christiansen, that state\u2019s health officer until he resigned in December.",
      "A bill that would have broadened exemptions made it through the legislature last year but was vetoed by outgoing Republican Gov. Jim Justice. The incoming governor, Republican Pat Morrisey, has been a vocal critic of vaccine mandates.",
      "People asserting their personal freedoms to decline vaccines for their kids can ultimately curtail the ability of others to live full lives, Christiansen said. \u201cKids getting measles and mumps and polio and being paralyzed for their whole life is an impediment on personal freedom and autonomy for those kids,\u201d he said.",
      "Since the Covid pandemic, anti-vaccine sentiment has been growing in Tennessee. One organization, Stand for Health Freedom, drafted a letter for constituents to send to their state lawmakers calling for the resignation of the medical director of Tennessee\u2019s Vaccine-Preventable Diseases and Immunization Program. The group said she demonstrated a \u201clack of respect for the informed consent rights\u201d of the people.",
      "\u201cThey feel emboldened by the idea that this presidential administration seems to feel very strongly that a lot of these issues should be taken back to the states,\u201d said Emily Delikat, director of Tennessee Families for Vaccines, a pro-vaccine group.",
      "Ultimately, like many effective public health interventions, vaccines are a victim of their own success, said Henderson, the Mississippi pediatrician. Most people haven\u2019t seen outbreaks of measles or polio, so they forget how dangerous the diseases are, she said.",
      "\u201cIt may unfortunately take a resurgence of those diseases to raise awareness to the fact that these are deadly, these are preventable,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope it doesn\u2019t come to that.\u201d",

      "Known as Xiaohongshu in China, RedNote is a social media platform that includes images, short-form videos, community building tools, shopping and more. It is not a one-to-one TikTok clone, and it is not owned by ByteDance. It is owned by Shanghai-based Xingyin Information Technology.",
      "American TikTokers who fear losing the platform have suggested their followers join them in downloading RedNote to send a message to the U.S. government, as well as the social media company Meta, which stands to gain new users of its TikTok-like product, Reels, if the ban goes into effect. Meta reportedly used a Republican lobbying firm to spread ill will toward TikTok in 2022.",
      "Some have said that following a ban, they are prepared to do weeklong Meta blackouts, meaning they will not use any Meta apps, such as Instagram and Facebook.",
      "On Monday, RedNote was the top free-to-download app on the Apple App Store, followed by TikTok\u2019s sister app Lemon8.",
      "Users say that while they wait to see whether the U.S. Supreme Court will give TikTok an eleventh-hour reprieve, they plan to use RedNote if TikTok goes away Sunday. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about RedNote.",
      "What is RedNote, and what are people saying about it?",
      "RedNote is a Shanghai-based Chinese-language social media app that offers a little bit of everything Americans are used to in a social media app. Users can share videos, post pictures, make text posts and access a host of shopping features.",
      "The interface is different from TikTok\u2019s in that a video does not immediately start playing upon the app\u2019s opening and users must log in to begin using it. However, it is similar in that it serves content it thinks each user will like.",
      "Although RedNote has been available in English, some users reported Monday that it appeared to be more accessible for its American user base as its popularity grew.",
      "Some posts Monday on RedNote welcomed \u201cTikTok refugees\u201d to the platform.",
      "Other users joked about meeting their TikTok-designated \u201cChinese spy\u201d on RedNote, with some Chinese users chiming in that they were happy to find their American counterparts.",
      "How are memes driving people to the platform?",
      "On TikTok, some videos of people joking about saying goodbye to their \u201cChinese spy\u201d (some in Mandarin) have racked up millions of views and likes. The memes are part of a deeper resentment some users feel toward the U.S. government for moving to ban TikTok in the name of security and safety even though some lawmakers use it themselves, as well as toward the continued politicization of other social media companies, like X and Meta.",
      "The anger was on full display on TikTok as some explained why they were downloading RedNote.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to download it on my phone. I\u2019m going to let it track other apps. I\u2019m going to give it permission to see my location and all of my contacts and then I\u2019m just going to let it sit there,\u201d a TikTok user posted. \u201cI\u2019m going to let it sit there as a little window through which my personal Chinese spy can see everything that I\u2019m doing.\u201d",
      "Others had a more somber tone discussing their decisions to download RedNote, suggesting the U.S. government\u2019s intention was to hurt its people, many of whom have built large followings and full-time careers on TikTok.",
      "\u201cOur government, I\u2019m convinced, loves and thrives seeing us unhappy and seeing us struggle and seeing us poor,\u201d another TikToker said. \u201cSeeing that RedNote, another Chinese app, which is owned and hosted in China, is the No. 1 app in the App Store today is just beautiful.\u201d",
      "When was RedNote released?",
      "RedNote launched in 2013. While it grew steadily over the years, its biggest boom came during the pandemic, which is when it rose in popularity.",
      "How many users are on the app?",
      "RedNote has 300 million monthly active users, according to TechCrunch. TechCrunch reported that women are 79% of the user base.",
      "Could RedNote be banned like TikTok?",
      "Like TikTok and Lemon8, the short answer appears to be yes \u2014 however, it is not as straightforward as it is for TikTok and Lemon8, whose parent company, ByteDance, is named in the law.",
      "Experts noted that the law gives the executive branch the authority to deem a country a \u201cforeign adversary\u201d and that in doing so it can choose to ban an app that comes from that country. In this case, China is already deemed a \u201cforeign adversary\u201d in the TikTok ban, and therefore the executive branch could theoretically decide that other apps from China must be banned.",
      "But lawmakers who crafted the bill said in interviews with The Washington Post that while it could be used for foreign-controlled social media platforms, the core intention of the ban was to target TikTok and its sister applications."

    "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2025 00:56:13 GMT",
    "summary": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has dramatically steered the company to the right ahead of the inauguration of President-Elect Donald Trump.",
    "story": [
      "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has dramatically steered the company to the right ahead of the inauguration of President-Elect Donald Trump with a series of policy and practice changes in the last week that have left some employees, users and interest groups up in arms.",
      "Zuckerberg said some of the changes to Meta\u2019s fact-checking and moderation systems were meant to curb censorship and protect free speech on its platforms, including Instagram and Facebook, but the scale of the changes goes far beyond social media moderation, reportedly touching on Meta\u2019s internal policies around its bathrooms and its board and on optional aesthetic theming it previously deployed on one of its platforms to celebrate trans people.",
      "These are all of the changes Meta has rolled out in the last week.",
      "Community Notes instead of third-party fact-checkers",
      "Last Tuesday, Meta announced it was scrapping its old fact-checking system and replacing it with a system similar to X\u2019s Community Notes that will be rolled out in the next couple of months, starting in the\u00a0 United States.",
      "Meta\u2019s fact-checking system, which was introduced in 2016, worked by running some information on its platforms by certified third-party fact-checkers who would identify posts that appeared to be misinformation. However, Zuckerberg said, the fact-checkers were \u201ctoo politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they created.\u201d",
      "Under the new Community Notes system, users will be able to write and rate notes that can be added onto posts, which can provide additional context that may be missing from the originals. In a news release announcing the changes, Meta said that for a note to pop up, it will \u201crequire agreement between people with a range of perspectives\u201d to help combat potential bias.",
      "Republicans have often expressed support for X\u2019s Community Notes system; many previously criticized Meta\u2019s fact-checking system over their belief that it disproportionately targets right-wing content. Research has told a different story, however,\u00a0 suggesting that conservatives are prone to sharing more misinformation, which in turn attracts moderation actions. Those who oppose Meta\u2019s changes fear that they will allow misinformation to run rampant on its platforms.",
      "Zuckerberg explained in a video on Facebook that Meta would also change its enforcement policies, saying the previous system\u2019s flaws accounted for the \u201cvast majority of censorship\u201d on its platforms. He said that the new filtering system would specifically target illegal and \u201chigh severity\u201d violations and that \u201clower severity violations\u201d would be addressed through the new Community Notes system, with users needing to proactively report when posts may lack context or may have misinformation.",
      "The announcement has received a mixed response.",
      "Many Meta employees have expressed apprehension about the decision to end third-party fact-checking. An employee wrote on Workplace, the company\u2019s internal communications tool, about being \u201cextremely concerned\u201d about the decision, adding that it seemed that Meta was \u201csending a bigger, stronger message to people that facts no longer matter, and conflating that with a victory for free speech.\u201d",
      "Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva called the decision \u201cextremely serious,\u201d and the country\u2019s attorney general has said it could take \u201clegal and judicial measures\u201d against Meta if it doesn\u2019t explain its new fact-checking measures.",
      "Many right-wing figures have applauded the new system. Fox News reporter Brooke Singman reported that Trump reacted by saying Meta has \u201ccome a long way.\u201d SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk similarly praised the changes, writing \u201cThis is cool\u201d on X.",
      "More political content",
      "In the video posted last Tuesday, Zuckerberg said Meta is looking to welcome political discourse back on Facebook, Instagram and Threads.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re bringing back civic content,\u201d Zuckerberg said in the video. \u201cFor a while, the community asked to see less politics because it was making people stressed, so we stopped recommending these posts. But it feels like we\u2019re in a new era now, and we\u2019re starting to get feedback that people want to see this content again.\u201d",
      "He added that the recent election has had a major influence on the company\u2019s decision to change its fact-checking system and work toward \u201cprioritizing speech.\u201d He also added that it plans to work closely with Trump\u2019s upcoming administration to \u201cpush back on governments around the world that are going after American companies and pushing to censor more.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe only way that we can push back on this global trend is with the support of the U.S. government, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s been so difficult over the past four years, when even the U.S. government has pushed for censorship,\u201d Zuckerberg said.",
      "In 2021, before Meta began reducing its political content, a study from the Brookings Institution found that often, conservative-leaning podcasters sharing \u201cfalse and misleading content\u201d could reach more than 28 million combined followers on Facebook and Twitter.",
      "Loosening rules around anti-LGBTQ rhetoric and an end to Meta\u2019s diversity programs",
      "Meta notified its employees Friday through an internal communications forum that it would end many of its programs aimed at hiring diverse candidates, including disbanding its diversity, equity and inclusion team and getting rid of its \u201cDiverse Slate Approach\u201d in its hiring process.",
      "The New York Times also reported that two Meta employees said Meta\u2019s offices in Silicon Valley, Texas and New York were instructed to remove tampons from their men\u2019s restrooms, which had been made available for the company\u2019s nonbinary and transgender employees.",
      "404 Media reported that Meta had deleted nonbinary and transgender themes from its Messenger app. The app\u2019s \u201cthemes\u201d feature allows users to change the designs and colors of their chats, with the \u201ctrans\u201d and \u201cnonbinary\u201d themes featuring the colors of each of the transgender and nonbinary flags. Meta had introduced the two themes in celebration of Pride Month, rolling out the trans theme in June 2021 and the nonbinary theme the next year.",
      "Meta also updated its \u201cHateful Conduct\u201d policy, which now allows for posts that call LGBTQ people mentally ill.",
      "\u201cWe do allow allegations of mental illness or abnormality when based on gender or sexual orientation, given political and religious discourse about transgenderism and homosexuality and common non-serious usage of words like \u2018weird,\u2019\u201d the policy reads.",
      "Under the Hateful Conduct policy, users can post about \u201cgender-based limitations of military, law enforcement, and teaching jobs,\u201d as well as use \u201csex- or gender-exclusive language\u201d in describing \u201caccess to spaces often limited by sex or gender, such as access to bathrooms, specific schools, specific military, law enforcement, or teaching roles, and health or support groups.\u201d",
      "Zuckerberg said in the video posted to Facebook that Meta would be \u201csimplifying content policies\u201d in regard to topics such as gender and immigration.",
      "\u201cWhat started as a movement to be more inclusive has increasingly been used to shut down opinions and shut out people with different ideas, and it\u2019s gone too far,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to make sure that people can share their beliefs and experiences on our platforms.\u201d",
      "Meta\u2019s chief global affairs officer, Joel Kaplan, similarly told Fox News that its previous system was \u201ctoo restrictive\u201d when it came to \u201csensitive topics like immigration, trans issues and gender.\u201d",
      "High-profile departures and new hires",
      "Former U.K. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg announced that he would step down as Meta\u2019s president of global affairs this month after almost seven years. Kaplan, a Republican who was White House deputy chief of staff, has stepped into the position.",
      "The CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship, Dana White, a longtime Trump ally, is also joining Meta\u2019s board of directors, alongside John Elkann, CEO of the Italian auto holding company Exor, and Microsoft\u2019s former head of strategy Charlie Songhurst.",
      "In a Meta news release, White said he hadn\u2019t been \u201cinterested in joining a board of directors\u201d until he was offered a spot on Meta\u2019s board. 404 Media reported that Meta\u2019s employees reacted to the announcement of his addition with criticism and jokes on Workplace, which the company\u2019s Internal Community Relations team took down, deeming that the posts violated the company\u2019s \u201cCommunity Engagement Expectations.\u201d",
      "The day Meta announced it would end its diversity programs, its vice president for civil rights and deputy general counsel, Roy Austin, announced on Facebook that he would step down.",
      "Jobs in a red state",
      "Zuckerberg also said Meta\u2019s trust and safety and content moderation teams would move from California to Texas.",
      "\u201cAs we work to promote free expression, I think that will help build trust to do this work in places where there\u2019s less concern about the bias of our teams,\u201d he said.",
      "After the announcement, former Meta employees wrote on the social media platform Bluesky and Meta\u2019s own platform Threads that Meta already had trust and safety moderation teams working in Austin, Texas.",
      "Musk similarly moved SpaceX\u2019s and X\u2019s headquarters from California to Texas in July. The same month, the U.S. Supreme Court returned to a lower court a case that questioned the constitutionality of the Texas and Florida laws that sought to regulate social media companies\u2019 content moderation practices."

      "A \u201cpreliminary assessment\u201d suggested the damage might have been caused by the freighter, which \u201ctransited the area at the time of the incident,\u201d the coast guard said.",
      "With an average of about 200 cable faults a year, according to the International Cable Protection Committee, damage to undersea communications infrastructure is not uncommon. The majority is caused by ship anchors or fishing activity such as trawling, where heavy equipment is dragged across the seafloor.",
      "But the Taiwanese government says this may have been an example of Chinese \u201cgray-zone interference,\u201d irregular military and non-military tactics that aim to wear down an opponent without engaging in an actual shooting war.",
      "It also comes amid an uproar in Europe, where NATO is stepping up patrols of Baltic Sea cables that provide power and enable almost all intercontinental communication, including the internet.",
      "Members of the defense bloc with access to the Baltic Sea were set to meet Tuesday in Helsinki to discuss regional security threats including Russian cable sabotage.",
      "The damage from the Jan. 3 incident did not disrupt communications in Taiwan, as the data was routed to other cables.",
      "However, \u201cif enough cables were cut you can potentially cause something as severe as an internet blackout,\u201d said Ian Li Huiyuan, an associate research fellow at the Institute of Defense and Strategic Studies at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. \u201cEspecially for Taiwan\u2019s case, since it\u2019s an island and there\u2019s no overland alternatives.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office said last week that undersea cables were damaged by \u201ccommon maritime accidents\u201d and that Taiwan was making accusations \u201cout of thin air\u201d and intentionally hyping up the \u201cso-called gray zone threat,\u201d according to Reuters.",
      "Taiwan\u2019s Mainland Affairs Council, which makes China policy, responded that the investigation would proceed based on the evidence.",
      "It said Chinese \u201cflag-of-convenience\u201d ships \u201chave a bad reputation in the international community,\u201d pointing to similar cases in Baltic states that are suspected to involve Chinese vessels.",
      "The race to protect cables",
      "It can be difficult to determine whether a cable was damaged by accident or deliberately, but heightened geopolitical tensions have raised suspicions that damage to some critical infrastructure may be sabotage.",
      "Estonia said last month that it would deploy naval assets to protect cables connecting it with Finland after its Estlink 2 cable was damaged on Christmas Day. Finland is investigating a Russian oil tanker that was seized after the incident and may have been dragging its anchor along the seabed.",
      "\u201cThree cases in one year cannot be a coincidence,\u201d Finnish President Alexander Stubb said last month.",
      "NATO is also deploying at least two ships to the Baltic Sea area for surveillance.",
      "While the alliance\u2019s heightened alert mostly involves Russia\u2019s \u201cshadow fleet\u201d of smuggling ships, Chinese-owned vessels have come under suspicion as well, including in November when one freighter was detained for weeks in Danish waters after two fiber-optic cables were damaged.",
      "The ship, Yi Peng 3, was alleged to have damaged cables that ran between Sweden and Lithuania and Finland and Germany after leaving the Russian port of Ust-Luga, on the Gulf of Finland. The ship continued its journey after investigators from Sweden and other countries were allowed to board.",
      "Swedish authorities said they were satisfied with the inspection and did not say whether any evidence had been found. China has said it will continue to cooperate with regional authorities in the investigation.",
      "Though European authorities have detained ships when sabotage is suspected, in the absence of concrete proof they have stopped short of directly blaming Moscow or Beijing.",
      "Still, the anxiety in Taiwan is heightened.",
      "\u201cPatrol of undersea cables is really time-consuming. It adds an extra burden and becomes more resource-consuming for the coast guard,\u201d said Yisuo Tzeng, a Taipei-based researcher at Taiwan\u2019s defense ministry-funded Institute for National Defense and Security Research.",
      "The Taiwanese coast guard said that although the intentions of the Xing Shun 39 on Jan. 3 were \u201cimpossible to confirm,\u201d it could not rule out the possibility of the vessel \u201cengaging in gray-zone interference.\u201d",
      "The coast guard said it was unable to board the vessel due to bad weather, but had asked South Korean authorities in Busan, its destination port, to collect evidence.",
      "Data from Marine Traffic showed the freighter making erratic movements that day a few miles off Taiwan\u2019s northern city of Keelung, where a submarine cable connects the island to both the U.S. and China.",
      "Because the cable is also connected to China, some analysts say it may be premature to blame Beijing for the disruption.",
      "\u201cIf there is an outage of a particular cable for half a day, for one hour, we\u2019re talking billions of dollars of investment loss,\u201d said Gerard Parr, who has worked on submarine cable projects and is a professor of telecommunications engineering at the University of East Anglia in Britain.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be gained by this because there\u2019s economic value in maintaining the cable,\u201d he added.",
      "While Chunghwa Telecom has not said which cable was damaged, the Taiwanese giant co-owns the Trans-Pacific Express, a nearly 11,000-mile undersea system that connects Taiwan with China, Japan, South Korea and the U.S.",
      "Companies from all of those places share ownership of the cables.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking at a shared infrastructure, shared risk situation, because Taiwan and China are part of the same networks. And this fact should not be overlooked,\u201d said Cynthia Mehboob, who studies undersea cables in the Indo-Pacific at the Australian National University.",
      "All seven crew members aboard the freighter were Chinese nationals, the Taiwan coast guard said. It said the ship was owned by a Hong Kong company called Jie Yang Trading, which according to public records was incorporated in 2020.",
      "Its Chinese-national director, Guo Wenjie, denied that his ship was responsible for the damage, saying \u201cthere\u2019s no evidence at all.\u201d",
      "\u201cI spoke to the ship captain and for us it was a normal trip,\u201d he told Reuters.",
      "NBC News was unable to reach Guo.",
      "Taiwan\u2019s suspicion toward Beijing stems in part from a 2023 incident in which the 14,000 people who live on the Taiwan-controlled Matsu islands, which sit close to the Chinese mainland, were disconnected from the internet after two undersea cables connecting the islands were cut.",
      "At the time, authorities said a Chinese fishing vessel and freighter had damaged the cables, but said there was no evidence that it was deliberate.",
      "The same year, another Chinese ship called NewNew Polar Bear damaged a gas pipeline between Estonia and Finland. It took months for Beijing to admit that its ship was responsible, saying it was an accident.",
      "\u201cWhat this has done in recent years is expose the vulnerability of these cables that have been out of sight, out of mind,\u201d Parr said."

She reported the incident to police, and Hegseth settled for an undisclosed sum.",

      "HONG KONG \u2014 First the Baltics, now Taiwan. This month saw the latest in a spate of incidents in which crucial undersea cables connecting U.S. allies have been damaged or severed.",
      "Some have been cast as acts of sabotage, pinning blame on Russia and China amid heightened geopolitical tensions.",
      "Early this month, Taiwan\u2019s coast guard said it had intercepted the Xing Shun 39 \u2014 a Hong Kong-owned freighter carrying the Cameroonian and Tanzanian flags \u2014 after the Beijing-claimed island\u2019s biggest telecom company, Chunghwa Telecom, alerted authorities that an international undersea cable had been damaged on Jan. 3.",
      "A \u201cpreliminary assessment\u201d suggested the damage might have been caused by the freighter, which \u201ctransited the area at the time of the incident,\u201d the coast guard said.",
      "With an average of about 200 cable faults a year, according to the International Cable Protection Committee, damage to undersea communications infrastructure is not uncommon. The majority is caused by ship anchors or fishing activity such as trawling, where heavy equipment is dragged across the seafloor.",
      "But the Taiwanese government says this may have been an example of Chinese \u201cgray-zone interference,\u201d irregular military and non-military tactics that aim to wear down an opponent without engaging in an actual shooting war.",
      "It also comes amid an uproar in Europe, where NATO is stepping up patrols of Baltic Sea cables that provide power and enable almost all intercontinental communication, including the internet.",
      "Members of the defense bloc with access to the Baltic Sea were set to meet Tuesday in Helsinki to discuss regional security threats including Russian cable sabotage.",
      "The damage from the Jan. 3 incident did not disrupt communications in Taiwan, as the data was routed to other cables.",
      "However, \u201cif enough cables were cut you can potentially cause something as severe as an internet blackout,\u201d said Ian Li Huiyuan, an associate research fellow at the Institute of Defense and Strategic Studies at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. \u201cEspecially for Taiwan\u2019s case, since it\u2019s an island and there\u2019s no overland alternatives.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office said last week that undersea cables were damaged by \u201ccommon maritime accidents\u201d and that Taiwan was making accusations \u201cout of thin air\u201d and intentionally hyping up the \u201cso-called gray zone threat,\u201d according to Reuters.",
      "Taiwan\u2019s Mainland Affairs Council, which makes China policy, responded that the investigation would proceed based on the evidence.",
      "It said Chinese \u201cflag-of-convenience\u201d ships \u201chave a bad reputation in the international community,\u201d pointing to similar cases in Baltic states that are suspected to involve Chinese vessels.",
      "The race to protect cables",
      "It can be difficult to determine whether a cable was damaged by accident or deliberately, but heightened geopolitical tensions have raised suspicions that damage to some critical infrastructure may be sabotage.",
      "Estonia said last month that it would deploy naval assets to protect cables connecting it with Finland after its Estlink 2 cable was damaged on Christmas Day. Finland is investigating a Russian oil tanker that was seized after the incident and may have been dragging its anchor along the seabed.",
      "\u201cThree cases in one year cannot be a coincidence,\u201d Finnish President Alexander Stubb said last month.",
      "NATO is also deploying at least two ships to the Baltic Sea area for surveillance.",
      "While the alliance\u2019s heightened alert mostly involves Russia\u2019s \u201cshadow fleet\u201d of smuggling ships, Chinese-owned vessels have come under suspicion as well, including in November when one freighter was detained for weeks in Danish waters after two fiber-optic cables were damaged.",
      "The ship, Yi Peng 3, was alleged to have damaged cables that ran between Sweden and Lithuania and Finland and Germany after leaving the Russian port of Ust-Luga, on the Gulf of Finland. The ship continued its journey after investigators from Sweden and other countries were allowed to board.",
      "Swedish authorities said they were satisfied with the inspection and did not say whether any evidence had been found. China has said it will continue to cooperate with regional authorities in the investigation.",
      "Though European authorities have detained ships when sabotage is suspected, in the absence of concrete proof they have stopped short of directly blaming Moscow or Beijing.",
      "Still, the anxiety in Taiwan is heightened.",
      "\u201cPatrol of undersea cables is really time-consuming. It adds an extra burden and becomes more resource-consuming for the coast guard,\u201d said Yisuo Tzeng, a Taipei-based researcher at Taiwan\u2019s defense ministry-funded Institute for National Defense and Security Research.",
      "The Taiwanese coast guard said that although the intentions of the Xing Shun 39 on Jan. 3 were \u201cimpossible to confirm,\u201d it could not rule out the possibility of the vessel \u201cengaging in gray-zone interference.\u201d",
      "The coast guard said it was unable to board the vessel due to bad weather, but had asked South Korean authorities in Busan, its destination port, to collect evidence.",
      "Data from Marine Traffic showed the freighter making erratic movements that day a few miles off Taiwan\u2019s northern city of Keelung, where a submarine cable connects the island to both the U.S. and China.",
      "Because the cable is also connected to China, some analysts say it may be premature to blame Beijing for the disruption.",
      "\u201cIf there is an outage of a particular cable for half a day, for one hour, we\u2019re talking billions of dollars of investment loss,\u201d said Gerard Parr, who has worked on submarine cable projects and is a professor of telecommunications engineering at the University of East Anglia in Britain.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be gained by this because there\u2019s economic value in maintaining the cable,\u201d he added.",
      "While Chunghwa Telecom has not said which cable was damaged, the Taiwanese giant co-owns the Trans-Pacific Express, a nearly 11,000-mile undersea system that connects Taiwan with China, Japan, South Korea and the U.S.",
      "Companies from all of those places share ownership of the cables.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking at a shared infrastructure, shared risk situation, because Taiwan and China are part of the same networks. And this fact should not be overlooked,\u201d said Cynthia Mehboob, who studies undersea cables in the Indo-Pacific at the Australian National University.",
      "All seven crew members aboard the freighter were Chinese nationals, the Taiwan coast guard said. It said the ship was owned by a Hong Kong company called Jie Yang Trading, which according to public records was incorporated in 2020.",
      "Its Chinese-national director, Guo Wenjie, denied that his ship was responsible for the damage, saying \u201cthere\u2019s no evidence at all.\u201d",
      "\u201cI spoke to the ship captain and for us it was a normal trip,\u201d he told Reuters.",
      "NBC News was unable to reach Guo.",
      "Taiwan\u2019s suspicion toward Beijing stems in part from a 2023 incident in which the 14,000 people who live on the Taiwan-controlled Matsu islands, which sit close to the Chinese mainland, were disconnected from the internet after two undersea cables connecting the islands were cut.",
      "At the time, authorities said a Chinese fishing vessel and freighter had damaged the cables, but said there was no evidence that it was deliberate.",
      "The same year, another Chinese ship called NewNew Polar Bear damaged a gas pipeline between Estonia and Finland. It took months for Beijing to admit that its ship was responsible, saying it was an accident.",
      "\u201cWhat this has done in recent years is expose the vulnerability of these cables that have been out of sight, out of mind,\u201d Parr said."

      "January 13 kicks off the beginning of Jenna & Friends \u2014 the successor to \u201cHoda & Jenna.\u201d On the latter, it was the crackle of Hoda & Jenna\u2019s genuine chemistry that resonated with audiences who saw themselves reflected in the hosts. And while Jenna feels bittersweet about saying goodbye to Hoda, she says her outlook is clear.",
      "\u201cI feel like I\u2019m going to feel nervous \u2014 which, to be honest, I haven\u2019t been since my first day (at TODAY). I\u2019ve felt nerves here and there, but not real nervousness. Not, \u2018Holy moly, what are we starting?\u2019 And that\u2019s the sign of something super exciting.\u201d",
      "So long to \u2018Hoda & Jenna\u2019",
      "Jenna remembers the day in September 2024 Hoda asked\u00a0to meet in her office; she had something to tell her. When Jenna got there, a candle was burning. There, before the rest of the world knew, Hoda broke the news: She was moving on from TODAY. At age 60, she was ready to spend more time with her young children.",
      "Jenna\u2019s first reaction?",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018Wait, you can\u2019t, you can\u2019t go.\u2019 And she said: \u2018...Well, I\u2019m going,\u2019\u201d Jenna says, laughing.",
      "Shocked by the news, Jenna immediately called her parents, former President George W. Bush and former first lady Laura Bush, in tears.",
      "\u201cI was crying in such a way that they thought something really bad had happened. When they found out that it was just that Hoda was ready to move on to other chapters, they said, \u2018Oh, Jenna, it\u2019s gonna be OK.\u2019 They basically said, \u2018This is your time. Enjoy it. You\u2019re ready for it,\u2019\u201d she says, calling them \u201cso supportive.\u201d",
      "Still, moving on from this \u201cwonderful, wonderful time\u201d has been a journey. Jenna says she has moved through the five stages of grief and has now reached the acceptance that eluded her when she first heard the news.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so proud of Hoda. I think she\u2019s doing exactly what she needs to do at this moment for her.\u201d",
      "For Jenna, this is more than the loss of a co-host, but also the loss of a champion. When Jenna first appeared on TODAY in 2009, she was a 27-year-old grade school teacher in Baltimore who was on the show to promote \u201cAna\u2019s Story,\u201d a book she wrote about the 17-year-old single mother living with HIV/AIDs she had met while working as a UNICEF intern in Latin America.",
      "An executive producer thought Jenna had the right spark for TV \u2014 and Hoda agreed. \u201cI never thought I would\u2019ve hosted an hour. But Hoda saw that in me,\u201d Jenna says, adding that through the years, Hoda helped her push past insecurities."

      "Some people have defended Gomez\u2019s use of Spanish in the film.",
      "Annie Abbott, a professor of Spanish at the University of Illinois, argued that the criticism of Gomez mirrors the judgment sometimes experienced by heritage speakers \u2014 i.e., people with a Latino cultural and familial background who are not formally fluent in Spanish \u2014 from native Spanish speakers.",
      "\u201cGomez is critiqued for experiencing the typical challenges of heritage speakers while being held to native speaker standards \u2014 a no-win situation that a rapidly growing number of Americans can relate to,\u201d Abbott wrote in a recent opinion piece for The Fulcrum.",
      "A 2023 study from the Pew Research Center found that 24% of U.S. Latino adults say they carry on a conversation in Spanish \u201ca little or not at all.\u201d",
      "According to the study, 54% of U.S. Latinos who say that only speak a little Spanish \u201csay another Hispanic person has made them feel bad for it.\u201d",
      "However, one commenter on X responding to Abbott argued that the issue wasn\u2019t with Gomez's language ability or identity, but with the fact that her Spanish skills did not match the demands of her role in \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe author misses the point completely. This has nothing to do with racism. Selena Gomez should be proud of her Spanish,\u201d the X user wrote. \u201cBut her accent doesn\u2019t match the character that she plays in the movie. And that\u2019s very distracting for viewers who know exactly how Mexicans speak.\u201d",
      "Director Audiard has addressed issues with the actors' varying Spanish accents in the movie.",
      "\u201cThroughout the shoot we had problems, for instance, with Selena\u2019s accent in Spanish. She is Texan. Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n speaks Castilian Spanish. She\u2019s from Madrid,\u201d he told The New York Times in November. \u201cGiven that I don\u2019t speak Spanish, the nuances of the Mexican accent versus the Castilian were lost on me. We had all these problems with accents, but we fixed them in the edit. We did a lot of dubbing.\u201d",
      "Some argue the movie perpetuates harmful trans stereotypes",
      "Some viewers have criticized the movie\u2019s depiction of trans people and the trans experience.",
      "GLAAD, the LGBTQ advocacy group formerly known as the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, called \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\" a \u201cstep backward for trans representation\u201d and said the film \u201crecycles the trans stereotypes, tropes, and clich\u00e9s of the not-so-distant past.\u201d",
      "Some critics say the film perpetuates the harmful narrative that transitioning is a form of lying. Emilia keeps her past a secret from her wife, posing as Manitas' aunt.",
      "\u201cIts protagonist\u2019s transition is seen as duplicitous and dishonest, an act of manipulation through which she continues her selfish attempts to control those that she abandoned,\u201d Mattie Lucas wrote in a November review for Trans | Cendental Cinema.",
      "\u201cNot only is her transition portrayed as more of a disguise to evade the authorities, it\u2019s an act of continued selfishness that ends up destroying not only her own life, but the lives of those she loves,\u201d Lucas added.",
      "Film critic Juan Barquin called the movie \u201ca regressive picture masquerading as progressive\u201d and criticized the way masculinity and femininity were portrayed in the film.",
      "\u201cAny time Emilia \u2018reverts\u2019 to her \u2018old ways,\u2019 Gascon lowers her vocal register as if to equate masculinity with evil and femininity with good,\u201d Barquin wrote for Little White Lies magazine.",
      "Reviewer David Opie echoed this criticism, pointing to a scene when Emilia throws her wife Jessi onto a bed \u201cand threatens her using the same low, masculine voice she used pre-surgery.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s as if the so-called 'evil' in Emilia is a separate entity, the 'man' she was raised to be, rather than her being the same person going through a transitional journey,\u201d Opie wrote for Yahoo! Movies.",
      "Several critics and viewers, including Barquin, also took issue with one line from the movie in which Emilia describes herself as \u201chalf male, half female.\u201d",
      "Some transgender commentators shared counterpoints to these arguments and defended the film\u2019s representation of its trans protagonist.",
      "Journalist and critic Mey Rude, who is trans, rejected the argument that Emilia uses a \u201cmale voice\u201d in moments of anger.",
      "\u201cShe simply is a woman with a lower register, and when she gets angry, it shows,\u201d Rude wrote in a piece for Out Magazine. \u201cIf you listen to the scenes where Gasc\u00f3n is playing the character as Manitas, you can clearly hear a difference in the voice she uses in the fight scene with Gomez.\u201d",
      "Rude also argues that the film does not lean into \u201charmful trans tropes about trans women being deceptive or liars.\u201d",
      "\u201cEmilia isn\u2019t a liar because she\u2019s trans, she\u2019s a liar because she\u2019s a bad person and she\u2019s in many ways, afraid,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe movie shows that if you live a lie, whether you\u2019re trans or not, your lies will catch up with you.\u201d",
      "Writer Julie River, who is trans, argues in a piece for Out Front magazine that Emilia is portrayed sensitively as a \u201cmorally complex\u201d character who makes \u201ca desperate attempt to atone for her sins in her former life.\u201d",
      "River also argues that Emilia hides her transition not because the movie is painting trans people as duplicitous, but because as a cartel leader, Emilia \"was hardly surrounded by people who were easy to come out to or who were likely to accept her transition.\u201d",
      "\u201cI may be amongst the minority in the LGBTQ+ community doing this, but I\u2019ll be applauding it for every award it wins,\u201d River wrote.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n herself has pushed back at people calling her \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d character transphobic.",
      "\u201cThere are some that say, \u2018I want to see LGBTQ or trans characters outdoing what people do in real life,\u2019 but we do bad things too ... I don\u2019t understand the criticism about the representation of portraying Emilia P\u00e9rez this way,\u201d she told Vanity Fair in January. \u201cThe reality is that the trans experience is not the same for everybody \u2014 my trans experience is different from somebody else\u2019s.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, go and make your own movie,\u201d Gasc\u00f3n also said. \u201cGo create the representation you want to see for your community.\u201d"

      "Jennifer Garner, who has been working to assist and repair the Pacific Palisades community through the raging California wildfires, said that one of her friends died amid the fires.",
      "The actor spoke to MSNBC\u2019s Katy Tur on Jan. 10, several days after multiple wildfires erupted across the Los Angeles area, burning communities, landmarks and thousands of homes. NBC News reported Jan. 12 that at least 16 people have been killed, and the fire has swept through about 37,000 acres across Los Angeles.",
      "After seeing the destruction, Garner said she reached out to World Central Kitchen\u2019s Chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, who has been in the L.A. area trying to feed and assist residents who have lost their homes and been affected by the fires.",
      "Both Garner and Andr\u00e9s discussed the devastation with MSNBC, particularly in the Pacific Palisades where the largest blaze continues to expand.",

And because of my work with Save the Children, (I) have a relationship with chef, and I was able to just say, \u2018Can I be with you for the day? What can I do to help? Put me to work.\u2019\u201d",

I mean, I can think of 100 families, and there are 5,000 homes lost\u2026 I could just write out a list of 100 friends who lost their homes. I feel almost guilty walking through my house. Just, you know, what can I do? How can I help? What do I have to offer with these hands and these walls and the safety that I have?\u201d",

So it\u2019s almost like Sesame Street, like, you know the people who are serving our food. You care about each other. There\u2019s a reciprocity here. There\u2019s a real love here, and we\u2019ve got to take care of them.\u201d",
      "She said it is also important to support children who have lost schools, homes, churches and playgrounds.",
      "\u201cThe people are strong, and the sense of community is strong. We will look after each other and that is still here. That\u2019s stronger than ever,\" she said. \"And just like chef said, I\u2019ve gotten to visit so many disaster relief areas, and I mean, this is tragic, but you always find love and hope.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "If you\u2019re paying attention to this year\u2019s film awards season, you\u2019ve probably heard of Mike Leigh's new British drama called \u201cHard Truths.\u201d",
      "Set in London, the 97-minute film centers on Pansy (Marianne Jean-Baptiste), a woman deeply unhappy with the world and takes it out on everyone around her, including her long-suffering husband Curtley (David Webber), her adult son Moses (Tuwaine Barrett) who lives at home, and even her seemingly happy sister Chantelle (Michele Austin).",
      "\u201cHard Truths\u201d is somewhat of a reunion for director Mike Leigh and Jean-Baptiste who worked together nearly 30 years ago on his Oscar-nominated film \"Secrets & Lies.\" The two also teamed up the following year when he used some of her music in his film \"Career Girls.\"",
      "Similar to his latest film, \"Secrets & Lies\" also centered on Jean-Baptiste, but as an adopted Black woman who traces her family history and discovers her biological mother is white. It also generated much critical-acclaim, including five Oscar nominations.",
      "\"Hard Truths\" appears to be following suit; it has already received early award season buzz \u2014 and accolades. It won a National Board of Review award, and Jean-Baptiste has won awards from critics organizations in New York, San Diego, Toronto, Chicago and Los Angeles.",
      "With the film's release in theaters on Jan. 10, there will be many who see the film who'll likely have a slew of questions as the final credits roll. Namely, happened to Pansy and Curtley and what is the takeaway?",
      "Let\u2019s dive a little deeper, and hear from the film\u2019s star, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, and directer to understand the film's cryptic ending.",
      "Note: Spoilers about the end of \u201cHard Truths\u201d ahead.",
      "What is \u2018Hard Truths\u2019 about?",
      "\u201cHard Truths\u201d is a small independent film that focuses on Pansy, the matriarch of a small family living in London. Pansy is deeply unhappy with the world, and takes it out on everyone around her, including her husband Curtley, son Moses, and sister Chantelle.",
      "As Jean-Baptiste tells TODAY.com, \u201c(Pansy) is somebody who has a lot of anxiety and fear\u2026 She\u2019s someone who doesn\u2019t enjoy life and doesn\u2019t quite understand why, and blames other people for it\u2026. I\u2019ve seen people that are quite similar to her, and observed that way they present in the world.\u201d",
      "But, as viewers soon learn, Pansy's temperament isn't solely based on her interactions with others; her frustration also comes from unresolved grief. There's an important scene in the film where Pansy and Chantelle go to their mother's gravesite; Pansy is abrasive and dismissive at first, but the sisters end up talking about their mother, Pearl's, death.",
      "\"Your memory of Pearl is not the same as mine,\" insists Pansy. She is resentful that she had to be the one who found their mother \"lying stiff in the bed\" with her eyes still open, \"Accusing. Disappointed.\"",
      "One of the film's critical moment comes when Pansy reveals that she thinks everyone hates her, to which Chantelle responds that she loves her \"but I don't understand you.\"",
      "Pansy\u2019s revelation helps shed insight on her complicated relationship with the world, and how she\u2019s surrounded herself with people she can barely stand. Chantelle offers Pansy an opportunity for respite amid her suffering: she tells her to simply walk away. But Pansy doesn't seem ready to do that.",
      "Leigh said he used locations, like Pansy's house, as way to highlight and reflect her inner mental health struggles.",
      "\"The choice of locations is critical... In this film, most obviously, you can see that Pansy\u2019s house is a function of her paranoia, her fear of stuff and things and plants and insects and all the rest of it, whereas (her sister) Chantal\u2019s flat is a celebration of color and light and plants and joy,\" he told Film Comment in Oct. 2024. \"For me, that\u2019s what it\u2019s always been about.\u00a0\"",
      "What happens at the end of \u2018Hard Truths\u2019?",
      "Don\u2019t expect some big twist or denouement at the end of the film. It seems to just \u2026 end. But \u201cHard Truths\u201d isn\u2019t a movie that\u2019s going to give easy answers or wrap things in a bow.",
      "The last twenty minutes or so of \u201cHard Truths\u201d stops being about Pansy taking everything out on the world, and becomes a bit more of the world reacting to her. Following a series of increasingly tense moments \u2014 a meltdown at her Mother\u2019s Day gathering, throwing her husband's clothes out of their bedroom, calling him \u201cdisgusting\u201d \u2014 Curtley is injured while at work.",

You don\u2019t know whether he\u2019s going to film stuff after that,\u201d she says.",
      "In fact, the first time she saw the ending was when she saw the completed film. As Jean-Baptiste explains, until the end of the film you\u2019ve been watching a woman who \u201cis unable to help themselves.\u201d So when she has an injured husband downstairs, \u201cHow is she going to help anyone else? And that\u2019s as much as I can give you. The rest is for the audience to take in, to argue about with their friends and come up with whatever ending they want to put on it.\u201d",

This is the greatest show ever. There\u2019s no other show. Oh, except for \u201cLaw & Order,\u201d\u2019 I said to myself.

      "The authors of the study estimate that the death toll for the first nine months of the war was around 41% higher than the figure of 37,877 reported by the Palestinian health ministry.",
      "Women, children under the age of 18 and people over 65 accounted for 59.1% of the 28,257 deaths for which age and sex data were available. Researchers did not provide an estimate of the number of Palestinian combatants killed. Health authorities in Gaza also do not publish data on militants killed."

      "Earlier this week, it said the bodies of both\u00a0hostages had been recovered close to those of armed guards from Islamist group Hamas or another Palestinian militant group, adding their deaths did not appear to have been recent and it was not yet clear how they had been\u00a0killed.",

Israel says it will not end the war until Hamas is dismantled and all\u00a0hostages are free.",

      "Since then, more than 46,000 people have been\u00a0killed\u00a0in\u00a0Gaza, according to Palestinian health officials, with much of the enclave laid waste and most of the territory\u2019s people \u2014 displaced multiple times \u2014 facing acute shortages of food and medicine due to Israel\u2019s actions, humanitarian agencies say."

      "BEIJING \u2014 As he prepares to leave Beijing, the U.S. envoy to China feels relations between the two rival powers are the most stable they\u2019ve been in recent years. But there\u2019s no guarantee they will stay that way.",
      "It \u201cremains a very challenging, often very contentious and in a long-term way deeply competitive relationship,\u201d Ambassador Nicholas Burns told NBC News in an interview this week. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t get around that. We\u2019re rivals for global power.\u201d",
      "Still, the world\u2019s two biggest economies have learned that \u201cwe\u2019ve got to talk to each other,\u201d Burns said, adding that \u201cthere are times when we have to work with China because it\u2019s in the American national interest.\u201d",
      "China is increasingly challenging the U.S.-led international order that has been in place since the end of World War II, working to various degrees with Russia, Iran and North Korea.",
      "The two countries have profound differences on issues such as trade, technology, the status of Taiwan and human rights, and blame each other for cyberattacks and the deadly U.S. fentanyl crisis.",
      "\u201cChina\u2019s been unduly provocative in the Taiwan Strait with its military maneuvers,\u201d Burns said, adding that Beijing \u201chas made a major mistake and continues with that mistake in helping Russia to prosecute its illegal and barbaric war against Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Beijing denies that it is aiding the Russian war machine or carrying out cyberattacks on the U.S. that Burns said are \u201con a scale of lethality that is unprecedented.\u201d",
      "Burns is winding down his job after nearly three years of managing the day-to-day tensions of what is often described as the world\u2019s most important bilateral relationship and navigating some of its lowest points in decades.",
      "If Beijing wants to maintain the newfound stability in ties, \u201cI think the onus is on the government here in China to make that happen,\u201d Burns said.",
      "One thing the Chinese government can do, he said, is lift its sanctions on Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., if he is confirmed as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s secretary of state. Rubio and other U.S. lawmakers were sanctioned in 2020 over their criticism of authorities\u2019 crackdown on dissent in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong.",
      "\u201cThey have to talk to the American secretary of state,\u201d Burns said.",
      "Burns declined to comment directly on how the incoming Trump administration might manage the U.S.-China relationship, though he said he had been in touch with former Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., whom Trump has said he will nominate as his China ambassador.",
      "Trump has advocated a tougher approach toward the country than the Biden administration.",
      "In what may be indirect advice to Trump and his Cabinet appointees, Burns emphasized the importance of talking with China as well as maintaining regional alliances the Biden administration has fortified in order to counter China\u2019s influence, the future of which is uncertain as Trump begins a second term.",
      "\u201cWe have got to keep our allies close to us,\u201d Burns said, pointing to South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Australia and India.",
      "Working with allies \u201cmultiplies and expands American power in trying to deter some of these really pernicious actions\u201d by China, Russia and others, Burns said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s one way to compete with China effectively, to win part of the competition for power, but also to keep the peace with China,\u201d he said.",
      "Slowly thawing ties",
      "In-person diplomacy was disrupted during the Covid-19 pandemic, which kept China\u2019s borders closed for three years. During this time, the previous Trump administration ratcheted up criticism of Beijing\u2019s handling of the outbreak, which began in China.",
      "When Burns arrived in Beijing in March 2022 to take up his post, he spent most of the first month of his job in quarantine at the ambassador\u2019s residence, unable to meet anybody even as the relationship he was tasked with steering was heading to new lows.",
      "At the same time, Chinese nationalism and anti-Western sentiment surged across state media and online platforms here, and the people-to-people exchanges that Burns likes to call the \u201cballast\u201d of the relationship have never really recovered.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has the tightest grip on power here since Mao Zedong, and has carried out an internal campaign against corruption that, during Burns\u2019 term alone, saw a foreign minister and two defense ministers expelled from their positions and the public eye. The heightened scrutiny has made some Chinese officials, academics and average citizens more reluctant to engage with foreigners.",
      "Relations hit their lowest point in decades in August 2022, when Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the House speaker at the time, visited the Beijing-claimed island of Taiwan over China\u2019s objections. They sank even lower in early 2023, when the American military shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon that had been spotted over the continental United States.",
      "\u201cIt took us a while to dig out of that,\u201d Burns said. Since then, both sides have moved to stabilize ties.",
      "China has only recently resumed direct military and other communications that were cut off in protest over Pelosi\u2019s visit. The head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command has since had two meetings with his Chinese counterpart.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s significant because we\u2019re trying to drive down the probability or the chance of any kind of accident or misunderstanding between our military forces,\u201d Burns said.",
      "Another example of improved cooperation, he said, is in addressing the U.S. fentanyl crisis, one of the areas where Biden and Xi agreed to cooperate at a summit in California in November 2023. Many of the precursor chemicals used to make the deadly opioid originate in China before being processed into fentanyl in Mexico and other countries, then smuggled into the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe have begun to see action from the government of China,\u201d Burns said, including 300 arrests, the shutdown of online sales of illicit chemicals and the scheduling of 55 synthetic opioids and precursor chemicals as prohibited for export.",
      "Burns pointed to other successes in the Biden administration, including the release of four Americans who had been detained in China for years: David Lin in September, and Mark Swidan, Kai Li and John Leung in November.",
      "\u201cTo meet them at the airport, to give them their passports, to tell them that they were free people again was an extraordinary moment, certainly for me as the American ambassador,\u201d Burns said.",
      "Though all Americans the State Department considered wrongfully detained by China have been released, hundreds of others remain imprisoned on various charges, more than in any other foreign country. They continue to receive consular assistance.",
      "In the interest of keeping the lines of communication open, Burns urged members of Congress from both parties to make greater efforts to visit China.",
      "\u201cI have hawkish views on the relationship between China and the United States. Many members of Congress do, too,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to be here to understand the adversary and to talk to the adversary and to know the reality on the ground.\u201d",
      "Janis Mackey Frayer reported from Beijing, and Jennifer Jett reported from Hong Kong."

    "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2025 10:38:50 GMT",
    "summary": "A series of incidents involving undersea cables has drawn attention to their vulnerability and cast suspicion on vessels from Russia and China.",
    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 First the Baltics, now Taiwan. This month saw the latest in a spate of incidents in which crucial undersea cables connecting U.S. allies have been damaged or severed.",
      "Some have been cast as acts of sabotage, pinning blame on Russia and China amid heightened geopolitical tensions.",
      "Early this month, Taiwan\u2019s coast guard said it had intercepted the Xing Shun 39 \u2014 a Hong Kong-owned freighter carrying the Cameroonian and Tanzanian flags \u2014 after the Beijing-claimed island\u2019s biggest telecom company, Chunghwa Telecom, alerted authorities that an international undersea cable had been damaged on Jan. 3.",
      "A \u201cpreliminary assessment\u201d suggested the damage might have been caused by the freighter, which \u201ctransited the area at the time of the incident,\u201d the coast guard said.",
      "With an average of about 200 cable faults a year, according to the International Cable Protection Committee, damage to undersea communications infrastructure is not uncommon. The majority is caused by ship anchors or fishing activity such as trawling, where heavy equipment is dragged across the seafloor.",
      "But the Taiwanese government says this may have been an example of Chinese \u201cgray-zone interference,\u201d irregular military and non-military tactics that aim to wear down an opponent without engaging in an actual shooting war.",
      "It also comes amid an uproar in Europe, where NATO is stepping up patrols of Baltic Sea cables that provide power and enable almost all intercontinental communication, including the internet.",
      "Members of the defense bloc with access to the Baltic Sea were set to meet Tuesday in Helsinki to discuss regional security threats including Russian cable sabotage.",
      "The damage from the Jan. 3 incident did not disrupt communications in Taiwan, as the data was routed to other cables.",
      "However, \u201cif enough cables were cut you can potentially cause something as severe as an internet blackout,\u201d said Ian Li Huiyuan, an associate research fellow at the Institute of Defense and Strategic Studies at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. \u201cEspecially for Taiwan\u2019s case, since it\u2019s an island and there\u2019s no overland alternatives.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office said last week that undersea cables were damaged by \u201ccommon maritime accidents\u201d and that Taiwan was making accusations \u201cout of thin air\u201d and intentionally hyping up the \u201cso-called gray zone threat,\u201d according to Reuters.",
      "Taiwan\u2019s Mainland Affairs Council, which makes China policy, responded that the investigation would proceed based on the evidence.",
      "It said Chinese \u201cflag-of-convenience\u201d ships \u201chave a bad reputation in the international community,\u201d pointing to similar cases in Baltic states that are suspected to involve Chinese vessels.",
      "The race to protect cables",
      "It can be difficult to determine whether a cable was damaged by accident or deliberately, but heightened geopolitical tensions have raised suspicions that damage to some critical infrastructure may be sabotage.",
      "Estonia said last month that it would deploy naval assets to protect cables connecting it with Finland after its Estlink 2 cable was damaged on Christmas Day. Finland is investigating a Russian oil tanker that was seized after the incident and may have been dragging its anchor along the seabed.",
      "\u201cThree cases in one year cannot be a coincidence,\u201d Finnish President Alexander Stubb said last month.",
      "NATO is also deploying at least two ships to the Baltic Sea area for surveillance.",
      "While the alliance\u2019s heightened alert mostly involves Russia\u2019s \u201cshadow fleet\u201d of smuggling ships, Chinese-owned vessels have come under suspicion as well, including in November when one freighter was detained for weeks in Danish waters after two fiber-optic cables were damaged.",
      "The ship, Yi Peng 3, was alleged to have damaged cables that ran between Sweden and Lithuania and Finland and Germany after leaving the Russian port of Ust-Luga, on the Gulf of Finland. The ship continued its journey after investigators from Sweden and other countries were allowed to board.",
      "Swedish authorities said they were satisfied with the inspection and did not say whether any evidence had been found. China has said it will continue to cooperate with regional authorities in the investigation.",
      "Though European authorities have detained ships when sabotage is suspected, in the absence of concrete proof they have stopped short of directly blaming Moscow or Beijing.",
      "Still, the anxiety in Taiwan is heightened.",
      "\u201cPatrol of undersea cables is really time-consuming. It adds an extra burden and becomes more resource-consuming for the coast guard,\u201d said Yisuo Tzeng, a Taipei-based researcher at Taiwan\u2019s defense ministry-funded Institute for National Defense and Security Research.",
      "The Taiwanese coast guard said that although the intentions of the Xing Shun 39 on Jan. 3 were \u201cimpossible to confirm,\u201d it could not rule out the possibility of the vessel \u201cengaging in gray-zone interference.\u201d",
      "The coast guard said it was unable to board the vessel due to bad weather, but had asked South Korean authorities in Busan, its destination port, to collect evidence.",
      "Data from Marine Traffic showed the freighter making erratic movements that day a few miles off Taiwan\u2019s northern city of Keelung, where a submarine cable connects the island to both the U.S. and China.",
      "Because the cable is also connected to China, some analysts say it may be premature to blame Beijing for the disruption.",
      "\u201cIf there is an outage of a particular cable for half a day, for one hour, we\u2019re talking billions of dollars of investment loss,\u201d said Gerard Parr, who has worked on submarine cable projects and is a professor of telecommunications engineering at the University of East Anglia in Britain.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be gained by this because there\u2019s economic value in maintaining the cable,\u201d he added.",
